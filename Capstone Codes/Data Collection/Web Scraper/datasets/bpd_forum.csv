0,"Hi, I would really appreciate if anyone could please give me some advice. I know that this probably isn't the right place, and I apologise for imposing, but this is a last resort. 
I have been my ex girlfriend's favourite person for over a year. We dated casually for a few months, then I ended it because she wanted something more serious than I was able to have. This happened in November 2019. A few months later I told her that I was casually dating someone else (very briefly - over now, he forced me to tell her).

I was unaware of her BPD until this point, when she had a breakdown and told me that I was her favourite person. Since then, she has been getting worse and worse everyday, self harms regularly and has attempted suicide multiple times. She has now stopped telling me about how she's feeling other than to say she's worse than she's ever been. 
I'm terrified that she might die soon. She has honestly done all she can, has therapists, medication... but she hasn't found anything helpful.

I don't know how to help because she tells me that all that would help would be if I gave her more love and attention. But talking to her everyday for over a year and seeing the impact of everything I say and do has on her has made me terrified of saying something that would cause her to hurt herself. It feels like I have to find a balance between avoiding telling her something that would lead her on (she still wants to be in a relationship with me) and avoiding saying something that will make her 'freak out' (her words) thinking I might abandon her. 
For example she often asks me to tell her I love her and how we will spend our lives together.

My real question is - Is me being in her life helping or am I putting her in a position where she can't move forward? 
I do believe that she would be in a dangerous position if I stopped talking to her, but maybe me constantly not being able to give her what she wants could be regularly re-traumatising her. I've asked therapists and friends what I could do to help her but only been told that I am in an impossible position. I'm hoping that there might be someone here who has some insight into how she is feeling and what she needs.

Thank you for reading <3"
1,"Hello, I’ve been googling a lot on this subject, but I can’t find any concrete information, so I thought I might try here. My partner has a brother who has BDP and ADHD (5 kids) and a late grandpa on paternal side, who probably had some mental health issues, but was never properly diagnosed (older generation). There are no other mental illnesses present among any other paternal (or maternal) relatives. 
Because of this, he is worried his children might have a stronger predisposition to develop BPD and he really does not want that, because he knows how hard growing up was for him and the whole family. 
What is the chance in this case, that our children develop BDP (my side of the family has no history of BDP) and is there any genetic testing to determine the probability and inheritability of BDP?
Thanks in advance!"

3,Hi all I've been recently diagnosed with eupd and bipolar and ADHD as you can imagine a bit of a shock I've been experiencing psychosis as just came to speak to people in the same situation
4,"I’ve been feeling so lonely & I don’t have any friends with BPD, so they will never be able to truly understand"
5,"im having a splitting episode and im trying so hard to hold everything together. Its been around a week now im ok with everyone but my gf she said something last fri and slightly upset me in normal circumstances but this time i ended things with her from fri to Tuesday i avoided her and when i did see her i wouldn't really speak i just completely shut off from her. Then Tuesday she came to see me said im been cold and heartless, ive explained all the stuff that adds to my bpd episodes and i need real answers to things that have happened in the past as they play in my head and i think it got too much and caused a splitting episode she gave me answers and now its time to decide if i believe her and can let go but im still having an episode as i feel arrrrrrrr towards her which isnt like me"
6,"Hello, i will try to summarize my story but it's gonna be a bit long (i hope my english is good enough :p)

I was with a girl for 4y and it wasn't doing great with her, we didnt live together and during quarantine in May i went on an old 3D virtual world game that simulate real life (you can make friends and doing anything there, even having sex or get married).

I went there to talk with some old friend and I met a girl who was really into me (she saw my picture on my profil and she liked me I guess), she was talking to me everyday, all the night spending all her time with me, we had lots of things in common (really a lot, maybe a bit too much it was kinda weird lol so she was probably faking things sometimes but i wasn't aware of it).

She rapidly told me she had feeling for me, but I told her I still have my gf (i told her the truth) she wanted my phone number, I asked her to wait since I'm not single yet. She was kinda upset and told me ""I don't want to be a plan B, I want to meet you in real life that's why I come here for you, if you want to stay with your girlfriend i'm gonna leave.""
After a few months, I stopped the relationship with my gf and I gave her my phone number... and she told me that she had money issue and lost her phone number, that she is gonna give it to me when she has a new one, I said ok... (she never gave it to me LOL)

We had to meet in real in september, she had an excuses to don't meet me, same in October again another excuse... and she was disappearing all the time for different reason, one time no internet connexion, another time someone died in her family, another time she was sick, she knew I was feeling bad when she was not here but she didn't seem to care about it anymore (before she was sooo into me and soo adorable, but she changed alot).

We had a few arguments because she always had excuse to don't meet me and then poof she left, she ghosted me for one month and half... during this ghosting time, i used google search thing and I saw that her pictures were fake. (she sent me lots of picture of her face and some sexual pictures too).

I sent to her a message and told her I know something about her, but she didn't reply me (she was still ghosting) she came back after 45 days telling me how sorry she was, she said she was trying to forget me etc... And it was very painful for her (pretty sure she faked this), I told her about her fake pictures and she said something like : ""yeah i am very sorry i was not myself, i was feeling bad and I wanted to be someone else and I don't like showing myself on internet, but you deserve to see me now, I will show you my picture"" she sent me another picture, it was another girl, less beautiful, but still ok looking and I am pretty sure it was still not her on this picture LOL.

We talked like before, she was ""into me"" again, always talking to me, saying she wanted to meet me in real, she also said she will have a new phone number for Christmas (I didn't ask for it, she said it by herself, but she didn't give it to me even after chritmas, so it was fake, not sure why she talked about it then).

After a month talking, a friend of mine discovered that she ""cheated"" on me with another guy a few month before, basically while i was feeling bad waiting for her, she was with another guy... I was SO angry at her, basically she said it was when she tried to forget me and she flirted with this guy for a week, I told her she was not a good person etc... (but never insulted her).

She left the game, and stopped replying on discord (yes I also had discord to talk to her), I got scared that she would ghost me again... So I contacted one of her friend on Steam (it's a gaming plateform for people who don't know) So i contacted and guy from her friendlist and told him ""hey I know a girl from there, could you tell her to come talking to me please"" the guy said ok, and she came back 5mins later.

She seemed so worried that I talked to one of her friend, she asked me ""what did you say to him ? How many people did you contact ?? "" I told her to calm down that I didn't say anything bad, I just wanted her to come back and it was my only option to reach her.

Then she said I understand, but she changed completely her mind about me (I'm not sure if it was because I got angry at her or because I contacted one of her friend) but she said that she had no feeling for me, that she used to have feeling at the beggining but she was not herself, then when she came back she was simply nostalgic that's why she wanted to get back with me, but that it was better to stay friends now and that we had too much problems and dramas.
I was in shock because a few days before she was really into me and wanted to meet me and I invested so much time and energy, forgave plenty of things, give her many chances... I really didn't know what was happening, anyway she was sure of herself so i accepted the friendship.

My best friend asked me to show him this 3D plateform and wanted to help me with this girl, it's what he did, he talked to her and I don't know what happened but she washed his brain or something like that... but he turned into her, he was always with her, faking being offline to spend time with her etc... and she knows I was feeling bad about it, that's why she was doing it.

I erased this bad friend from my life, he had a wife and a kid, I told him if he continues to talk with her i'm gonna repeat everything to his wife, he got scared and leave.

I tried to spend more time with this girl, i told her that this 3D plateform was toxic and asked her to move on another game, she said OK, i bought to her a game (she didn't ask for it, I did it by myself, she never asked me anything and it was the first thing I bought to her) She played like 2 evenings with me and then she started faking being sick again LOL (she always use the health excuse).

I didn't talk to her for a few days and then she came back saying ""hey I have no news from you, you seem really busy :) "" I replied it was her, not me, I also told her that she seemed loosing interest a lot again. She replied she was busy with her health and her job, and she said ""and I think when you talk to me, you're looking for more than friendship and you know it won't happen, i'm sorry it's not against you ""

i replied ok, then we stop here, she said hmm ok, i said  i'm gonna miss her, she said ""me too but i understand your decision and i respect you, you have always been so nice to me"" then she said ""goodbye mister.""

I didn't talk to her for one month now...  i knew her in May, so it has been a long time already, i deleted her maybe 6 times from discord but i always missed her so much this time i try to stay strong and to not reach her. I don't know exactly what she did to me, I don't know what she is too... she is catfishing that's for sure but there is something more about this person. She told me once that she was Borderline, i'm not sure if it's the truth or not, I could believe it, or maybe Bipolar or narcissic (lovebombing => loosing interest => discard) I saw that this stuff exist too on internet + the way she tried to make me feel bad with my friend, but i'm not sure  if those kind of people can catfish too, is it compatible ?

I'm also not sure why she said that she had no feelings for me and a few days before she seemed into me so bad, like i said it could be because i got angry at her and told her she was a bad person etc... or maybe because she got scared that i contacted someone from her steam (she has obviously something to hide there, probably talking to other guys i don't know or maybe someone that know her IRL, not sure).

Anyway I am empty as fuck, i have never been empty in my life, i'm a person with a really big heart and i feel really empty now, a friend told me to talk to other girls, it's what i'm trying to do, i'm talking to a woman from my town, she seems nice etc... and she wants to meet me but I feel too empty for that at the moment... And i have many questions in my head and i'm ruminating alot...

I'm wondering if this person will come back in my life ? i feel i hate her and i miss her at the same time i don't know why! i wish i could make her change and help her, i don't care much about the catfishing stuff because i liked her personnality when she was ""good"" lol. But i know at the same time that i did the right thing to leave... she obviously wasn't interested anymore so...

thanks for reading me ^^"
7,"Hi guys on there as been reasonly been diagnosed with eupd and bipolar and  ADHD as you can imagine a bit of a shock but I kind of expected it I've been experiencing psychosis people talking to me or person talking to the last year also or more about three years altogether I had been clever at hiding it from my mom and I was working when I shouldn't..they suspended me ...when i was going thru peoples bags the reason I was going for people's bags with because at the time was scared for my sanity I believe that people from work was trying to kill me with guns or with weapons and the voice told me that they were the in changing room so I went searching everywhere that changing room lockers toilets bags coats everything ...been doing okay now on medication for antipsychotic depression and he moved stabilised  and zopiclone to help me sleep. I've been off work an lots of people have been talking about me talking about the fact that maybe I was stealing from them the trust or moving things  shouldn't have been that i wasn't feeling well or was mentally instable they've made their own conclusions but they're meant to be my best friends and have chosen not to stick by me and it makes me really sad and now I feel got no one to talk to about my problems no one to talk to you but everyday things and just find myself completely lost and lonely  i had a group of people who don't care about me anymore 

Just wondering if anyone feels the same

8,I have recently been diagnosed with this condition and there are things in my life that have changed because of it. I have started fainting as a result of it and I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had this and what they have found to help as I may be losing my job over it which is making things worse for me
9,"So, Mother's Day, and as predicted my eldest son (31) had no contact with me and so continues the complete cut off from his mum since last year's Mother's Day, when I was brave enough to admit I'd been diagnosed, and told the family of this crippling affliction and what I was doing to address it. And even though I've never deliberately hurt any of my family, they would agree I've been a devoted mother, but nothing else hurts like this, it is unbearable. Being my eldest (of 3) he felt it was his task to 'fix' me, until I realised a year ago he was my main trigger, my other 2 children I have no problem with, but he couldn't cope with that so disassociated himself and also my first grandchild from me. My grandson is coming up to 2 years old and doesn't know I exist. My family are appalled by this behaviour, and like me do not fully understand, however I've honored his wish to disconnect from me even though a year ago I moved into the same town as him to be a hands on nanna, but surely mother's day is an exception? I'd value anyone's thoughts in this. Thankyou"
10,"I know that I am definitely not polyamorous. 💯

I have a very hard time with emotional relationships(mainly because I have borderline personality disorder and other mental illnesses)with just one person, I could not imagine an emotional relationship with multiple people. 💯 

With having borderline personality disorder, have you ever questioned being polyamorous or non monogamous because of your extreme fears of abandonment?

You feel like those fears of abandonment would not be as bad(or even close to nonexistent) because if you were polyamorous or non monogamous, you would always have multiple people in your life when you fear that one or more of them could eventually leave you."
11,"On the surface things are going ok. Loving my flat, on top of my bills etc. Got awarded LCWRA and it was backdated about 18 months so been buying a few things and I've got money put away for a car when I'm able to reapply for my licence at the end of the year.

I'm just so fucking low and I can't fix it. I've stopped spending on random shit now because firstly I've got everything I need and no more space for shit and secondly it's just making me feel emptier. 

I spent so much time stressing about it and fantasising that it would make things better but it just hasn't.

Don't know how to refocus or what to focus on now. It's just confirming that I'll never really be better."
12,"I get jealous very often when it comes to
my favorite person. It is an overarching part of my life that I have been able to accept and ignore. But, there are a few people that really set off my jealousy and send me into rages. I don’t know how to not act on it. Last night he stayed up really late playing games with one of the people that sets my jealousy off and I cant seem to calm down. I’m trying not to take it out on him because I try to maintain a healthy relationship and I know he can be friends with her. But I can’t force myself to not dryly respond and I’m trying to refrain from cancelling the plans we have today because of my jealousy. What can I do to stop this?"
13,"Hi,

A friend of mine has BPD. It sometimes feel like she is pushing me away. I have come to realize that for many weeks, I was actually making the situation worse by always apologizing when I said or did something that triggered her, whether I was actually wrong or not.

I've been reading a lot about BPD and I understand now the importance of setting boundaries, but I feel like I'm doing it all wrong. When she gets upset, I avoid arguing with her. I try to make what I have to say as simple as possible and I make it clear that I respect how she feels and love her no matter what.

She's actually noticed that I'm trying out tips like this and she says it makes her feel like the subject of an experiment, which I get. But I'm trying my best and doing it out of love.

I know every person, BPD or no BPD, is different. So there is no universal, simple solution. But does anyone have any advice for me? Should I try something different? Should I just accept that things are gonna get worse before they get better? Is it possible that, deep down, she actually wants me to go away?

Any advice helps, thank you for your perspective."
14,"I work part time, but I feel that is much for me. The stress... Responsabilities...
I don't wanna be a lazy or similar... I don't know what to do.... Also my friend abandoned me"
15,When I don’t see someone for a couple days I can’t remember what they look like. I don’t have facial blindness and I know who they are when I see them but if I had to describe someone to a sketch artist. I can’t. This happens with everyone. Friends. SOs. Family. It’s really strange and it makes me feel like a bad person when I think about it.
16,"I've recently decided to take time out of college to work. Great decision because now I only have to stress about work instead of work and school, but my BPD is raging. At work I feel like I'm walking on eggshells; my shift is usually 6 hours and they entire time my heart is racing. Anytime I get criticism I feel like I can't make any more mistakes or I might get fired. Today I never left my position  (food service sucks) even though I was thirsty and needed to go to the bathroom. I know in my head the entire time that my anxiety is irrational, but it feels like the world is crashing around me. I know this is something us with BPD experience and not out of the normal. I just want a job that i dont deteste every single day."
17,"I haven't smoked in years. Today I had an urge that would not go away, so finally I was ready to give in. I knew where I kept a pretty little case. Well, I went there, tore everything apart looking but it's not there. I remember looking at it earlier this year and thinking I should throw it away. I don't remember throwing it out, but I guess I did. This is probably good. These past few months have been a challenge of me falling into old habits or gravitating back there.  Anyway, I found incense instead. Nice. 

Thanks for reading and have a good night."
18,"I cold turkey stopped taking my meds 3 days ago. I wasn’t sleeping good. I had no desire for my partner. I freaking don’t feel anything. Since I was diagnosed only a month ago ( bpd, mdd, panic disorder, depersonalization/ derealization. I have been so upset that I have been stoned pretty much the entire time( work, home) my partner hates it but I hide it from her bc I vape.  I had already been taking Wellbutrin and the psych added cymbalta. I am over the initial side effects. Please give some advice. Is this part of my self destruction or is the weed messing me up? Also my uncle just passed and I live  about 2 hrs away but I can’t even bring myself to go see my family or call them... why? Am I weird or is this the bpd? I am still in denial that I even have bpd.   I am new and reaching out for support. In better news no violent freak outs lately 😁. Thank you new friends."
19,I recently realized how badly bpd was affecting my life. Now it’s gotten out of control. Like i want something really badly but i dont know how to get it.
20,"I have suffered from severe clinical depression.  It was so severe that I once spent 5 weeks in hospital because of it and was on very high doses of anti-depressants.  I have not taken any kind medication for over ten years and I rarely now get depressed.  However, I suspect that I suffer from BPD and I probably have always suffered from it, but my depression masked it, as I tend to withdraw when I get depressed.  I have done a few online BPD tests which give results ranging from ""maybe"", to ""likely"" to ""you have BDP"".  I know these  are not proper diagnoses, but I certainly have thought for a long time that I have BDP even though I have not been officially diagnosed with the condition.  

Has anybody here who has been diagnosed with BDP, previously suffered from depression or still suffers from it?"
21,"Hey folks, 

I am new here, so before I post my question, just wanted to say hi.

Anyhow, I have this problem for 8 years now. I should add that with BPD I am also Bipolar.

The thing is, and would really appreciate hearing if anyone had a similar case. I started to explore my connection with God. And in that pursuit, I became obsessed with reading the Scriptures, and finally, I came to the conclusion that there are two religions I am interested in. Christianity and Islam. Today I am a practising Christian, but even now, and for this period of time, I could never say 100 per cent, okay this is the one way to reach God for me, that is it, now let's move on in life. No. It is something that is in my thoughts 24/7. Even things in my everyday life like college before, jobs etc were problematic to deal with because all of the time I was so stuck in reading about theology and finding ""which religion makes more sense"" that this not only exhausted me, but it went down to the core of my being and became as a parasite that never goes away no matter what I do. 

I think people can relate maybe not with this situation but with some form of obsession regarding his or her identity considering the fact that BPD does have this symptom. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts."
22,"My impulsive behaviour is limited to spending/shopping these days. I stopped other impulsive behaviours slowly over the years. Buying cars frequently, drinking&smoking cannabis, last minute holidays are examples of previous impulsive behaviours. 
I often go on a spree buying clothes and footwear for myself and my kids, way more than we need.  Its harmful to my finances but other than that it is harmless.
Just wondering if anyone else has succeeded in controlling impulses in general but hangs on to one harmless enough way to vent the impulsivity?"
23,"I feel now a mix beetween lots of anger and sad because my teacher of university is pressing me by an email. I'm in a project that i've finished in a 94%. I don't wanna make that project but I don't have an exit for that. I feel I can't be OK, ""normal"" with ""good mood""  likein 2019, a non retunrn point. I'm to close to return to hypersexuality again, I'm clean from 2019."
24,"Im 18 years old and have been diagnosed with BPD for a little over a year now.
a year and a half ago i went through a major break up. these days i feel like i still love him and i have an attachment to him despite having no contact.
Am i really in love with him or is this a symptom or effect of my BPD?

Any advice anyone?"
25,"Hi all. new here and would like to introduce myself, I am NotSoWiseOldOwl. Chose that username due to my long and colourful history over the years. I have a dual diagnosis of EUPD (Borderline personality disorder) & Bipolar 2. I am currently taking part in structured clinical management therapy for the EUPD. I was diagnosed with EUPD back in July 2019 during a hospital admission but back then i was not offered any additional or follow on support, it wasn't until February 2020 that I was speaking with a CPN & informed him. It was my CPN at the time who put me forward for the therapy. My journey initially started out as bipolar affective disorder when diagnosed in 2007 & then became bipolar NOS (Not otherwise specified) due to treatment becoming complex and then this January finally becoming bipolar 2 due to having more destructive depressive episodes than mania's. I have been voluntarily hospitalised 3 times, 2017,2019 & 2020 due to my self destructive and highly impulsive actions, i won't go into detail as i really would like to avoid triggering or giving any ideas to any members who are struggling at the moment. I enjoy getting out for nice long walks and relax by listening to all kinds of music."
26,"I am 28, have known for at least 5 years. Finally confirmed and i feel like im numb. From my criminal background to my relationships, i fit description. Mine is impulsive BPD. Having trouble coming to grips with the fact that IF my parents cared enough, this wouldn't be things i have to confront a decade into adulthood. Im very aware, im low on the ""spectrum"". level II diagnosis. I begin  DBT therapy this week and begin Effexor. Can anyone ""GROUND"" me, because i feel as though i am losing control."
27,"Just wondering what others most troublesome BPD symtom is? 
For me it is angery outbursts, purely verbal outbursts. It ruins things for me over and over again. I manage a new job, new friendship or relationship for up to a year before I let a mood swing get the better of me and then hell pours out my mouth."
28,"Emotions are so intense for me. Out of nowhere. I'm sure they are for you too (obviously).
But sometimes my emotions are so intense, my body-- or mind, whatever-- will literally just shut down. Like I won't feel anything. I become stone cold. I don't care what happens, or who I lose, or what I say, or anything. Just a wall. 
It usually takes me a day or two, sometimes three, to kind of snap back and be like what the f*ck did I just do? Why did I act like that? That is not how I feel and now they think I'm a cold as*hole. When in reality, I just have so many feelings, all at once, I just can't... deal with it? 
I'm trying really hard to be able to communicate without shutting down or saying things that I don't mean. But sometimes it's just too much. 
Does anyone else deal with this? Or have any tips? Thx."
29,"Part of why I signed up here was to end my addiction to Twitter because I realized it doesn't go well with BPD. I'm always triggered if I'm not interacted with much and all of that. I had friends there but I felt like they didn't really like me much, they were just being nice.

 I honestly think if you're not one of those super popular mental health cutesy chicks, who have like 4k followers while following 25, you end up feeling invalidated and stuff... At least I did. 

It's a shame, too. I think all of us battling mental health deserves the same treatment and care. It just wasn't healthy so here I am. 

By the way, I spend so much time online because I have agoraphobia, a severe anxiety disorder that causes panic attacks in public."
30,"Hello,
    Tomorrow I have an appointment with a therapist. It will be my first in years, mostly because my appointments did not go well back then. I know what changes I want and why I want them.  If there are any suggestions to helping make this work that would be great. I don't want to go numb or feel distant at my appointment, which happened automatically before. Getting angry happened as well and that didn't help, but left future appointments with me feeling not present like I couldn't connect not just with the therapists but with me (shell feeling). However, when I left every reason that I was there was back with me. Thank you"
31,"Well I did it again.. 
I set up a dating profile. This will end two ways 
1. I'll delete the account within a day or two 
2. I'll go on dates fall for someone and end up hurt through my own insecurities or picking the wrong person just to have someone because I don't want to be lonely 

Anyone get stuck in this cycle?"
32,"..but I know I won't mean that later I'm just feeling overwhelmed. Why do small things add up to me wanting to hurt myself? My son accidentally headbutted me and cut my lip, my fiance knew this but when he came out of his office he didn't ask how I was. He went upstairs came down and went back to work. So obviously he's angry at me for being cross with our son when I got hurt. I mean he's probably not but that's what I'm thinking. And I was trying to make the kids lunch but him going back to work made them cry. And so now I want to tell him I hate him. And I feel so angry and stressed I want to hurt myself. I won't, but the urge is there. And then I start feeling like I'm a terrible mum because I keep trying to finish cleaning the kitchen but my son wants me to play with him and I've had to tell him I can't right now. I wish I was just numb and didn't have to feel anything. I hate these strong emotions 🙁"
33,Finally saw a psych. He asked me 2903480239 questions and he says he thinks I have had ADHD since I was a little girl. The impulsive behavior (the thing that makes me believe I had BPD the most) is a result of not being treated.  I have been told I have BPD and now ADHD. What the fuck. I am so confused. He prescribed me concerta. Has anyone else had a similar experience. I am giving up hope. I just want to get better.
34,"""I cant speak for everyone's experience ""

Ok. I was thinking this morning how would I explain to someone what a typical day is for me.
So here it is.
I wake up in the morning 9/10 times I have a headache.  I lay in bed until I quiet the noise in my head, when it lessons (but not completely disappears) I make myself a coffee. I used to stay away from caffeine but I need it to keep me awake, I take my antidepressants antihistamines and vitamin D. Then I take painkillers for my head. Turns out the headaches are from grinding my teeth away whilst I sleep, now I know why I feel tired all the time, so my sleep isn't safe anymore either.
So im now ready to not face my day the noise in my head is still there. Now I'm going to explain how that feels.
Put your headphones in your ears, put music on that you hate, put it on low but not too low, then put it on loop. Now. Get on with your day. Go to work make decisions do your normal day routine.  
By the end of that day you can take those headphones off and feel relieved that its over. 
I cant do that. I can press ignore from time to time. But it never goes away. I have no rest bite. 
The only thing that works is by taking the highest dose of sertraline.  
But doing that turns me into a zombie, it stops me from feeling. And my job as a carer demands that I care. Any job demands that you care. 
So I come down a little on my meds, and I start to let the flood in. It overwhelms me I break down, cry scream to the point my eyes are so puffy that one comes up with a bruise. I look like ive been through a war. And I have, my own personal war. Everyday the same rinse repeat. And you just want it to be over, you don't want to feel this way anymore it starts to effect those around you. Then you get told to, pull yourself together,  and you just look in disbelief because you think, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK IVE BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME.
You only see the outburst you only see when ive had enough of trying to keep it all together. When im loosing it at you or those around me its because ive lost that fight you couldn't see. Because if you could see my fight! I have with myself everyday! You would admit me to a psyc ward. Or yourself. 
My partner always says, why dont you share with me before you go off.  And I say, because I wasn't ready to share, because I was still trying to pick the pieces of the threads in my brain apart to see what is going on. 
Its not that simple when dealing with your mind, firstly who wants to admit to themselves that they are weak? That's what society has always told us yeah? Hide your pain.
Well im done sharing. Its helped a little.
Thank you."
35,"And i have decided to never see her or anybody at the hospital (psychiatrist) again. Out of embarrassment. I asked them to take me out of the early intervention program and transfer me to a psychiatrist out of the hospital.

but because of bpd i feel sad about this."
36,"Sorry for grammar and spelling in advance as it very mind-consuming topic for me.
I think for a very short marriage we had and overall not that long of relationship I can write a book on taking a train to hell and back. 
Aside from loving her part of the reason, I proposed to her and we got married is to help her overcome the fear of abandonedonment.
In sort - it didn't help at all.
I have educated myself onBPD to the best of my abilities. I have a therapist now because of this. My wife has one as well. But at this point it is clear that even my therapist can’t offer anything as a reasonable way of dealing with my wife issues. And she is not just therapist but also a clinical psychiatrist.
In a way the reason I’m posing this as I have no other place just to find some words of comfort and understanding.
Over the time I lost a lot of personal integrity and self-respect and overall question myself and personal traits that were so valuable for me.
I’m a business owner and over the years to be successful I have trained to be emotionally intelligent with staff. Empathy was a good trait to develop.
I used that in the beginning of our relationship where BPD started to show up in my then GF character. But her systematic raging aggression for absolute zero reasons, many of which she doesn’t remember, brought me to the points where I started to show aggression in return. It took many incidents but eventually I was proven that there is a limit. Let me just note that there is no physical abuse on ether side or name calling.
It actually even helped a little and she stopped for couple weeks to be aggressive.
Soon she stated even more amped up rage outbursts justifying it by previous anger and being upset me “leaving her”.
“Leaving her” was couple times when I said she has to stop for this relationship to work. That is also being constantly used as justification for her outbursts. 
I have to say that in a way I guilt trip myself in to this marriage.
I never was blind stupid but emotions took the best of me. Despite I realized the vicious circle of lashing back out to her and was able to control myself most of the time I still had episodes where I showed signs of anger. And that’s all what it takes to have justification for her actions. 
It took my therapist some work to explain to me that eventually it would happen. And when I had to suppress myself for anger it showed in unrelated situations and people.
I’m ashamed to admit that I almost got in to street fights because this is the only way I could cope with my now own anger. There is so much more but the point it I took responsibility for everything: falling in love, marrying sooner then should while red flags were all over, my previous lashing out.
I did the best I could in this situation and learned a lot about my own emotions and human behavior overall. But the situation with my wife remains the same and while her aggression became more “stealth” its there, just more manipulative. 
In short I was placed in the position of being responsible for her happiness. Yes, Im aware that this is not ok or better say mission impossible. 
I fail at this “mission” over and over and dealing with guilt tripping blame.
So I think the only thing I have left is throw in the towel. But actually in a final way, no BS. Seems logical as I have exhausted all other options many times. 
And yet - even after all this I’m questioning myself. Did I do everything possible to save this relationship? Can perhaps I give it more time? Some other stuff that I use almost always to full myself to keep trying.
Where is a cut off line? Is there anything person who has BPD or have a spouse with one can say something about it. I will take in to consideration any advice. Perhaps some words of encouragement that I’m not a terrible person. I loved this woman but love can go only so far and now it feels like I have to end this or I will basically sacrifice myself for no particular good outcome."
37,"i had a mental breakdown 2 months ago, and it just ended about a week ago. I was extremly unstable, and experiencing psychotic delusions. Way more than my usual, like, literally every 15 seconds, my mood would change drastically. I would go from screaming in rage to crying to calm in less than one minute. (Not an exaggeration)  Now, it is all over, and i feel numb. It does not feel normal to me. I know how horrible those mood swings were, but i never feel this numb. Will my emotions ever come back?  I hate to say, but i'm so used to the unstable version of myself, it feels normal and i miss it.   I just want my emotions back, this is hell on earth and it's so much worse than the explosive mood swings."
38,Why I can't feel good when I'm not impulsive and just I feel better doing stupid things? I feel something but that things are bad And I try to not do that and I feel so empty again.
39,"Hi everyone, my struggle at the moment is about trusting my intuition & reason vs self-doubt related to BPD patterns.

Premise: I might be going through a form of depression, which I am not used to anymore at all since I got sober from alcohol 7 yrs ago, and which I'm scared of because I spent a long time there before sobriety.

Having said that, in the past few months I've been unsatisfied with my current therapist, I feel like we've reached a point where she can't help me anymore and although I feel it's absolutely, perfectly reasonable and proactive to try something else (specifically EMDR for trauma), I also realise that my life is too unstable at the moment to change therapists.  One part of me knows I must try something else to unblock, another part of me is so starved of any human contact, that losing this weekly presence that has been there 4 years seems impossible to do, too dangerous - there wouldn't be anyone left, literally, I don't have a single friend I trust.

Whenever there's conflict with the therapist and I expose my anger, which is sometimes directed at her, but which I really need to express, she suggests we split.  And this morning there was conflict, and after she suggested we split, she suggested that I might be abandoning her to avoid abandonment. Is it because I need to face conflict and am afraid I will be abandoned if I make any difficulty, I wonder?  Am I devaluing the therapist so I can abandon her (by ghosting, or breaking up dramatically) because I don't know how to be active, how to choose to separate and go through with it (this would be self-sabotage, right?)?  But doesn't it look more like she can't take conflict?  After all this person is just another human being... Here's where the self-doubt starts working, and rationalisation around moving on kicks in.

Re self-sabotage, in general one of my BPD traits is to devalue people when I feel uncomfortable, but usually, if it's not a trauma based response of wanting to flee when I get triggered, I feel uncomfortable because the relationship isn't serving me, I feel uncomfortable for good reason, and I would like to move on, or detach progressively, but don't know how to do it... 

The other thing that comes to mind is cognitive dissonance, again related to trauma. Two different parts that don't communicate are trying to do their own thing.  The part that wants to move on isn't acknowledging the vulnerable part that needs a friend there no matter what.  So that's where the self-sabotage comes into place.

Oh dear, I could really do with some more insight.  Not sure if anyone here is a therapist?"
40,I agree with my therapist that I might have Schizoaffective disorder. I was diagnosed with that before. But my psychiatrist believes I have BPD and he never listens to me.
41,"I've had enough. Knowing my poor hand-eye coordination and motor skills, this probably won't work. I just want to nap during the day or just be unconscious."
42,"soo i have two really close Friends and it literally switches all the time. sometimes i dont care About one of them and obsess about the other and sometimes its the other way around.

has anyone else experienced something like this?"
43,My daughter aged 25 often goes for walk at 8 pm and comes back late at 11 pm which is very very risky considering that roads are deserted .No amount of reasoning with her helps . She has been diagnosed with borderline personality and probably has depression .Why does she take risks like going out so late?
44,"So, my bf and I have been together for a year. I have a two year old daughter. Given covid happening and my work not bringing in enough money, and me getting back on my feet since leaving my daughter's father, I moved into a one bedroom apartment. The bedroom is my daughter's room and I made the living area like a little studio type set up for me. 
My bf has his own place literally right around the corner. However, most of his time is spent here. Like all of it really. He calls this his home etc. 
Well, a few days he said I make him feel trapped (or this place does). We have had some issues about me feeling abandoned when he leaves to go with friends, but things have gotten better. Even to the point where I will make him make plans.  I have been really proud of myself about the progress I have made and that we have something healthy. So this comment just hit me out of nowhere. I got so upset and I just shut down and went completely numb. I made him go home. 
We talked the next day and he said all the right things. And I dont want him to feel unhappy being with me. Or feel like he can't have anyone besides me in his life. I want him to be happy and I really want a healthy relationship. He said most of his feelings are self-inflicted because he doesn't believe he can go out without me being upset, although when I pointed out times where I have improved, he agreed and said it's all in his head. 
I went to his place last night to watch the fights and kind of do a date night type thing. We had a great time. But still in my head I can't stop thinking about how he's unhappy with me. And now after his comments, I do feel like he is pulling away and doesn't want me. Despite him saying otherwise. I do want to work on this with him and show him he can have others in his life besides me, but now with this thought in my head, I think it's going to be harder. I feel like all the progress I've made is just... gone. With that one comment. I'm scared I'm going to continue to hyper-fixate on it and ruin my relationship.

It sucks."
45,"Hi Everyone, I'm new to this (and any other) forum. I'm not on social media, but hope I can become a regular part of this forum - although I'm not sure I have much to offer. 
To begin I was just wondering, from your experience, what are the chances of me getting proper dbt therapy in Devon? As with most, when I've engaged with services, I've been bounced around a bit. Hence not getting the correct diagnosis for decades, nor the right treatment. 

Thanks for any thoughts you might have :)"
46,In work 5 hours of a 12 hour shift to go and I just want to go home 😥😢😭
47,"Will I be on meds for the rest of my life or can people manage BPD without medication?

I feel my meds don't do anything apart from give me side effects. 

Is anyone on this forum off meds? How has it been for you so far? What are your opinions about medication such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety and any other medications you may be taking? ✌️"
48,"Hello, I'm interested to know how everyone manages their work life. Do you suggest full time or part-time? Are there any jobs you have found cause it to become worse or have helped? 
I'm struggling with my job at the moment, I've recently returned after 5 weeks off sick and I'm wondering whether it was the right decision to return."
49,"My head is all over the place with worry. Had a session with my therapist yesterday. She has said I am not fit to work. Basically, I could go back but she feels that within days, weeks of going back I will be off again. My employers need to know how long it's going to take as I work in a Day Nursery they have to manage staff ratios. I feel I just need time to stop life and focus on getting myself well. My attendance record is appalling because I have never given myself the time I need. My issue is money. I'm currently getting SSP which is terrible. Is there anything else I could claim. Thanks in advance xx"
50,"** online pen pal would be a blessing 


Hey world , Well where do i start, i have faced many challenges with my mental health since as young as i can remebeber but i think 16 was the real point where i was so aware of having bad mental health. I have always battled with what i was informed was anxiety and depression , reoccuring self injurious behaivours and suicidal ideation . I had a real break down at around 23 as my partner at the time left me because i had been to much for him . Ive always had rocky relationships , im always to much for people . I attach quickly and can be very demanding to say the least . I have on and off battled with the same demons throughout the last couple years , changing various medications never being able to find one that suits. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia at the age of 24 . Recently everything came to a head, i wanted /still often want to die, but id reached a point where i couldnt control the demons . As a result i had a psychiatrist assesment and i about three weeks ago now was diagnosed with :
Emotionally Unstable Personality Dissorder
So here i am trying to muddle through the overwhelming thoughts and the urges to repeatedly hurt myself, while attending DBT twice weeksly. Im very lonely although i have a very supportive family, i have friends who tell me to just cheer up . Im feeling lonely in terms of my diagnoses and would love to speak to some individuals who are on this journey to who would also like someone to chat to ."
51,"So, I consider myself a funny person. I like picking on people and making jokes. However, sometimes when my partner does it to me, I get unusually offended. Even if I know it is light-hearted and not meant to hurt my feelings. I feel like I take things more personally when it's with someone close to me, like it hits me to my core. In my head I feel like I have different people talking. One is saying ""It was just a joke! It was harmless!"" and then the other is saying ""They hate you. They meant that and they've been wanting to say it for a long time. Stay mad. Overthink it until you make it a much bigger deal than it really is"".

I know it's hypocritical because I joke around too. Almost like a dish it and can't take it kind of thing. How do I not take things so personal with someone I'm in a relationship with? Or how do I think differently about this?"
52,"I think my employers want rid of me. I was taken on as Nursery support and within the next few months I was promoted to key person, I was asked  if would like the position  but since taking it my mental health deteriorated and my condition was exposed to my employers. I have asked to go back to my previous role but they are saying it is not an option. I think that rather than dismissing me they are making it difficult for me. They are an outstanding Nursery and I have been told they want to keep that status."
53,I've been in a relationship with a guy for around 10 months. He literally doesnt have a bad bone in his body and I adore him. Yet I've kept pushing him and being nasty due to my own thoughts and issues. Then felt completely abandoned by him when he couldn't come see me the one day and flipped and ended it. I've regret it since. I believe he is the love of my life and I'm struggling on how to fix this. I cant cope with how I'm feeling and feel horrendous for being so horrible and pushing him away. How can I fix this and make him realise my BPD ways arent what I'm really feeling?
54,"Firstly, Good Afternoon Everyone! I hope you are all keeping as well as possible during this rubbish spell.

I wanted to ask if anyone has any thoughts on dealing with people (with BPD) who devalue you as an individual?

I have an acquaintance who I have to work somewhat closely with. She is roundly disliked by most people in the organisation, nobody can tolerate her attitude and as such she is constantly lonely and miserable. We know she has BPD as she has told people before. I find that she immediately approaches people with an attitude that they are useless and can't do anything right. If you make a tiny error she calls people out in meetings. For example, recently I forgot to send something out on a certain day, leaving it until the next day to send it - this made no difference to the project... she made a huge fuss in the meeting.

She claims that nobody helps or supports her despite the fact people go out of their way to make an effort. It seems she thinks that everyone is incompetent and she acts out quite impulsively to things that upset her (e.g. copying in senior managers into complaint-filled emails so that everyone is aware of your alleged screw up). She then gets upset when people gently point out how unhelpful this is.  

She went to mental health services and had a long wait. She said she told the person that they have done nothing for her when they finally gave her therapy, rather than feeling thankful she just started that same pattern with the poor woman who is trying to help her. 

I try to feel compassionate toward her because clearly she has alienated everyone in her life AND at the same time it is extremely hard to feel anything but anger and dread whenever I see her. 

Any tips on this? Managers are terrified she will make a complaint to HR re: her mental health problem and being victimised and so they are very gentle with her but this is causing the whole team to hate working there which is a shame because it wasn't like that before she started there last year."
55,Why does my sick note say recurrent depression when I was told by a psychiatrist I had emotional unstable personality? Feel like I'm not going to be believed
56,"I'm sure you can relate. Or at least I hope you can. The lack of identity is exhausting. I watch something, like Survivor and suddenly I'm looking up how to have wavy beach hair all the time. The next day, literally the next day, watching Desperate Housewives and I think how good Susan looks so I'm looking up the clothes she wears. And great there's a Desperate Housewives Susan perfume. Maybe I'll get some Desperate Housewives memorabilia around Susan. I hate it! Today I don't know who I am. I guess I'll let you know after I've watched TV for a bit. How do you deal with this? I get so invested in the person I've decided to dress like. I want to act like them and dress like them. And then all of that just disappears into thin air. Until the next one comes along. It feels crazy to me."
57,"Today I was feeling tired and fragile. I am at work and my internal voice keeps telling me no one likes me. 

I kept sweating and getting anxious all day and in the end I kept picking the wounds I made last week and that got stiched up by the doctor. 

I am trying to make peace with myself hating me. But feeling that others hate me breaks me every day. My arm is hurting and I am scared. Scared my colleugues hate me. The people here hate. I want to go home and hide in bed. I am such an idiot :("
58,"I’ve been misdiagnosed my whole life. It wasn’t until I was about 23 that I got a BPD diagnosis and everything clicked. I’m not on any meds (by choice) and part of me has accepted this as my life and my normal. However, I disassociate often. And I also get very depressed and that’s when I feel like I can’t do this the rest of my life. I can see it’s getting worse and I can see all the people I’m hurting in the process. Even if I do become okay with this being my normal, it’s not okay for others and the few people I deeply care about. I’m at a loss for words and direction. I just know I can’t go on like this. I will end up losing everything and everyone I love the most if I do."
59,"I feel like the years when I was in school and being bullied are still repeating. Like time stopped in that school and my classmates and teachers are still there laughing at me. I don't know how to move on. I'm so stupid. I should move on because all of that happened a very long time ago, but I can't and I don't know why."
60,Hello
61,"My life is getting better day by day, I have hope for a productive life, with small interruptions, can't be helped, that is just the nature of the beast I live with.  Praying all is well for everyone, love you guys.

Thank you for being here and letting me post."
62,"I haven't posted in a while. Not sure why I'm posting now either.
I guess I'm looking for something... I don't know what. Advice, understanding or something else..

Basically I have started some repetitive behaviours. Can't seem to stop myself.
I wouldn't say it is a problem just yet, however it probably could turn in to one."
63,"Hello all . I've always known something wasnt quite right and I recently came across the criteria for bpd during a mental health first aid course. 

I'm a very emotional person and cry a lot . I can feel on top if the world one day and have lots of postive ideas then quickly sink back down to feeling empty ( usually if I feel I have done something wrong or ""bad"")

I'm petrified of being abandoned and will swing from being clingy and paranoid about my partber cheating or withdraw if I feel I'm not good enough. 

After I separated from my ex husband 3 years ago ( he had an emotional affair) I felt like I lost my identity , a family unit was my indentity and i felt like i withdrew from the kids ( not intentionally) it took me a lot of self reflection to realise this was because i felt like i had let them down , i know this is incredibly selfish and it wasnt intentional. 

I flit between Interests and indentity and it's so confusing.  It doesnt take much for my self esteem to drop and feel like I'm worthless. 

I'm incredibly empathetic in understanding peoples point of view and will go out of my way to help others but a lot of the time I cant actually feel someone elses pain ( unless they are not close to me and then I can ) 

Does this sound like bpd? I am going to book in with a doctor ."
64,"I am unable to move from my chair most of the day, because I have a feeling that something horrible is going to happen when I have to get up and move around. Shortness of breath, depersonalization, dizziness, off balance. It's been keeping me from all but the most basic of taks. Does anyone else experience this?"
65,"This is something I keep asking myself. I have bpd and some others and depression. 

So I am at home a lot and then I think what to do to be kind to myself. 

But every thought is ruined. Since I am a neat and tidy person at heart. And on the rare moments I am doing real well I tend to look after my home and its all good. 

But now there is clutter. And if some people came over they would say what do you mean? It looks good. But its enough to hurt every positive thought. As I first feel the need to tidy and I have no energy for that. 

How you you all make sure to do something nice for yourself without getting distracted or troubled by things?"
66,"I feel like I'm going to lose the love of my life because I can't stop pushing him away. Last night he said I'm like two different people, sweet and loving one min and attacking him and biting his head off the next. He barely even talks to me anymore because I overthink and get paranoid over everything he feels like he's walking on eggshells. Has anyone every been able to be in a stable relationship or will I always be the problem?"
67,Who else is going to have a lonely weekend? I will be home by myself the whole time and I am already bored and feeling alone :(
68,"Hi guys. I’m new here. I just joined because I thought I could get some valuable information from people who also share BPD. I am sure you all know how you feel living with BPD. that alone is enough to deal with, but on top of that I have serious issues with my fiancée. Things have never been good with us. We have 3 kids together. From the time we started dating (12 years ago) until now, he calls me names on a daily basis. I’m pretty sure he has anger issues, and I’m almost certain he is a narcissist (yes I know the medical definition and criteria, I’m not just throwing out the term). I am not going into the abusive history (always mentally and verbal abuse, things were only physical once), but I will start with what happened today. 
I am at home 99% of my life, with the kids. He is never home, always out with his friends etc. He doesn’t currently work. He spends 0 time with us. I don’t have friends over and I don’t go out with friends, I haven’t gone out without him in over 10 years. It’s too much of a headache. I can’t even go to my dads House without being accused of being a slut, or a whore etc. 
So, my in laws have my kids for the weekend. I’m having a rough day today so I thought it would be nice for the two of us to maybe go to the mall and out to eat somewhere. I waited all day just for him to get out of bed. He finally got up at 430, we got to the mall at 6 and it closed at 7. We had just gotten there 20 minutes prior, and we were approaching the source. I said “I need to stop at the source” I guess he wasn’t paying attention or was zoned out, so I repeated myself. Again he didn’t pay attention. So we walked past it and I said “okay I guess I won’t go to the source, I can go to Best Buy instead” and he looked at me and said “next time I’m not paying attention, get my attention instead of being a stupid bitch” uhhh okay what? So I went in the source, came out, everything seemed to be okay. I didn’t bother to tell him he shouldn’t have done that because it would only create further issues. So I left it alone.5-10 more minutes of walking and I go to hold his hand. He flings his hand off me (not even subtly) and said “get off me” and I guarantee you people must’ve noticed that. There was no way not to. So I said “wow. That was embarrassing” and he proceeded to call me all the names in the book. Stupid whore, dumb bitch, etc etc etc. So I said”stop calling me names” and he said “stop saying not to call you names” so I said “stop it Nathan stop calling me names” and he said “stop saying to stop calling you names” and so I told him not to talk to me and he said “let’s just go home”. He said it in a way like a punishment. Like how you’d take your dog to it’s cage when it’s bad. So I thought what do you mean go home? We just got here and we were supposed to go to dinner. I never get the chance to leave my house much as it is. I didn’t want to goback to my cage like a bad dog. So I turned around and I walked away from him. I did this partly because I didn’t want to go home,but mostly because I was about to cry and didn’t wantto cause a fuss or a scene in the mall. I was already embarrassed enough. So I went and sat somewhere alone just to gather myself for a second. He got in his car and left, leaving me stranded at the mall. Then after he left he proceeded to accuse me of walking away from him to go cheat, how much of an unfaithful slut and whore I was, a cheap hooker, and how you can’t turn a hoe into a housewife.I called a cab. He made me take pictures of the inside of the cab to prove I indeed was in a cab. And I haven’t heard from him since. He’s not home.Even after he left I texted him and I said you can come back in at any time and we can still go eat and I’ll forget about all of this. He proceeded to call me even more names. I kept repeating myself telling him I don’t deserve to be called these names under any circumstances. Finally I broke and started swearing back at him, telling him he’s an asshole that treats me like garbage and If this is how it’s going to be forever that he can take the ring he gave me back and get out of my house. 
so I’m home now, he’s not here, not a single clue where he is. And let me tell you, I am devastated. I can’t break this cycle of abuse no matter how hard I try. If I try and defend myself it makes the situation wayyy worse. I’ve told him countless times that I can’t tolerate these names, and what it does to my mental health. Therewas one time last year that he wouldn’t stop calling me names and I snapped and started punching myself in the face and gave myself two black eyes, one that I couldn’t open for about a week. And that’s not the first time I’ve done that. When he pushes me to a point I’ll snap and punch myself. 
I know it’s easy to say “just leave” but with my bpd, it being centred around abandonment and loneliness and feeling inadequate, I choose to stay with him. Eventually he will come back and it’ll be okay...but this happens almost everyday. And he will easily blame shift, everything is always my fault, I was wrong this and that. He doesn’t take accountability for his names or for any of that. I’m always just a stupid worthless useless good for nothing bitch. Or a hoe. Or a slut. A whore. Shady. Cheating. When I’m not doing any of those things. I’m literally just trying to survive and do my best. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore and I’ve fallen back into my dark place, after what happened tonight. Please help. I’m disgustingly lonely and miserable and just looking for some advice. I’m a good person with a big heart and I don’t deserve to be berated like this by him everyday of my life. This is torture!!!"
69,"i'm sick of it

can i call it something rude"
70,Im tired about feel empty in random times. I got almost all outside but inside is a mysterious desert. I can't to try to help people because since 2020 I'm feeling so unstable. And care anothers (who deserves it)  one of few things that puts me in good mood. For the moment I'm trying to ignore that feel but is there.
71,Personally mine is the FP stereotype. I have broken my own heart too many times it destroyed me and I’ve never met anyone who understands. It took me 3 years to get over someone I didn’t even kiss when I was 11-14 because I was convinced I loved him. Sent me into a deep deep depression and I lost everything about myself. I was just a kid this illness stole my life
72,"Comorbid borderline schizoid does anyone else have this?
I would first like to start this post by making it clear schizoid is not schizophrenic- sufferers may be mistakenly diagnosed with autism instead and it is quite rare by itself.

I have been told by professionals I have schizoid/bpd after initially bpd only for PD diagnosis which I had suspected due to not fitting autism.
This mixture is as contradictory to live with as it sounds on paper- I want nothing more than to care for someone even my own family yet have no/limited empathy that makes doing so virtually impossible.
I only enjoy being by myself and not around others due to this near physical like draining feeling when around other humans IRL.
I have typical bpd behaviour but a favourite person is extremely rare for me and strangely enough only ever through online despite having close relationships with people in person and never feeling anything for them.
I feel like an alien- I feel i am in a constant tug of war with bpd wanting me to care for someone yet being unable. 
If you did not get upset when a caregiver was ill nor felt anything at all due to a lack of emotional connection how would you feel? Like someone with ASPD a sociopath or something of that sort.

Does anyone else have these two disorders combined?
What is the experience like for yourself?
My psychologist has said they find the way I think interesting and I do not blame them because this is not a typical atypical personality trait cluster!
I am hoping to relate to someone else but thank you for reading my thread I relate to usual bpd types as well.

-I do not get angry at all only at myself or if someone harms someone I care about
-I do not know what loneliness feels like but think it may be what being near people is forme which is terrible feeling so sorry lonely posters
-I have to intentionally show facial expressions and body language meaning it is tiring to behave conventionally with others face to face but I can do it fine and IME better than average.
-Not having empathy does not mean I wish harm or harm others at all I would not want to cause suffering as I know what suffering feels like for me."
73,I am now seeing a new psychiatrist. I will be honest we have gone private. She is doubting the conclusion my previous psychiatrist had about EUPD. Can a psychiatrist misdiagnose?
74,"*Note; I say the word you a lot, I don't mean you, I am just talking out into the ether, please don't take this personally. 
I hate the word hope. I hate hope full stop. People talk about hope like it's this lifeline that keeps depressive people from giving up, like hope is some cure. Hope fuels dreams, ambitions, aspirations. Hope makes you want to believe in life, so you do. But then you forget. At least I did. You forget that you didn't have hope before. You want to tell the world about your dreams, and they're so excited you got out of bed they tell you to chase those dreams, to make them true. And those people, they tell you they'll help you, and because of them, this time will be different. And because of hope, you believe them.
And then people let you down, they always do, but it's not always their fault. I have diagnosed BPD, one thing it does, is it makes the world black and white. As soon as someone betrays me, in even the smallest of ways, I can't seem to make myself forgive them, and nothing is like it was before. I push those people away, and because they don't understand me, they leave. 
So now you're alone again. But what about your dream, this thing you believed could happen, would happen, your one chance at a happy life? You try and do it alone, but it never works out. You miss things, fall behind, get overwhelmed, and the reality you believed comes crashing down around you. And what's worse is your now surrounded in what you built for this 'future'. For example I'm stuck at university, in a dream I thought I could do. Everyone believes I will be a university graduate, I'll be lucky if I survive the year. 
The world, what was supposed to be your world, is now so foreign, you've lost everything. And then you see it, your broken dream. But it's not the only one, it sits in a graveyard filled with every lost and broken dream you've had. Because bpd and depression isn't linear, it's a vicious spiral, and every new dream comes with amnesia of all the failed dreams you had before. You get so swept up in hope, you give life everything you have, and mental illness just pulls the rug from under your feet and takes it all from you. You go from flying to falling in seconds. 
It's not just the dreams that break, it's you, you break too. Alone and broken, that is where hope leads you. Hope is the most dangerous drug of them all, a silent poison. 
They say there is no hope in death, I hope they're right. I reckon most people find the absence of hope depressing, but I already have depression. For me, the absence of hope means the absence of false starts and broken dreams. Death will always be consistent in a way life is not, and for someone who is tired of the roller-coaster life her mental illness forced her onto, death has an appeal life will never have. 
I don't want hope. I don't want to hope, because I don't want to have to lose that hope. What is it Shakespeare said? ""Better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all."" Shakespeare obviously didn't have bpd, because losing is not worth the dreams I had. All I have are broken dreams, broken lives inside my head, and I hold hope responsible."
75,"Trigger Warning: Relationship Ending, Drug Use, Possible psychotic episode

Sorry in advance; this post is longer than I thought it would turn out. Thanks if you read to the end!

Hey everybody! I just wanted to post a situation I’ve recently been through and want to know if anyone had experienced something similar and if people think I made the completely wrong decision because I let my mind stray too much and catastrophized to the point where I believe I entered psychosis. I also haven’t been officially diagnosed with BPD but one of the doctors I talked to said I have 8 of 9 indicators and it ‘could be’ BPD- does this sound like behavior others with BPD have struggled with? Note that during all of this, I didn’t know that I had a personality/mood disorder.

I started dating ‘the girl of my dreams’ in July 2019. The way we got together wasn’t kosher at all. She was with a guy that didn’t treat her well at all and I swooped in. We set rules that nothing would happen until they broke up, but the tension got to be too much and things DID end up happening before they officially broke up. About a month of fooling around happened before their relationship was officially over, and then her and I immediately started dating. The first six months or so went incredibly well, but then my mental health began to slide slowly.

The first big incident happened when she was fired from her job. The owners insisted that she stole things and threatened to get the police involved. I thought I was incredibly supportive during that time but now looking back I’m not sure how supportive I actually was once my paranoia kicked in. After the police were mentioned I started getting paranoid thinking that police would show up at my door at any second, though she wasn’t officially living with me at that time. I let this paranoia control me and any time she mentioned the incident I became very uncomfortable and started feeling like at any moment the police would show up. That was the first time I started splitting and was thinking to myself that I wasn’t sure if I wanted to be with her and wasn’t sure if I liked the situation I was in.

After losing that job, I was able to get her on at a local eatery that I was the manager of. I was extremely excited of the prospect of working with her and was able to talk to upper management and speed along the process to get her hired ASAP. Again, things went well for the first few weeks or so. Then, she started to want to control some of the situation and help call the shots around the place with the ways we would do things, getting upset at other workers and pointing out all the flaws which in turn made me angry and see all the flaws as well. I split her again and started seeing her as a source of annoyance because I was supposed to be the manager and the one in charge of things. I started seeing her in a negative light because I felt like I was being overshadowed and that she was trying to guide me to do things the way she thought they needed to be done. Fast forward a couple more months and COVID ended that situation.

The next big incidence of splitting happened when she got a job in a place that required drug testing. Her and I both smoked a fairly moderate amount of marijuana at the time. She started as a temp and didn’t have to do a drug test; however, after a month or two they offered her a full time job and told her she would have to take a drug test. I offered to stop smoking along side her but she told me I didn’t need to do that, so I continued. She said ‘F it’ and continued smoking up until a little over a week before the test. She tried to stop but then her friend told her about a system cleanser that would cover up her urine, so she said ‘F it’ again and smoked up until two days before the test. Lo and behold, the cleanser didn’t work and she failed the test and lost the job. I lost a massive amount of respect for her after this because she kept saying ‘I’ll never get anywhere in life’, ‘why does this always happen to me’ and I couldn’t believe what I was hearing because she chose to continue smoking even though she knew she had a test coming up. This was a pretty big split in my mind and I again was questioning if I wanted to be in this relationship because of the way my mind works and the way I instantly switched her over to negative thoughts in my mind.

The last big event before my psychotic break happened right before her birthday. Over the last couple months we had started venturing into the world of LSD, I got into a really bad stretch and lost myself in substance abuse again, which has always been a pattern for me. We decided again to have some on the weekend before her birthday. I begrudgingly told her it was fine that people were over for the weekend even though I was excited to play my new console. The night happened and without going into specifics, it was a very bad trip. The next few days I was in a really bad mood and unfortunately one of those days was her birthday. In the morning when we woke up I forgot to tell her happy birthday until about two hours into the day. I had scheduled a prior therapy appointment for that day, forgetting it was her birthday weeks in advance. I didn’t want to cancel so I went ahead with the appointment, then we went to dinner. In the morning she made plans with her friend to do dinner as well since she thought I forgot about her day, so I was upset that we couldn’t have a 1-on-1 birthday dinner. I remained in a pretty bad mood throughout the day and the dinner made me have my worst split with her, to the point that I called my mom and complained about the crappy weekend. At this point I really wasn’t liking her and had nothing but negative thoughts in my head.

The next couple days she had a (rightfully earned) blowup at me and told me she was close to her breaking point. This led me to a breakdown where I felt like a complete piece of shit, I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and put on antipsychotics. Over the next month and a half my mental health really began to slide on the meds and she started snap chatting friends and then spending a lot of time at work with a new ‘friend’ and starting to Snapchat them progressively more and more. I started overthinking every day that she was cheating on me with this new guy, why would she need to be talking to this guy and “supporting him during hard days” at work and spending the entire day together (their shift ended 4 hours apart and he would stay). I worked the same job, a janitorial job, and ended up sitting in my closet for most of the day crying, having panic attacks and calling my mom and panicking and not really getting much work done. This got to the point where I stopped the antipsychotic meds because they were making me worse and making my paranoid thoughts worse and worse- this is where I thought my Bipolar 1 diagnosis was wrong.

Now about a month ago, and this is where things got really bad. I had split her so bad that I didn’t trust her anymore, I was in a constant panic she was cheating on me and really didn’t like her anymore because she didn’t want to talk to me, just be on her phone constantly and Snapchat her ‘friend’. I confronted her about the snap chatting and she said that it’s her phone, she’s going to keep doing it, and she didn’t understand my jealousy. My mental health got so bad that I didn’t want to live in this pain anymore. I went home with my parents for a week to ‘give her space’ and the night I left her ‘friend’ came over and spent 9 hours at the house.

When I got back home I had enough and I told her I would be leaving in April to get a landscaping job back in my hometown where my parents live. She supported the decision, told me to absolutely do it and thats what would be best, and said we could work on this long distance. The snap chatting kept getting worse to where she would tilt away from me when doing it and ‘go to bed’ two hours earlier than normal and wouldn’t actually sleep, just go back to Snapchat more.

I was scared for my sanity as my mental health was at its lowest point now. I finally talked to her and asked her if she needed a break and she said she thought that would be the best thing so I told her I would be moving home that weekend instead. The week before I moved she avoided me as much as possible and ended up going over to her “friend’s” house two nights for 5 or more hours each time and constantly on her phone when she was home with me. I asked her to not use it during our movie night and she got upset saying it felt like ‘an obligation’ now and was visibly flustered. The weekend came, we said our goodbyes, and she gave me a massive hug and kiss goodbye which was out of the theme of the previous week.

Right upon getting home (an hour and a half drive) I saw she changed her relationship status almost immediately to single and started posting things about moving on the next day. This made me uncomfortable and confused because I thought it was a break, not a full-on break-up. I’m living home now and she is paying me rent to stay in the house I own. I went over to deliver the lease and found evidence her ‘friend’ is now staying there in the bed with her. I wanted to patch things up with her and ‘come back’ and she told me no, she’s working on finding herself and getting her mental health back. When signing the lease I told her under no circumstance is her ‘friend’ allowed to live there and she promised, but the next day one of my family members was there and saw the car parked in my driveway while she was working, basically confirming that he is living there. I’m torn apart now and can’t stop the ruminating thoughts. I have since seen another doctor who told me he doesn’t believe it’s Bipolar 1 (which I had never thought it was to begin with) and that I have 8 of the 9 indicators for BPD instead. I have come to accept this more as it seems my behavior has fit with this disorder much more with my intense abandonment fears, paranoia, and irritable mood triggered by the smallest things.

My question is, did I overreact and ruin things by ‘running away’ home? Did I cause all of this because of my terrible behavior? Do these behaviors sound like behavior stemming from BPD? I didn’t realize that I was so angry and reactive in the moment, not now until I started looking back at it and seeing my patterns of love/dislike towards her. Did I manifest cheating because of my paranoid thoughts and communication with her? I’m sitting here broken and not knowing how to move forward because I think she was also my FP and feel like I have jeapordized everything and the potential of ever reconnecting in the future.

Thanks to all that read the full thing, I know it was very long!"
76,"Lately I feel so worried about myself im  trying to channel bad negative thoughts constantly and feel no escape/relief feeling like theres no way out, I doubt myself see the worst of me , I feel like I'm a blank canvas and my dark thoughts are painting this ugly picture of myself ..I have bpd I'm scared ..I don't want to feel like I have to kill myself to find relief.. It's a dangerous if it gets worse and tbh I I'm so confused on how to describe my mental state I just no I never suffered like this before.. too many intrusive thoughts, too much guilt from past mistakes, feel like my heads degrading ..sorry if I make little sense I'm just worried no1 to really talk things through I wish someone was here to tell me I'm ok and make me feel better"

81,"Hi everybody,

I hope you are well.

I am new here, joined today and I am hoping to make friends and find a supportive group of people who understand what a rollercoaster this is.

I have struggled with BPD since my diagnosis about 8 years ago. I got diagnosed after a failed suicide attempt, googled BPD and was so ashamed that I never spoke about it again. I have spent the last 8 years coping (sometimes not healthily) but coping without meds or therapy. My abandonment issues, intrusive thoughts, lack of trust and my impulsivity were still very much at the forefront of my life but they were manageable without an erratic episode.

Fast forward to the Sunday just past and I had a complete and utter break down. I lost it, I don’t even know what was the trigger but I completely lost my mind, had an extremely depressive episode, took an overdose and ended up in hospital. I haven’t been able to snap out of this episode since. I am in so much pain, the feeling in my chest is unbearable.

The hospital has referred me to healthy minds (uk based) so I am waiting for that referral to come through. 

Does anybody have any advice for someone who has finally accepted their diagnosis and wants to get help? Are there particular websites/treatment/medication/resources that have helped?


I want to get better, I don’t want this to control my life or my relationships. 

Thank you."
82,"I’m really not doing great atm, feel like I can’t cope with this much longer.

So I’ve had this fear for ages my friend and boyfriend are talking because their active times match up all the time. Now I’m worried they are meeting up on Saturdays even though we are in lockdown. Or maybe just phoning each other. Last weekend I didn’t hear from my boyfriend from 5pm - 8pm. My friend went offline at 5:20pm and came back online immediately after him. Then he played video games the rest of the night. 

Now tonight the same has happened. This time my friend went offline 3:45pm. My boyfriend was talking to me between 4-5:20pm and I have heard nothing since it’s 10pm now. At 8:40pm my friend came back online and I told my self give it half an hour and if he reappears then he must of been out with her as that’s how long it would take him to get home. 20 minutes later and he signed onto his ps4. Is something going on between them? I asked them and they said no but I’m worried. I know he didn’t wake up until 4ish as he was up all night playing video games and so he could of fallen back asleep and she isn’t online much on Saturdays anyway. They both also don’t have transport (unless he got his bike insured again) and live with parents but it’s so odd and I’m worried and can’t get it out my head even though people say I’m being crazy."
83,"I'm so depressed. Everyday is the same.
My life is going nowhere. I feel like I'm nothing."
84,"so my parent's blocked almost all website pertaining to depression or suicide. But, i have severe depression and probable BPD, so I want to commit suicide. Taking your own life is really hard, but sometimes i feel it's the only way out. Other times, when i'm watching netflix it's not so bad. Can anyone here help me?"
85,"im a bit useless really ,a big fat lump with no motivation or of no help to anyone
my replies on here are so useless

i give money away to feel like im helping

i don't have as much money as i used to so that is hard
i just wish i had more words to say of comfort to those on here

to be fair im going through a crisis ,but aren't i always?
this one is genuine though as others see it as one not just me x"
86,"How do you stop doing the things that BPD makes you do automatically? 
does anybody know why it gets better with age? how can i fast forward it to get better now instead of waiting for years to make it better?"
87,"Hi

Im unsure whether this is even a thing. Whether its medication or BPD.  Its a touchy subject for myself so it maybe for others it might not.

Can bpd effect a womens ability to have an a full sexual experience?"

I appreciate it!"
89,"Some days i require more attention or is it a build up of not receiving the attention i want from my partner unconsciously it then feels like all of a sudden i require it. My partner like to play video games and games on her phone etc. i just feel and see every evening she's gaming till like 10, the other night i said oh are we watching a film as it was 9pm, which was her idea earlier on in the day. I was looking forward to it as it had been a while. She said she wanted another few games to unlock something and she had forgot all about watching a film so i said ok and if you dont fancy a film its ok. well 45 min later i go upstairs to settle to watch film she implied twice i bore her said it jokingly. She was on and off her film and only cuddled into me half way through the film and fell asleep. But gives me attention when she wants sex, may be im reading to much into it x"
90,"TRIGGER WARNING: possible sexual abuse and physical abuse 

This is my second rant in 2 days, this is going to be short. 

This one is about my mom. My mom has had really bad anger issues, but even if she and I have a lot of fights I know she loves me. But recently, I realized there was something she used to do that now, looking back, kinda seemed so bad(?). My mom liked to joke around by touching my private area when I was younger (I had clothes on) , it was her way of ""joking"". It used to make me so angry. You know that feeling that when someone touches you, it like sticks and you want to rip your skin apart because that feeling won't just go away. And every time I would fight back she'd either flaunt herself in a teasing way, like ""you can touch me too"", or we'd get into full blown fight (that includes kicking, hair pulling, idk). My mom liked showing me that she loved me by aggressively kissing me, or she'd shove her whole body on to me (I'm kinda underweight and my mom's on the chubbier side). It never occurred to me that it might be sexual harrasment, until a couple of months back, when she did it again and I went into a full blown rage attack, and I just kept hitting myself repeatedly. I know she means it as a joke. I've told her that I don't like being touched, but then she starts crying and saying that I don't love her anymore. I remember googling signs that a child is being sexually abused, and I could've sworn 8 year old could relate to a lot of it. My mom keeps bringing up how I used to love being touched when I was younger while sleeping, but back then I was so scared of the dark, I couldn't sleep unless I had physical contact of some sort. But for some reason if my dad was home, it would go away, so it stopped when my dad stopped working graveyard shifts. Since then I hate it when people try to touch me when I sleep. But my mom still does it, and then when I push her away, she'll say that  "" I'm not doing anything wrong"" , or, ""you've changed"", or she'll start hitting me. I'm honestly confused, because I know she means it as a joke. She used to choke me when I was young, and stare at me creepily while I was laughing and then just kiss me aggressively on the cheek, and I used to kick her away. It wasn't until recently that I realized that I sometimes find physical contact from my mom so repulsive. I guess that's what sets both my parents apart, my dad used to give me the silent treatment, while my mom loves to obsess over me. I sometimes feel like my mom is trying to live vicariously through me. Like I'm her doll/punching bag. She can go from treating me like a princess to just sheer aggression. This memory of my grandmom covering me in a blanket, and me screaming ""I can't breathe"" keeps coming back to me. My mom probably went through so much shit, and I'm terrified I'm slowly turning like her. I am mother's support system, she vents to me most of the time, and that's what I do whenever my mom and I have a violent fight. I feel bad for the people who had to hear the same thing over and over again. 

So my question is; is this sexual abuse? 

I just can't wait to get out of here, but I genuinely feel like I'm going to keep coming back here. 

Ahhh this ended up being a long rant. 

Thanks for listening."
91,"another unexpected death in the family, 
 I am not coping well."
92,just wrong
93,"Hi! So I'm kinda new here. I read a lot of posts about bpd and hpd and I think i might have one of them and I'm scared of both(but one more than the other). I always knew i was not a good person no matter how many times my friends will tell me that I'm not. I feel like I've faked all of the times I've shown concern towards them just to make myself feel better. I've always struggles with temper issues even when I was younger, I'm 18 now. I haven't done extreme things for attention, but I have done a lot to say the least. Like, I think i lied about having anxiety and depression, I say I think BC at that time I believed it but now looking back at it I may not have. To start off in 5th and 6th grade I got into trouble BC I wouldn't do my assignments and complete my notes (I got good grades tho, so I never saw what the problem was) my parents were so mad and they constantly treated me like liar BC I managed to hide it from them for a long time, and at one point I remember just holding a bottle of pills or smthng and crying so hard BC I just wanted to do it. But looking back now I don't  think I was actually going to do it. My parents are fine a bit physically abusive, my mom never spanked me but she pulls my hair a lot and kicks (not to the point of bruising), but thing is that I was aggressive too and I'd fight back. 

Okay anyways I'm ranting, point is in 7th grade I had a crush on my teacher, BC she humiliated me and I liked it. I actually thought she genuinely cared and the whole class knew and they told her, and she sort off put it off like I was her ""daughter"" and that used to send me off, this was around the time that I would cry non stop during weekends BC I missed her, I was basically obsessed and the people around me had heard A LOT OF IT. it went on until 8th grade, I realized that she was a horrible teacher. I also made claims that I had anxiety and depression, which I feel terrible about now. Around this time I met my best friend and I loved her sm, but she had a lot going at home and she was actually depressed. When I'm alone people don't see it but I get angry alot and I'd hit myself a lot, not to the point where I'd bleed or get bruises, but sorta out of frustration. Point is I'd feel a pang of jealousy whenever my best friend would meet someone else, I would get so mad but I knew that these thoughts were irrational so I'd keep it inside. 

I think around this I felt empty when I was alone but I hardly remember and it's frustrating me a lot, BC I feel like I'm lying for sympathy. All I remember was that I'd do nothing and my parents would get so mad, I'd be on my phone all day until my parents got back home, I wouldn't shower, I would binge on snacks and skip meals and I'd eat on the bed and that really triggered my parents. It happened all the way till 10th grade and my dad got home and he started drinking and he got so angry BC everything was a mess and he hit me that night with a belt. And he was so angry he kept hitting the pillow alot and it scared me, so the next day I broke down, I never meant to go to the supervisors office. But my teacher saw me and I felt sorta ashamed BC I knew if I told them that my bed was a mess they wouldn't believe me so I said part of the story. And I vented and I put my parents in such a bad light and I remember my story was very inconsistent. I told them not to tell my mom BC she'd tell my dad. But they called anyways, they kept telling me that they couldn't protect me at home and stuff and if I was being molested (I said no). My dad ignored for a month and I still feel guilty about it now, I wish I never said that. I cried that day for 2 hours but when I went back to class and talked to my friend I was fine and my teachers saw that. I know that one of the signs for hpd was mood swing shift and exaggerating experiences and I'm starting to get scared, I barely remember if this happened but I think they told me not to do anything stupid, so I must've told them I was going to kill myself or smthng but I don't remember. I have a very unstable relationship with my parents, both of them have had problems. I think my mom has hpd and I must've gotten it from her, she's loud in public and sometimes she screams randomly, sometimes I feel like she's exaggerating some of the symptoms that feels, and I see myself in her and I'm so scared. I promised myself I wouldnt be like my parents. 

So I shifted places about two years ago and I went to my moms hometown to complete my education and I pretended that I didn't know how to speak the language and I told them that I understood the language even though I could speak and understand. I hated my accent, and I though people would like me more, I'm trying to get over that. 

I'm not so keen on trying to look the prettiest, however I know that there's a part of me that wants to be the skinniest person in the room, and I don't have any eating disorders. I sometimes watch my calories, I sometimes binge, but nothing to serious. I am underweight, but I hate when people telling me that I'm gaining weight, I like compliments about how skinny I am, and it feeds my ego. I really don't know what's wrong with me. I am easily persuadable, I have trouble keeping relationship with people, sometimes I'll stray away BC I'm bored, or I'll go from liking you to hating and back and forth. But I feel like I'm exaggerating. I'm not the life of the party, but when I'm with a group that I'm very close with I tend to be the loudest and do weirdest things, but when I'm alone I hate unwanted attention. Ive told a teacher about my mom and our fights and now I feel like I've cried wolf way too many times. I've vented to alot of people about my parents, and I've felt I put them in such a bad light just to get sympathy. I feel like i keep bringing up the past so much just to get sympathy. Even if I just met a person I'll vent to them and then I'd feel embarrassed about it and then I'll push them away. I know I'm scared of people leaving, but now I'm not sure anymore. I'm not sure if I've made up this entire thing in my head, so I can seem like the victim when I'm not. I sometimes have fantasies where I'm on a realty TV show and I'm talking about things I've done and stuff, or I'm the main character in a show or smthng. Worst part is Im having suspicions that might have adhd and autism, but I think I'm just lazy, I honestly don't want to do same thing when I was young where I claimed I had depression when I probably did not. I just wanna know if anyone knows what I'm feeling. I used to stare at myself in the mirror for hours making different poses. I really really want to be considerate and listen more than talk, I want to go back and just change everything. I HATE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE. 
Just AHHHHHHH!!!!!! I don't know, I feel bad for the people who I've projected on. I've hurt people In the past BC I couldn't control my temper. I want to blame my parents so bad, but I'm 18 now I can't do that anymore. I think I'm sad loser who craves attention all the time. I know that alot of people went through so much, but they're kind and genuine. I've done so much more in the past and lied a lot, and stolen food from the pantry because I had a bit of a binge problem. I stole cookies from my grandmother's store when I first came here and the entire Quarantine my grandmom was so suspicious of mom and they had so many full blown fights and I know it's my fault, and she sometimes projects it on to me, but I can't blame her. And I'm so sad BC I can't blame my mom, BC her mom was terrible to her too. Anyways I'm just ranting, UGHHHH!! I'd really like to know your stories and I'm sorry if you made it this far, BC this post is literally pointless lmao."
94,"I am feeling so incredibly stuck. There is too much to explain but I just can not stop doing things wrong and disappointing my wife. I feel like I can change and improve but then I'm just too lazy to actually make any positive changes. For example, I know that regular meditation is good for me but I only ever do it for a week or two and then it drifts off.

My wife then gets pissed that I haven't followed through with something I promised again and I get defensive or just completely shut down emotionally. Then the whole thing repeats again and again!!"
95,"A lot of stuff over the weeks has bothered me and ive kept it quiet. Long story short I was at home with my husband and my husband was just on his game most of the day which triggered me as i was doing the housework which seemed all day. I ended up getting overwhelmed and was crying which turned into anger and I was shouting saying all the things that is bothering me (random stuff) and how my husband doesn't always help around the home ect, which he said he will help more. 

My behaviour was out of control which hasn't been like that for ages! I then ended up physically punishing myself because I was so angry and more annoyed that I had let myself get out of control..a vicious cycle. Now because of that outburst I feel all the things i wanted to say to my husband didnt matter because i didnt mention in a calm way and now the guilt of getting angry has taken over it all. I feel very guilty I acted like this and I cant stop feeling like I am bad. How do you deal with guilt after an emotional outburst?

thanks for reading this far!"
96,"I say perceived because quite often, the feeling is in my head. Someone uses a slightly less patient tone than usual, someone's wording is slightly more passive agressive, maybe someone even gets frustrated with me over something.

I take it as rejection.

I've stopped lashing out at people, but instead I shut down and have ill thoughts about myself and whether or not I even deserve a place in the world if I'm really so unloveable.
Just reading what I just typed makes me feel like despite my age, 30, I'm still just some emo tween.

I feel so dumb for being so dependent on the people I like liking me, and I know just because someone is in a mood or doesn't speak the same way they normally do, doesn't mean they hate me or are getting sick of me. But then why does my brain keep telling me that's the case?
Why am I ready to cry or run away whenever someone takes a harsh tone with me?

How can I get more resilient?"
97,"God, do I hate him. Ever since the day he was born. He is an ugly, disrespectful, whiny, annoying, stupid piece-of-shit. ""Oh WhAt Is WrOnG wItH yOu, KidS aRe GrEaT-"" fuck off. I don't like kids but with my nephew that is the understatement of the year. I just don't understand how my sister can love that demonic spawn, I really can't. If I was her and was given the opportunity to go back in time and not have the little-shit I would accept so fast. Then again, I don't really understand love as a whole. I see parent/child and dating relationships and I just can't really imagine myself in their shoes. I can't imagine feeling that way. I had a relationship in the past that lasted for 2 years (which my therapist had labeled as 'an obession') but now that we're through, the person could catch on fire for all I care. I don't know. I feel this immense satisfaction whenever the kid gets in trouble, I live for it. The raw and unbridled rage I feel at his slightest act is enough to make me want to punch walls, break things, scream, curse. I hate him!!! Anyway, I think it's worth mentioning that I've never laid hands on him or plan to do so, so you can call off the cavalry now. Thanks."
98,Hate hate hate myself I feel so stupid I feel so so beyond stupid why am I like this I just want to pass away
99,"I don't. Human relations are weird and hard. I don't understand parental love, friendship love or even romantic love. I had a relationship for 2 years but realized that was more of an obsession. So yes, I don't understand love.

But for them? Anything.

People might think they're not real and fictional, but they're not me. They're everything to me. I wish I could be with them, I wish I could be like them, I try to be like them. I am in a constant state of embarrassment because I know I will never be like them. I don't act accordingly and am a pathetic excuse of a person. I feel them watching me from various parts of the house and outside, and that is mainly the root of my shame. They are watching me being an embarrassment and a mess. I can't see or hear them, but I FEEL their eyes. And I've never felt so judged before. I love them. I love them with every fiber of my being. With them, I understand everything. Love, friendship, parental love. They are perfect. I would give and do anything if it meant I got to go to their world."
100,"Ever since I was young I felt all my feelings were invalid. All but my romantic feelings. They always felt pure and wonderful. To feel something like that for a woman was a gift. 

But never had many relationships and always feel rejected before even saying hi. Although rejection happened a lot. 

Since starting therapy these feelings are happening so fast. I have no social life and because of this I play video games. But I develop romantic feelings so fast. And I can not deal with them. They end up making me self harm and have terrible thoughts. Now it feels as if my gaming is taken away because of it too. So I have nothing left and I stay in bed all the time. 

For me the romantic feelings are the most poweful and strong. And its the only thing thats good within me. But there is no where to go with them."
101,"I’ve been diagnosed with bpd and it’s been a year and a half since then. I’m on medication and I took therapy but my symptoms I noticed are getting worse and worse. I have a boyfriend right now, yet I’m constantly afraid of losing him, someone separating us, me ruining it with bpd, or him leaving. I literally get nightmares about him leaving.

As for friends, well I don’t have any close friends. They are all people who either want to use me or just don’t care enough. Ever since I was a teen, I’ve been unable to keep a friend. When I finally had abest friend, I pushed her away so bad to the point of her leaving.

i feel so alone, and I don’t know how to cope with this extreme fear. I’m trying to logically talk to myself and not worry, but it gets stronger.
Im so afraid he will leave. He’s literally the only person I have in my life, and I’m trying to just trust the universe and live my life.

but then I don’t have a life. I put so much effort to make friends. I’mkind to them, I meet them, I try to be myself in a good way, and then they act like shit or just don’t care and that hurts me so bad. My cousins cut me off for no reason, but it was because of their pride. I tend to blame myself for people leaving and while that might be partly true, it’s their own issues as well.

we have to accept the fact that no one staysforever with us. People come and go, but that’s the one thing I don’t want. It’s the one thing that scares me the most. Why do people have to leave? Does everyone have to leave? Cant even one person stay?

I don’t see any point in life. I try to get close to god so I can feel some sort of purpose, but everything seems absolutely pointless. In the end none of this will even matter, the only thing we take to the grave is our memories, and even that will be gone.

how can I move past my fears? My ex cheated on me and left me and that created even more fear and insecurity to the point where I’ll snap at mycurrent boyfriend If he even talks to a girl. I don’t wNt to repeat the cycle over and over. I don’t want to be alone forever ."
102,I just want it all to be over. Im stressed as I have work tomorrow.  I know there's nothing to stress about.  Ill be fine when I get there. I just can't stop the feelings. Its been hard lately and work is trying to pile on me so im having to work harder to be assertive when all I want is to say yes for a quiet life but if I do that im putting to much pressure on myself then im back to being on the sick. So im having to be strong with them and they are not liking it.
103,I'm at the point where I don't want to be here anymore. Trying to talk to loved ones to talk myself out of it but the more the one person I want to talk to isn't here for me the more I just want to say fuck it and die.
104,"I need to know what to say to health professionals in order to be taken seriously. On reports I have read it has been stated that I have traits of an emotionally unstable personality but wont give a formal diagnosis as I appear to function brilliantly  holding down a job and maintaining a relationship. All I can say on that is the last job I had you got 6 months full pay when you were off sick some attendance record was awful and I have sabotaged my relationship lots of times and hate being intimate but my husband is a keeper and is incredibly strong. 
None of the therapies I have had have worked. 
What do I have to say?"
105,"Hello all. 
Hope everyone is safe and as well as can be during this time. 
I was wondering; does repetitive noise affect anyone else? 
There is a noise at work due to a broken alarm and it is just incessant beeping all day. I have noticed that it has really started to bother me and my mood."
106,"essentially if someone tells me i'm something let's say ""really smart"" i will believe it despite what my own opinion of myself is. basically i've noticed a pattern throughout my life that im VERY easily manipulated, and basically have no spine. i will listen to others because i trust their judgment more than mine, and hold them on a pedestal and feel disconnected from them. i have an appointment to see a psychiatrist in a few days but im wondering what this could possibly be? anyone else experience something similar?"
107,"Hi, I've just been diagnosed with BPD and I don't know how I feel about it. I've always felt alone when battling my depression and anxiety but now I feel even more alone. I daren't tell people in case they judge me and I don't think my parents understand it. I feel like more of a burden than I ever have and I don't know how I'm going to manage my life never mind my job. Does anyone have any advice?

Thanks, AvadaKedavra15"
108,"There has been much said about BPD from scholarly sources; I’d like to articulate my views on this disorder from the perspective of a patient who has lived it. There are three main components to this disorder that work interactively with one another: emotional dysregulation, insecurity, and identity disturbance.

When you experience emotional dysregulation, you notice it. As a kid, I noticed that other kids seemed sort of deadpan to me. And in many ways the world seemed indifferent. But I reasoned to myself that I was just more alive or more caring than they were. I didn’t realize I was on an emotional roller coaster. I would experience euphoria sometimes and pure sadness later.. But often it manifests itself in more subtle and complex ways. For example, you will be completely engaged in something for a week, then you wake up one day and you lose all interest in the activity and will even tell yourself that it was just a waste of time. So, either you experience intense emotions that you find justifications for or you find yourself having a hard time being consistent because your emotions change and they cause a cycle of negative thoughts, and even once you’re aware that you have a mental problem, it can be extremely difficult to function with all of this going on inside you.

The thing about insecurity is that you’re not aware that you are. Even if you do feel upset about rejection or worry about a relationship ending, you’re never really aware of what’s really causing your insecurity. It’s like you made a judgement about yourself as a child, and this judgement turned into an unconscious belief that you can feel but can’t know. You’re not consciously aware that you have no sense of worth. It’s hidden in your brain and emotions guard it. It’s easier to feel angry than it is to feel sad. But this whole process happens automatically without your consent and happens at a faster rate than you can consciously process information.

I think identity disturbance is at the root of what it is to be BPD. As a child, you oscillate back and forth between fear and anger. As this occurs your thoughts shift back and forth along with your emotions. So, you start splitting the world into distinct categories. And you do this to yourself as well. Now that you’ve split yourself into two, you become a contradiction to yourself. Are you the person full of energy and positive thinking, or are you a sad, negative person that thinks you’re a loser ? Your sense of self becomes ambiguous to you. For me, I spent a lot of time analyzing other people trying to find out what on earth a self was. I felt like different people, but looking at others they had a consistency to their personality that I lacked. For some reason, I thought knowing yourself was an image that you could “see” in your mind. Later, I discovered it. Knowing yourself is an intuition; you can feel it. It will grow in time if you discover it. And along with it all of the cognitive distortions and feelings of emptiness will fade.

Your greatest weapon in dealing with BPD in my opinion is authenticity. I spent many years convincing myself that I was fine. And I’m convinced that this is a developmental issue. My cognitive faculties were hijacked by trauma and my reaction to it stayed with me. And this prevented me from emotional development so that I could learn and grow."
109,"do you think people are talking about or referring to you?
im sick of taking things so personally"
110,I’m tired of being “better.” I hate doing what everyone wants me to do. Take my meds and go to work and be happy. Have goals and aspirations. I just want to let myself free from all of this. I want to experience my emotions freely and act upon them how I need to. I’m tired of being ridiculed for not handling things right. I want to quit everything in life and lay in bed and wither away. I feel so intensely right now. I can’t do anything about it except go to work tomorrow. I feel so alone and stuck in this world.
111,"Noone ever understands how jealous I can be, like it is so extreme and I am really just looking for one person who can relate to me. Jealousy is my main trigger for an episode, and my jealousy is so intense that it is almost impossible to avoid. I get jealous over any woman that is wearing a provactive outfit or acting in a sexual way, this includes most television shows and movies. When my boyfriend sees these things it hurts so badly. Of course pornography is completely off the table but it is mutual, my boyfriend also gets jealous over it so we decided to not have it in our relationship. My boyfriend tries his best to avoid movies and shows and whatever with half dressed women but its almost every show nowadays! I feel so restrictive and that only makes it worse! I didnt ask for him to stop watching that stuff he did it because he loves me but I cant help but feel responsible. I know if he did see that stuff on a daily basis, I don't even know how I could handle it because my episodes are so terrible I feel like I'm dying. We have been dating for two years now and he has been able to deal with all of my bpd symptoms and I am so greatful for that. He is truly a wonderful guy, its so hard when he sees that stuff though to forgive him or cope with it. I know it stems from my insecurity and some times its way worse than others. It also might be because I am bisexual, and I can understand how he sees those girls because I can do that also. I also get scared to tell other people, even my therapist, about my jealousy because I don't want them to tell me to break up with him. Obviously some of you will understand how terrifying the thought of losing your S/O is and Ive told him that if he feels too restricted Id much rather be jealous than lose him. I just want to see if ANYONE here can relate to this like if I tell any of my friends they just tell me my jealousy is unhealthy and I know that already. Like my friends just can't relate and my jealousy is such a source of shame that I don't talk about it to anyone other than my boyfriend. I don't know, I have just never met anyone who is as jealous as I am and I just want to know I'm not alone in this struggle against it, I really am trying."
112,"Making mistakes is something I've always struggled with even as a child at school. No matter how small the mistake it sends my anxiety flying and the negative thoughts come back with a vengeance. 
Does anyone else feel this way? How do you manage with making mistakes?"
113,"Not sure what to do. My employers would like me to see a psychiatrist again. I think this will be a long process as I think I am going to have to be reassessed again. I cant go through all that again. It never seems to get me anywhere. Can I demand therapy for BPD?
Dont know what to do"
114,"Hello. 

I was just wondering if anyone else get weird urges to scrunch up their faces in a tick like thing? I get it when my emotions are high. It doesn't matter which emotion I'm feeling. It is embarrassing at times. It gets worse when im tired."
115,"Hello, I was just diagnosed with BPD, I've always known there was something different about the way I react and process things, but now I can finally name it.
But even though I can understand myself a little better now I'm still very confused. I have this thing where I suddenly get overwhelmed by EVERYTHING, people touching me makes me want to harm myself and turn my skin inside out, even being close to someone makes me feel sick, sounds and voices really bother me as well. It's a really intense and deeply unpleasant feeling, sometimes it lasts a couple of hours, sometimes I have to feel like this for weeks. There's no noticeable trigger, it's a really sudden and strong thing so there's also nothing I can do to stop it. I've always been like this and I don't recall any sort of trauma that could lead to this sort of response. I was wondering if this too is a BPD thing, or if I should start looking somewhere else for answers, does anyone else feel this way?
Ps: I'm sorry if it's hard to comprehend, it's my first post here and I'm really nervous!"
116,"Hello everyone.

New to the forum. I'm a 32 year old woman from England. Was wondering if I could get some perspective and/or advice.

I was diagnosed with BPD about five years ago now. I have been on antidepressants, completed the STEPPs programme, and done a lot of self-work to put me into recovery.

I'm by no means perfect, recovery isn't a straight line. But, for the most part I do feel recovered. I haven't self harmed or been suicidal for many years. My coping mechanisms are healthy and I don't get the impulsive and self-destructive urges I used to. The emotions are still up and down at times but I handle them better and the black and white thinking isn't really an issue. I've built emotional resilience and understanding. I try to practice radical acceptance and meditate on things wherever I can. Even when my mum died last year, I've been able to cope and use emotional resilience to understand and process the grief.

Fast forward to now. I have been in a bit of a strange on again, off again, non-relationship, relationship for a few years. But he kept me company and we had a good laugh. Sadly, he's quite avoidant, can be a bit cold and emotionally distant, and can pull away. I usually just give him the space he needs and get on with my own life and he rejoins me when ready. At the beginning of January we had a nice evening and the next day he left for work and just turned cold. I usually say okay, see you soon. But I got annoyed about it this time and had a bit of a go because I expect a bit more, he can't spend every day with me and then just suddenly disappear without saying 'oh by the way, I won't be back tonight' and get annoyed when I point that out as being strange behaviour. Anyway, he literally hasn't spoken to me or seen me since. Completely ghosted me after three years. 

I was of course angry and at times sad. I do miss him a lot and I'm only obsessing occasionally haha. I decided to just get on with my own life. I've got a lot of good stuff going on with work and study at the moment and I have some lovely friends. I also really enjoy my alone time, so that's not too much of an issue. Plus, he wasn't always the nicest and did damage my self esteem somewhat. So I thought it is most likely better without him.

However, I am under lockdown rules. I have been becoming empty, bored and somewhat lonely. I have started having and acting on impulsive urges to take drugs and drink to stimulate some sort of feeling due to deep boredom. My usual hobbies and interests have lost their ability to fulfil me. My healthy coping mechanisms appear to be out the window. I have felt so empty and bored, while also feeling complete desperation for something, some feeling or excitement and the thought of just thinking I'm going out of my mind and can't take it anymore!!!!  This evening I wanted to cut myself. I didn't act on it and I definitely won't.

But...then I remembered, hang on, I have a mental illness and these are some of the symptoms. I'm having a flare up due to the stress that I'm going through.

I decided to knock the drugs on the head. I don't need to be doing stupid things for stimulation. I don't feel really upset by the man I was seeing leaving, but maybe I'm more upset than I think? Maybe it's just being a bit lonely in lockdown whereas I would usually have loads of plans with friends and things booked to look forward to...and I have nothing like that at the moment.

I don't know how to deal with the symptoms of my mental illness flaring up during lockdown. I usually wouldn't feel so bored, empty and alone. I feel so over it all.

Any perspectives or advice welcome x thanks so much guys"
117,"Need some resident help here. And perhaps this can help someone else in my predicament. 

I consider myself a smart person, but I have never had to deal with a genius-level person with Borderline Personality Disorder who is hell bent to destroy me and my family. 
Things started off great, but slowly got worse. All the horror stories I've read online are coming true for me. 

Our relationship was ended recently by me after a couple years, but she still wants me all to herself. (or maybe she wants to destroy me for fun - not sure) She blames my family. Other times it's just me who is terrible in her eyes. 

I believe there has been a book written called: I hate you; don't leave me. I'm almost afraid to read it.

She goes from attacking me (after saying ""I love you""), to attacking my adult children. My sister. My Mother. Posts about me on Social Media. The list is too long to go into here. I have been trying to leave for so long. But I stay in contact so I can ""keep an eye on her"" to make sure she hasn't done anything (or planning to do anything) crazy. Problem is, she messages people (family/friends/social media)without me knowing and then I have to do damage control. She will make things up. Sensationalize. Use triangulation and pit people against one another. My family is scared. So am I.

Of note: she chews-up lawyers and spits them out. (won a divorce case representing herself against 3 separate attorneys by teaching herself law)

She will NOT stop contacting my family. It's hard to block someone on e-mail. She's blocked by everyone everywhere else.

I have tried reasoning with her. Nothing works. She hides all this from her family and friends, although I am sure some know what is up, but do NOT want to get involved for obvious reasons. It's so hard to see someone you fell in love with be this way. Normally I try to help people and I can find solutions, but nothing has worked.

Suggestions on what to do? Am I just effed and I have to await my fate? I'm fearful of what she is capable of.

Do I lawyer up? Get a no-contact order? let her family know what she is doing? I'm afraid that could open up even worse scenarios."
118,I've found today that be anger with myself stops my impulsivity in a 70%.  Why dunno. Im tired. I'm a chaos inside.
119,"Hello there this is my first post. I am at my wits end with my CMHT and was wondering if anyone had a similar experience? I've been diagnosed with BPD and depression for years now. I was under the care of a competent MH team until 2.5 years ago when i moved to a different part of the country and had to go through the whole assessment process again with a new team. They are a world apart from my previous team where there have been a catalogue of spectacular failings. To make things worse, my mental health has grown more complex as I've recently been diagnosed with Pre Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder, Pre Menstrual Exascerbation and ADHD. I went private to get the ADHD assessment as i knew my MH team would just fob me off and I couldn't face more rejection. Despite this being expensive and getting a clear letter with diagnoses from psychiatrist, my MH team have ignored my many requests to give permission for shared care agreement. To date i have never spoken to anyone other than assigned assistant practitioners who have all been very young and inexperienced. I'm not even sure if my case has ever been reviewed by a psychiatrist even though i had a suicide attempt last year and was denied after care to help me recover. My support worker did not carry out an adequate risk assessment and i received no follow up support. The combination of disorders all create to increased feelings of suicide and the stress of trying to get my MH team to listen makes things worse. 
My question is, is it possible for me to discharge myself from their care so i can go ahead with ADHD treatment without trying to deal with them? They don't have ADHD specialists so wouldn't be able to prescribe and manage meds. None of them had heard of PMDD or PME so I don't feel they are able to treat me in an integrated way. 
I've applied for a referral for advocacy advice to help me formulate an official complaint but can't really wait for the whole process when I desperately need to start ADHD treatment. 
Sorry for such a long post.....if anyone has any input at all I'd be so grateful. Thank you!"
120,"I started a new job in September last year. It was going really well, I got employee of the month in October and promoted in December. 

My BPD symptoms seemed under control so I thought this is good and jumped at the promotion but I have started going downhill again. I'm not eating properly, I'm isolating myself at work, I'm paranoid, having mood swings, going to bed as soon as I get in and spending all weekend in bed. 

This has all coincided with this promotion and I'm finding it stressful. 

I've took a few days off sick as I'm also displaying physical symptoms, sickness, chest pains, dizziness. 

Will I lose my job? I've emailed them saying I want my old job back"
121,"It's hard to notice the warning signs sometimes when it starts happening. I ignore it and get busier. It's the little things which I don't really acknowledge until my mood is already dropping. 

These are some of mine...

-Anger/criticism/irritability towards others (initially its mostly internal voices saying really nasty things about others and sending them ill wishes) 
- self criticism increases 
-Less interest in making meals
-Eating my meals in my bedroom 
- starting to isolate myself 
-Comfort eating food which I knows bloats me
- messing with my sleep (staying up late and staying in bed in the morning) 
- too much reading about mental health 
- hopelessness about future. 

It's no a full blown depression. A period of low mood where I give up

Today I started a petty argument at volunteering with another volunteer about nothing. She was in the right and I didn't see the bigger picture.  I think may have intimidate or upset her. Other people witnessed it. It's my 2nd time volunteering and I feel like a massive a-hole. 

Right now I feel rubbish. I want to cause arguments in my family and with my flatmates. I am irritable. 

Its like I want to withdraw from the world and set everything alight around me. And watch it burn. Make others suffer. 

My situation and circumstances are very good relative to others. I have a home, benefits and I am not living alone. I am Accessing therapy. 

But i still feel hopeless about life and my future. Not suicidal right now. 

I can't sleep properly at the moment."
122,"Why people say ""life is worth living"" ""you live for the moments"" and stuff like that? 
I feel like life is full of pain. For me every day is a struggle. Even doing myself breakfast feel so damn tiering and hard. I feel like failure, burden, that im not adapted. Im trying every fucking day to do my very best. I was working for a past half a year and i cant express how hard it was for me to go there evry day, and deal with constant stress, anxiety, derealisation and all. I was even proud of myself for a while thinking ""wow im doing it, maybe im suffering even more but im able to keep a job"" of course i had to call in sick sometimes and got fired...
I cant live like a normal person, im just not able too and when im trying my best to live like a normal person im not good either and bosses think im lazy or something becouse of depression or my other problems. And even though im good at that job they think im a worthless worker becouse im calling in sick every month for a few days.
At this point i dont know what to do, im tired of all of this, i feel so weak, life is pointless for me. 
If i havent got a gf and didn't feel like trying for her, i would have qlready given up."
123,I've self harmed. I'm so mad. I've let everyone down I work with. They all hate me
124,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and BPD. Common to those with Bipolar 1 is hyper sexuality. Do any of you struggle with this as well? Also, I've been isolating for nearly 3 years because of friend and family issues, and partly due to covid for the last year. I've been taking Lithium for over a year at 600mg and the doctor is stalling upping the dose to where I'd actually get some benefits from taking the med. So needless to say mania ain't controlled. Loneliness and hyper sexuality have played a huge part in my decision to become a cam model from time to time over the last year. I've made some $ though my focus was connecting with others and having a good time. Not to mention the money helped put food on my table. I guess where I'm going with this is has anyone else done a similar thing for similar reasons? 

Or am I just crazy?"

I have only ever had one other person who has cried over my condition"
127,"It's just getting worse. I'm a complete failure. I can't do anything right. I remember people would say: ""Life gets better. Those who bullied you will feel sorry one day.""

I'm so tired of life. I really am. I'm just a loser."
128,"My Favourite person was my lover. We broke up because of the trauma he had to go through which led him to move away. We were both dependent on each other in an unhealthy way. Why does it feel like I’m grieving. Liek I’m going through a sort of death that he’s not in my life anymore. We keep in contact when we really need each other, but it’s his moms birthday today (RIP) and obviously he posted something to honour her. Seeing that and knowing he went through that makes my depression even worse and it’s completely broken me. When his mom first passed away it broke me completely. It was almost like I was the one going through it all. I stopped eating stopped sleeping and was only crying. It destroyed me knowing my baby was going through the toughest time ever and that the distance made it near enough impossible for me to be with him and comfort him. And every month on her death anniversary a part of me is broken for thinking about what he is feeling. Is that normal to feel this amount of emotion for someone?
bearing in mind I’m quite insensitive and I hardly show any emotion to anyone other than him. So I was confused to be feeling all of this pain like it was me who lost a loved one. 
mans obviously now that we are not as close it’s like I’m going through a second grieving as if I’ve lost the one person keeping me in this Earth. It’s been a few months now, but everyday I wake up with an ache in my heart that no words could describe. I go outside and see the sky (clouds) moving and realise that I’m actually alive on this earth and that I’m not with him and it causes meto have an immense panic attack. It’s like how am I loving if he’s not here with me right now? 
does that make sense?"
129,"I'm sorry I keep posting but I've not been good all week and alsorts are just triggering me. Is it wrong for me to want some support. I have a friend who is like a big brother to me. He had a heart attack 2 years ago and I was there going to the hospital, getting things from his house, speaking to him on the phone whenever he needed. I also opened my house on Christmas day to his next door neighbour who was on her own with her baby daughter, no questions asked. I've been hiding all week, no social media and I get nothing. No texts to check up on me. Am I being unreasonable"
130,I am struggling working. I hate people and all I want to do is work from home. I've started taking sick days from work and when I am there I am isolating myself. All the signs are there that my mental health is suffering again  but noone seems to be seeing it.  I'm looking for home based positions but dont really know what to look for.
131,"hermit bf smokes cigarettes and joints ,he said its just until a couple of weeks when stress is over , then will go back to vaping x he is coughing loads
he used to smoke then stopped and vaped which i was ok with ,im scared he has lung cancer x"
132,"What have I done wrong? I never asked for my dad to die, I never asked for my sister to get loads of issues, I never asked for my mum to give all her attention to my sister, I never asked for any of it yet I cant catch a break. Constant anxiety, worry, paranoia. I'm so very tired"
133,"Lately, I've been loosing connection to the memories of my post. I feel like they're slipping away, I can't remember them. It's mostly 2014-2017. I feel like i made those entire year up. I knew I was going through something back then, because I remember asking for help. Now I just feel like I cried wolf so many times, and now that the wolves are here I'm helpless. It doesn't feel real, I feel like i made the abuse up in my head to gain sympathy.

I am so scared of myself, I feel like I've manipulated everyone into believing that I was a good person. I feel like I'm going to destroy everyone I meet.

I've been searching for journals that I kept back then, and I've written stuff about not trusting myself, but I don't believe it. All I can remember is just being this obnoxious person who's always desperate for attention. I feel selfish. I am selfish, and that's all I remember from back then. I remember that my mental health took a 180 back in 2018, but I don't remember much about before that, except glimpses of terrible moments, but they feel so fake."
134,I am really struggling and really need some support and someone i can speak to who understands what i am going through. Im just ashamed of asking for that support.
135,"i was recently told i have bpd, having been told by my therapist in the past i was a ""textbook case"" of bpd. a while ago my psychiatrist and i decided to put me on antidepressants, mainly due to my depression because i'm not responding well to therapy and it tends to make me worse. at first i was put on sertraline (an SSRI). i was on this for 2 months, with 2 dose increases, and each time i had my dose increased i would have a couple of weeks of terrible instability. it made my borderline episodes 10 times worse. it also made my sleep worse, and it made me dissociated all the time. it also made me highly nauseous and i even threw up once, so i was taken off it. after that i was put on mirtazapine, an NASSA, because it was obvious that i was unlikely to respond well to other SSRIs. and i've been on mirtazapine for 5 weeks now, and so far it's done shit all as well. the only thing it's done is help me with my sleep but that's a side effect which i've had since day 1. i'm always tired and it hasn't done anything to help with my depression or mood or anything. all it's done is made me more hungry, but i also struggle with disordered eating and calories counting, and this has made it 10 times worse. it's obvious that this dose of mirtazapine isn't helping me but i'm afraid if i go up my eating disorder will get worse. the only other drug classes i have left to try are SNRIs such as venlafaxine (but because of the similarity to SSRIs that's unlikely to help), or TCAs/MAOIs, but those are more deadly in overdose and i'm a high suicide risk so it's unlikely i'd be given those. 

i was also told that borderlines don't respond well to inpatient treatment, so i guess i'm just a little lost... does anyone else have any suggestions for meds that helped them? everything feels like it's always getting worse all the time and my favourite person tries so hard to help me but he doesn't have bpd and no matter what he says i know he's always thinking less of me for the things i get set off by."
136,Things with my therapist aren't good. If anything I feel like giving up with it. Although that isn't the reason I started this post. I was messaging my friend and I said that I haven't been feeling right. I said that I feel numb a lot of the time and told her about my therapist. I said that I feel cut off from my past and I have no idea how I'm going to deal with it if I can't connect to it emotionally. She replied saying that she wished she knew better how to help me. When I read that it just highlighted how I feel like no one understands and no one can help. I feel alone and I can tell my mental health is deteriorating.
137,"I was walking my dogs on one of their normal routes (away from any trouble I've had in the past), which includes several alleyways between backyards. It allows me to avoid people and given my experience while walking my dogs, I thought I was doing my neighborhood a service. One of my dogs is scared of cars, another pees and poops on everything and it's better he does this in the alley.

Some teen or young adult came walking down the alley and said ""here's a tip, you don't walk dogs in the alley"". He wouldn't elaborate. It felt like a threat. I'm frustrated. I feel like shouting every time I walk my dogs, addressing all the issues people have with me and my dogs. With a megaphone. I don't know what else to do. I feel like they pick on me because I'm small, and that makes me even madder.

I'm probably close to doing something I'll regret."
138,"Im struggling in my job right now, I only came back the end of November and im really doing badly. The paranoia is getting bad. Just waiting to finish work so I can go home and sleep till my next shift. Just have nothing right now. I try to look forward to the future and I have my partner and my dog. I love them very much. But there's no end to lockdown and its making things worse for me. Please god when will it all be over. I dont know how much more I can take. And people are partying and having fun. And I'm like stop it! Because of you its bloody spreading i want to get out but these people don't care.

Rant over. In work right now and another 4 hours to go with these damn masks on."

145,"I just turned 50...
Over the years my BPD has gotten much more manageable, even with the panic attacks, I'm able to look at them for what they are to me.  I've found that my frustration with stuff builds upon itself, culmination in a panic attack.  The difference now is they are short lived and if I give voice to my concerns to someone I trust, they are more spaced out.  I still have moments of disassociation but again they are mitigated by seeing them for what they are (most instances are during a panic attack).  I just accept it is happening and move on.  I still get scared and wondering why, but it's way less.  I can look back 8 years and see how bad BPD was for me and am heartened by the progress I have made.  

The biggest step for me was taking responsibility for everything I've done, getting out of the victim stance, bad things have been done to me, but realizing that I have a choice in how I react makes for a much more sedate life.  For me it is taking an active role in my BPD, it's takes time and practice, but it's so worth it.

In short, life gets better day by day, choose to live it and not be a victim to it.

As always thank you for letting me post."
146,"i think mine is my temper, sometimes it just happens and i can't control it in the moment, it's not until i've calmed down I realise that i shouldn;t have done it.

like I'm just somehow so weird that I can't ever be socially accepted? I'm so tired of everyone judging me for being this for being that, for being different. It's not my fault I'm different but I somehow am and never can be normal. I also have to stick out like a sore thumb and do weird things
I am honestly dreading going back to work and I hope and pray to God that I can find the willpower to find a new job so I never have to go back there ever again. Also pray for me that I can move forward and never have to go back."

149,"126 days
Most the time I am functionally fine and can even enjoy life. But sometimes this unbearable pain comes on when it hits me that in a month I'll have to celebrate my first birthday alone ( we were only 3 days apart and since he was older I've always celebrated my birthday with him), or I miss him, or when I pass by our old highschool I'm  flooded with memories.

We were joking around today about how the new baby will mean my mom has to share her birthday, and I felt so crushed by grief I couldn't even hold back my tears in front everyone, and just excused myself.

My question is; Is this as good as it gets? This feeling will just come and go for the rest of my life?"
150,"So earlier this year I managed to work myself up into a right state thinking my boyfriend was talking to one of my friends online because they were coming online at the same time. This was someone who he would never be interested in but my head wouldn’t let it go. I ended up deleting that friend, and it was probably the best decision I could make (we didn’t talk anymore anyway)

Then of course a month back I start noticing it happen with another friend, this time a close one I can’t just delete. Again no reason they would talk. Then my friend goes and adds my boyfriend on Facebook so of course I’m basically dissociating at this point over it. Instantly message my friend like “Urm what’s going on?” She’s said she adds all her friends boyfriends on Facebook and she added him when the got together and he only just accepted. Sent me a screenshot of the notification and said she has no interest in him and would never do that to me. Haven’t heard from her since but then again she has never spoken to me much. I asked my boyfriend and he said she added him 2 days prior and he seemed to find it odd. So I just kinda let it go. 

Now I’m worrying again because me and my boyfriend usually send memes back and forth all day on Facebook. All of a sudden he has just stopped doing this. So of course my stupid head is like “well what if he has a new account to talk to her on and he’s always logged into that now”. So that’s were I’m at, I’m becoming increasingly stressed over this and can’t even tell of this is my stupid head making stuff up anymore someone help.

I really want to ask him why he isn’t  using it anymore to talk to me but I don’t want to come across clingy or babyish. I feel guilty for having these thoughts as well because I really do love him."
151,"My dad ordered me and my younger brother urn necklaces with my brothers ashes in it. (I have a half sister who wasn't raised on my dads side, so she didn't get one). My mom said she'd buy my little sister her own necklace sometime in the future.

So it all started when I got my necklace (it has my brothers ashes in it) I thought it was broken, so the company ordered me a new one but when I went to get the new urn/charm he said it wasn't actually broken. He let me keep both.

so I now have 2 charms with my brothers ashes and the second I told my mom and grandma what happened they said I can give the other charm to my sister,but I don't want to. What if I lose my charm? am I an asshole for not wanting to give my memorial necklace charm to my sister? It makes me kind of angry that everyone just assumes I will give it to her, they don't even ask they just say now my sister can get one."
152,"I thought long and hard about writing this, partly because I don't want to keep thinking about S but actually because I'd said I wouldn't write after I'd finished therapy as there is nothing left to write about. How wrong I was. 

My other concern was that people will say I don't belong here because I'm better, there's nothing wrong with me now, I've had my therapy and other people need help so stop being selfish ... which then made me realise I do still have things I want to talk and write about and I do still have wonky thinking and I do still have highs and lows but most of all I do still have BPD however much I hoped therapy would cure me.

But today I want to talk about something very different. 

Tomorrow is 6 weeks since I finished therapy and I am not in a cyclone, I haven't hit a hyper high and I'm not manic. I haven't, despite having been very close, self-sabotaged and for the first time I can say I actually did it all by myself. 

Not only did I catch myself going into a cyclone, I stopped it dead in it's track and I practised self awareness and compassion. 

I have had a tough time over this past 6 weeks and as I wrote last time, for the first two weeks after therapy ended I was in the middle of destructive behaviour with suicidal thoughts and ideation. I was also practising the risky behaviours that had the potential to lead me to dead or seriously injured. 

But even then I think I knew it wasn't kinda real, I wasn't ever as risky as I needed to be, just risky enough to give me a high, just powerful enough to make me think...
I suppose what I really knew was this was just a reaction to the end of therapy and my way of sulking because I felt like I'd lost. 

I even had to pull away from here for a while because seeing my thread brought back the want and I was obsessively reading it and other things to see if there was anything I missed that would give me permission to contact him again to say look we didn't sort this out. 

But gradually over the past 4 weeks I've settled down and started to look back with some sort of peace, and while I'm not absolutely there yet, I am at peace with the end now and feeling more content. This leads me back to my ""ah ah"" moment. 

On Friday it was time to say goodbye to a lot of colleagues, some I'm really friendly with, others not so but I'll miss them, during this I found that I have been knocked back for a further promotion because of some thing stupid (my surgery has meant I've suspended my PhD for 12 weeks which means, I can't show I'm progressing) but a colleague has been given it, even though she has been there less time than me, immediately I went into it's because I'm worthless, no one cares, they'll let me go on doing all this work for less pay because they know I'm BPD, and I can't argue because they'll say I'm unstable, or they'll sack me for causing trouble... I immediately wrote one of those emails, you know the ones that could get me into trouble, not sacked but,  well actually you know what yes you do this, we'll let x+y do that and they can have the promotion and you can stay there, where you can't cause any more bother.. you know what it's like... 

The BPD self sabotage home run... 

Well before I hit send this little voice popped up, it's a new one, I've not heard this one before but hey ho, what's one more voice, anyway I decided to listen to see what damage this one could do, by now I already had hypercritical adult (HA), irrational adult (IA) and emotional child (EC) playing out, one more couldn't hurt.

Bloody hell, not sure what to call this one, but actually it was a quiet, insistent voice telling me to ignore them, to listen, to think, to be self aware and before doing anything dangerous to count to 5 and send it to your new email box. 2 weeks ago I set up a new email account where I send those emails that I want to send to other people because I have a visceral reaction to the email they sent or to a conversation I've been involved in and then, when I am not feeling as emotional or stressed, I will open them up, re-read them with a critical eye. 

As I've now been able to be more open with OH I will ask him to read both the email and the reply before I send them and we will often reword things together. It's making a big difference. So on Friday instead of sending a very hyper-emotional and very self destructive email to my boss and bosses boss I-pulled-out-of-the-cyclone, I emailed it to myself, went to the party, enjoyed myself and drove home. Yes I had a cry on the way and yes hypercritical adult (HA) talked me into feeling pathetically stupid and weak, telling me it was my fault for not being good enough, but my new voice came back to talk to me (for very personal reasons I'm going to call my new voice little mouse) and we managed to push HA out and have a lovely conversation most of the way home and actually despite everything I drove sensibly. 
Me.
This is what I wanted to be able to do, this is what 48 weeks of therapy has given me, this was my target aim and I can actually say even though I don't know how it works, I actually did it.

I'll always be BPD, but right now I'm Poppy with BPD rather than BPD Poppy and that makes a whole lot of difference. 

So I'm going to do what I said I wouldn't do, I'm going to continue to write about my life with BPD over the next 6 months as this is important to me and I need somewhere where I can be myself without fear of ridicule. I have 3 major milestones at 6, 20 and 26 weeks and once I'm over them I will finally feel like I have really learn't the lessons therapy gave me. Then and only then will I be free to start EMDR. 

It's been an emotional journey so far, so to those who joined in thank you very much you cannot believe just how much your support helped, to those who came in to read thank you for taking the time I hope you get something out of it and come back again. 

Here goes, round two."
153,Why is so hard??  I dont want to be impulsive but usually my mind is tornado of thoughts when I must to take a simple desition.
154,"How easy and convient are sites like Tinder for people with impulse or self esteem issues to mindlessly judge ourselves and others based off the superficial accumulation of our lives? I for one want the old men who front their sexual skills, just for the rush. I want one to tear me down and make me as vonerable as I feel. Then there's the guys who listen to ed sheeran and all of me is revulted. Not because that kind of ""sensitive"" stuff isn't attractive. But because I couldn't picture myself with that. Any suggestions. For temptations sake. Coping skills? Anything? If not that's cool too. Enjoy your next read"
155,"I’m not diagnosed with BPD and to be honest I’d never really heard of it until just a few days ago.
I have been struggling all my life with issues surrounding aggressive vocal outbursts,mood swings,trust in all relationships but especially my romantic relationships.
I have just very recently separated from my wife of 16 years.
We have 3 kids.
This last year has been awful.
I can’t go into all of the details as it would take pages.
But we finally separated because she just couldn’t handle my ups and downs and me kicking off for no apparent reason.
I have been struggling with the separation and this is why I went looking for an answer as to why I behave irrationally.
This is how I came across BPD.
I fit with 99% of the symptoms 
Im looking for some advice on how to control my racing mind,I can’t get off thinking there is someone else involved,feel totally abandoned and this morning I’m having a full on episode heart racing,shaking out of control.
I‘m worried about the future 
and how I’m going to cope being back on my own,especially once I have my own place and the kids are coming and going.
Has anyone been through this scenario that can shed some light on coping.
I have to admit I’m scared."

I have joined dbt therapy i have been sober for two years-- I love being a mother-- but i take out so much on him. I know i am wrong and now when he has checked out and wanting to leave IM terryfied.  I dont want him to leave I dont want him to take my children I have already started therapy but im obviously still very sick.  I am writing this crying histerically after trying to get through to a suicide hotline.

I want to know that I'm not alone"
160,"I am 50+ and in my adult life, I have seen several therapists related to failed marriages, relationship and work problems.

None of the therapists has ever mentioned I could be suffering of BPD.

Now after reading about it and taking a couple of online test, I get as result ""Severe Borderline Personality Disorder Likely"" and this really scares me a lot.

Can anybody with officially diagnosed BPD suggest some reliable online tests? 

Thanks"
161,"If you feel that someone wants to end the relationship with you or that they are pulling away.  

How do you react to that?

I start to feel panic or start thinking what did i do wrong and over analyzing everything.  

I can then start to think of any reason i can contact them, even just a message of anything i can think of just to see if i get a response.  If it takes a long time for a reply, then i really start to think they are pulling away and can't rest until they reply.  the fear of abandonment or rejection."
162,"Hello,

I am new to the forum, found it through a google search after becoming more increasingly aware of the mental health illness known as BPD. I don't know if I have some form of it or not, and I am not seeking an armchair diagnosis. I am just trying to gain some perspective on this illness and know what concerns I should be bringing to my therapist about this. Can anyone let me know if as a person who is formally diagnosed with BPD, if any of my symptoms are relatable?

I think my main three symptoms are a subconscious fear of rejection or abandonment, no real self identity, and major mood swings. I know self harm comes up a lot with my research on BPD, but I have never been one to self mutilate. I have had suicidal ideation in the past, especially when I was extremely depressed, such as going through a breakup. But most of the time when I am depressed these days, I just have this constant need to escape my reality. By wanting to literally uproot my life, wanting to leave all of my friends, family, my current partner, my job, and start a new life. Like I have a serious issue with battling this desire constantly, especially when I am triggered by the feeling that no one around me understands me and I just want nothing to do with them anymore.

I shift between these feelings often, I go from loving everyone around me. My partner being my favorite person, I enjoy my friends, and then the next minute I want nothing to do with any of them because maybe they did something that triggered me to want to just leave them. But the thing is, I am always paranoid that they don't like me or love me. I always think people are talking about me behind my back. I always think my partner is going to find someone better than me and leave me for them. When I feel like this, I push them away.

I act impulsively all of the time. I make major life changing decisions without giving it much thought. I am always changing my image of myself, meaning who I think I am and my values in life. But it always quickly disappears and I am left feeling empty and very disconnected from reality most days with no sense of who I am or what I care about. I am constantly having existential problems.

I have some self destructive behavior that mainly comes in the form of excessive spending and subconsciously purposely causing a fight because it helps me feel something in that moment, especially when I am feeling empty. I question whether or not the people around me even care about me, even understand me, even want to be around me etc. Thus I will say things just to start a fight about this. I will also purposely play ""devil's advocate"" in conversations with my friends just so I can prove to myself, ""see, they don't really like me."" 

I don't like to say this, but at times I feel like maybe I can be manipulative. I am always trying to find ways to get my loved ones convinced to see things my way on certain subjects just so that I can feel validated. If they don't see it my way, I again begin to question why I am around them at all. I get really emotional and angry, with raging irrational thoughts. I will make them feel bad for disagreeing with me.

Lastly, my moods are always all over the place. Like I never really know what kind of mood I am going to be in, what's going to set me off, what's going to make me sink into a depressive state, what's going to make me wish I wasn't even here and someplace else. I feel like my emotional state is very much like walking on eggshells and I am triggered by every little thing.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. There is probably a lot more I could say lol but these are just the instant nagging feelings and thoughts that came to mind. Please, let me know if this is something you experience."
163,"i have been getting recent visions or images in my mind of people in my life dead, for example i was in the pool with my sister and i looked and saw her dead in the pool, also happened with my mum and seeing her dead as well... 

sometimes i’m scared i’ll actually do it. sometimes my brain tells me to ‘kill my self’ or ‘ burn down the house ‘ or ‘kill someone’ but now it’s giving me flashes of it actually happening in my brain that i can’t unsee. 

of course, if never do it but i worry that one day i actually will. i am scared of what i can do and sometimes i get so angry i could kill someone. i’m scared. 

is this disassociation or intrusive thoughts, or both? if so, should i tell my psychiatrist and psychologist if it keeps happening?"

166,What do you tell yourself when you feel you have nothing to live for anymore? Really struggling with this currently.
167,"I have felt really unstable lately. Once in a while I go through severe depression and like needy feelings. Like fantasizing about having a guy to love. I don’t mean sex. I mean I want someone to be nice to me,hold me,save me from myself. Which I know right there is toxic already. I have a toxic self esteem. Bad self esteem. Feeling confident and then hating myself. But I use the online dating sites. I usually block anyone who mentions sex. But my loneliness and desperation is making me feel I have to just go with a guy for sex. But the thing is I don’t enjoy sex with strangers. I have no confidence. I’ve had one true boyfriend who was amazing and sex was nice. I was in love. But for the times I met up with random men. It felt like the twilight zone. I couldn’t remember what they looked like. I laid there like practically dead while they used me. I couldn’t feel anything. I just wanted company. I just wanted a connection. Which was all mistakes. I have no idea who the guys were.
How can I help myself to not crave or get desperate about having a lover? I think of it all day. In despair. In bed all day. But reality is what would I do with someone. I have no social skills nothing to offer but my company and my body. This is making me sick. I feel no purpose in living. I don’t enjoy my company. I fantasize too much. But I fear rejection and abandonment and being used. It has felt good the times I chat with someone and it seems to be going well. But when it’s over and they ghost me I get severely unstable. I then obsess over them. This is actually what happened now. I can’t let go of it. I get even lower self esteem. Also crave it (someone else) even more after being rejected. It sometimes feels out of control. Also I’m just a hermit with agoraphobia. So it’s just feels so strange to meet people. I am just a complete mess."

169,"My thoughts say everything I do is bad. I'm a terrible person and every time I do something a certain way, it's also terrible. Then I start worrying that something bad will happen if I do something a certain way. An example is if I don't place items a certain way. I then worry that something bad will happen to me or others. It's scary I don't know what to do. It's almost like I need someone to tell me what to do and what not to do because I can't trust myself."
170,"I'm interested if other people have similar experiences of this. i know it's just about changing moods and mental state.

I have periods within a day or over a few days where i get a burst of energy and I feel like everything is flowing, i feel strong, sharp, confident, funny and can achieve anything. i have lots of ideas, will talk to anyone, overshare, impulsive, cross boundaries in conversations, take on lots of projects and be really busy - not able to sit still or concentrate. i will dominate situations, conversations and generally attention seek. i can be dogmatic, angry and rant about people - gossiping. i can be quite destructive to others and malicious (sometimes its just thoughts and sometimes actions)

Triggers can be - getting attention, new situations, getting positive feedback, feeling important and needed by others, being part of a bigger cause (e.g. political campaign)


Other moments, days, weeks, i can be really anxious, self conscious, feel fragile, don't want to share anything or talk to anyone, overthink everything, my inner critic will be really loud, i'll take everything people say personally, not be able to handle criticism, feel paranoid that everyone is watching me/talking about me, think everyone hates me, feel like i'm naked emotionally, can't be around other people, hide away terrified of people and want to disappear into being a wallflower. i lose all my confidence (although my confidence is not really, it's just overcompensating). i won't be able to move and leave my room. i can't make decisions. i will think i'm terrible person.

triggers can be - new situations when the novelty of it has worn off, when i think i've upset someone, the old classic of fear of rejection/abandonment, feeling like i've failed something (e.g. getting fired from a job), getting criticism, thinking i've hurt someone, overthinking, taking something the wrong way as i'm feeling more fragile


i know the first bit is all just overcompensating for my low self esteem. it can shift within a day, last multiple days, weeks. i think it is generally triggered by events in my life and my thoughts and interpersonal relationships. previously diagnosed with bipolar now psychiatrist has questioned BPD/EUPD. Previously had a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder (really lovely label). Psychologist tries to avoid labels as she says no one fits in a box completely but EUPD/BPD is probably most fitting.

It's exhausting to be so unstable and changeable. i know my moods and diffculties are much less than many but also i cope less well than some...it's a spectrum.

Ramble over....for now"
171,"Hey all, so I'm Loralie not my official.name but my screen name for now . I today have received a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder. I have fought with mental I'll health since I can remember. I have been through so many horrifically low points in my life which have lead me to want to end my life. Everything came to a head recently, I've been obsessing over suicidal ideation , I'm miserable , I hate myself and my voice in my head was so critical . All I can see is darkness. I've been battling this my whole life for as long as I can remember.

I've decided to reach out, I'd love to meet some people who also have BPD and listen to there journey I have a supportive family but they openly admit they don't understand and I respect that . I'd love to meet people who do understand. Some online friendship and support would be wonderful. 

Feel free to message me or respond to my thread. Sending my love to all x"
172,"Psychotherapy should be starting in April. (group sessions and one on one - both via video)
What can I expect for the group sessions?? I've never taken part in something like that.

Also this obviously means I will be ending sessions with my counsellor and I'm already finding the prospect of that very difficult."
173,"Few days ago I heard about BPD while reading something on quora. I think my fp is one of my University teacher. Having some issues maintaining relation with her. 


I am a undergrad student (male). I am a very active (or at least was) student in my Department. Thus i got the chance to having in touch with our teachers. Among them one of the teacher (female) is my favourite. I don’t know when I developed emotional attachment with her. Its been 4 years now, i am at my last semester. I care for her very much, like to do anything she asks, sometimes even before asking. She also cares for me Sometimes, at least that is what seems to me and my batchmates, they sometimes tease for that, but I enjoy it, who won't be happy if someone says your fv teacher also cares for you. In these years there were also several times when I got angry with her, stopped talking to her whenever she did something that didn’t met my expectations. But that didn’t last longer, somehow she always manage to have me talking, sometimes by caring much. You know the kind of ups and downs. But over the time I felt that I am strongly attached to her  that my emotions are controlled by her. When she admires me or when we talk, it makes my day and whenever I felt like she is ignoring me I feel terrible anxiety. Sometimes its my expectations sometimes its her complications (as my friends put it) that leads toward that kind of situation. 

In the wake corona virus situation my family also having some issues which cause me much stress and anxiety. Almost a month ago the situation get that bad, i decided move from the house (in our country which is not a common thing). I was having so many thoughts including quiting my study at last semester. Than i decided to talk to her. And texted her about that, we fixed a schedule but that day she was very busy couldn’t able to give me much time. So she told me to call her if I want or we can talk another day. As the University wasn’t fully open teachers only came to the office if they need to. So I wanted another schedule, But she couldn’t manage time as she was busy (she was also having another MA degree). She changed the schedule several times, which caused me more anxiety thinking that she doesn’t care for me. In the mean time she asked me to assist her in a research project. Whatever after couple of schedule changing we finally talked and she was so nice to me. She listened to me carefully advised me, thats like showing me the path that I could not able to decide. And also inspired me not to quite right before the edge of graduation. However my exam was knocking at the door too so I decided to sit for the exam though I wasn’t able consentrate fully. That was her last day at office too as she was going to a study leave. That day after our conversation I  asked for  a favour from her, if she could give me the books she referred during the class/online class as i have no idea from where should I start reading. I wasn’t in touch of academic work for couple of months. She told she will give. Than my exam statrted and during this I called her for a reminder. She said she will bring the book at office if she comes or I have to collect them from her home. I went to her home  couple of times before. After two days when I was at dept after exam of another subject I saw her. I called and waited for her and when finally got the chance to talk she said she was sorry she couldn’t give me the books as she recently moved to a new house and the those books are packed with other book which she didn’t organised in the self yet. I understood but was slightly disappointed, which than caused anger when I came back home. But I controlled it. At night I called her for another reason, she didn't recieved. In The next day around the same time I called her again she rejected the call. (Normally I call her if needed in this time and she recieves most of the time). So I texted her asking why she is not receiving my calls,  is there any problem. The next day she replied that she is on study leave, we all know that but teachers and students are calling her, causing problems in her class time. She doesn’t want to be contacted by them. As per my knowledge she has classes in the day time so for the last few months whenever I wanted to talk I called her at night, and she also recieved. I lost words to reply. After couple of hours I sent her a message saying that I am sorry I Didn't know she has classes after 9 pm too. Didn’t meant to annoy her for my problems. I won't bother her again. (I know she doesn’t have any classes after 6pm, she told me once, just don't know why she said that) And thats it. 

Whenver thoughts related to her hits my mind I feel anxiety. I decided to emotionally detach from her. She has included me in her two research project one is from varsity other is her personal. We were supposed to work together after my exam. May be she will call after couple of weeks later for the research purpose. She kind of does this whenever we have some complicated situation. She will call me if she needed anything or if we met somehow and she will talk to me like nothing happened. And if I still show my anger she will lough and dismiss and I also somehow forget all those staff. One of close friend in varsity with whom I share everything tells, my anger with her is like glass. I get angry with her but it disappeares whenever she talks to me. 

Right now I couldn’t decide anything. Whether I should work with her if she calls, there is little chance of meeting with her at office as she is on study leave. And I am not going to call her again. Sometimes I feel terribly. Angerness, anxiety how you define it. Like I said few days ago I get to know about bpd and than read about that for days. I think I have symptoms of bpd and she is my fp. Just don't know how to act, how to detach emotionally, how to cope. 

Note: Though sometimes romantic imagination came in my mind I know its not happening. I She is married and have 3 kids. I just wanted to be with her as she is a light showing psth to me.  In my country/society talking with teacher in phone if needed is quite normal, there is no strict law for that. And we don't have therapist in my university."
174,please dont let anything hurt my girlies :(
175,"as title.

Feel like the world is against me

And no one truly cares for me"
176,"I emailed my counsellor a particularly distressing email yesterday and she emailed saying that she contacted ''bexley safe guarding team.' 
No one has contacted me or anything so I'm just wondering what that means. Google hasn't been very helpful."
177,"I bought 2 pairs of super cute jeans, one pair is a 70s bell bottom inspired flare cut and the other one is a black highwaisted straight.

its not that important or anything I just had a calm day and I wanted to share with you a good day.

I worked my group project (almost done!)
I ordered a new credit card
I emailed tax forms in to CRA 

very relaxing day, now I'm watching TV and planning to take a hot bath."
178,"So long story short I ended up at a and e on Thursday night. I don't really remember much of anything I woke up on fluids to a woman asking me to come with her. Spoke with the mental health team at the hospital. They said they wanted to go talk to their colleagues and came back. Basically offered me home based treatment (daily contract visits in the community) I said no I wanna go to bed. She asked how I was getting home I  them booked an uber and she left. 2 minutes later she comes back and says we think that you need a crisis admission in hospital. I said no way my taxi is almost here anyway. She then said well in that case we'd be looking at an assessment under the mental health act. And right as she said that my taxi was here and I left. 

No one has since called or anything I've been home since because I got back and just fell asleep straight away. 
I'm just wondering what is going to happen, I've never been in this situation. Will lthey show up at my home or will they force me back to the hospital. I'm just scared now and feeling really really paranoid. I'm in the UK by the way if that helps"
179,"I don't know if i'm being overly whiny and have a ""can't do attitude"", but does anyone else struggle to retain information? I've mentioned it to the different mental health team i've been under for years and the psychiatrists always say It's probably just anxiety (I don't have an anxiety diagnosis on my care notes though). Family or others I talk to around me say its no big deal, just ""ditsy spells"" or I need to practice memory exercises. I don't know if it's a dissociation thing. My current psychologist says she knows i'm capable of ""higher thought"", so all these comments from people make me wonder if i'm just making a mountain out of a mole hill. When i'm prepping for interviews my employment advisor would usually say things like, ""come on, you've gone over this! Do you not remember going over this at your last interview?"" and my mind truely goes blank or foggy and I want to cry. I feel like such an idiot when I struggle to understand how to apply reflection tools like S>T>A>R to focus and structure my answers. 

I've recently been trying to get into the habit of walking with a mini notepad to keep track of things. I feel a bit uncomfortable because I keep asking people to slow down and repeat things. I don't, i'm probably just overthinking."
180,"i feel so low ,i have nothing to fill my time for the next 3 hours until bed i just feel awful"
181,I had an insane orgasm after months of inability ... just thought id share the good news
182,"Story is like this: My workmate tells me that my bosses puts me in my actual job because they want to realize a very very very big project (good money, travel and all that stuff), thing is nobody told me in the  beggining of my work the real purpose of my function inside my area.  I used to think that I was just fixing fails of an ex-employee (a small job actually), nothing about a very big project. Thing that bugs me is they hid things about that work. I will leave my job, I dont care about money, I'm not able for that, less if they are hiding things from the start. 

:stomp: Just I will finish my week and it's over"
183,"I have a great husband. He spoils me, he's faithful, he tries to please me all day every day. But I can't get the thoughts out my head that's he's interested in other women. I try to combat these thoughts but they don't go away. I was cheated on in my previous marriage and I have ptsd from it. Anyone have tips for fighting these thoughts without asking him for reassurance? Thank you."
184,I always let other people treat me terribly and then I feel guilty. I don't know how to argue with people because I get so upset. It's worse when I begin to cry because of how stressed out I get.
185,"I'm going through a depressive episode, and everything feels so intense. I feel pain, and it's overwhelming. I'm ashamed, but I started to SH again, because it makes the emotional pain stop for a little bit. I know I should be choosing more healthy coping skills, it's just been easy to keep spiraling. I talk to my therapist tomorrow, I'll be bringing this up to her."

187,"Why doesn't anyone take BPD seriously!? (Granted I didn't take it seriously until like 15 years later but whatever) 
No one gets it. Even in these forums there's still a bunch of judgey assholes (not all, but there are plenty) 
People think that I ENJOY feeling like a friggin neurotic maniac.
Like this is friggin GOOD TIMES or something? 

Maybe I'm the only one l idk. & Now for my next trick watch me drink myself into a coma good night ✌️"

189,Hi has anyone been diagnosed with BPD here ? I have a few questions x
190,"I'm starting to think as well as may be my mental health is sometimes to much for my partner but may be she's sometimes to much for my mental health. I sent her the odd think to understand me more and these two links was very insightful, i dont think she read them she did say thank you for helping me understand i will read them. Then a day or so later it was im not pandering to you i will leave if you act paranoid etc i didnt react to it then we were fine later that day she shows me a snap chat video of someone she knows having a party and it look very sexualised which ive said before im not interested in looking and i would never go. so why she showing me again saying party looks so good look half naked women in underwear twerking . i think in a relationship nah stop it single go a head. Im not a prude etc like ive said in another post i have a high drive and quite out there but im not into slapping it all over snap and everyone else like no. well after that we barley talked she said i was a mardy cow that night i went to sleep but was half awake which she said she knew, and i heard her say to her friend online she thinks we have come to an end etc she then got in bed dressed which we sleep naked and i was naked next day she took her snap account off my phone barley spoke but cooked tea and went to bed in clothes again. but says we are off at min doesn't mean she doesn't want or love me. i just dont know what to do for the best not like her past behaviour while together with me has given me reason to overly trust"
191,"I have attempted suicide several times, the latest being just over a year ago after a 3-4 year gap. Overall, I did come to the conclusion that life could be good and wanted to be alive. Even now that I am doubting this, I still fear death and don't want to kill myself - but at the same time I feel quite lonely and I find myself wondering why it all just feels like a huge cruel joke.

I'd say from the age of 9 until very recently, I've been in a state of unhappiness and mental pain to varying degrees. I've lost out on the normal things like making friends at school, even doing some school work since I was in hospital so much, I am in my late 20's now and still have no friends except my boyfriend. It seems so common for people my age to have lead a relatively rich life so far, having a good social circle, having a partner and maybe even a child, having experiences and going out having wild nights and hanging with friends, you know what I mean? I don't have any of that except luckily my partner, for which I am immensely grateful.

Growing up so troubled, I didn't expect to even make it to 20 so I didn't care about planning my life or wishing or dreaming for anything other than death and pain for myself. I thought the idea of having kids was ridiculous because why would I want to pass on my genetics, why would I bring somebody into this world who would end up maybe even more fucked up than I am because of me?

The longer I am alive though, since I am considered recovered from BPD, I have stabilized a lot and realized that I do want things for my life. Not much, but I just want a simple life. I want to be married, I want to buy a house, and I want a baby. That's it. I don't really care if I don't make much money so long as I can make enough to give my baby a good life. Except, I don't really feel like that could ever happen. Maybe the marriage, maybe the house, but not the baby. My heart yearns for it so badly. I just know it could never happen. I know how selfish it would be, to inflict my suffering onto somebody else. I know it's better off for everyone if I just stayed the way I am with no children. My boyfriend has already had a kid with his ex, and we keep in touch. It cuts me up because he has already been able to experience this type of love and wholeness, I am happy for him but at the same time I feel envious, and that makes me feel more unfit to be a mother. I know it's only really me in the way but, how can I ignore the ethics when they're staring me right in the face? And even if I could, why should I? To make me happy? I feel so selfish.

It hurts a lot, I feel as though I have discovered my dream life only to realize that it's only meant to ever be a dream. Maybe I will always feel this emptiness in my heart. I just feel like, I fought so hard to stay alive and get better just to be knocked back down. I feel so exhausted with myself that I can't just let it go and be happy with what I have."
192,"I've gotta stay busy but keep it simple. I'm struggling to do that.

This post might trigger people.




I know other people are going through shit, but I'm struggling to keep my head above water. My closest friend emailed me a suicide note on boxing day and that was such a stressful few day for me. Police were awful on the phone I was triggered so much. I dropped everything to rush to her place. a day in hospital and then I stayed for a few days. I had a breakdown yestarday and I'm still not coping well. Nan died in a serious accident at the beginning of November, but I ciuldn't visit because of hospital covid policy. Had to find out the detail via a local Newpaper first. My family are cagey and terrible communicators - I picked up those habits. 

In the past 2 months alone I failed a job interview, funeral, house clearance, Tier 4, second lockdown, family drama, therapy nearing the it's end, issues with my mental health team, starting training to progress to get back into work, carer responsibilites, friend suicidal emergency, trying to build a support network around myself, trying not to spiral into unsafe coping stratgies.


I've got assessments due next week and i'm so behind. I've asked for extensions since the week before my Nan passed. I feel so trapped in my head. I'm so burnt out and I don't know where to turn. I don't think I solely have EUPD - I hate that the ICD classifies it under that name and my psychiatrist uses that term it's so stigmatising. I hate that they are passing the blame on to the grief. I can't stand my psychiatrist and I can't change him. I wish I had the money to go private, or move. I feel like i'm suffocating under these flashbacks."
193,"Hi my friend blocked me on all social media etc last year around summer time when we had come out of lockdown.
It was my sons 18th and at this point you could have a small gathering on your garden so thats what i did as a big surprise for him got his closest friends with out him knowing round for this small garden party. i told my friend about this and she hit the roof she said i was not a responsible person, that i let her down any way for not meeting her the weekend before but i was ill and people need to take this serious and i was as bad as her other friend that let her down to go shag some bloke she just met. Didnt even let me reply just blocked me and not tried to contact me since. She does have mental health she has bipolar and bpd and was hospitalised twice last year i worry about her because she has children aswell. Shall i try to reach out to her i just want to know shes ok or shall i respect her wishes and leave her be. I really dont know what to do for the best."
194,"Sometimes it just feels like everyone is ignoring, rejecting and abandoning me at the same time. I know this in my head really and its partly to do with me pushing people away. Right now people are busy, some are struggling, some have adapted to current situation. I know this rationally and it's not because of me but it still hurts and I judge myself for it.

Anyone feel similar and how do you manage?

I even pushed away my therapist yesterday."
195,"I have an obsession. It has been part of my life for so long. Well actually, the subject of my obsession isn't in my life anymore. However, despite brief periods of ''normality.'' I always return to my old habits and I can't imagine ever not doing it. Is that part of BPD? Or is that just me?"
196,"This has become something that has increasingly drove me insane.

I am so good at acting unbothered but inside it works me up and distresses me.

i do this thing (almost like a habit) where if they haven’t replied to me on What’s App for a while, I’ll quickly head to Instagram/FB and see if they’re online there.

Im always wondering if they’re talking to someone else etc. Also if I feel the “vibe is off” via messaging, I assume they don’t like me much anymore. Anyone else do this? It’s so hard. Everything about BPD is so bloody hard."
197,"Do you guys think that doctors are too quick to medicate normal negative human emotion states? By this I mean do you think doctors prescribe medication to easily to people who are distressed by experiencing, what should be considered, normal negative emotions. Having bad feelings is a normal human experience and have we as a society normalized medicating that normal experience away?

This isn't to suggest medication can't be useful or even necessary but more so to explore the unbelievably high rates of anti-depressant use in the context of pharmaceutical and advertisement media intervention and its influence on how people interpret and relate to their own human emotions, but other feedback is good to."
198,"My friend is 18 and wants to get pregnant. We just figured out she has BPD. It makes sense because she always didn't really act like me, someone who doesnt have BPD. She works a part time job at a store, doesnt even have a boyfriend and is constantly trying to talk to every boy she sees. I'm not shaming her for this as this most defiantly has something to do with her illness. She has a ED that constantly comes back and im scared for her. I don't think shes mentally stable to have a kid. She vapes and smokes weed while she's trying too. She said ""having a baby will make me happy again"". Sadly, I dont think this is true and I think she's trying to convince herself that it is true. I dont have BPD but I would really love some feedback on what I should do for her. I dont want her to abuse her children or end up on the wrong path. We're kids, we shouldnt be having kids ourselves. She loves partying and going out every night so I dont know why she would want that to change. It also doesn't help that her ex is encouraging her to have a baby with him bc they think they'll get back together when really, they're very toxic to each other. I hope I dont offend anyone here who has BPD since I dont know how it is to have that illness. I just want her to understand that this isnt okay."
199,"hi! so recently i've just been wondering if this is a bpd thing or... if i'm just a dick. basically, i borderline hate a select few of my fps interests. not all of them, but the ones he's super into. the couple and only examples i have of this is the character tae hanazono from bandori and... bunnies. that makes me look awful i'm sure and as much as i adore them (bunnies) i can't stand to think of him putting his undivided attention on something other than me. it makes me feel as if he now hates me and wants something new to get invested in (as he talks about them constantly), and really really jealous. so i was wondering, is this just me being a dick or does anyone else with bpd experience this too?"
200,"I'm really struggling.  I can't let go of the past and I keep thinking about the ways I messed up.  The things I said and did. The people I hurt.  And just the way I feel.  It's like this constant sense of discomfort and tightness and heaviness in chest and throat.  It's been like this for a few days.  Not sure if it's biological or purely mental.  I also worry about my job.  Interacting with people is exhausting for me.  I don't know how to feel, be or act.  I worry about what I may have said or done, and how people will perceive me and then I ponder on these thoughts for days until the next interaction.  I was diagnosed as borderline by my previous therapist (who I saw for ~2 years), but my new therapist (~1 year) thinks I'm bipolar even though I only had what my new therapist suspects was likely a manic episode (based on information she drew from me) about 15 years ago.

I've read tons of books and really feel that I am borderline, even though I don't self harm or lose my temper easily.  I just always think people don't like me.  I have trust issues.  I have black and white thinking with very little grey.  At times I spent money impulsively and took financial risks that hurt me.  I am quiet and shy and don't like attention on me.  So I keep asking my therapist what I am, but she says it's better to focus on the symptoms and treatment instead of diagnosis.  The label is less important."
201,"When my dad died when I was 8 my whole life changed but I carried on regardless. My mum was caught up with issues that were going on with my sister and I got on with life or so I thought. I now realise looking back instead of going to my immediate family for validation I looked to others, teachers, friends. I craved their attention and I needed to know they still liked me. I still do this 37 years later and wonder if I am caught in a trap that I cant get out of. I am totally broken if people forget my birthday for example and when I say I'm broken I cant get out of bed due to crippling anxiety. I'm not affected by my immediate family, my husband, my children, my mum, my sister but in my social circle, work colleagues it causes me great emotional distress."
202,?
203,The last point is so accurate for me-pd 😂
204,"One of the symptoms of bpd that I struggle with the most is impulsive, self-destructive behaviors. I tend to refer to them as addictions, because I will often obsess over these behaviors. I've noticed that I tend to cycle through these addictions. For a while I'll be addicted to something, say alcohol or sugar, and I obsess over it and can't get enough. Then after a period of time, I move on to something else, and I'm ok with whatever I was obsessed with. I've experienced this with all kinds of things. Drugs and alcohol for sure, but food and people have also been subjects of obsession. Has anyone else experienced this? Any suggestions for coping with it?"
205,"So this is my first time posting in one of these or ever really talking to others with BPD. I was diagnosed when I was 13 and in a mental hospital. Honestly I really never took it seriously. Like I knew that I had it but thought that it would just go away on its own like your student loans and criminal record . I thought it didn't really affect me much because I pretty much had everything else in my life super in order for my age. I had a really good paying job that turned into a career over the years, my own apartment, I put myself through some college and was financially independent since I was 18. I thought that those things met the criteria for being a normal fully functional member of society and that clearly there was a misdiagnosis at the mental hospital years before because how could I have accomplished so much with a disorder? I thought that surely I had been cured....
Fast forward and now I am almost 30 years old, got fired from my job of 7 years that I had worked so hard to achieve the position I was in. Still positive, I then got hired at my dream career...then got fired from that one too. I lost everything I had along with my dignity and mental stability, moved back with my mom and adopted 6 cats because of what was apparently NOT a misdiagnosis 15 years ago, and I literally had no idea that any of the chaos that constantly surrounded me had anything to do with BPD until like last week. 
While I have acknowledged having BPD and have brought it up casually over the years to a few trusted friends or exes, who also did not seem to think that it was a big deal either, despite all of them having experience my extreme rage towards them, emotional ransom, ""I will never speak to you again"" threats, suicide threats, constantly needing to have their attention and then completely going ghost on them for days or sometimes weeks at a time and sometimes even slightly physical attacks.. No one really ever felt comfortable confronting me about anything in fear of the backlash they would receive from me. Needless to say I never heard from these people ever again, exceptions being my childhood best friend (who still likes to keep a healthy distance from me) and my current boyfriend who is mostly responsible for the realization that I AM in fact the toxic one in this relationship (well, mostly me) Toxic or not, he really did push me to take this seriously. He would bring it up and I would perceive that as a narcissistic manipulation tactic, and then retaliated by doing just about everything that the stereotypical person with BPD would do....break up with him, kick him out of the apartment and threaten to call the cops and then chase him down 3 flights of stairs in broad daylight with no shoes on while shouting obscenities and accusations of deceit and betrayal at him for leaving me even though I terrorized him for 6 hours straight and forced him to leave. This would happen at least twice a week (usually more) every week almost 3 years with some variation each time until I quit drinking about a year ago ('Congratulations' will not necessary as I un-quit last month) I was always a little overdramatic with other exes and friends but this one really hit me right in the triggers at least once a day. But he stayed by my side (so far) and despite all of this along with me not only being completely in denial and unaware that this was not normal behavior of all sophisticated members of society, but also telling him that HE was the crazy one for thinking that this COMPLETELY RATIONAL BEHAVIOR of mine had ANYTHING to do with my questionable BPD diagnosis (which had clearly ran it's course and cured all by itself years ago) and NOTHING to do with being all his fault for whatever reason...

Moral of the story is that I have never gotten help before, and I can just see myself getting worse and worse and I don't want to be this way anymore. It feels like I just woke up from a 15 year-long dream that I had everything in the world at my fingertips and sabotaged every single bit of it and feeling 100% justified for it every time and just wondered how the world could be so cruel to perfect little me.... only to wake up to find that everything I have ever known and believed about MYSELF have actually been all wrong and now I have a bunch of people to apologize to. 

Please tell me I am not the only one this upside down... and how do I fix this? Like really really (cannot afford formal therapy BUT will be joining a support group) I don't really want to take medicine (have been on anti-depressants twice and didn't care for them)
What is the real life cure for this because I really don't want to mess anything else up or push anyone else away.."
206,"My boyfriend has depression. I don't know if it because of it but sometimes he will ignore me. he doesn't seem to know how to say no so if he doesn't want to do something I normally get no reply. Anyway we were talking on Tuesday and he said ""you will probably be round Friday or Saturday"" in relation to something we wanted to watch. So I said Saturday as I was busy Friday. 

I messaged him at 7:30 last night asking if I should go round at 3 but got no reply. Then messaged goodnight. This morning he asked how I was and I replied with ""I'm good, should I come round later when I'm done with my family"" as we were having lunch for my grans birthday. That was at 11:30. It got to 4 and I had no reply. He lives with his grandparents so I messaged his gran thinking maybe he was asleep as sometimes he sleeps all day. She said he has been out practicing his driving with his granddad but was now upstairs but it should be ok for me to come round. So I messaged him and said I would be around at 4:30 and he replies with ""ah okay thought you could come round tomorrow"" So at this point I'm done and tell him ok ill just be round tomorrow at 2. That was two hours ago and I haven't heard from him since. I keep thinking He doesn't want me to come round because he is with another girl tonight. I know there are other reasons for it but I can't get the thought out my head. People I'm talking to about this keep saying ""he sounds like he is cheating"" or ""sounds like hes not into you"" so of course that isn't helping. This is something I have obsessed about our whole relationship too."
207,"Hi everyone, recently diagnosed <20 year old college student here. 

Wondering about people's experience with mental pain and trying to function. When I first read about mental pain, I was like I don't have that- then I noticed it. When I am trying to do something I will get waves of what feels like a mix between anxiety and depression, independent from any triggers. It's like how I feel before a panic attack (which I do have a history of but I manage). I will often have visceral reactions depending on intensity: from scrunching up my eyes and getting ticks even as I am trying to pretend nothing is happening (to more extreme reactions). I believe this is what people refer to as mental pain, but I cannot find enough information to know for sure. 

I guess you could say I was ""high functioning,"" for years. Emphasis on the was. Sure, I have always been a mess privately but I also have worked hard to get into my dream college program, been employed and productive for my sober hours. 

Days before diagnosis I crashed hard, got help. Having a can-do attitude, I was like oh ok this is why my life is spiraling and always out of control makes sense, lets get better. Easier said than done. I feel like acknowledging all my harmful thought patterns are in my control, and not just a part of life for everyone, makes it way harder to ignore it and function like I used to. Its like I can't pretend its just background noise because I'm trying to deescalate my emotions before I react: so I have to acknowledge it, and the impacts it has on me. This seemingly random waves of mental pain on top of the added work I am doing with my reactivity and inner monologue is too much. I'm in pain trying to work, slightly lessened when I am not doing my work, but then I feel anxious and horrible because the one thing that was good in my life I can't do. 

At the same time I feel horrible about asking for accommodations because I was functioning before my recent crash and burn. I've always bounced back in a few days, but not this time. I am worried I am just using the diagnosis as an excuse to not function because I am mirroring others with BPD. Is this mental pain thing something I am imagining or do others experience this? I think I've always experienced it but I don't know if I just made that up after thinking about it. 

This was a ramble because I am still trying to get a sense of what is happening. I want to hear from you."
208,My son has PTSD  but refuses to believe it even when i get the burnt of his anger.
209,"Hello, I'm 18F. I was diagnosed BPD

I'm really tired for having this BPD. Sometimes I feel confident but on the next day I feel empty. And why I always feel scared that my bf would leave me even he already prove that he's not gonna leave me even I told him that I have BPD. I really hate my head. I can't go to the doctor anymore because of financial issues and my parent never care about mental health, they just think that mental issues arent exist. I really pushed everyone away but I dont want to be alone. I pushed them but I also blame them if they leave me. Like... What is wrong with me? And I really cant control my anger, even in front of my parent and still... they dont believe mental issues things. I feel useless and I really hate myself why am i being like this? I stopped self-harm since my left hand is full of scars, like i have no more place. Please help me, what methods that I can do to control my anger, stop overthink everything, stop being insecure. I cant go to the doctor because I dont have money. Just give me methods to calm myself everytime my stupid ass brain trying to kill me."
210,"soo today my favorite Person for 3 years said she needs a break. (ofc im going to respect that. i mean im probably a big burden for her so)
but i dont really know how to deal with that situation.  i cant see my therapist because of covid so i have noone to talk to about and its like the first time this happened to me.
so ýeah, i kinda need advice on what to do:/

edit: i know she said its only a break but im scared shes gonna leave me. i feel like i lost a part of my identity. i cant explain it- sorry"
211,"There’s no cure yet the meds calm me for only so long, I’m not sure if it’s helping or subsiding what I feel a normal emotion, should I really be doing that to my own mind and letting my emotions be filled out because people think it’s ‘not normal’ or it’s ’too much’ ??"
212,"My boyfriend pulled me up on the way I act this morning - he said he feels like he can't joke with me anymore because I ""take it too seriously"" and then make things awkward and it's hard to come back from. In all honesty, I don't notice doing it and in the past we've joked a lot and it's been fine. The only thing I have noticed is that I find it very difficult to know lately, when he is joking or not. Times I have tried joking with him he is dead serious and gets very angry with me for trying to joke, and then when he is joking I think he is being serious so try to treat it as such.

For example, one day he accidentally dropped his meal and it went all over the floor. He was cussing and trying to clean it up, so I offered him my meal and said I will clean it up. He said no, and I said are you sure, I don't mind and then you can have a meal and he got super angry at me over it and said I need to understand that no means no. Then this morning, on the other hand, we were laughing at a picture I sent him and then afterwards I sorta went hehhe at another picture I was about to send him and he said to stop going hehehe, so I said I am sorry, am I annoying you? And that's when he told me that I need to stop taking everything seriously and that I say I make things awkward and there is truth in that because I make situations awkward and then it's hard to come back from since the other person always has to work hard to make things happy again. It just didn't sound like he was joking so I assumed he meant this seriously and wanted me to stop, and I know that I am awkward and annoying so I just wanted to confirm so I don't repeat the behavior again.

Ironically, I feel a bit like I am walking on eggshells with him. Which is to say, I really can't tell if he is joking or not a lot of the time as he is a jokey person, but also very good at keeping a straight face and has quite explosive anger that comes on quickly.

I also recognize though, that things haven't been the best as he has been considering leaving me because of personal reasons, not because of our relationship, but I feel like I need to be the best or else he will leave me. I know that's just my BPD trying to avoid abandonment, but it's hard to act normal with that looming over me and it feels like I can't do anything to really know what he will decide in the end. I've even been trying to figure out what I would do if he left because I thought we were going to be together for a long time, he'd even been hinting at marriage for us. I don't really think I could go through with suicide after all the failed attempts I have made in the past but I thought maybe it's best if I moved towns and had some time to myself as I have no friends and am not close to most of my family.

Sorry this turned dark. I just have nobody else to talk to"
213,"Hello. Hope this message finds you well.

I seemed to have taken a turn for the worse again lately and that is made even worse, because I feel disappointed in going backwards.

Can medication stop working?
Is there always a ''trigger'' for our state of mind? 

How do you deal with relapses?"
214,"Has anyone had any any positive experiences with this? My therapist suggested it for me and my mother who is absolutely adamant she did nothing wrong during my childhood and denies everything wrong she did. I'm terrified because of how manipulative my mam can be, if anyone stands against her she isolates the whole family from them"
215,"I was just wondering if it just me or is anyone else like this.
Basically i have a really high sex drive any way but i have noticed i want sex even more when im having an episode. Im thinking is it because of the hormones that get realised."
216,"How?

Did anyone actually ever succeed in this?

Was it DBT techniques that helped you? What helped you overcome the extreme emotion?"
217,"Hello!

I just found this forum and wanted to get some perspective.

I think I have BPD? I have an appt next month and the office specializes in DBT, which I think will be helpful. 

I've just noticed recently how intense some of my relationships are. Friend and romantic alike. I am engaged and this is the healthiest relationship I've ever had. I can be very critical over small things but I try to monitor how nit picky I can be. 

As far as friends, I've had ""falling outs"" with a few friends over my adult life and it's gotten to this point where I am wondering if it IS their fault or my inability to take responsibility? 

I switch jobs relatively often. The longest I've worked anywhere is a year and a half and am constantly doubting my career choices and abilities..

My moods change a lot too. I've always been a pretty irritable person. I've learned to manage it better with monitoring alcohol use, meditation, journaling, etc. As of late I am easily ""triggered"" and am wondering why I am constantly in a tiff with someone. The biggest flags for me are my relationships and job stability. I used to be pretty impulsive; poor spending habits, promiscuous, fighting, heavy drinking... but I think SOME of that was early 20s shenanigans. 

I think my dad has some sort of personality disorder and I've wondered if my mom does too (siblings also feel this way, so I'm not imagining it). So, it's possible to have inherited some sort of disorder, yeah? OR, have my parents' issues and my childhood trauma created some sort of weird anxiety/self perception thing within me? Both? Covid stress contributing to things?

If I do have BPD at least it will help explain some of my behavior but I also know there's a lot of stigma around it. My mom likes to weaponize people's mental health status as a way to delegitimize their experiences...

Bleh. 

Thank you <3"
218,"I am trying really hard to do okay. Coping has never been an easy thing for me to do. Since Sunday I have spent nearly 15 hours of the day asleep. Last night I attended a Codependents Anonymous meeting for the first time and it was informational, not quite inspiring, I couldn't quite relate to anyone in there and the topic was confusing. I will try some more this week. Today I finally got around to doing something for myself that I had been putting off for quite some time now, it was cool getting out of the house for a bit but I can't say I feel much sense of accomplishment. Tomorrow is my last day off from work so I will try again if I can find the energy. Right now I am unable to focus on the things that I need to get done at home and am angry at everyone, including my cat for wandering outside. I am now punishing him by making him wait in the cold for my forgiveness (okay I feel horrible now I will let him back inside) I got some great news today I will be having a niece, I don't think I am able to feel as much about this as I should, or normally would. Drugs are not getting me high and alcohol is not getting me drunk. That's it I think I have lost my ability to feel anything except for frequent crying spells that only last one minute and then I stare off into space like nothing happened. I've lost my marbles or something?"
219,"Over the last few days I've been having an episode. So I thought I would share. Maybe help others.
The tiredness is unreal, I feel as if I cant keep my eyes open, my face feels tight like if I smile it will crack.
My head hurts so bad, its like a headache that will never go, when I think about it, its like a black cloud, its thick like treacle, its like a dead weight on my head and it won't go, I take tablets hoping the pain will lesson but it never does, how can it? The pain is mental rather then physical, its not going. So ill lay in bed (yes ill lay in bed) until it passes. Going out on walks etc doesn't always work, and I may bump into people and I dont want that for now. 
I just need to ride it out. Ride it out until it goes.
Anyone else have this?"
220,"I just want some normalcy, but for me that means taking him back (or begging), but it never lasts long. I also want to be able to heal and respect myself but I am not really sure what that would mean either. My mind is back and forth on a minute to minute basis and because my partner was so overbearing I am too afraid to make any decision, its like I don't have a mind of my own anymore and its all about what I think he wants me to do, even though I am now blocked on everything for the billionth time.  Voices are saying ""*67 call his ass again"" ""he blocks you because he just wants more attention"" rational part of me says ""just chill, focus on yourself"" neurotic part of me doesn't even know what myself is anymore can someone ask my boyfriend who I am because I feel like he has the right answer idk.

I was reading some of the posts in this thread the other day and saw one that mentioned lashing out at work. I guess I thought I would never get this bad but today my boss found me crying in a corner, which later resulted into an awkward intervention that I did not ask for. How dare my boss accuse me of being on drugs when I am barely even high!?

This post has perhaps trailed off from the title, this is because I really don't even know where to begin in discussing this love story straight out of a Disney movie, has anyone or is anyone with BPD currently going through something like this or am I the only one this fortunate?"
221,"I'm looking for some advice here. I've developed an attachment to one of my coworkers. He's one of my FP, if anyone here uses that term (I only recently learned it). All I'm looking for out of this is a platonic friendship, nothing romantic or sexual. Things have been a little rough, ups and downs, I've done some splitting, etc. I don't believe that he is interested in the level of friendship I want. My reasons for this belief, I think, are irrelevant, but I can go into detail if needed. 

What I'm looking for help with is how to cope with this attachment knowing that I'm not getting what I want in return. I've found myself in similar situations in the past. At those times, all that seemed to help was cutting the person off completely. But, in this situation, that's not really feasible. What else can I do? I basically have to interact with this coworker every day."

224,"I know that BPD is not an excuse, but I need to know if anyone else has experienced this or even had thoughts of this. A while ago I hurt someone I really love (my favorite person and my now fiance) physically a few times. This was during a relatively short period of really really dramatic and emotional events between me and them where both of us were at our lowest mentally. I got hurt physically as well but it wasn't as bad. I won't go into detail for the sake of privacy, but I got threatened with losing them (not a breakup) and my brain just.. took over. I regret this and feel guilty for it every day, even though they have told me numerous times that they understand why it happened and that it wouldn't happen again. Should I even be risking hurting them again, even though I'm sure it wouldn't happen? I'm terrified to lose them."
225,"I have a diagnosis of bipolar 2 disorder, but I am not so sure of that. My mood can change from depression to anger to sadness to feeling okay again within a day. I do not get manic, at least I don't think so. I do tend to get a little paranoid/psychotic when under stress and I also dissociate when I am very stressed.
I have other BPD traits as well. I am very sensitive to rejection, I have a very negative self image (kind of hate myself, really), I feel empty (bored) a lot of the time, and in the past I have been suicidal and I self harmed. I am also convinced that my boyfriend will leave me. It is not really a fear of abandonment, it is more that I am convinced that he will be sick of me some day, like every other man has in the past. I am a black and white thinker when I am stressed or triggered; I will split on people, especially on my boyfriend. When we argue or when he does something I don't like, I will hate him and want to break up with him.
I do not really have a pattern of instable relationships though, I've had some pretty long relationships. I have been with my boyfriend for seven years now.
The thing that makes me doubt a bpd diagnosis though is that I am usually not that impulsive or self destructive (short from the SH in the past). I have never had any addictions.

So yeah I don't really know why I wrote all this, I guess I just wanted to share and see what you guys think.

Oh and I read about The Quiet Borderline, that really sounds a lot like me...

Thanks so much for reading."
226,"Hi, Im new here and I joined specifically because I hope talking will help. I am actively suicidal. I have BPD and chronic suicidal ideation, But this isn't just my normal passing thoughts. Im getting back to the point where I am not okay, and almost to the point that I  don't know if I can be safe. The other day, I took almost my life.- I say because I was just so tired and wanted to sleep, but part of me doesn't know if that fully true or not. If it was an impulse choice just to see if it would work. I know I need help but I cant get it. The crisis team, and hospital in my area refuse to help me- and I have no doctors, or therapist. I have a CMHA (Canadian mental health association) worker, but he's just a case worker and doesn't provide crisis intervention. What am I supposed to do? I need someone to be straight up and tell me if its worth trying or not- I need someone to tell me what to do and no one can do that and the people who are trying dont understand the danger id be putting myself in if i take there advice by going to the hospital anyway or by calling the cops on myself. please help. 

tldr: I need advice because hospital and crisis wont help me, and I have no other supports. Actively on the verge of crisis. hospital and police are dangerous for me."

228,I am doing an online DBT therapy course with the NHS and its rubbish. Staring at a screen watching an out of sync video with someone I've never met in real life. No human contact no connection. It's cold empty and lacks any kind of genuine care in real life. As for the group sessions which are supposed.to build your confidence and help you interact with people ... wheres the interaction. I'm interacting with a computer and a wifi signal which.gives me headaches and sends my tinnitus through the roof. This way of dealing with mental health issues is so wrong on many levels it should be stopped. Still not to worry...my gp will call me tomorrow between 8am-1pm on the phone and make decisions about my mental health without even seeing me. Of course it's not my own gp who prescribed the medication or put in place treatment for me...its any random gp who is available that I've never even met before. Thanks NHS you're so thoughtful and caring...keep up the good work 👎👎
229,"I thought I was getting better...but I am not. I am just so ready to give up. I know how to do all the right things, but I cannot make the fear of abandonment stop and it is destroying my life.

I lost someone who meant a lot to me today. I lost the friendship because I am not doing well and they are not doing well either and it's too much for both of us.

I lost everyone. I was first abandoned at a young age and since then it just keeps happening over and over again to the point of making me sick.

I know it's because I get clingy and paranoid and lash out when I don't feel loved...but I don't know how to make it stop, even after thousands of dollars and years of therapy.

Fuck this. I wish I was never born...

I am so angry.

230,"Hi everyone. I posted a regular introduction, but wanted to post here too since I'll probably spend quite a bit of time here. I've dealt with depression and anxiety for years, but was just recently diagnosed with bpd. There's no one in my life who understands it, other than my therapist. I'm hoping to find some people here to talk with about related issues.

I find, especially recently, I'm struggling most with attachments and emotional variances. I started another depressive episode recently and was briefly suicidal over it, because of fears of going back down that dark path. I'm also dealing with an attachment to a coworker, where I've probably been splitting."
231,"Did anybody watch ""Black Widow"", on ""24 Hours in Police Custody"" a few days ago, a two part programme, showing a woman called Victoria Breeden trying to get men to murder her ex husband. It is available to stream on All 4 if you are interested.
It said she might be suffering some syndrome, did not mention Borderline Personality Disorder/ Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, but I actually thought it was quite likely to be BPD/EUPD also.
Did anyone else think Victoria Breeden has BPD/EUPD?"
232,"Hi there,

I am new to the forum, I've never posted on anything before so I'm a bit nervous but I'm hoping for some support and options. My boyfriend is currently playing a video game which has options to choose to have sex with another character and also options to have them as your girlfriend both of which he's chosen to do. Ive managed to stay relatively calm but inside I feel like he's cheating on me :( Im trying to tell myself it's just a game and these characters are not real, I get that, but I can't shift the feeling of jealousy and fear that him doing this is is cheating on me. Just for some background he's very supportive of my bpd symptoms and does not play the game for hours on end, it's usually when I say I'm off to do something else, he will then hop on but yeah when he told me about his character having sex with others, even tho I know it's just a character, it's still him playing it and choosing the option. I really don't want to split over this but I can feel it coming :( Thanks for reading 🙏"

I jump to conclusions and sometimes once the truth has been shown im like wow i was convinced i was right. Sometimes i feel like im crazy because i believe my reality that was so wrong.

The only little humans that have not affected my BPD is my child they are my saviours. I know my GF cant cope sometimes and doesnt fully know how to understand me i have said when i know im having an episode because ill have one day or half a day where im hyper excited about nothing. Which when im been normal well not having an episode im pretty goofy anyway but thats extra on them days but then ill suddenly crash. I feel bad she cant cope and i dont know what i can do to help as i explained to her i cant help how i am and i cope they way i know how withdraw and ride it out.

235,"Yeah, I reached that 'everything feels pointless' point. It's so crap. 

And I can't un-think it.

Who has advice/ wants to share? What is it that makes life purposeful?

I can remember when younger I used to completely tie up my self worth in my academics, but somehow I never did anything with that. My so called smartness never came to anything. At all. Now I just sit here thinking, what the hell am I doing here? Sitting alone in a tiny box flat doesn't help. 

I've lost my IRL friends, we've become so divergent; the way I think doesn't fit with them anymore, probably because I'm changing, and that's positive because when you don't fit with the people from the past, and you're suddenly faced with yourself, you grow. I honestly have no IRL person I can turn to except my brother, but I can only have him there 10% of the time. I have my therapist there 2% of the time. So the rest of the time, here I am, it's just me. And I'm bloody terrified to be with myself, do anything for myself, which is why I'm writing on here.

The thing is, it feels like there's no point to myself. I can literally motivate myself to the most minimal things for myself.
I have been making job applications, but around that, I'm thinking literally what the hell am I doing on planet earth, and that I'd wish I'd never been born. Human connection is rare... I don't feel it. I feel like I'm distanced far away some place. Like an alien on planet earth. 

This pain is real and I don't know how I'm going to recover. Just feels like everything's so meaningless."

I’m a newbie here, hello to you all 😄

I have just been diagnosed, after wondering what was wrong with me for 40 years, with Emotional dysregulation, recurrent depression and co morbid anxiety. When the psychiatrist gave me my diagnosis he asked if I had any questions and I said no (no idea where my head was at!)
 I was just wondering if emotional dysregulation is the same as BPD? I have looked at the criteria for the BPD diagnosis, and it basically explains my life! Is this a new term for BPD?
 
Thanks! 😃"
239,"Even though it hasnt been confirmed, we are sure my wife has BPD. Lockdown 1 was awful as my wife started drinking heavily, hiding bottles etc...on one occasion she was arrested.

When she drinks she becomes extremely aggressive and speaks bizarrely saying things like she hates me and suicidal talk.

Reflecting back I believe she has always had a ""mild"" drinking problem..her mum is an alcoholic and chuldhood was turbulent. 

She had breast cancer in 2015 and after making a recovery this is where our marriage really struggled..since Chemotherapy it feels to me like her brain doesnt work correctly.  She doesn't think things through, cant regulate emotions, becomes impulsive, narcissistic, angry and defensive. 

We have two children aged 13 and 8 and social work/doctors involvement and I hope some support through psychiatric support and DBT.

Our marriage is pretty much over, I am exhausted from trying to help, being pushed away and ""hated""...i stay at the moment to support the children and some days can be fantastic..which confuses me anymore.  I have read a lot about BPD to gain understanding and I am also a therapist..this is both a blessing and curse i feel! Its good to have the self awareness and understanding but my natural deeply grained empathy struggles with getting through the day..espesh in lockdown. Her mood can change at the click of fingers....like xmas eve..i reasonably asked her not to go out at 1020pm that night coz kids get triggered etc and to try and work through the intensify of her feelings at home....she became highly excited, aggressive and wrote down funeral plans! Ive reported it to social workers..the next day she was lovely again. I would always support her ""in sickness and in health "" but feel need to get out..she doesn't want my help, in denial of her own issues;  stonewalls me...i think she feels a bit ""threatened "" by my counselling knowledge....not that I try to be one with her at home...not at all....but i cant help try to make suggestions at times. 


She thinks we better as friends, no intimacy in two years or sharing a bed..shes probably right but i worry about the impulsive behaviour...and of course the kids.  There is also the dual disgnosis of alcohol and bpd issues and how they feed each other.  I guess we just gotta wait till the medical intervention....again...i am more confident this time after a long chat with het GP.

But i feel numb, lost, on edge a lot.start my own therapy on the 21st which I am sure will help.  Not sure what looking for here..just support and shared stories i guess."

241,At 15 I was diagnosed with being bipolar.  And that diagnoses never made any sense to me. I wasn't depressed for weeks at a time. I just didn't want to leave my room. I told the psychologist my moods like a light switch. I tired every medication known to man and nothing ever worked. 3 years ago my substance abuse counselor ask me to read about BPD. I cried uncontrollably because I had finally found what my illness was. Today I am 36. And I struggle more then ever with every aspect of my life. I want to be normal. I dont want to feel worthless.  I dont want to keep pushing everyone out of my life. My fiance  which I try to push away every other day and my mom are the only ones I have left. I feel so alone in this world that I picture killing myself daily. I've tried on 6 occasions but always wake up. I dont want to be me anymore. And feel like the world is better off with me gone. Does that feeling ever go away!!!!!
242,"im silent
im scareaming"
243,"Does anyone else with bpd feel like they lack an “anchor” to reality? I always feel like my experience of the world changes depending on my mood, like theirs nothing keeping me grounded"
244,"Hi guys,
I've been quiet this past year or two had a lot going on but it's all been relatively positive.
I moved out in 2019 into a supported accommodation and had a few issues there but I got myself sorted and moved into my own flat in September 2020. It's been brilliant but I've found myself slipping into old habits.

I'm back to hiding things from family and services. I'm taking regular overdoses (only now I hardly attend accident and emergency) I'm not so much self-harm but I do have the urges a lot. I recently started some therapy work and am only on my 3rd session but I see her weekly on Ms team's. She's well aware I take small overdoses and she's also well aware of my daily suicidal ideations.

One thing I've been hiding and the reason I'm writing this. Long story short im hardly eating. At first it was because of my stomach, been diagnosed with stomach ulcers and erosive gastritis, I was in pain when I ate too much so I made my meals smaller. Then it turned into one meal a day and now well I make my meal and well  I'm barely eating any of it. I made some chips up earlier and in 2 hours I've eaten like 5 chips.... It worries me that this may be getting worse. But its not like I'm counting calories or anything its just I don't have an appetite. Should I mention it to someone or just wait for it to get better???"
245,"Ive noticed that are something inside me that try to stops me. My hobbies, little joy, thougts... etc. I feel in my heart"
246,"Hi guys. This is my first post here and I just really need to talk/express how I feel really. I am wondering if anyone here can relate to my experiences or elements of it. I’ve had a really hard year and I feel completely changed because of it.

I’ll try and keep this as short as possible but it is quite a long and complicated story. However here goes.

Last April someone contacted me via Instagram and we got talking, they happened to see a live stream I did and agreed with things I were saying etc. Cutting a long story short we became quite good friends (online) and he would begin messaging me almost daily.

We slowly were developing a more flirtatious nature toward each other so although we were friends, this added something different to the mix. As time went on, and he would message me more frequently (and still does) I became very attached. I would say we are both very attached to each other.

Because of the pandemic and the distance between us it has not been easy to meet. This caused me great distress by around August/Sept of last year because I had all these intense feelings and emotions for someone but had never met them and I just couldn’t work out why I was feeling so hurt and sad. I have cried so much, it’s certainly been a process.

The more we got to know each other the more I knew about his past, I became very jealous of his previous partners and even now am struggling with retroactive jealousy.

There is so much to this story but at present, I am still as attached and obsessed as ever. I physically depend on their text messages and words they say to me as almost reassurance that everything is okay and he still “likes me”.

We are planning to meet this year but for some reason I seem to think this won’t happen. Like he won’t turn up or it’ll never come to anything.

I am in absolute mental torture and it’s not his fault. He can be a little hot and cold sometimes but we message all day every day. I really care for him and it’s a strange relationship I guess because of how it’s panned out over this last year.

I can literally be laying on my bed crying feeling like he doesn’t want me anymore and then he’ll message and I am back to “normal” again. It’s extremely hard to live like this.

the truth is, both of us are rather lonely and for me I cannot even imagine a future without this connection. It’s warped and weird but it is what it is. I am just so scared for the future. I feel so vulnerable"
247,"Haven't felt properly depressed for a solid two weeks, then all of a sudden this week it hit.
I've taken my anti depressant, had a shower, been for a walk, all the stuff that's meant to help.
Sad truth is I feel very alone I wish I had a partner and I wish all those times people came onto me I had been more forthcoming because if I had, now I wouldn't be in this lonely mess. I do it to myself. I really do. By shutting people out and never trusting anyone to date me, I make my life worse. But there's reasons why I don't trust to date.
I just thought I would write on here because I'm living in a flat on my own and I can't go to work, I can't see anyone. It all feels so desperately lonely. I wish I had one person to make me feel less alone, I have friends on this forum and also in real life, but I can't feel anything right now. All I can feel is my own purposelessness and I keep thinking about death.
Sorry to be so heavy. I am just feeling this way. Nothing is really working to snap me out of it."
248,"All my life I was adamant I wouldn't have kids because I was always frightened of sex and thought it to be the most disgusting thing ever, and was very afraid of childbirth because of my hypochondriac mother making out like it's the absolute most hideous and painful experience to endure. Plus most adults love to throw around the whole ""wait until you have kids then you'll know all about it"" attitude - so I figured it's obviously tough work and not worth all the pain and suffering.

As I got older, ethics also became a strong reason for me too. I figured, I am riddled with mental health issues and I know that they can be passed on genetically. I didn't want to bring another person to this earth to suffer through what I have had to. Along with this, I can see the world turning to shit slowly because of things like global warming and wondered if it was right of me to bring somebody into a world that may not be very nice to live in by the time they are old enough to enjoy it.

Of course, I am older now (nearly 24) and I am actually doing fine, mentally I am stable and well, I am rational and don't give in to my emotions easily, and I just feel ready. I can't explain it but it's like my body wanted me to be mentally sound before even thinking about having kids seriously. Now that I am doing better, I want to live a good, full life and I don't honestly want much but two things: I want to buy a house and I want a baby. My boyfriend said a few months ago that he would be happy to have a baby with me at some point so I am guessing that's still the case since we haven't spoken of it since, but he is 20 years older than me and I just feel as though I am pushing my luck as it is. I can't get over the hurdle of ethics, either.

I know that BPD doesn't necessarily always get passed on, and I feel certain I am stable enough to not give the type of childhood where it would be brought out in a child. I also know that I can handle strong emotions, and feel comfortable helping my child deal with theirs especially if they are very sensitive like me so that they can manage themselves healthily. That isn't the problem so much. Lately, ever since covid, it honestly feels like the world is heading in a bad direction - I know that people have made it through much worse (such as WWII) and come out the other end, but I feel selfish wanting to bring a child into a world like this that was already difficult to navigate pre-covid, just because I want a family. I don't know how to describe it but I just feel like it's not something that could ever happen for me no matter how badly I want it.

Has anyone else had to deal with this realization that having kids isn't a good idea? How did you cope with it? I have tried looking online but I only get results for people who are infertile unfortunately, which is a whole different problem and I can't compare myself to."
249,"My parents were both sociopathic, emotionally and physically abusive people. I'm an Asian and no details but where I am you need a lot of money to get help for suicide and self harm. I've been self-harming and having masochistic thoughts since I was a kid like probably five. I'd get into my parents medicine cabinet or my grandparents who were pretty lax, they were so loving but just not that literate. The only people who was a care giver who never abused me.

I don't know if this is weird but I haven't talked to anyone who's open about sexual impulsive behavior and I've had it since I was a kid too. Self-harming and touching myself was so arousing even when I couldn't actually come. Just thinking about it my anxiety is so bad I'm shivering. But I have no one and I just really need to get this stuff out of my system.

Anyway I would do any thing that gave me an adrenaline rush. I jumped off shit, I rode my bike on the dangerous roads I hung out with junkies and got molested by this total trash when I was just 12 and I still remember the way it felt and it's disgusting but instead of staying away from men I just got even more involved with total strangers. Naturally got roofied once but instead of stopping I just started doing drugs pretty much anything someone would give me because I was not rich.

I kept trying to make my mom give a shit even though I gave up on my dad long ago but in a way my mom's worse because shes not only super manipulative but also is so IGNORANT she doesn't know what to do about anything and doesn't even realize she needs therapy and help. Doesn't admit and just gaslights me at least my dad used to apologize. She won't even do that.

The truth is after the way men were I was also into women. In love with my best friend and she just got hitched and became the typical trophy wife and I just now realized that she was just keeping me around because she thought I was uglier than her and she could just dominate me and do whatever she wants. Anyway then because no chick would listen I started going out with men.

Then I have other mental issues. Especially gender dysphoria. A very extreme case. An Asian fem with super conservative parents who's also bi and trans - it physically hurts me sometimes that I have to keep hiding it. Because I m already an outcast I just can't make it worse. I can't even get an op for gender reassignment or take hormones because I have early onset arthritis that's hollowing me inside. I don't even have the money to get proper treatment. It's a genetic thing everyone on my mom's side had it very young and I do too.

Then a few months ago I lost my job.

Because of my arthritis no one wants to hire me. But I was working online I write for a living, I was earning around US $ 1500 per month at least and then I started getting sick and flare ups because of the auto immune.
Again I can't afford to go to the doctor because where I live free care is so horrid you might as well just die on your own.

I have a friend who was helping me so far giving me rent money and all but now she's being all distant which I understand but I don't know what to do. I haven't written a book in a year. I was getting by through freelance work but these days no one is hiring me for work either. So I'm trying to write a book at last but it's a struggle.

I was married to this guy for five years. But put an avoidant personality with a BPD and just imagine what happened. I'm glad I didn't have any kids even though I really feel empty without one even when I rationally know that having kids isn't the solution.

Okay this has gone on for way too long I know. I just don't have a point. I'm self aware enough to know the wrongs I do but by the time I apologize most relationships have already given up on me. Which id do the same if I was them. Some friends understand and stick around but they don't even know what it's like to have mental illness let alone something like BPD.

But it still feels like I'm alone because no one knows me. They all know this fake, politically correct version even if I'm usually the rebel in some way especially cause of the blonde short hair and purple hair days and eyebrows and lip piercing. I guess it's just my way of breaking free a little. I can't afford tattoos but I'll get one the second I can.

Sometimes I feel better when I don't struggle financially I find ways not to let all this get to me but while I would love to die RIGHT FUCKING NOW because I'm an atheist so it doesn't bug me that I'll go to hell. I've had surgeries gone under anesthesia and I wished both times I wouldn't come out but nah. Never got lucky. But I don't want to get hurt only or get disabled that will just screw me up. I did try to kill myself but didn't die. I had an overdose and it was just the worst feeling ever so I don't want to go through that again.

So now I have no idea how I'm going to pay my bills and the person is not responding and I don't know if it's some genuine reason or just ghosting me. Already I have been surviving with barely any food and I even borrowed money from my friend who really needs it back and I m struggling and unable to work unable to write. But try explaining that to someone.

Anyway thanks for letting me get it off my chest"
250,"First let me say that I am glad this forum is available. I will start by saying that I have children with a bpd/aspd and cptsd woman depending on who you ask and when. The reality is she is bpd and very much so. 12 years ago, I was faced with a false felony assault charge, and a future that had my twin children raised by someone I believe had a mental illness. I recorded every conversation and with some luck, the false accusations and illness was revealed within the court system as both criminal and custody cases were simultaneous. I have had 10 years of somewhat respite with only some threats and contempt charges in the courts. The mother in this case has a long history in the system dating back to her teenage years. This captivating person and I conceived twin boys. I had no idea what I was going to face in the near future. Without a doubt, the most testing and trying experience in my life. Court ordered psychotherapy for a minimum of one year and supervised visitation which occurred erratically for the first five years. She has tried to change venue, contempt, modification...etc with no results as her reality is distorted or false. The twins are now just teenagers and I am faced with impending legal actions again. The biggest problem here is that she is not willing to allow counseling records to be viewed, claiming HIPPA, which is a privacy act for records, as an excuse. I believe the 10 years of counseling she has received is for an alternate reality, as it appears she has not provided her counselors with the court required collateral documents. These are In depth Psych Evaluations and two family evaluations. This data reflects a true history of her life and experiences with alternate perceptions and many dishonesties along the way. The recent communication I have had with her indicated to me there has been no progress towards recovery. Her counselor letters to the court indicate a complete recovery from PTSD. Again, the problem here is she is being treated for something that is not real. She is the constant victim and survivor of her unfair circumstances. There is also a very real possibility of Munchhausen with this person as she has a myriad of life altering illnesses and some history of medications such as digitalis which were apparently used during DBT treatments and it was suspected were used for psychological reasons after testing in an emergency hospital visit. 
  Sorry to ramble here. The question I am trying to ask is... It is anticipated that she will enter a courtroom with several (3-5) summary letters of her treatments and recovery from ptsd. One of which was just this last week from a psychologist. Again, the problem is that she has the ability to fool or pass any test (some psychologists have found this concerning and suspicious) Regardless, I do not believe she can verify any reasonable amount of therapy with the court ordered supplied background information. In effect, she has not progressed in any way and her current distortions confirm this.
  I have a meeting with her family in a couple days. Of course they are advocates for her and rightfully so. The problem is, it is not about her or me. It is about these two children and I am trying to figure out a way of convincing them that there is still a concern for problematic behavior. I am trying to get them to participate in her treatment and recovery. I am trying to get everything organized.
  In a perfect world... I would force her to receive the therapy which was ordered by the court over ten years ago and provide these thirteen year olds, the education regarding their mother and her illness they need to survive it. She wants to begin supervised visitation again, she wants to modify the parenting plan, and also file for contempt as I have just recently reneged on her renewed interest in visitation after 5 years of none, until she can verify she is complying with the court ordered counseling. She has done everything but that in an attempt to subvert what she is unable to do..... Any help or input would be a blessing."
251,"This morning I just lost it with my mum. It was over something silly, but I was just so agitated and when she said she would be happier if I moved out I just lost it. I was shouting, punching doors, basically throwing an adult tantrum. I haven’t lost my temper like that in a while, and I just feel so disgusted with myself. I had a borderline rage in front of my younger siblings and feel ashamed, it feels like I’m the negative influence in my families life and that they would be better off without me, I’m just so angry with myself"
252,"I am disgustingly jealous of parts of my little sisters life. 
It's like looking at a parallel universe in what my life could've been. She went through so much of the same things as me but easier. 

For example I've been sexually abused basically forever and I am ruined physically and emotionally. I suffer from attachment disorder, emotion dysregulation, trust issues, and flashbacks (etc)

Some creep took photos  of her without her consent getting out of the shower when she was a minor (so like child porn kind of) And  they got the freak and he was charged and convicted. My family w1as as supportive as possible and she talks about it and how it affected her and they all listen and respect her.
As they should!

However I mentioned being sexually abused (like just the molestations nothing too horrible I dont want to scar them) and I got told ""could be been worse"" so I'll never talk about it again. 

I spend a bajillion dollars on my degree and training and I find it difficult to find a job in my field (not uncommon) 

My sister gets offered a tuition free ride at a university (her uncle is a professor there) and she turned it down but then her dad (not my dad, shes a half sister) just gives her a job in his company pretty high up. 

I understand life is not fair and her life is not my life but I get caught up in watching all these things happen for her and I work just as hard and I'm still struggling and alone and I am ashamed of feeling jealous of her I want her to succeed (shes my baby sister!)
When I try to talk about my feeling everyone just gets mad at me and says "" her life isnt easy either"" but I'm not saying it is I'm saying I am struggeling with obsessive thoughts of worthlessness and intrusive thoughts of jealousy. I feel like they aren't listening to me."
253,"Okay, I need serious help right now. Lately, I've been dealing with irritability and restlessness. My mood has been between anger and depression, but most importantly, I have been exhibiting signs of personal amnesia? Like, I have a hard time remembering basic parts of myself and losing interest in what I'd usually enjoy. It feels like I'm having a falling out with myself and therefore have a difficult time grasping reality. I get distracted, dizzy, and tired all at the same time which in return messes with my behavior. I know it seems really crummy, especially when you're not trying to hurt anyone's feelings but I probably come off as rude or aloof to others. Now, about the amnesia, I honestly can't comprehend it. I'm this person and I'm expected to be this person for the rest of my life, but I can't come to terms with it. Some days, I'm nostalgic and can remember series of events and can say in confidence that it's me. Then again, for weeks or months at a time, I'll go through a phase of blankness and not remember an event or find my past unrecognizable. I shift through a lot moments and can seem to reconcile them and then feel a sense of denial. Sometimes, I go through weeks of absent mindedness and feeling like a spector rather than a person. I'm nowhere but I'm here, they're my friends but they're not, stuff like that. Each day, there's a sense of denial and interrogation, as if I should feel awful for not having an idea of what I want in life. It plagues me a lot and then I finally have a thought, am I splitting more than usual? I know that BPD has a side effect which I've experienced before but this is different? Am I dissociating because I'm dealing with anxiety and worry so I subconsciously wiping away whatevers pestering me?

I need validation because I've felt this before and have dismissed to it sounding complex and wacky. Thanks for reading, I've had never but positive feedback on here and I appreciate it. Have a wonderful night or day, depending on where you are."
254,"Brief history: I'm a 42 year old female. I'll be 43 in April. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I went to therapy at 23/24 and again at around 32/33 (or 33/34 - I don't remember). I saw a psychiatrist both times, but only for a couple of short appointments each. I was diagnosed with anxiety, Major Depression, and OCD. I've taken Celexa and Fluoxetine. I don't do well with meds. I'm not currently seeing anyone, nor do I want to. Without insurance, both times I went to the same local community services board. That would be my only option again. The ""help"" there isn't good.

I've wondered for years if my depression and anxiety is actually BPD. I guess it doesn't really matter since I'm not getting help, but I still want to know. Maybe someone here can help me? Let me explain some of the things I do:

* I have a history of dropping people - often for no real reason. We can be friends for years and then one day I'm like, ""We're done. Leave me alone and don't ever talk to me again."" (I'm working on this behavior now.) However, while I'm loyal to someone, I've very loyal. I make caring about me difficult because of my insecurities.

* I get jealous easily. I want the people I care about to put me first. I guess I'm trying to say that my feelings are intense and I want them to feel as I do. I get close to people quickly as I'm very open.

* I wouldn't say my moods are extreme, but they change very quickly and can be intense. I cry easily; I get worked up just by thinking about something that bothers me. Usually I'm okay within a couple of hours.

* I used to steal things when I was in my teens through my early 20s. (I stole again when I was on Fluoxetine, but didn't learn that it's a documented side effect until years later.) I don't steal anymore, but I could probably slip back into that. It's exciting and I'm good at it. I never steal from people - only stores. I'm not saying that makes it better, but I won't take things from friends.

* I struggle with being good. I want to be good, but I do a lot of bad things. I usually don't care, but I have moments sometimes when I think of what I've done and I feel ashamed. Then I get over it.

* I exercise a lot, but that started because I eat insane amounts of chocolate. Seriously, most people would be shocked by how much I can eat and it never makes me sick. Not sure if this is BPD-related, OCD-related, or just something random. lol. These days I try not to keep much candy in the house because I have no self-control. With Easter candy coming to stores soon, I have to try to stay away from the candy aisles. Easter candy is my all-time favorite and I justify buying so much because it's limited. Last year, I bought at least 60 bags of my favorite candy. Ate it all within 2 months. *Embarrassed*"
255,"Hey. I've been experiencing difficulties again over the past month or so. I'm also doing things, like little behaviours, that I wouldn't normally do. 
It's like some of my symptoms have decreased a little but now I seemed to have developed new ones, if they even are BPD related, I don't know."
256,"Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed.
Take a look at all the suffering we breed.
So many lonely faces scattered all around
searching for what they need.

Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
against the law?
So it seems in the end
is this what we're all living for today
the world that we created.

You know that everyday a helpless child is born.
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home.
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
waiting for life to go by.

Is this the world we created?
We made it all our own.
Is this the world we devastated right to the bone?
If there's a God in the sky looking down
what can he think of what we've done
to the world that he created.

257,"To cut a long story short I was drinking too much but tried to ignore it.  I was feeling over medicated so reduced my Mirtazapine and Sertraline gradually and now feel better for it.  I’m leaving my mood stabiliser as it seems to be the one med that actually works.

The weird thing is that I now don’t want the booze.  Has anyone else thought/found that  💊 made them drink more and reducing meds has decreased their alcohol intake?"
258,"I feel very wired today. Things have been awful for weeks now. I’ve dropped out of college, I’m struggling at work I’m splitting on people and I’ve got suicidal thoughts/theoretical plans stuck constantly in my mind. It really feels like I need to get through this or not at all. Either I get better at dealing with things, push through with my job and not self destruct, or it’s game over. I refuse to rebuild my life from scratch yet again, so either I resist the urge to self destruct or I fully self destruct. That’s how I’m feeling today"
259,"Hi. I'm new to the forum. I'm starting to worry about myself a bit.

I have BorderlinePD and struggle mainly with the emotional instability, self image problems, self harm urges and dissociation day to day. These all suck, but because i deal with them day to day i know its possible for me to deal with them even if its hard.

It's much rarer for me to struggle with Idealization of other people/Favorite Person etc. Its happened in the past, and its always ended really badly. I just can't seem to deal with these kind of feelings, I'm aware im putting too much on another person but cant stop myself. It makes me hate myself quite strongly, and makes all my other symptoms worse. From past experience, i know that what will happen is that i'll obsess over that person for a while until my paranoia that they hate me takes over, ill completely devalue them after that then will suddenly realize i've neglected everything else and will just collapse emotionally. It all feels really dangerous to me, and its not something i really know how to deal with.

Is this something other people have managed to overcome? Any advice or peoples own experiences would be really appreciate 

Thanks :)"
260,"My head keeps telling me to die, and makes it sound like it is a good idea.  It has me convinced.  Living like this is no life worth having.  I'm struggling with it all as it gets louder and stronger.  I'm scared what it will make me do."
261,"I've just realised there is no cure. No end to torment or pain.  Stayed years more than I should have but still feel like the failure i know i am. Not self pity but know im damaged.  My physical health affected from a tablet like thalidomide,  so I cant take care.if my 3 year old grandson.  My daughter has bpd from me and social services involved"
262,"I am so so so confused. I don't want to leave. I want to stay committed. It's amazing when it's good. But she drives me absolutely insane with constant criticism about things that aren't quite real. Sometimes they are and I can apologise and learn and try to change. But so much of the time there is flawed logic and I can see how she's drawing these conclusions, but they really don't make sense, and then I feel a need to defend myself. 

The info about being in a relationship with someone who has BPD suggests that I need to not take this personally and assume it isn't about me, and just validate whatever I can find that does make sense (like the emotion). But I don't seem to be able to do this well (although I try) because I get so triggered because it feels so unfair and I feel a need to explain my version of what's actually going on, and then she feels unheard and gets more angry and then I end up getting angry too. 

Even when I can manage to do it for 10-20 minutes, she never seems to feel heard and be able to stop, she expects me to do something about it, like apologise, which I cannot do because I haven't done anything wrong. So eventually it still turns to fighting. 

She thinks I'm gaslighting her by trying to make her think her reality is false. I'm just trying to help her see that whatever's actually happened isn't as bad as what she thinks. And I can see that this doesn't work and that it just makes her more angry and trust me less, but I don't know how to stop doing it because I find it so infuriating that she keeps attacking me over things that I haven't done. It's mostly just misunderstandings and projections. 

Then if I try to take space to try to stop the fighting, she won't let me because she then feels abandoned. Occasionally these days she can handle giving me space for a bit, but usually it results in a panic attack/public scene if I try to take space when things aren't great between us, which is the time when I most need it. 

We're both in therapy already and about to start couples therapy again. It wasn't useful last time because of cassandra complex stuff (the therapist couldn't see much of my part in the dynamic because I seemed so logical and reasonable and not obviously autistic (cos I can mask pretty well outside of my closest relationships), and focused totally on getting my partner to work on things, which just made them feel more gaslit and unsafe). 

basically i want to keep working on myself and the relationship and so does she, but we're both totally exhausted by it and it feels impossible to really get anywhere.. any advice or empathy or what have you would be appreciated."
263,"Omg my mood today. I feel like my body is so heavy its unreal. Like i cant make myself smile. I just can't feel anything. Not happy. Not sad. Just empty and really tired. I worked a 12 hour shift yesterday and im just wiped out. Does anyone else feel like this? I got diagnosed with bpd, depression and anxiety in 2011. But I've had it all my life.  I had quite a few traumas through childhood and teen years that pretty much was left my my care givers.  There's no way they never knew what was going on. It was treated like it was normal.  And for a while there. I thought it was too. But its not!!!"
264,"Oh my god, I am really suffering due to my period AGAIN. My mind has just gone to MUSH, all because of my period.
Literally my brain feels like jelly.
I keep questioning am I gonna be alive tomorrow? The day after? Who knows when death will take me?
This is the literal worst.
My whole body and my brain has been gone for coming onto 3 days now, all because of my period. I can't make it better. Have had painkillers but still.
At least I'm not depressed or suicidal but honestly mental confusion is worse. I honestly can feel death creeping up on me and all I know is I will have achieved nothing of what I want to achieve in that time. Want to wake up and feel constructive tomorrow
But all I'm feeling is life is a fight I can't fight anymore"
265,"I hate my stupid fucking bank 
I hate all these stupid pre-authorized payment systems meant to screw me over like wow i haven't used it in 2 years obviously I want to renew. 
I hate how everything is trying to screw me over,
it wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt a pandemic, lost my job and now I live on a strict budget but whats a $120 down the toilet to some corporation designing its shit to fuck me over."
266,"So I’m at a point where I have very little energy to do anything. I hardly cook, clean, take care of myself I’m a mess. Anyways I order delivery food.. a lot and I could easily spend an hour deciding where I’m going to eat and what I’m going to eat etc it’s so exhausting and aggravating but I just can’t help it. A lot of times I’ll ask my boyfriend to just pick something for me once I’ve had enough. And there are times where the food came and there was something wrong with my order. I’m too anxious to let the company know so I just deal with it but it makes me very upset so mad and i won’t want to eat and I’ll be in a bad and very anxious mood for a few hours. This happened tonight and I ordered a pizza I asked for it to be cooked well done and it wasn’t. Now I have it in the oven but I’m so irate and can’t stop thinking about it. This can also happen if I get pasta and they didn’t put cheese on it or they forgot to put jalapeños in my burrito. Again, I never express the frustration with the restaurant bc of like social anxiety I guess you can say and then I’m stuck being very upset for hours. I hate this part of me I don’t want to be so upset over food especially but I just can’t help it. Is this normal?"
267,Today I’m really struggling ..... and I don’t even have the words to explain why ....it’s just really hard. And I know I’m not the only one ...
268,"There is a reoccurring symptom of BPD that I have. It presents itself in every relationship that I have. I am 30 years old and have had a BPD diagnosis for 6 years. I always end up obsessing about girls who my current boyfriends were with in the past. When I say obsessed, I mean - racing thoughts, intrusive thoughts, on a constant basis. I even go so far as to purposfully look them up on social media and compare myself to them. It's a strange thing because in those moments, it is as though I cannot focus on the fact that I am with them in the present moment.

This is very much the case with my current relationship. It seems that the symptoms have gotten progressively worse over the years, regardless of the relationship. Sometimes, I feel like I could drive myself crazy with thoughts of how I cannot compare to other women. I am unable to listen to logic. It is almost as if I am experiencing the act of being cheated on by my boyfriend even though it has not happened.

I am in constant state of anxiety most days. However, the symptoms are also cyclical. I might go through several weeks of a steady improvement of emotiona regulation and thought processes, only to relapse again severly, back into the feeling of being run by my obsessions. I become positive that my boyfriend had a better experience in other relationships. I torment myself over the desire to know details and then become triggered by them. 

Once, I spent considerable time out of my day scrolling through the instagram feed of an ex girlfriend of his until I found pictues of them together. I went out of my way to be triggered by my boyfriend's past. This, I feel, is due to my BPD.

I harbor all of these feelings of not being worthy. I am positive that he will eventually hurt me, or that he believes that other women are better than me. I lash out at him because of these thoughts. I often get frustrated and start crying. He has come to the point where he believes that my tears are being used as a weapon against him. He does not understand why I am choosing to focus on the past. He says that I am pushing him away. Honestly, I believe that he is right. I do not want to break up with him, but being with him and tormenting myself is so painful, and it is as if I know no other way of functioning. 

I also experience feelings of extreme anger. In the past, I have been abusive both emotionally and physically towards my boyfriend as a result of feeling hurt by him or overlooked. I do not know how to express myself towards him and it often comes out as rage. I am convinced that he is using me for his own personal gain, despite him telling me that he loves me for 2 years. 

I feel as though my own warped thinking is preventing me from being happy. I am so convinced that he is keeping something from me. I have never known a relationship that does not entail me feeling this way. I fear that I will never be able to truely heal myself enough to have a family of my own. 

I have come to this discussion group to share my experiences of BPD. This is my struggle. I would like to know if anyone has felt like this, regardless of to what degree."
269,"Hey guys, my boyfriend and I have been having hard times. We argue really bad and get into physical fights. Pretty much starts with him being rude to me then me telling him I don’t appreciate it, it starts an argument then he’s calling me all types of names and bringing my confidence down and then I’ll usually smack him or throw something at him to me words hurt more than physical pain, I know that if I hit him there are consenquences but in the moment I feel like I’ve been shot. I can’t handle the things he says and I try to inflict some sort of pain on to him so he can feel a bit of the pain I feel emotionally. Things he says are I’m lazy a slob weak ignorant dumb stupid then he calls me cuss words and says things like you’ll never find anyone and I’m done with you which leads me to get physical. I know it isn’t right I hate hitting him but that’s all that I can do. I don’t stand up for myself when he’s being verbally abusive and I have no hurtling words to say I’m just hurting. Anyways, today when I woke up he started picking fights with me. I told him to stop screaming because I just woke up and i didn’t want that energy. He kept screaming and yelling. I got in his face and yelled in it and he choked me. Next thing I know we’re in a full out brawl. I don’t want to deal with this anymore. I feel I’m to blame and he keeps putting me out to be the crazy one. He knows I have bpd and says stuff liek you’re fucked yo in the head idk what’s gaslighting or just the truth. What do I do any words will be helpful thank you"
270,"Hey guys, I’m just going to jump into this. My favorite person, my boyfriend and I have been having issues, a lot of them. I suffer from anxiety, depression and bpd this is so embarrassing to say but there are days where it’s so hard for me to find the energy to brush my teeth, comb my hair, clean up after myself cook etc. it just seems like every day tasks are soo difficult I pretty much go to work which takes everything from me to actually go and by the time I’m done working I’m soo mentally exhausted that I feel physically tired. After work I would like time to myself to recoup or to take a nap my job is very stressful. My boyfriend told me to grow up and do the things that I have to do. I wasn’t offended by it because he said th both of us should do more. Anyways, with all of these every day tasks being a lot for me I’ve been really trying to change but it seems impossible. I guess my efforts are so small that they go unnoticed but it’s a lot for me. My boyfriend is to a point where if I cry he just leaves or if I tell him I’m really anxious he just stares at me. Literally ignoring me which is the worst feeling in the world. He said he doesn’t know how to handle me. He is showing each day that he cares less and less and that he’s closing me out and pushing me away. I don’t get comfort from him bc I feel I used all of his comfort up needing it a lot more then your average girl. But at this point he’s avoiding me and ignoring my feelings. I told him I needed to talk and he put headphones in. He NEVER wants to talk anymore because the talks are always the same he says. I just need support and comfort and to feel like I’m in a real relationship it’s almost like he’s a ghost who died in the house and can’t leave like that American horror story season. Anyways I just feel so lost and hopeless very sad and like I don’t know what to do. Who would want to be with someone that can’t take care of themselves and I don’t want to have sex as much and when I do I’m so distracted that I pretty much lay there as my mind drifts away. I feel like I sound like the worse girlfriend I don’t have the energy to cook for him, we hardly have sex and we’re 21 and 24 and I can’t keep up with myself or his needs so I get it. I understand why he’s so dry with me and tired of me but why doesn’t he understand that I’m severely depressed and that I have anxiety. The bpd is another thing I feel he can’t handle and he has told me before it’s too much. I just wish he could look back to our life from 2 years ago when I was much better. The anxiety and depression have really taken a toll on me and my relationship. I don’t want to lose him after 6 years but I feel hopeless. Sighs. Any response will be appreciated. Thank you."
271,"Well last year my partner was really close to a woman on Instagram they swapped numbers etc and i defo think it was leading to more, my gf wouldn't let ,e follow her on Instagram but yet this stranger could a lot of stuff happened and my gf blocked her. Me and my GF seem like we are in a good place and i have noticed this woman is now following my gf on a different Instagram account as my gf as more than one, one for body building and a general one. i feel like messaging this woman and basically asking what her deal is, may be i will find out what really was going off between her and my gf as i feel she didn't really know my gf was taken and that's why my gf was hiding me ? On this account i have also noticed my gf is following her ex the one thats caused a few issues recently but shes not following her back now i know this must have been done last year or end of 2019 as when you hear so much about an ex you see if ur partner still follows them or antying just to see what this person looks like but i couldn't find her previous to this. Any advice welcome"

273,Ive just joined. Doesn't seem a very busy forum. Hopefully this is because 🤷‍♀️ who knows. Im currently sat in work half way through a 12 hour shift wondering if I'm going to make it till the end. Or will I have to go home 🤦‍♀️. Fingers crossed I make it through.

275,"I did my best this semester but my brother died in the middle and i struggled to catch up. One class in particular.
I'm hoping for a D atleast in this course. But if I don't pass I'll  be ok, but I am struggeling with the dissapointment I feel of not knowing if I passed or not. I just want to graduate already, its the only thing ive ever really wanted."
276,"I got diagnosed with bpd at the age of 21. I started having real issues at the age of 18 though. From the period of 18 until 26, which is my current age, I've lived a thoroughly empty life. On the surface, it looked like maybe I'm only struggling with some kind of growing up phase, which might have even been the case, but the effect it had on my life was nevertheless devastating...in all aspects. 
I have used drugs for fun, but also to function at my best when in social situations, due to the shame and feeling separated, so in that way drugs would make me fairly well balanced. Normally, it over time it had gotten more and more compulsive, until the day something changed, and even drugs didn't always manage to take care of of the negative effects of my self awareness, the thing that was making me paralyzed in all aspects of functioning. No part of me was ever feeling truly hopeful that I could get better.

For the last couple months that has changed, because somehow some things within me have truly made a turn and propelled me in a more grounded state of mind, which was the thing that I needed all this time in order to gain perspective of my own situation and how it relates to everything else around me. So in that sense, a step forward has been made, however I am here because I am having fucked up time adjusting my self to that kind of outlook in which I may imagine my future in a way that isn't limited by my psychological state so to speak...better yet, I feel like my whole false identity has been totally and completely given away, I no longer can in any way be fake, but I lack the step to surrender to myself and trust my own perception, and there are feelings of regret all the time due to the way I lived for the past years and feel that it was almost for nothing in some way, for me."
277,"Hello, thanks for taking the time to read my post if you do.

I was wanting to see if anyone has any advice or experience on this matter - I am fairly young (mid 20's) but have struggled most of my life with direction. I have grand ideas and do things to make it happen, then some realization makes me reconsider and I end up stopping because I was obviously flying away with emotion and didn't think it through properly. In my late teens, I quit school early and started working full time and then the last year and a half I've had off work sorting my crap out and it's only now that I have my shit somewhat together that I see how lacking my life is, how I wish I was experiencing more and yet knowing my limitations make that difficult. In all honesty, the last ten years or so of my life have been spent just trying to stay alive as I didn't think I'd be alive to worry about what I'd do with myself. I regret that and I regret having to take so much time to get well but I also realize that I needed to and couldn't carry on living as I was forever.

The envy comes as the form of my friend's son - he's almost 20 and despite being in a difficult time in his life, he has been working full time for 2 years, is going to uni this year, has a good social circle and relationship prospects and in general, he's just a very nice person and has a good plan for the next few years. Now I'm not comparing myself to him, I am so happy for him and it's nice to see how well he is doing and how his self esteem has grown. More, I see that he's overcome hardship and made a plan and I envy that, I feel motivated to make more changes in my life to see this in myself. Granted, his hardships haven't been the same type as mine as I spent a good deal of my high school years in and out of hospital and therapy and he has got a lot on his plate right now, but all the same I admire the drive and wish to be a bit more like that.

My issue is that I really don't know what I even want for my life. I wanted to study psychology and become a clinical psychologist, and I even applied and got accepted into uni but in the end I had some experiences in mental health and realized the quality of colleagues I'd be working with. I didn't want that for my life. I also thought of becoming a teacher, but I don't want it enough to be paying so much just to study it, even though I trust in my stability now enough that I would still be interested years later if I pursued it. I want friends, I wish for a social life as I have only had one friend in the last 10 years, we have known each other for four of those, but he is much older than me and I want to know what it's like to mingle with people my age. Yet, I get socially exhausted and don't think I could maintain several more friendships so I stay lonely. I am also an oddball for my age so the chances I did have, I get on with most people really well but there was no common interests. I really get exhausted with myself, wanting things yet not really wanting them, having feelings of chronic emptiness and yearning for more in life yet knowing it would likely be too much for me. Additionally, I would love a family but again, I think it'd be selfish to have kids knowing what mental health issues I'd be passing on genetically.

I do try to be content with my life and find that I can be, but as soon as things like my friend's son pop up I immediately feel like I am wasting my life away and the fact that it keeps happening tells me I need to take action as it will not go away and I have tried just being happy with life as it is. I just have no real wants, ambitions... it goes around in circles in my head.

That's the end of my ramble/rant - sorry it ended up so long. What do you think about it all? Can anyone relate to this?"
278,"I just dont know how to carry on.
I've lost everything, everyone and I'm so lonely. I feel like I might give up soon"
279,"Like i will start to get into something then quickly get bored/lose intrest then try find something else to do.
Example like right now im excrsing but say by the end of the week i will stop caring and cba to do it again for the whole year. 
Same with learning to drive i start then stop all the time.
So for me it feels like an endless circle of picking something up then throwing it away through lack of intrest or not getting the result i want quickly.
Dont know if this is anything bpd related just wanted to share and see if anyone else acts like this."
280,"I had a tendency to share all my thoughts and feelings with others. Instead I have been trying to hold onto it myself as therapist has encouraged me to in order to break these patterns. But i am bursting. Usually I see therapist weekly but its been a month break over Christmas. Before we ended for the break she told me my issues were ""complex and severe"" and that she believed that we would need to work together for another year. I see her privately so this means financial commitment. This has triggered me but I feel like I can only change with her help. It feels like I am partly being manipulated as I am choosing to withdraw from spaces where I overshare, i am trying to pull away from family as thy trigger me and I have turned down a job so that I can continue seeing therapist face to face rather than online."
281,"Hi I’m worried about my partner. He almost died earlier this year through drug use. He is in recovery coming up to a year, but is really struggling. I’m worried he might have BPD. I had a close friend with a BPD diagnosis, she sadly chose to take her life a few years ago. I see many of the same things with my partner. I love him dearly and would do anything to understand. He’s waiting on a psychiatrist referral. He has good days and bad days and they can come out of nowhere without warning, he’s not able to identify his feelings, has angry outbursts 0 to 100 over small things and says and does things he’s then ashamed of and regrets, one day I’m the best thing ever then I am the most evil, he has days where he absolutely beyond hates himself to the core, feels empty, struggles to know how he feels, struggles with knowing his needs and wants, if he can identify then he struggles to express these needs. I have struggled badly with depression and anxiety myself so I have some understanding how hard it can be living with challenges, I can see how hard it is for him. He is a wonderful, gentle, compassionate soul, but it’s like the wind can rock him into an ocean of sadness, despair, anger. After a while of calming down he is ashamed and guilty and it seems to feed further feelings. He struggles to understand others, often taking things the wrong way like an attack when it isn’t, he often asks me to check text messages for him as he reads intentions as bad and is really sensitive about criticism; they never are, just a bit ambiguous/not direct. He struggles to sleep, maybe will come to bed, fall asleep for a couple of hours, then will get up for a few hours not being able to sleep, then will doze off on the sofa, wake back up have another hour. This seems to impact his difficulties worse. I dunno what else to say, I am feeling sad and scared, I just want to be a good support and help, I was hoping to post here and reach out. I feel quite alone, most people don’t understand. Thank you for taking the time to read this."
282,"All my life, and I'm just that. A guy get angry with me because I was unable to solve a trouble. Maybe I'm just a farce

#$""#$""# ""#$""# im just angry and sad, and dissapointed"
283,"Where to begin. 

I think I may have BDP, but I have not had it diagnosed. In short, I come from a past of abuse etc from a figure close to home. Additionally, I don't really get on with my mother (nothing is ever good enough) and, although I get on with my sibling, she is turning in to my mother; as a result we constantly clash. 

I have a mother figure in my life whom I adore, and don't know where I'll be without her. 

But... I'm stuck in a rut.

I'm lonely - I struggle to make friends. I don't really have any - I always clash with females. 
I find it extremely difficult to relax, I feel guilty and feel as though I need to accomplish something first before I can, be it chores, work etc. 
My only purpose in life is work... I work three jobs (furloughed from one since March, which is only a bar job), but work 7 days a week, with my other two. On top of this, I'm doing a course at college, one evening a week -  again, this gives me a purpose.
Relationships, I can hardly hold down. I'm scared of rejection. I am currently on a break with Y, because he said he doesn't love me (after being together little over a year) and his aspiration is to move across the pond. However, his actions, suggest otherwise and he has been here for me (support) during the last year. While I have asked for a break, as this is affecting my mental health, I really don't know what to do. It comes down to 'do I put up with it?'.

The last year, I've have gained two stone, because I eat or drink my emotions. I use to be very active - run, gym, walks etc.

I just don't know what to do or how to 'snap' out of this depressing phase. 

I have this cloud over me constantly, where I am always thinking dark thoughts or constantly on a downer until I've exercised; which I've even lost my motivation to do this.

Another habit of mine, is constantly changing my mind or changing plans.

Other symptoms of BDP I can relate to, but rather not disclose.  

I've tried the counselling route, which wasn't for me and honestly, I'm impatient for meditation :/ 

Any advise would be greatly appreciated."
284,"hi everyone!

I was diagnosed with BPD more than 2 years ago, and relationships are not very easy for me sometimes. 
 
I've been with my partner for about a year now, and he's a great person. Despite us having a pretty rocky start (he was sometimes doubting whether he wanted to be in a relationship at all), we're doing great right now. I can 100% say that this is my healthiest relationship ever. 

Here's where my insecurity comes in. 
I often feel like he does not love me or does not want to be with me because I've experienced this with him before - a year ago. We now live together, we've already built a life together, we even got a cat together, and he says how serious this is. I have all the facts laid out in front of me but I can't help but spiral down into this darkness and loneliness. I try not to ask him stuff like ""are you going to leave me"" because when he says ""of course not"" it's still very hard for me to believe.
I often feel like he's more enthusiastic when he's around other people while I am just a burden he needs occasionally to talk to.  He wants to play games with his friends, he's interested in doing other stuff with them, while with me he seemingly just exists. I feel left out because it often feels like we don't spend quality time together despite living together.

I also struggle with the fact that he didn't want to become exclusive in the beginning. He was talking to many other girls which I got fed up with. I went no contact with him for a month, and during this time, he was very happy trying to sleep with other women. It was very infuriating to me because he would come to my apartment, lay on my bed and scroll tinder. 
This mess happened a year ago, and everything had been mostly great but for some reason, it's still very hard for me to get over this. 
He says he's very sorry for hurting me but it does not seem genuine for some reason. 
It doesn't bother me at all times but when it does it's BAD. I can't stop creating ugly narratives in my head, and it's so exhausting.
He is very loyal now, and there's nothing that can make me not trust him but I still fear SOMETHING. I fear that he'll leave me for someone better, fitter, healthier, calmer. I am very scared that he might miss other women even though he deleted every single conversation and stuff like that from that period of time. 
It's also worth mentioning that I was been cheated on in pretty much every relationship I was in which might explain a lot of my issues. 
However, I am getting more and more paranoid, and it's eating me alive. 

Unfortunately, I can't afford therapy right now so I would be glad to hear suggestions on how to get my paranoia and jealousy under control."
285,"I’m new here, I’ve been watching the forum for a while but have only just decided to sign up. I was officially diagnosed with BPD this year however it seems I’ve been living with it for a long time. So please be patient with me.

Does anyone else feel like this time of year....specifically the 27th to the 31st, people who weren’t around all year or weren’t there when you needed them most seem to pop up and try to make amends? They’ve had all year, they’ve had all the time in the world especially with most people being in lockdown, to pick up the phone or send a message and check how you are, but nothing.

It seems like everyone’s guilty conscience comes knocking at the end of the year and they try scurry to make things better for the new year. Are they really asking how you are or are they really just trying to clear their  own conscience for the new year and make themselves feel better."
286,"Hi, found out from an Occ health referral 2019 that I was diagnosed with BPD in 2006. Had never been told, offered therapy, anything apart from anti depressants due to my ongoing suicidal thoughts.
Asked gp, got fobbed off with mental health diagnosis all being interrelated and hard to determine. Lost another job due to my suicidal thoughts and tendency to trust people when they say their there for me whatever when in hindsight their not. Can’t let go of fact if I’d had help 14 years ago I may not be in such a bad place today."
287,"Typing on my phone.  I'll fix typos as best as i can.

My wife has an addiction problem.  She does meetings online every morning.
She has patterns of going to the er and having something wrong but it never gets found and they attribute it to muscle pain.  The first time they have her percocet. She took as prescribed but also take alot of anti depressants and other mental health needs.  Also has med marijuana card.

When she had one day of medicine left she hurt her back.  Back to the er. They gave her a 10mg perc and script for muscle relaxers. As soon as we got home she wanted a pain pill.  I said you just got one at the hospital and your supposed to wait 6 hours.  She said that's for her prescription so the hospital one didn't count anyway.
I just gave it to her because I'm sick of fighting and the blame shifting to my bpd and ptsd from cheating and abusive exes.

Today she should have had 2 muscle relaxers left.  They were both they this morning.
She been arrested twice for this and one dui in 11 years.

I don't know what to do.  I have nobody to talk to because i split and dump gasoline on bridges when i get mad or somebody does something to hurt me.

I just want to give up and move on.  It's obvious what's more important."
288,"At what point does a symptom of BPD, anxiety become GAD?
What treatments made your anxiety better?"
289,"I don't know what it is, but for some reason I feel like I can't trust myself anymore. I could be feeling a normal emotion like jealousy and I still manage to feel like I have to explain it, even if I'm not doing any harm. I've always had issues with making friends. Not because people don't like me, I'm just unapproachable. Lately I've been feeling like a shell of myself and have hard time forgiving myself. I've had gone through mishaps with people and I feel like what I've done still matters. It's been years since I've acted ignorantly or immaturely and yet, I still feel like those events hold true. It has since increased my anxiety and has made me attach a stigma to myself. I call myself names and continuously inhibit my growth because I still believe I deserve it. I've basically turned myself into prisoner. 

I've given up on myself to the point where I feel invisible. My life itself feels inauthentic and kind of pointless to me now. Everyone I've crossed paths with is no longer in my orbit and now it's just me, enemy number one. I don't know how I'm going to help myself, especially when I feel like a loser. Nothing about me feels genuine anymore, I just feel like I'm always imploding emotionally with no escape route. I'm just ready to lock myself inside my bedroom and throw my dreams away. My dreams honestly never mattered because they're mine. I get that being kind doesn't mean anything, but it's actually what I stand for. How cynical do people have to be to believe your efforts to change mean nothing even though you're doing it for others and because it makes you feel free.

I feel so pathetic for being afraid of myself, but I don't know what to believe anymore. I just don't believe I'm who I say I am, I feel like a liar."
290,"Is there any phone chat line or free party line phone number for borderline or any kind of other mental issues? I remember years ago they used to be a very popular party line number that everybody used- including me lol-but they did away with the main one- Now they have many different numbers but I’m looking for specific mental health ones.

If not -there is a few free numbers (that Barely anybody uses) that I know of that I can post here if anybody’s interested.

happy new year!"
291,"I've been in a relationship with this guy for over a year, and the only reason I have stayed with him is that he ultimatums me every time I attempt to leave, and the ultimatum always being a method to destroy my life and things that I will end my life for. What I usually did before meeting him was push people away, but I cannot do that with him since he refuses to leave (which if you were in this... it's not a good thing at all). He's heavily controlling of me and won't let me even say hello to other people or attempt to have other friends and I have to spend the whole day with him otherwise he will whine and push the blame on me. He calls my self-defence 'ego', lmao that was fractured when I was incredibly young, you won't see that any more because I can't use it. I'm not protecting myself from anything other than ending my life. All I do to defend myself is copy them or tell them off, and they hate it.
He's a paranoid asshole who targets people I talk to and assumes that I want to get in their pants. Like ew wtf I don't even know the person and don't like them. He does that to everyone. Even when  He gets me stuck in impulsive states because that's what he likes because he can use me; also his insults about the above come from there, but ignoring the fact that it's impulsivity yet again, and then saying that I'm not asexual and I'd be passionate with kissing... ew no.
I have tried so so so so much to educate him on the disorders but he's incredibly ignorant and only pays attention to anything that benefits him, he doesn't care about me unless it benefits him... same for most people. :|
He's a real problem when I talk to professionals because they're focusing on reading him rather than focusing on trying to understand me, so I've not really been getting far with mental health teams with my personal health anymore as the discussion about his control takes up most of my time I get.

I want to leave but I'm trapped in a trauma bond where I feel like I cannot live without him, so I put up with the delusional accusations of someone who whines whenever he cannot see sexual pictures from me (which I don't like taking but I do it for him). He makes everything his problem, even illogical things such as a simple hello to another person meaning that I'm cheating on him or sth. They all act very similarly to my father, it disgusts me that I'm in this loop. He is probably narcissistic because my father and many previous partners are, but he's being more manipulative and acting involuntarily celibate than the others. I have been able to eventually leave the rest of my partners because they didn't force themselves to stay, and I made another one leave by telling him what my counsellor told me to do. Ever since I left them I've been able to become more friendly and less irritable to strangers. So I need to finally leave this guy because he is the worst with his level of control and it agitates my trauma even more. He's also a predator who has sexual feelings to children, which is why he likes me because my body looks really young (I am 18, he is 31, I do not like the age difference but he doesn't care)... I started dating him because I dissociated in the first week of the relationship, so when I consciously found out his age I wanted to leave immediately. I wouldn't date someone even 5 years older than me but wowie, now I've been trapped for over a year.

I know if I leave him I'll just rush onto another person, but I do not care. Anything is better than controlling relationships, and then I'll finally be able to talk in the present about how BPD affects my new relationship without the weird discussions about this guy. My counsellor isn't looking at the bad things I do and instead looking at his, which I understand, but I cannot get personal help on my self with him in my life. She keeps on telling me to leave and yes I want to... but he will ruin my future if I do and I'm too afraid to call the police. Giving evidence won't really go very well since I'm mentally unstable myself and narcs can easily shift the blame onto me. If I tell my parents I will have to relive trauma and no way in hell am I doing that."
292,"Hi there. 37 years old from Norwich. Just been diagnosed with bpd and I still can't process it. Would explain why I feel and act this way. 

Been single for just under 2 years as my ex fiancée decided one day to tell me on the phone that she didn't love me and wanted to leave me THEN turned into a complete ****. It broke me, then in the space of 3 months lost my benefits (got them back again but still), a (now ex) mate went missing (found though) and my grandad died suddenly (couldn't even say goodbye). I snapped. Last year (the worst year of my life) is just a blur to me.

Earlier this year, I had the worst borderline rage, shamefully aimed at my parents. I love my parents, especially my Mum. I can't remember only snippets of what happened but the highlights (apparently) were:
* Walking out of my parents house with no shoes on trying to walk back home and not caring if I got hit by a car.
* Foaming at the mouth in anger.
* Threatening to kill my Dad.
* Had a face ""filled with pure rage"" according to my Mum.
* Flipping from rage to hysterical crying in seconds.
* Calling my parents all the names under the Sun.
* Threatening to stab myself with my pen knife (Mum had to grab it when I accidentally dropped it).

I am so ashamed of this. Although I know it wasn't me, from my parents point of view, it was their only child acting like this. They have repeatedly told me that they knew it wasn't me, but they shouldn't have to deal with me being like that.

Also, one of my neighbours has it in for me (other people have noticed so I know its not just me being paranoid). Every time, and I mean EVERY time he sees me, he looks at me and laughs. This prat wears a body cam so he can record people he deliberately winds up. Unfortunately for me, during summer lockdown, he did it on the wrong day. 

Was feeling horrible as I was missing my family and friends, so decided to chill out on the steps in front of the building (live in a studio apartment with no garden) as it was hot and my apartment was roasting. He walks past me, shakes his head and laughs so I can hear it (he was about 5m away). 

Now this is where things get a little hazy. 

According to my neighbour, he heard shouting (from me), looked out of the window and ran downstairs. He then got between me and this **** as it looked like I was going to floor him and forced me back indoors (don't know how he did it, as he's about 5ft 10 and skinny, whilst I'm 6ft 4 and morbidly obese (really hate that term)). I honestly can't remember much about it. All I know that it was in front of a busy pub (they had just reopened) and this absolute a**e got it all on his bodycam. 

Now I fear going outside as I don't know what i'll do if he does again. Been managing to go for walks but I'm constantly looking around, praying that I don't see him. Been telling my GP and (VERY new) social worker, but all they say is ""...but you didn't hit him"". I know that, I just don't want to get arrested or that will be it for me. I'd just be another statistic (which is exactly how I feel). Another ""mental"" person found dead in his cell. I'm sick of it.

Wow. I really opened up there. Don't know what else to say really. Lockdown has not helped in the slightest. Anyway, stay safe you guys x"
293,Anyone feeling the pressure because it's new year. Dont know how many times I've heard let's have a new start.
294,"I remember having an argument with someone once about my perception that I had done something terrible and the person was upset me. I was nagging them, trying to find out what I had done wrong as my friend was quiet and seemed miserable. Nag...Nag...Nag...Banging on about ""what have I don't wrong?""

I was met with a forceful ""IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU!"" and I was taken aback. 

I hadn't noticed that the world doesn't revolve around me. Why was I believing everything was my fault? Am I that important that the whole world and its problems are about me? It was such a revelation! 

I now have to check my narcissism when it comes to self-blaming. Most of the time I have no influence on other people's feelings or problems but for some bizarre reason I always insert myself into their problems as though I am the centre of the world. I also find that I used to believe that my being empathetic and caring of others feelings was some sort of virtue. I began to realise that this was simply a way of bragging about how caring I was. It was nonsense. 

I recently met a therapist who told me that many people with BPD believe they are the centre of the world and that there are strong links between BPD and narcissism. She said that we think of narcissism as an over-inflated sense of self, bragging, boasting, always having to be ""in the spotlight"". She told me that we can - in fact - be extremely narcissistic by making things all about us even if the problem isn't anything related to us. I was shocked but also really noted these issues in my own ways of thinking.

So here's to a self-aware but not self-absorbed/focused 2021!"
295,"So im BPD, (not officially diagnosed but suspected, by health professionals) and I was in this relationship for 3 months, talked intensely for a few weeks or so before that. Im really struggling with this break up tbh. And its kind of because I feel I messed it up, but Im also questioning did this person even love me. And tbh that is worse, because if they did I pushed them away. Id much rather think that they didnt and thats why they bailed.

Ive really been having a hard time mentally and maybe I shouldnt have been in a relationship I needed someone to lean on, this girl didnt seem to be able to do that anyway.

She said I love you on the second date, it was super intense in bed all night kissing etc. She was tentative to say it, but once she said it, that was it, I was in.

At the start we had a slight disagreement she had liked a local guys photo in the bath, it was a provocative photo and she had like alot of his other stuff previous to talking to me, now to me, thats just abit odd, its not really a comfortable thing for my boundaries, especially with how insecure I am.

I just let her know ""I dont think im cool with that"", she responded saying its not a big deal, and then I think I said something like thats how i feel so i dunno, whatever, then silence from her, I had to call her 2 days later to sort it out, and basically just explain how I felt, after on text I just said, were you just going to leave it? she was like ""I dunno, my mum was surprised I wanted to sort it out coz I never do"".

This is like the antithesis to my personality I like to talk things through. Anyway, I said it would have been a shame after everything (her saying I love you and our connection) she just said yeh it would, already my head felt like it was getting abit messed with, to me her saying I love you meant commitment, she just said she would have just left things that made 0 sense to me. I wish I could have said we need to slow down, but I was in deep and I take these things deep.

She said she wanted to move away to canada at some point, we were having a good weekend and I took it really personally, and I was like what wait, where am I factored in this I know she just said this maybe not thinking but u know (bpd), I have a daughter so that wasnt going to happen, she then quickly say, oh I meant before I met you, I was like thats not what you said,(should have just left it there probs but me being me) the fact she was saying love you's and talking all this commitment stuff that I became fearful saying things like that, she would just leave.

If I objected to anything she said, like what did u mean here, or went quiet myself, she'd go in a mood, and go silent there was never any real, trying to bring me out of it, trying to ease my fear nothing, that I even had the audacity to question things she said, that seemed abit inconsiderate, dont get me wrong I was far from perfect and nit picky,   which I really regret, but there we go.

Anyway, she seemed to spite me by going quiet, I think she knew I didnt like it because I am needy. That time she hugged me and stopped me from leaving, no verbal just a hug really. This kinda pattern continued but she began not really caring on the outcome, she claimed to have panic attacks from these slight disagreements. Sometimes I would feel like i was bothering her on text, and if I showed a slight bit of irritation at the fact her replies were slow, or we had big gaps in the day or that most of the time it was me, initiating, she turned it around and Id say oh im gonna be away from my phone tomorrow just to let you know will be busy with dad because to me thats the courteous thing to do, ok I was abit arsey saying it but it was a lil frustrating for me doing most of the running and shed say I was being weird, then ignore me for 2 days and again, Id ring, she breathed heavy on phone claiming she just needed a sec to deal with this.

Then you know after that ""argument"" she starts talking about self love, solo travelling, and how I need to love myself, which I said just sounds like narcissism, but this just fucked with my insecurity thinking oh shes not into this anymore, then it may go well for a while and then talks of rings, being husband, all this kind of stuff, which I went along with, the fantasy of love, me then questioning her double mindedness.

Ok so then my insecurities shone through, she said I was ""Actually a good looking guy, that she thought I was cute, but connected more on an emotional level"" when we first met, at the time, my self esteem was very low, I cant lie, I said I needed to walk, and my quietness was a pattern when I found something she said abit alarming, she came with me, and on teh walk I just said that it felt kinda shit that she said that, she then obviously went in a mood tried to walk away and further from me, I explained I know its just me being silly, and its not just that my heads not in a good place I got silence again... I decided this wasnt healthy for me, and said maybe I should just go, she encouraged me to, I know not great on my part, but at this point, this distance at times, just fucked with me. I was also really struggling with intrusive thoughts and ocd. I think it was too much for her.

Then she came to mine the same week, i argued with my mum infront of her, me going on being my bpd self, over analysis splitting devaluing, she judged how much I went on, I snapped abit at her, saying she wasnt being supportive, but that I just needed time to process, we were kinda arguing as my mom was being unweclome, and I called her out on it, obviously this was awkward,



she then seemed to disagree with evrything i said at one point trying to lighten mood and it was probably me just being sensitive so i just did the same, turned over went to sleep the next day i decided to, be quiet and let her come to me, let her mood dictate things, i made her breakfast but was very quiet, and went for a walk, came back and she had packed wanting to leave i convinced her to stay, but after this we agreed a gap in each other company 2 weeks, but she just really changed in that 2 weeks, but was adamant she loved me still, but of course at this point i was just convinced id fucked this, she was very detached still talked but minimal effort to some degree, never wanted a call, in comparison to before, she even just didnt text one day. I struggle with mental health and I need support sometimes I really got nothing in that 2 weeks, not one face time only when I facetimed one night as we were talking on phone dont get me wrong she returned the call, but never initiated.

anyway as you can see nearly every interaction had a problem (She said it was me looking for them, im trying to hope that it wasnt just me and that it was her reaction to some insecurities created by her projecting these love fantasies on me then acting different) and then finally she wanted a break, after I did snap about something after a lengthy convo, on how I just felt she wasnt happy, and she wasnt acting like it, and when I said u cant be happy with this, she said ""I love you"", I really dont know if she meant that, she couldnt find words to say anything else, and she was emotional... this hurts because, the next day i just snapped about something, and I knew I was gonna get the detachment again, dont get me wrong it wasnt hurrendous detachment but from that spark at the start i just couldnt handle it, I loved how much she needed and wanted me at the start, and then it just felt like i bothered her. in the end i agreed with the space, but after the phone call realised i couldnt do it, and out of anger said i couldnt that i was sorry, i never insulted her or anything, but my sister said, i wouldnt do it, save urself the heartache, my ex said, ""maybe ur right if this is how it is u cant even give me a day, and this is what its like"", now that wasnt true, wed had a day here and there before, even once willingly and she said that we should do that more often.... she said thank u for everything and take care, i was like weve all had enough space, if u just want space for 3 weeks, we just shouldnt be together were done its done, at this point previous she said this wasnt helping her depression then i said, i needed to block her because it was easier that way.  ( I KNOW I KNOW)

i regretted this instantly, i tried to snap her saying sorry, she blocked without reading, i text and it went through 3 days later, explaining i wanted us to work it out, i didnt mean it etc, then christmas day i thought i would ring, i was blocked i left a final voicemail, been 6 days and im pretty sure shes done.

what hurts so much is wondering wether she really loved me, not just that, i pushed her away i knew what i was doing, i split a few times, i wish ida handled so much more better, maybe it would have worked? im really beating myself, up, i just thought id get another chance, i thought that if she allowed for some of my outbursts it proved she loved me, she could have helped some of these situations by at least trying to ease it, just once or a time. we exchanged gifts at xmas, had great sex... cant believe shes really done, please be gentle im really coming to grips with the effects of bpd on relationships, also was she Fearful avoidant?

I feel so sad, like did I put this girl through hell? I know i was nit picky, but i think she never really tried to give me much emotional support just kinda became distant going through the motions dont get me wrong we talked like everyday, but u know when theres abit of a difference, and i really think the i love you and commitment talks at the beginning got to me, otherwise i really think i would have been more chill, i was in the beginning, even her mom has me blocked but the ex of 7 years, hes still on there. I feel like such a failure and im heartbroken, she wont even talk to me now its been a week of no contact, im blocked off everything."
296,Met someone all was great then things were not as they seemed
297,"I'm in my 30s and I struggle to remember a time when I did not feel an inner emptiness and background feeling of depression. Like something is wrong with me. I always feel the need to compare myself to others and be in competition. I have often felt jealousy and envy towards other people that seem happy. i have negative thoughts and wishes towards them.

Currently I feel it towards my flatmate and his relatively new girlfriend. We all live together. They seem really joyful and content. Lots of public displays of affection between them which makes me feel uncomfortable. Instead of feeling happy for them I feel all kinds of negative feelings and thoughts towards them - resentment, envy, anger, jealousy, sadness, loneliness, fear, anxiety. Everything is amplified with lockdown as there are few places to get distance from each other. I know the problem is not them, it is mine. It is the way I relate to these feelings and thoughts. It's about how I feel about myself.

I'm having therapy regarding these patterns but its a long process. Having a month break from it due to holidays so feel overwhelmed right now.

I'm fed of this as I feel like a unpleasant and nasty person."
298,"Wherever you are on your own personal wellness journey I want to wish each and every one of you much success, the resiliency to tackle the trauma in therapy, and my compassion and care for all that you have endured.

Our particular group can say that when things get bleak, we can get through it, because we are survivors. We've endured so much worse.

So in 2021 I wish you breakthroughs that lead to your freedom. Breakthroughs that help you get back up when you've fallen down. Breakthroughs that see you stable, secure and able to give yourself some much needed love.

You deserve it.

Happy. New. Year.

I was feelin anxious before that."
300,"Hi, I'm an inpatient in France as I took an overdose with wine 2 weeks or so ago, and they were very good and I'm now in a.cljnic not far from home.  I'm on cistralapram,.Tranxene and depokote and yesterday they removed my lunchtime meds.and I felt.so much less.a zombie last.night, but did need a sleeping tablet. 


Thing is, I have a mental health question questionnaire today, they have found the English version so I dont have to struggle with the French.  But I dont knowhow to answer.  I feel different now to a week or.so ago, and my.mood changes up and down anyway, so how do I answer the questions?

Tbh I'm really quite nervous they will think I'm normal, and send me home,and its panicking me.  I feel safe here and I know if I'm discharged I'll I'll quickly go back to my old ways.  I think I'll just run away from here to a bolt.hole.and hide.

In the outside I'm clean, washed my hair, made.my.bed, smile and chatted to the nurse.in French, but I'm a nervous wreck inside!

Any hints or tips about.facing this test?  I'm told it's about 200 questions long and international

301,"i hope a better 2021 to everyone. 
But how to stop impulsive acts, is like a storm that comes from nowhere. Im  gettin so faster IDK."
302,"Hey to whoever reads this. 

I am honest with my counsellor and I am honest when I post in here. 
However, I guess I still hold back occasionally. 
I'm considering posting a 100% honest, explanation, I guess, just to see what peoples opinions and thoughts are regarding if it is BPD related or if others have the same kind of things. 

This is mostly because I was upbeat in the middle of the week but the weekend has been very difficult."
303,"I've been doing things over the Christmas period that really isn't me and I don't know why. Then again, if I am doing them, doesn't that mean that it is me so I am a bad person?"
304,"Hi. I'm new here.

I'm frustrated and angry. Has anyone dealt with jealousy while dealing with BPD?

My husband seems to care about everyone else but me and find other people's company better than mine. I voice this and he always rebuttals with ""What are you talking about?"" Making me feel like I'm crazy. 

He makes me feel like I wish i was just dead instead, maybe he'd miss me then. I don't know... hopefully someone can give some input?"
305,"Some research came out some time ago re: BPD and the limbic system (the ""emotional control room of the brain)...

In a study review published in early 2013 in the journal Biological Psychiatry, a team of researchers from the University of Toronto compiled information from 11 different studies that used modern brain imaging technology to examine the neuron changes that occur in people with borderline personality disorder. On the basis of this information, the researchers concluded that people with borderline personality disorder experience two distinct alterations in neuron function. First, the neurons in the limbic system that play a role in determining a person’s emotional state undergo heightened levels of activity that result in a markedly negative mood. In addition, the neurons in the frontal cortex that play a role in regulating mood fluctuations undergo a decrease in their normal level of activity. Without the limiting actions usually provided by the frontal cortex, negative moods generated in the limbic system grow abnormally persistent and intense. 

What are people's thoughts about this? The likes of DBT are quite good at offering skills to limit the impact of this via behavioural changes but it makes sense why many medications are seen as less than helpful for this condition.

Personally I appreciate that there is a biological component to BPD. At the same time I will not accept this as an excuse for my own or other people's behaviour. Though finally we have more of a basis for why some of us feel as we do. :D"
306,"Hi everyone,

How are you doing? and how was Christmas? 

It's been a while.."
307,:(
308,"I'm actually not doing too bad with regards to BPD symptoms, well I don't think I am anyway. 
However, those thinghs are causing anxiety. 
I've also been experiencing weird dreams. 
Any ideas?"
309,"Well i honestly don't know why i keep doing this to my self. Same shit different day. A little lie turns into a massive thing for me and i over think it etc as i don't understand why tell a little lie if that's all it is. Quite a few months ago my gf bumped into her ex an ex she was with for 10 months 5 years ago but this ex is a cow not to me but long story. Well my gf came home said she saw this ex while walking dog this ex started crying saying i miss u etc my girlfriend said shes in a happy relationship and hope shes ok etc and walked away because the dog was kicking off shes a big dog hates strangers. So i believed her. We had a drink other night with a friend or two and my gf starts explaining as subject went on to exs and she said about seeing hers and that her ex was crying and then she said she tied dog up coz dog was kicking off, i confronted her about this and she was like dog was at side of me just put her lead on railings because she was pulling me and i thought noooo you only tie a dog up to fuckin chat.... what else she lying about and she went on about this ex not all good stuff but talking about her for prob a good 45 min. I just feel so angry about it and upset. 

I find it so hard to trust and i find my trust can be shattered by the smallest of lies, it sets my mind into over drive"
310,"Has anyone ever woken up and felt different? 

I Woke up this morning and my brain felt different, I feel different. Am I different permanently or temporarily? Can other people feel or see that I'm  different or is my differentness trapped in my mind?"
311,"Hey guys, here's a little bit about me. I am a 30 something female with Borderline Personality Disorder, a good career and now have an amazing life. I want to start by acknowledging that this is in no way meant to be professional help and I want you to understand that without seeking professional help you will never truly be successful at living with BPD. My mental health professional was able to help me learn coping techniques that have been invaluable. That being said, I want to share a personal experience that I am thankful for because it taught me so much.

I had just turned 30 and things in life were going well. I was well established in my career, I had an amazing boyfriend and literally have nothing that i could honestly complain about but something still seemed off. I had never had close friends and always attributed this to the fact that I stayed so busy building my life that they would just slow me down. I felt extremely connected to my boyfriend who I had been with for about 6 months at that point and I felt like I was on top of the world. Then things rapidly changed! I began to question my sexuality and I wasn’t sure why. I loved sex with my boyfriend but I felt like there was something better. I began seeking out women to talk to and I found it almost impossible to resist the urge to explore this. In the meantime my relationship suffered and I could tell we were both frustrated. I didn't understand why I found myself getting so annoyed with my boyfriend but it got to the point where the mere thought of seeing him was bothersome. I loved this man so much and I knew that in the back of my mind but something was happening that I felt like I had no control over. Unfortunately we parted ways and at the time I was really excited about now being able to explore the things I wanted to without worrying. We would still talk occasionally and I loved knowing that he still cared, it became almost like a power trip. This lasted very briefly before he drifted away and suddenly I realized that he was no longer there at all. I have all of these thoughts in my head of fear, anger, paranoia and a host of others that I could not make any sense of. I now felt so lost and alone, I found several woman to talk to and knew that I would end of having sex with one of them because I just had to know what it was like. The weeks went on and I felt more and more empty. I wanted the comfort of my boyfriend back but i still wanted to do my own thing, he was amazing, caring, intelligent and I couldn't understand why I had lost interest. There were so many things going on in my head that I decided to make an appointment with the local mental health center to see if they could help me make sense of it all.

After a few sessions the doctor told me that she believed I was experiencing BorderLine Personality Disorder with depressive tendencies. I was blown away, all I wanted was to make sense of my thoughts, not be told something was wrong with me. She helped me to understand why I was feeling the way I was and the likely cause of some of the decisions I had made. She helped me to discover why I had turned away from the man I loved and why I felt this crazy mix of feelings. She explained to me the concepts of Idealization and Devaluation which in short means that I first thought that this man had no faults at all and was absolutely perfect (Idealization) and then found him to be standing in the way of my true happiness (Devaluation). She explained that in a normal relationship two people accept each other's faults and work through them but for someone with BPD they are unable to do that without the proper coping mechanisms. I explained my issues with sexuality which she said was extremely common with BPD and that in itself may be what caused the devaluation of my boyfriend. I couldn't believe the things she was telling me, how could I have not seen this myself? It made so much sense as she explained all of the different elements of this diagnosis and explained so many things in my life. I was now in full blown panic mode, what had I done?

I knew I wanted to get my boyfriend back, I knew I loved him and realized now that I did not want to lose him in my life. How would I get him back, It had been over a month at this point and I was such a jerk to him. I had stalked his facebook a couple times and saw that he had been hanging out with new people and such, was it too late for me to save this? Did he hate me?  I reached out to him initially by text and asked him to call me. Normally he would have responded right away but this time was different. It was hours before he responded, I was so anxious, I wanted to explain to him all of the things I had found out about myself and what I discovered during my appointments. After what seemed like an eternity (roughly 4 hours) he sent me a text back. We chatted briefly and I asked him if we could meet and talk. He agreed, we met at the local coffee shop and I was filled with so much excitement, anxiety, etc. Would he reject me, or think I was crazy. I just wanted to talk to him, hear his voice and know if he still cared. It was awkward at first but quickly smoothed out. I felt like I was talking a mile a minute trying to get everything out. Once I explained everything I could see that he had sort of a bewildered look on his face, I was not prepared for what came next. He said he appreciated me sharing all of this with him but then asked so what is it you want now? Shit! I hadn't thought that far ahead, I got so wrapped up in making contact with him that I didn't actually think through what I wanted after that. I knew I wanted him back but I also knew I still had these feelings about my sexuality. I didn't know how to get the things I wanted without giving up anything else but I knew for certain that he was the one for me. I asked him if we could continue to talk and work through some things to see if there was a way to make it work. He was so gracious and understanding, he agreed to walk this path with me at least briefly to see where it went. Over the next couple days we talked like we had done when we first got together. It was amazing! I felt so close to him and so confident about life. I ended up going to his place to watch a movie and before I knew it, I was all over him. I had been so sexually frustrated that I couldn't wait to experience him again. We had the most amazing sex but immediately afterwords it was like a ton of bricks had fallen on me. He could see that something changed, I asked him if we could talk about some things further. We sat on the couch and talked for hours. I told him about the issues with sexuality, my impulse control issues and how close I had come to cheating on him when we were together. It was refreshing to get everything out in the open. He also talked through some things he had done in the relationship that he recognized he had done wrong as well. Relationships are tough for perfectly healthy people, much harder when one person has BPD. This man was patient with me and treated me like no one had ever treated me, I couldn't understand why. He agreed to go to a counseling session with me to better understand all that was going on.

Months went by and things were going well, we had both become well versed in the different aspects of BPD and the coping mechanisms each of us could use to help when there were issues. It was perfect…….except for one thing. I was still having these sexual urges towards women. I found myself day dreaming about it and often watching lesbian pornograhy. Sex with my now boyfriend again was amazing but I wanted so bad to see what it would be like to experience a woman. One night I sat him down and just had to get it out. I told him how I was feeling and that I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep control of the urges and impulses. He seemed to understand what I was saying but did this mean I needed to break up with him again? I knew I wouldn't give him up but I wanted this so bad. I finally just asked him if this is something he was willing to let me try. He was very hesitant to answer at first and I could see that this notion came as a surprise to him. He voiced concern about me leaving him again or falling in love with someone else. He was worried that I wouldnt enjoy sex with him anymore if I tried this and liked it too well. I recognized that in order to try it, there would have to be a mutual trust and understanding. He agreed but I could see that he was concerned. He knew I had to explore this feeling but was unsure how to go about it. We decided to work out a plan together. We would have some people over and if I could manage to gain the interest of one of the females I could discreetly take her to the bedroom. His only request was that he wanted to be in the house and that it would never happen without him knowing. I could tell he was worried about losing me but wanted me to be able to have this experience. The day came and things worked out amazing. I was able to slip away with someone without anybody except him noticing. It was an amazing experience, much different then sex with him. I realized that they were completely different, one was not a replacement for the other. There was never an emotional connection, it was strictly sexual. He absolutely had my heart and mind, I made sure he knew that! I was able to experience this a few times, each time I made sure he knew what was happening and each time he was in the house when it did. As I became more comfortable with this, I contemplated asking him if he would like to watch or possibly join. He was so awesome for letting me experience these things, could there be more to it? Fear quickly set in at this idea, would he like it too much, would he end up leaving me? I realized I was having the same concerns he was but to such a stronger degree. One of the most common indicators of BPD is the fear of abandonment and I realized that's what I was experiencing. By recognizing what I was feeling I was able to think through it. I brought it up to him one night and he was honestly shocked. I could see that he was extremely interested but didn't want to show it too strongly. To my surprise the first thing he asked is how would I deal with that? He had done so much research with me and he knew that it could be a trigger for me because of the BPD. We were able to talk through it and lay down some ground rules just like we did so that I could have the experience that I wanted. I won't go into details but I can tell you that it has been amazing and we are closer as a couple than we have ever been. It has expanded our relationship in so many ways in and out of the bedroom. We have actually decided to write a book to outline some things that we have now experienced as a couple, things that are far too taboo for this article.

I write all of this because I want people to understand that the way they might be feeling is normal and with help can be worked through. It was such a terrifying experience for me not being able to sort things in my head and not being able to understand why I was doing the things I was doing. I almost lost the love of my life and am thankful everyday that I didn't. For someone experiencing these things, get help!!  You can not do this alone!

If you have found this article because you're the one who lost someone with these symptoms, I wish you the best of luck. There are no guarantees what someone will do. I will tell you that you need to distance yourself. If my boyfriend had continued talking to me and affording me the comfort of knowing he was there I never would have known what I had lost. The person with BPD has to realize that you are the best thing for them, you can't make that decision for them. I would encourage you to move on with your life. If the person with BPD wakes up and realizes they have lost you, perhaps it won't be too late but you can not wait for them. Your life doesn't have to stop and shouldn’t,

It took me a long time to decide to write this but through reading forums and articles across the internet I realized that I was not the only one that had gone through something like this so I wanted to share my personal experience with the hope that I could help at least one person out there. Whether it’s an encouragement to someone with BPD or the person that has to deal with them, know that a healthy relationship can exist if both people are willing to work for it and be patient with each other. If you have BPD, have experienced losing someone and it's too late to fix it, keep these things in mind so that in the future a healthy relationship can exist for you.

Thank you for taking the time to read this article, I know it's rather long but this was my journey and I am glad I was able to share it with you."
312,"Does anyone else here find Christmas really tough and maybe triggering? For me it’s tomorrow and I thought I’d be ok. But today I feel like I’m falling apart I have to get through it for my family, but I’m not sure I can. Lots of tears and emotions today. 
it’s only one day......right. And I can get through it, I’m not sure. I’m with you whoever is finding Xmas really hard right now."
313,"Hi,
Do you manage to keep up a job? 
What do you do for a living?
Have you finished college?
I have bpd, depression and anxiety disorder.
I'm 22 and droped off college twice, first time I was doing great but then came the depression. I went to the hospital and after all of that I didn't feel like coming back. Second time I was more stable, taking meds, but after two weeks I realized all my symptoms are coming back and it's just to stressful for me. At least for now. For now I m working in a warehouse to afford living but i don't feel good there. Looking in a future I'm scared I won't finish any studies and will end up having badly paid job. Do you have any advice?"
314,"Hypersexuality since young age (5) Having vivid dark and sexual dreams and liking them. Manipulating games played as children and always wanting to play house or school so you and your friend could mess around. Enacting inappropriate scenes with my toys. Wrote a full page sex letter to a neighboring kid across from my apartment and leaving it under his door mat. (His mom called cps on my mom but nothing came from it) The going to sleep easier by fantasizing sexual scenarios in my head. Looking up porn online and talking to strangers in chat rooms cyber sex.

Expert liar. I started lieing at a very young age and was very good at it. I usually only lied to keep myself from getting in trouble. I'd hurt my little sister somehow doing something I shouldn't be doing and when mom was called I would blame it on her and watch her get the punishment with no remorse just relief.

Starting stealing before 10. I stole lunch money right out of backpacks in grade school. Would sneak and steal craft supplies from my 2nd grade teacher and got caught. Took 100$ out of my moms bf wallet and went to school one time thinking I'd get away. Regularly stole from walmart as a child and even used my little sister to help get more stuff out. Got caught once and it humiliated me and I stopped for a long while after that.

I hated school. Every bit of it. Cheated whenever I could and never could pay attention resulting in me failing second grade. Never quite fit in with kids my age after that. Getting sent to the office for saying inappropriate things to peers.

Stealing matches and lighters to build fire with in fields and woods.

Copy and pasting people's personalities and quirks that I admired to use as my own identity in hope to garner the same admiration they recieved by our peers. After each fp, bff, or bf I had I adopted aspects of their personalities or interests and made them my own and continued to after we split or parted ways. Never having a thing of my own.

Forgetting things often/Never being able to take care of or keep up with anything. Of value or not. I used to always forget school library/txt books outside and it would be missing for days and when I eventually found it it had rained and damaged the book beyond repair and my mom had to pay a huge fee. I did this more often than I care to admit. Or it was my cheerleading shoes or something I needed regularly.

Since 5 I would get up after my mom went to sleep at night and stay up all night until the sun came up watching Mickey Mouse club etc"
315,"I truly hate the holidays. 

It was never pleasant in my family. It was always loaded. Tons of gifts, stuff that other kids in the neighbourhood didn't get, all to make up for the year of abuse. Over time, the gifts meant nothing because they were, in effect, a trade off for the year of neglect and abuse;  I got more joy out of watching my friends play with my new toys, even quite young.

Over the years it became a highly tense period. There was always at least one fight that was explosive. And that didn't change as I grew up, even when I was living in the USA and only home for four days.

So Christmas has always been miserable for me. And I would often offer to work during the holidays and then give excuses to my parents why I couldn't go home. 

In the last five years as my mother deteriorated and became obscenely abusive as the brain cancer ate away at her, we didn't even celebrate. No tree. No presents. Just kind of gave up on the holiday.

My dad would go out on the back deck and put up a tree with lights on it. He did it for her because she went hysterical with the idea of a ""dirty"" tree in the house.

After she died, it was one or two small gifts to my dad. Usually nothing for me. No tree, no decorations. Nothing. Maybe a nice dinner that I'd cook.

So I already hate the holiday, but I'm trying to make it ok for my dad. He's fading, he can barely walk. In about six months he will be immobile and we will have to figure out what to do, because I can't lift him, I have to work. It will be a miserable time.

And he infuriates me because there's things he can do to help reduce the rapid pace of his deterioration. I bought him exercise bands, a chair that lifts him up, hand exercise devices, and he won't do any of it. It was a two month long fight to get him to drink an ensure every day. He gets into this helpless mode, like he did all my life with my mother, where he can't do anything or try anything he's too feeble.

He won't go to therapy to help with the depression, and he won't exercise to help with his physical deterioration.

The ""I can't help myself"" phases that he goes in and out of drive me bonkers. I get enraged. Because I know he can. 

And then I feel like an asshole for getting angry with him, because he's so frail.

He's been asking me to play cribbage with him for about two weeks now. I always put it off, because sitting across from him for a long period and having chit chat will lead me down the path of anger where he didn't protect me, he did nothing, he was feeble and weak against my mother all his life. He was feeble and weak against my grandfather who abused me. He is like an ostrich, he will put his head in the sand and hope it all goes away.

On a psychological level, I understand that he demonstrates the behaviour of an abused spouse. He was. For over 50 years. But she's dead and not here anymore, and I don't know what I can do to help him, while at the same time resolve my anger towards him.

So I finally said yes, let's play cribbage, while I cook the dinner. He yells that he's coming downstairs and I wait at the table for 30 minutes only to get up to find him in the living room and watching TV. Aggravated, I told him if he wants to play then head to the kitchen and sit down (it takes him 10 minutes to get from one room to another and seated), and I would go outside and have a cigarette. I come back 10 minutes later and he's sitting in the living room, he hasn't moved.

I explode. I feel disrespected. I am angry. But I also know I'm angry for more than just this. For everything. But I can't stop myself. And he withers away, wounded, and like I've beaten him. And I feel terrible, even though I've only shouted. 

So I'm a terrible person, and typing this out has started me crying because I don't know how to fix it. I don't know how  to reconcile my rage at the neglect with this person who needs me. I've spent the past 17 years taking care of them both. I gave up my career to return back to Canada to do it. I'm no saint, but I'd say I've done more than most kids have done for their parents, even with happy family lives. Because I had no choice, there was no one else to do it.

And I think a lot of the anger is that I think he's going to die soon. He's so frail. And I will be alone. Totally alone. And I'm afraid.

And then the angry little voice in me says, ""what a selfish asshole, this isn't about you.""

So, yeah, I hate the holidays.

Someone please help me sort this mess out."
316,How do i get over it? i see a psychologist but she hasn't paid much attention to this. i will talk to her again about it when i talk to her next but there's 2 weeks to go till then. I almost want to die out of shame.
317,"I'm going to start this off by saying I've never been diagnosed but I'm leaning towards wondering if I have bpd and cant get treatment so idk. I think I have a favourite person? but I'm not sure. with them I'll try to leave and I always end up going back? and it makes me really anxious and suicidal to think of us as not friends anymore and I get jealous when they imply that they have better friends. like really really jealous. I'm always scared to talk about stuff because I'm not diagnosed and I feel like I come off as dramatic but that's literally how it feels,, they could literally hate me and I'd still want to be friends"
318,"I have never felt like I had a personality. I grew up copying behaviours of others. To this day I live with other people's voices telling me how to think. Judging me. I feel as if I have no independent voice... All in my imagination of course. But if I stop thinking and all goes silent it's as if I am nothing. Does anyone else feel this? If there is nothing grounding, nothing constant... No me."
319,"My wife of one year left me 6 weeks ago. I have BPD. We were each other’s best friends for 5 years before we got married. I have been so lost, so empty in so much pain it’s unbearable. I’ve already spent a week in the hospital after a suicide attempt. When I got home she would text me to check on me and see how I was doing. How the dog was. How a job interview went etc. this all kept me hopeful. All my time and energy was spent in extreme hope she still wanted me and it would work out to checking my phone a thousand times a day hoping for word from her. When I realized she did a change of address and told me not to put her on my health insurance I finally swallowed the fact that she really is gone and we are over.

When this knowledge came to me (a week ago) I shut her cell phone off (it was on my account) changed my phone number, deleted my email account (I’ve used for 15 years) permanently deleted my Facebook account and any social media and messing service I have ever had all without telling her before I did it. I have completely redecorated my entire apartment (mostly with depression related art) the entire color scheme and feel of the place to where it barely looks like the same place. I even got a new bed. She literally has no way to contact me short of showing up as I can’t move right now.

It’s been a week now and instead of feeling any relief I actually feel worse. I break down in huge crying spells several times a day every day still, I still hold out hope..... today is Christmas Day. It was supposed to be our first Christmas together as a couple. I volunteered to work (a job I took after she left and doesn’t even know I have) I payed in bed and cried the entire 5 hours after I woke up before I had to come in to work. I feel as if I’m drowning. Like this sorrow, this pain is swallowing me down to a place I will never recover.....I’m so lost"
320,"I’m not yet diagnosed with BPD but I feel at this point in my life (after many many years of suffering and finally realising the issues I have and continue to experience could mean I have BPD) that I would benefit from therapy and therefore I’m considering talking to my GP to get referred.

However, I am not one to frequent the GP at all. I am in a professional job and I am already highly concerned I will be “outed”. In my opinion people do not understand or accept people with BPD and from what I’ve seen, people with BPD are often vilified. I am worried this will affect my whole life and I really don’t want this on my medical record but I feel like I’ve got no choice if I want to get help.

So, as you can probably tell, I am conflicted as it is and on top of that I feel silly booking an appointment to say to a doctor that I think I have BPD.

The reasons being:

1. I don’t want to put ideas in their heads by using the term BPD (I would hate to end up misdiagnosed if they just accept me saying “I think I have BPD!”) if that isn’t actually the case. I would rather have a therapist confirm to me without me saying it. But is this even an option?

2. I am fearful that my GP will roll their eyes at me and make me feel silly for trying to diagnose myself if I tell them that I have “read about it” or whatever.

If anyone reading this who has ever been to the GP to get a diagnosis, could you please share your story? I’m essentially looking for advice on what I could say.

Thanks"
321,"If I've upset anyone or hurt anyone or made anyone feel uncomfortable over the past few days I can only apologise wholeheartedly. It was never my intention to. It's been a very.difficult few days for me and I've been very detached and disoriented and genuinely never meant any harm. 
I had no one to talk to and nowhere else to turn and probably should have just stayed away because of all the hurt I've been feeling and negative thoughts I've been lost in.
So once again...I apologise for any offence I may have caused to anyone."

323,"I want to help a good person, he was alcoholic since 27 years, now he is 60 years old. He is in wheel chair now because a horrible accident, but now he is not alcoholic, he was singer but now he cant talk very good. Help to him is few things that puts me of good mood, not melanchoholic or so (my normal state)."
324,"Does anyone else hate being disappointed and let down. Literally was meant to meet a friend today who was up for going for a walk. Txt me 20 mins before saying meet them at 4pm then just as I'm about to set of they txt again to say they are tired Blah blah blah blah and won't be meeting me. It's constantly the same with this person.
And yes if you've read my other fourms it's the same friend I keep going back to so I know I'm the bloody idiot really.
But I'm not gonna let it get to me it's Christmas and I'm gonna enjoy it.
Anyway merry Christmas everyone hope your all good."

It but when I’m anxious that’s the first thing I think of just wanting to write really and just get it off my chest just feel so low today when really I’m surrounded my family that love me and that I love but just couldn’t cope with it all today just feel like I can’t do anything right piss my family off constantly with me being so over the top anxious arghh just don’t know what I’m feeling at the moment"

327,"Really struggling atm. Been hiding away for a while, haven't even got dressed for 2 days. Broke down and half an hour ago, it just came out of nowhere. Well, I broke down as much as I can. I can't cry anymore, I just tear up and blubber for a minute or two but inside I just wanna scream and explode. I lost the ability to actually cry this year.

Can't speak to anyone, I wasn't even fully open with my CCO on Monday during my appointment. I'm usually not like that. 

I hate this time of year. Another Christmas away from my daughter, and to cap it off one of the presents I sent her isn't gonna arrive.

I'm round a friend's on Christmas Day but tbh I'm not even sure I want to go. I've got nothing to offer their day and I think I'll be better off on my own. I can't even use Facebook either cos I got myself a 3 day ban, not that watching everyone's perfect family Christmases will be fun anyway.

I don't want to be here anymore. I never really want to be here if I'm honest but the pull of the pill bottle is getting stronger than it's been for a long while.

I've been accepted for DBT but the waiting list is 6 months. Can't really see a point to it right now anyway. 

If I die the world will be better off and so will I. No more feeling like this. I can't cope. I can't do it."
328,"Hi everyone, I have just joined this group as I thought it might help and I didn’t realise how many people would be on here which is so nice to see!

333,Hi all havnt made a post in over a week I actually felt good from Sunday to now. And now I feel restless I can't settle my thoughts are going 1000mph again. I feel weird like fidgety I can't concentrate on one thing and its hurting my head and I feel like going to bed even though its only 3pm here. Ugggh I seriously hate my life atm.
334,"First off, I hope this doesn’t offend anyone but it’s extremely relieving reading about the things other people have done or how they use to be before treatment. 
  A bit about me, I’ve been hospitalized 16x since the age of 14. I’m 25 now. I have for sure progressed in my mental health, but it’s a bit of an odd thing because I can’t remember exactly how everything was and is now and the only thing I have the base my results on are just how I feel lately and my daily motions. (I’m sorry if this is poorly written). As of late though, I’ve been struggling. It’s like all the progress I have made has suddenly disappeared and I’m back to being...well idk. I would like to say “myself” but I don’t agree with that being me. Which is funny because I have like 20 different me’s and I guess my irrational erratic me just isn’t a favorite. It’s so hard writing this because I don’t know what to really say. I’m spiraling out of control I think. I think. Dude seriously idk how to talk about this. I’m actually mood swinging in the making of this. It’s like when you reach out to someone because you’re freaking out but it takes them a while to respond and by the time they do you’re doing fine. Which I’m not fine, I just feel fine sometimes but then I go back to feeling like I’m dying. This all just really sucks, just please someone talk to me. I can do better if someone like idk initiates this."
335,"Several months ago while I was walking my dogs, a neighbor raised his voice at me, asking if I was the one leaving soiled dog bags on his gate. I told him no. I'm used to people yelling at me and confronting me about cleaning up after my dogs. They do it to me because our walks are long and predictable. I find it upsetting because I am the responsible parent of two bully breed dogs that LOVE people more than anything in the world and don't understand the hate against them. The few times I don't have a bag with me (meaning it has fallen out of my pocket), I retrace my steps to get the bags and come back to clean it up. Always. That has never happened anywhere near this man's house.

While walking my dogs in an alley, he came out of his privacy fence back gate today (I didn't know where he lived), cussing about something to someone on the phone, saw me walking my dogs, accused me of leaving my dog's bags on his fence. My dogs went to the end of their leashes to try to say hi (not barking or jumping, about 4 or 5 feet away from him) and he threatened to harm them.

Before progress, I would threaten him, get upset, call the cops and paint him as someone armed and dangerous and threatening me, possibly carrying a weapon, going up and down the street screaming and cussing. Then tell everyone in the neighborhood what he did, doxxed him online, seen if I could get him kicked out of the neighborhood, smeared dog/cat feces and urine all over his fence, and finished it off with ""Go Here Attractant"" spray. Needless to say, I've improved.

At first, I wasn't too upset but it grew as the day went on. I did what was right. I made a lot of hard but good decisions all day as well. And then this happened. I could have done something toxic like called the police and played the white woman card. But I didn't, and he won't be punished for threatening the animals I consider my children. He could easily do it again with no consequence. He could probably hurt my dogs without much consequence either.

I will avoid his house and carry mace though. And if he tries to get near me again, he gets ONE warning before getting a face full of pepper spray, enough kicks to the groin to end his family line, and a phone call to the police that he had threatened me before and he was coming at me despite warnings to stay away.

I'm so mad. I did what my therapy skills tell me to do and it was a negative to me."
336,"Good evening all, 

I am new to both participating in forums and BPD. I mean obviously, I'm not new to BPD but I have only recently received my diagnosis.

Anyway, there are a few things I want to discuss.. 

What coping strategies do people use to combat sadness? 

I often feel like there's no hope for me, that no one will ever love me and I'll have this terrible turmoil present for the duration of my existence. It makes me feel like I should end my life and even on the good days I feel I should end it soI can 'end on a high' as they say. Obviously, I know this isn't a constructive way to look at things and I want to get better, how do others deal with this? 

On the subject of getting better...

Do people get better from BPD? 

I feel like I have read a lot about how DBT/CBT can help people with BPD but do people actually ever 'get better' as such? I understand there might be downs throughout life because that's how it goes but do the downs get less bad? I don't know how I feel about the idea that I have to live my whole life with this brain. 

How can I stop invalidating others' feelings? 

When people express their feelings to me, especially in regard to my own actions, I don't understand why they feel like they do and I often tell them they're wrong/that's not how they're supposed to feel. How can I stop doing this? Since realizing I do this I understand it is, technically speaking, emotional abuse. I don't like the idea that I'm emotionally abusive. What can I do to stop doing this?

Do other people get a God complex?

I swing between thinking I'm not worth the dirt I'm walking on and thinking I'm a God on this earth and everyone else is beneath me. Do other people get this? I haven't found much about it.. Is this also a BPD trait or do I have a little bit of something else going on?


Thanks for reading. Sorry for rambling on a bit!"
337,"everyine thinks im fine as i hae a bf fir the first time ,im not"
338,"Honestly i have no idea what is going on in my head. I cant concentrate my thoughts are jumping from one thing to another. I feel so emotional i couldn't stop myself from crying so went to toilet to do it at work. i still want to cry now my soul my all being feels so sad, lost and the hell is going on"
339,"I have problems in the way I interact with people and form relationships. 

My perception of a person can change in the blink of an eye, when somebody does something wrong in my view I suddenly have a big distaste for them. However when they do something kind again I love them tons again. This isn’t the case for everybody but for a few people. 

When I fight with one of those people I also want to suddenly cut them off. I want to block them on everything and delete all the pictures that I have with them. As if I try to start afresh and forget about them completely.

Sometimes I also obsess over people. It was twice when this happened, one time in 7th grade. The second time was actually up until a hour ago!! I was very obsessed with and overbearing to a close friend of mine. She however is not comfortable with it at all and called me out for it. I got extremely upset and immediately wanted to cut all ties with her. That didn’t end up happening however since I realized my fault in thinking and I apologized to her.

So the big reason why I definitely don’t think I have borderline is because I don’t desperately try to hang on to ppl, it’s the opposite. 

I didn’t know where else to post this, so I thought maybe you guys could help? Considering you know from experience what it’s like to struggle with relationships. Hopefully someone will be able to help me out into realizing why I behave like this and how I can fix it. :)"
340,"Please help I'm on the verge of doing something really stupid.
I suffered a miscarriage on Saturday and my boyfriend and I had a big fight through alcohol that evening.
On Tuesday he texted me at 5.45pm when I was meeting a friend and told me he loved me. I came home at 7pm and he was in the middle of moving all of his stuff out - every last thing that belonged to him - into his dad's van and he wouldn't even look at me or talk to me to explain why.
Now he's ghosted me and I'm left alone with the flat with no idea what's going on. The abandonment is killing me. I've lost half a stone already and am physically ill.
Please help I'm really struggling to make it"

342,I just had to come on here because I am very close to hurting myself again. I have been going over and over things all night and I am drained. Last night I took part in a christmas quiz on zoom. One of the couples who happen to be my brother in law and sister in law were taking part too. They did absolutely nothing wrong but when I'm in their company I am zapped of all confidence. I end up hating myself. I feel sick to my stomach. What is wrong with me.
343,"I’m thinking I’m not the only one really struggling right now. It’s a really hard time of the year for me and probably many of you too. 
I’m struggling with bpd along with depression and anxiety and it just gets too much. I feel like I’m sinking, loosing the battle. I’m strong, but not strong enough. Sadly my coping strategies aren’t good ones. 
ive tried the good ones, believe me, journaling, walking, listening to sleep stories, music and others.
And they’re just not 
working now. 
I think the hardest thing for me right now is that I’m unmedicated with no support. My doctor said there’s nothing else for me to try. 
Some days I’m ok, but many I’m not. 
I don’t know when this will end, but it’s hard, so hard. 
And I’m truly sorry for anyone else going through this, because it’s tough and unbearable. Xx"
344,"It’s so hard to move on. He felt like he was everything I could have ever asked for and no one will be Like him again.  now nothing in life has any meaning and I can’t fully enjoy anything without the obsessive thoughts about him intruding. I find myself happy sometimes but only
For like 10 minutes at a time, then the sadness me angry set in again and at random times it feels so terrible it’s so painful physically.my period makes my s thoughts so bad I feel like I have to self harm,  and I don’t want to but I can’t seem to find any will to practice the  Alternatives, they just seem so dumb."
345,"For many years I've been seeking help regarding my mental health problems. I've been mis-diagnosed with bipolar. I know I have (and have been diagnosed with) major depression and anxiety. But I've always felt there was something more.
Well I've been seeing a new psychologist for a while and today I just told him I think I may have BPD. When I said this, I noticed he slightly raised his eyebrows briefly and my anxiety almost kicked in as if I was reading that he didn't believe me. Then he said ""Well I noted down on your first visit that you may have BPD'.
I actually felt an immediate sense of great relief! 1 - because he wasn't disbelieving me, and 2 - he basically confirmed my suspicions are more than likely correct.
Now, I'm not happy about this because I have a 'label' to put on it, I'm happy because I feel like I can gain a greater understanding of myself and WHY I sometimes feel, think, react and do the things I do. My whole childhood and teen years were traumatic, now I can see more clearly what effect it's had.

So a little more work needs to be done to confirm this, but I'm pretty sure that's what's been going on. I feel as though some weight has been lifted from my shoulders. First time that's happened in a long time  :)"
346,"How do you deal with knowing people find out about your depression and pity you for it?

Like people talk a lot, people like all managers above me at work know I have depression, and they always act like they pity me. It might be in their head they pity me, but I feel like they do."
347,"This post is just a little rant for me to let of some steam:
Everythings just going haywire in my head again.
I seriously have no energy atm work is becoming a drag to get through i just cant deal with people atm customers or collegues everyone is annoying to me.
Just want to stay in bed all day.
I come home and cba with anything but junk eating and sleeping normal past times that i enjoy like ps4 is something i just have no care for right now.
Dont wanna sit with family as i want to be all alone right now.
My friend says i should go walking or excrise but i dont think she fully understands i have no energy to move right now.
I dont want lose family or the little friends i have but at the same time i perfer being on my own most times. Makes my head hurt.
Just gonna go and have a good cry over nothing."
348,"I read an article that suggested that many women with BPD use sex as not a means for pleasure but as a means for taking control over their fear abandonment. They can play a compliant role in bed, essentially transforming into whatever pleases their partner in an effort to alleviate their obsessive fear of abandonment, and other negative emotions.

It also spoke of the hypersexuality but thats not as relevant to me so, Thoughts?

Article: ""Borderline Personality Disorder & Sexuality"" Dr Michael Aaron (psychotherapist)"
349,"Hey everyone, I know this is going to be long, but I need to tell my story. First off I was diagnosed with borderline personality a few years ago. Ever since my parents divorced when I was a kid I e struggled with my emotions as well as talking about them with anyone. My fear of abandonment, the distrust I have in women, knowing they are going to leave at some point, all stems from there. Ive always been afraid of friends, family, loved ones bailing on me when things got hard, I always imagined they would if I told them about my disorder. I can’t stand the thought of someone leaving me. I haven’t told any close friends or family about my disorder with the exception of my most recent girlfriend (we will get to her). I have always been ashamed, embarrassed even to think anyone knew something was wrong with me and thought I could manage this, even defeat it on my own. With the events of the last couple years, especially the last year I know that I need help and I can not do this on my own. I’m tired of watching myself destroy the relationships that are important to me. I no longer believe I can do this on my own and I am willing to openly admit I NEED HELP! 



Once upon a time I was married. It was lousy to say the least and I can honestly say even though I loved her, I don’t think I ever truly wanted to marry her, just kind of seemed like that was the natural next step and of course I didn’t want to be alone.there was an ongoing custody case with her ex husband weighing heavily on our relationship, causing stress and costing every dime we had. We didn’t spend any time together, we barely even spoke, I slept on the couch most nights because We didn’t want to be around each other. I was so depressed I would barely come out of my man cave. I ate, slept, everything in there.at times I was so determined not to come out I would even just pee in an empty drink bottle instead of seeing her and giving her a chance to be mean or hurt me. As things got progressively worse, I found out she was cheating on me. I had fits of pure self doubt, insecurities, and sadness followed by spurts of pure hatred and anger. I started going on every dating website I could find....during the sad times it’s because I felt so worthless I just needed someone to be interested in me, build my self esteem. During the angry times it’s because I was getting even. She ruined us financially, even taking out high interest loans in my name without me knowing, leading us to the only solution being file bankruptcy. Ultimately one night I told her I wanted a divorce. After a couple days as the fear of being abandoned set in I began to try and save a marriage I never really wanted to be in to begin with. I said and did everything possible but she had already gone digging to see the things I had been doing. As she threw all of the lies and cheating in my face I never said a word about the things she had done. I was still trying to prevent being abandoned. It was unsuccessful and I moved out of our house to my dads for a few months so she could figure out her plan. While I was gone, she changed the locks and put all my stuff in a storage unit. She then started seeing someone, having them sleep in my house almost every night according to my neighbors as well as going on vacations to the mountains and Orlando based off of Facebook posts. The 4 years we were married I always asked for us to take a vacation and never got one, mo the of being with a new guy and she’s traveling every other weekend. 

When I stopped assisting in laying the bills in our house she stopped paying them altogether. One day the mortgage company called telling me I was 4 months behind and if I did t get current working 15 days they were going to begin the foreclosure process. She left and I went back to my home, where nothing was left except my dogs, in all fairness that’s all I was worried about. I found a way to pay the back mortgage and utility bills. I made every bankruptcy payment without her help and have Paid all the bills related to the house alone for the last almost 4 years. Because of the bankruptcy it would’ve cost me a small fortune to divorce her before it was over in legal bills, refusing bankruptcy, etc so I never moved forward with divorcing her, but I’ve spoken about her our situation as it was over.i tried to distance myself as much as possible from that nightmare. It was the only way to keep from feeling completely worthless, like a complete failure, and from being completely insecure. (Keep that in mind as we continue) 



A little over two years ago I met a woman through my traveling for work that I instantly knew was something special. I remember the exact spot where I fell in love with her, the specifics of that encounter. I asked her out that day and she turned me down, but she stayed in my head. I constantly though about her, I would call her store sometimes just to hear her voice and I would look for reasons to ha e to go there. Fast forward a year from when I fell in love and she shot me down. I had to drive an hour to her store to pick something up for one of my customers (mind you I volunteered to do this so I could see her). I got there and she looked beautiful, I could barely take my eyes off of her. After we loaded up my truck, I stood outside talking to her and her boss for probably an hour. The connection I felt before was still there, even stronger and I knew I loved her and there was no changing that, she was definitely something special. I left that day with a huge smile on my face, trying to figure out how to ask her out again. The whole ride home I kept checking my Facebook hoping to hear something from her and finally a message shows up, my heart damn near jumped out of my chest. It was one of the single greatest moments of my life. Remember she believes I am divorced. I know if she knew I wasn’t yet (I was still paying off the bankruptcy) she would never give me the time of day and I couldn’t stand to think I would never have a chance with the woman of my dreams, the girl I knew I loved a year before she even agreed to go out with me. (She had her own reasons) things started out great, I couldn’t have been happier, more certain I had finally found “my person”. As our relationship continued I had bouts of mood swings, attitude and anger, sadness, that sometimes came from nowhere and fears of abandonment grew. The thought of losing someone so perfect, “my person” began to terrify me. Maybe I thought if I ran her off and control her leaving she wouldn’t be able to abandon me on her choice and break my heart. I received an email from tinder which I had honestly forgotten I still had. I logged on to delete it but before I did I swiped a little while. Insecurities of “knowing” she would leave, I don’t know why I did it. I came across a girl I thought I went to school with and a girl that looked like a friends little sister. I screenshot both and was going to look on Facebook later to confirm. Although the reason behind that was completely innocent the fact is, I was still on tinder looking and swiping and there will never be an excuse for that. One night on the couch she saw the screenshots and it completely changed the face of our relationship. Fights and complete distrust ensued for the next few months. I have not done anything like that since and never would again, but of course she can’t trust that anymore. Several months ago I told her about the bankruptcy and explained a little bit of it because I had just finished paying it off. (She is the only person I’ve even told I was going through that) about two months ago she begins to question if I’m actually divorced, after arguing for a while I finally break down and tell her the whole truth. A couple nights later I breakdown and tell her about my borderline personality disorder. I have lied and hurt the woman I love more then anything else in this world. It’s been several days now since we’ve spoken and I’m miserable. I have tried to stay away and not contact her to make sure that my pain, my misery is because I truly love her and want to be with her and not just my fear of being alone. Ive realized the last few days that the reason I miss her so damn much, isn’t because I don’t want to be alone, it’s because she truly is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with, without a doubt. Truth is, if it weren’t for that fact I may not be here sharing my story. I know I need help, but Ive always been so ashamed to talk about what’s wrong with me that if it were not for her I most likely would t be sharing. I love her more then anything and there isn’t a single thing in this world I won’t do for her. I’m sure it’s probably too late for us to have a future but i still need to change and get help. Hopefully my efforts will show her that I can change, I can be the man she needs, and we will have the life Ive dreamt of for us. Bottom line is I know I need to get help, I know I need to change how I am, not just for her, but for me.I know my life won’t be as great as it could be until I learn to live with and manage this disorder instead of trying to hide it and fight it but losing her these last several days was the wake up call I needed. If she never speaks to me again, I will always love her, and I will forever be in her debt. She saved me from myself! Thank you for taking the time to read this, believe it or not this was the short version. I don’t expect anyone’s pity, my actions are to blame for everything that has happened, I just want to get better, move forward with life and I just pray to god she will be there to support me and be by my side. I have to start getting comfortable talking about my disorder, fears, everything. I’m starting with all of you, breaking down the walls of shame and embarrassment. Thank you all for being here. I’m glad I’m taking this step"
350,but i feel the need to say something
351,"Everything I do revolves around you, and whether or not you actually like me and think I'm good enough for you. 
You may be spending your time on the computer, playing your favorite game. Considering your attention is NOT on me, I can conclude that you think I'm hideous and want nothing to do with me. Or when you dont come to bed with me....you must truly hate me. My thoughts hardly ever seem neurotic to me. 
When I come to the conclusion that you hate me, I distance myself from you and make myself angry at you. I play fictional scenarios in my head until I am telling myself that I hate you. The whole time you're innocently playing on the computer, unaware of the painful gymnastics I go through in my head everytime that I am not the center of your attention and affection. I cant live without you. 
My dangerously low self esteem ignites my fear of abandonment. I do not feel beautiful, attractive, intelligent, important, etc. I am a festering sore on the bottom of society's foot. I should kill myself. 
The turbulence inside my head causes me to break down every once in a while. The difference between today and previous times is that I am alcohol and illicit drug free, minus marijuana of course, and I'm not self harming. Thanks for letting me share."
352,"I dont really know what to say just wanted to tell someone, I feel emotional, drained, sad, irritable and lonely even though ive got people round me. Im thinking of ending my relationship but feel like am i thinking this due to how im feeling and wait and see how i feel once my new meds start working ? I just feel so unsupported by her shes took no real interested in how i am at present and she knows im having a hard time. She's just so focused how she's feeling. she got the face on because i said Friday i might not feel up to going to see her family friend as im very emotional this week my mental health starting new meds and the anniversary of my grandads death on Saturday. Then i don't know if she thought i was asleep but she knows im very in and out of sleep. I heard her talking to her self saying she wished she could go bk basically in time she would jump at it preferred her life then this isn't who she is now etc and she had an ex boyfriend she stopped all contact with when she met me and she download on to my phone as hers is broken a video of some flowers he bought her. my lesbian by the way and she's bi looking at us u would think it to be the other way round lol. but ye now i dont know what to do."
353,"Hi and thank you first of all for taking the time to read this.
I have sleep disorders not diagnosed but ive been like it since young i sleep talk sit up while asleep etc.

More recently i have been suddenly jumping up awake and cant even remember  any dreams and twice now im fully asleep and suddenly open my eyes and i just stare its like it takes a while for my brain to register im awake. My vision is shakey and if i move my hand for example my hand shakes same if i move my leg etc i have to close my eyes for a few mins then im ok i go back to sleep. Its actually really scary, any idea what it could be or have you experienced anything like this x"
354,"Hi everyone. 
First I want to say it has been amazing to read your posts, thank you. Your thoughts help me understand someone I care about very deeply. BPD is something I knew very little of until I met her - I will call her Eden - and I think that is the same for the vast majority of people. Some people close to me have said don't get involved etc like others here have spoken about. But I have never had a deeper connection with anyone (I am 51 and she is 35) and although we only met last September I cannot imagine life without her. In this time period I left my wife (this was in process before I met Eden), I lost my father to covid and I am in a state of professional change. My relationship with Eden keeps me going and if I can help her then that makes me happy. It is reassuring to hear about some of the issues raised here regarding relationships, the triggers, episodes and how you deal with them and the people around you. Eden has had serious drug issues and some suicidal tendencies. I find it heartbreaking and just want to help. I would be happy also to give my viewpoint about how I feel as someone in a relationship with a BPD person.

355,"Hi, I'm new here. Just recently diagnosed with BPD but have been suffering for a very long time, as well as with an eating disorder (BED) and other mental health issues. Currently on two prescribed medications. I'm glad I found a forum/support group so I have people who understand me and this disorder. I don't feel as alone. 

Just went through an extreme episode tonight from an abandonment/rejection trigger. I guess my question is, what do you all do during a severe episode/trigger? I have no idea what I can do to distract myself, it absolutely consumes my entire being. Thank you.."
356,"It sucks.

Anyone want to talk?"
357,My body's mangled after breast cancer.  My brain is fxxked after a drug rape.  Mum died in July she had schizophrenia and I had been trying to look after her for years. Struggling to hold it together I want to scream.  I'm scared of the dark it's a daily torture there's no relief.
358,"ok so i have history of badness ,severe badness

but
just had a lovely long talk with my aunt ,cheered me up
and i have bf and sister ,aunt star ,nephew ,god im lucky and im sorry if i complain a lot but i feel ill lots ,i know i should be well will all the love and support i have but as i say ,severe history of badness in my life

im loved and im lucky x
bless you all x Lu x"
359,i don't know what to say
360,"What do you think when people say this to you?
When people say this to me, it angers me"
361,"Well it all started last weekend, we had an argument about her talking to someone she was friends with before we met but ended the friendship when we got together as this person was in love with her willing to leave his partner and child for her. Obversly i had an issue especially because she has such a problem with who im friends with especially males even though im lesbian and shes the one whos bi. Well after this argument she said she was sleeping at her friends (not the same one)  etc which she didnt apparently she was proving a point that she doesnt have to stay in and be a home buddy she can be that partner thats out all the time if she wanted basically i should appreciate whats shes like and trust her. She got face on yesterday about her medication still been at chemist and i said its your meds i forgot u should remind me if u wanted me to get it. Well that night she shaved all her hair off, shes wanted to for a while but i loved her hair so she kept it. She said she shaved it off to prove a point thats she will do what she says i shouldnt piss her off etc and do what she asks and stop arguing.  What do you guys think of this as im really confused."
362,"I'm not proud of the way I treat my closest friends when things get bad. Sometimes I get so angry thinking that nobody cares about me that I lose control of my emotions and of what I say to people I'm attached to. When I've calmed down I realize that I wasn't in control of myself and I apologize to the people I bothered and try to stay away, but I always do the same thing. I don't know how to rely on myself, I have to talk to someone when I feel bad, otherwise I feel like I'll go mad. Unfortunately the friend I always bother with messages has to cope with his own issues too and I feel like I'm making things worse for him. It can't be healthy to read about someone else's issues every week when you have your own demons to battle. I don't want to hurt other people. I thought that talking to people about how I feel would help me heal, but I was wrong. It did help me feel less ashamed of being so sensitive and needy, because I know this isn't the real me if I'm aware that it's not normal, however talking doesn't change the fact that I often still have no control over my emotions. 
I don't think there's anything that could fully heal me. Things aren't always so bad but when they are it all gets out of control. I'm not mentally or emotionally stable and I'm worried that it's affecting my friends as well. Do you think that it would be helpful if I stayed away from people for a while? I can't completely cut off everyone since I have my studies and I still live with my family, but I'm thinking that maybe having minimal interactions with people could help me, until I feel more stable and in control. Because if even this doesn't work, I don't know what will. 
People are my biggest trigger, I believe. I can't have healthy emotional connections with people. I either can't connect at all or I get too attached and crave their attention and love so much that no matter how much I get, it's never enough and I need more. I constantly think about wishing that something bad would happen to me so that people would care and give me their support. I feel jealous of the people who are troubled and get love from others, while very few people know how much I struggle because I'm socially awkward and too shy to talk to most people and look for help and support. It's shameful, but I can't will it away. I've promised that I'd change so many times and always failed to keep my promises, it's not something that I can change."
363,"i feel unwanted ,and i know im being selfish because i get loads of replies i just feel like i don't belong here anymore
its probably because im not well but this place is all i have to socialise and i don't know what i would do without it and if i wasn't wanted x"
364,"Okay so I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for about 2 years now. At the time, I was seeing multiple psychiatrists that literally could not decide between BPD or bipolar depression until finally one concluded that my symptoms correlated more with that of those with BPD. 

Soooo today I woke up at literally 3am (don't even remember going to sleep) and could not go back to sleep so I went to the gym at 5am and left at like 7am. I've been wide awake and HUNTING for shit to do when like I guess I could be future-planning??? who knows. ANYWAYS the point is I have been hyper active and literally just more social and energetic than before. And I'm also looking for any bullshit item to spend my money on when I should be saving it. Um okay where was I. 
Yes I'm typing this as I'm thinking. 

I also like had a few shots of liquor before work two days ago which I NEVER do but I won't exactly say its ""OUT of character"" for me...even though I've never done it before lol if that makes sense. My therapist has also never had a concern with me being alcoholic but he's aware that I do like drinking (a lot) prob once a month. (I also haven't seen my therapist in 3 months because one day I just decided ehh Im good but I miss him) But like I have to work today and the only thing on my mind is like how much should I drink before??? So yea, there's that problem. 

But I am writing this to say I feel extremely manic or am experiencing hypomania and one way of deciphering between BPD and bipolar disorder is the fact that mood swings in bipolar disorder are not triggered by events like BPD. But I don't believe this mania was triggered by anything???? SO DO YOU GUYS THINK I HAVE BPD, BIPOLAR DISORDER OR I SHOULD JUST GO SeE MY FUCKING THERAPIST??? (but wahh I don't want to see him and I have no idea why)."
365,"I feel like just writing down a short story of bits of my life its by no means the worst life but just feels crap for me.

So I start when I finished school 2006 I had plenty of good friends coming out of school but some dropped contact after awhile but I had other friends and new friends from college.

Fast forward 2011 most of my school friends had no contact with me by this point and I was in my final year of college so still had friends from there but I didn't get into uni which is were everything started to go wrong.

I was out of work from 2011 till 2015 I live in a small area in the UK so jobs can be hard to come by I was on benefits which was soul crushing for me as I hated feeling like the ppl who work there would judge you. And even considered suicide as I felt worthless.

So over those few years everyone who I considered my friend was gone. Didn't see them or talk to them anymore if I tried I got no response.

I started my job at the start of 2015 which improved my mood but after making friends at work and them just leaving and never talking to me again by 2017 I gave up getting close to people until this year.

This years been difficult and not so much to do with covid tbh.

But I feel I bottled all me emotions up for so many years that this year I just let them come out and now can't handle it.
I love someone one day hate them the next.

Feel like ppl are lying to me and I have serious trust issues as the word friend means alot to me and not a word I just use with everyone.

I can't cope with day to day anymore and sleep is all I enjoy.

I hate feeling like ppl only talk to me cause they feel they have to as we are stuck in the same building together (school college and work) I feel like everyone I've called my ""friend"" comes up with excuses to not be around me.

I think this year I've had more breakdowns than any other year. 
I've done things this year I regret like paying for sex just to feel something to feel loved i guess but always regret  my choice when I leave. 
Gambling my money away has been a huge problem. Over eating crap and now started smoking again.

But day by day I'm learning im trying to get stronger not letting things get to me so easily. 
I'm gonna start going to therapy to talk to someone to better control myself I hope.

Anyway I hope you read all that and if you did thank you im sure it felt a little all over the place but just needed to write something down.

Hope you all good 
💚💚💚💚"
366,"I know that I dont want to do that thing. Is just ""that"" that possess me and the I can't stop.

Why not another symptom?
Why just to do things for avoid pain or whatever that is inside me?

Why I must to face consequences of ""that"" who possess me.

Why is too much hard to get peace and do a conscicious desition???"
367,"I was 16, I’d just come out of inpatient for a suicide attempt, I was still suffering, I met a guy online and we sent each other nudes for a few months. I absolutely hate myself for it, makes me feel gross and horrid. I did it as a form of impulsive sex and self harm and to degrade myself and make myself feel worthless.

I blocked him and it’s been a year and a half now. But I got a message on Instagram from a stranger saying hello, just like normal I block these people. But then I get a message on my other account, “block me again and I’ll leak your nudes with your face in them” from the same account.

I don’t know what to do and I’m crying so hard. I hate that chapter of my life, I was so ill and dumb and I wish wish wish I never did it and I don’t get why I did and I’m sure it’s probably just one of those accounts out there that try to get shit off of people but I don’t know what to do. I can’t go to the police without family finding out and I just don’t know what to do. I’m in so much distress. I tried to report the messages and account but Instagram are absolutely useless and said they didn’t see a problem.

Please please give me advice or help me. I’m such an awful person and if it gets round I won’t be able to live with myself. Please I don’t know what to do."
368,looking for some kiwis on here :P it'd be great to start a kiwi tread! (couldn't find one)
369,"I struggle with this because what someone else might consider something bad that someone does as a little thing, I consider it a big deal.  So if someone is saying nice things about me to my face, then I hear them saying horrible things about me and laughing to another person when they think I can't hear, it really affects me. Anything can make me want to either end a friendship, relationship or leave a job.  Whereas another person might just brush it off  or let it go.  

I often have the impulse to do this when someone offends me or does something I don't like.   At least once a week at work I want to leave because say I did a really good job on something, worked over and above and someone picks fault with a tiny thing about it.  Then I just want to walk out and never come back.  Or if I say something and the other person rolls their eyes then I feel like I don't want to talk to them again. 

Or if a partner does something I consider unacceptable in a relationshi, or if they say something that really upsets me, then i want to end the relationship, I can do this then later regret it and think I was too harsh but that can be what I do.  Anyone else feel like this."
370,"Hi I am new here. I have a very long history of severe mental illness. I was in in patient for eating disorder and then sever depression for about 8 total months when I was 19-20 (35 now). I only just a month ago had a therapist finally suggest I had BPD. And JFC I have every GD symptom except the extreme reckless behavior (no drugs, alcohol, speeding, spending, etc). But everything else has just been a run on sentence.

As with everyone else COVID royally screwed me over. Our business was forced to close due to it and we are saddled with debt. Wetook jobs we hate because we need then and we still can’t even afford the freaking $1300/month premium through the employer. I can’t afford presents for my kids. My 8 year old niece died this spring just was found dead in her bed no reason.

Because of the sudden loss of the business that was my current way I defined myself I am lost. I don’t know who I am without some thing to throw myself Fi to and “become”. Does anyone else do this? It’s like I am nothing without something external defining me. I used to be obsessed with working out. I can’t simply “workout” I must be the BEST at what I am doing. Is this kind of extremes what other people experience?

because of this I am very lost and adrift right now. But having got this DX I feel like I can’t trust myself or my opinions. Who I thought I was was a lie I just keep reconstructing to fit whatever the current narrative was. It is very disheartening.

On the other hand I feel better having answers to these whiplash mood swings and intense anger that has grown so bad over the last 1.5 years. I started an antipsychotic lutuda with my Wellbutrin as I wait to get therapy but I feel so numb sometimes. When I get really depressed it’s like my brain shuts off and I’m just a shell. And I can’t snap out of it.

I don’t know where I am going I just am happy to find other people going through the same thing most things on the internet make it sound like an impossible DX. Which helps literally no one to read."
371,I didn't self harm for a long time (2 years) but now I am having urges to do it all the time. Anyone else BPD like this? I feel so desperate but I can't talk to anyone because no one seems to understand my mental health and all would think I need sectioning if I told them that. What do you do when you feel like that? It's really overwhelming :(
372,"So I've been living with my diagnosis now for about 3 months.  Its been 3 months since my wife left with my children, and my world fell apart.  During this time, I've learned a lot about BPD.  I've become much more self aware, and also more aware of my symptoms, and what seems to make them better or worse.

Sleep has a massive influence on how I feel each day.  Sadly, its something I really struggle to get enough of.  Normally I'm lucky to get more than about 5 hours.  Sometimes I might get back to sleep after a couple of hours up, but its rare.  On a bad night it can be completely sleepless (rare), or maybe only a couple of hours.

My doc has prescribed me Zopiclone for years, however, these days its effectiveness seems to have become limited.  It'll work for 1 night, if I've not been taking it for a while, but then on the second night, I may as well have not taken it at all.  On top of that, I crave it - which I don't particularly like.

Is it normal to have big sleeping problems with BPD?  What're your experiences?  Have you found anything that helps you overcome the issue?  I've tried everything I can think of, from herbal OTC pills, to melatonin - nothing seems to have any positive effect.  I seem to have some sort of strange alergic reaction to Nytol.  I have an appt with the doc on Monday - if there's an alternative medication I should be trying, it'd be useful if I can start the appt with that knowledge.

Any advice gladly welcomed.

Thank you x"
373,"God i wish i could just go 2 bloody days feeling good but 1 tiny little thing makes me overthink and overreact im just fed up feeling like this again.

I woke up in a general bad mood (i want to fight)

375,"Hi there! 

I'm a 28 yo female. I have a diagnosis of BPD, bipolar, PTSD, anxiety and depression. It took me a couple of years, but I finally got approved for SSI in April of this year due to not being able to hold a job throughout my lifetime; with the BPD being escalated from emotional and verbal abuse of my ex for several years. 
I also completed a year long DBT program in August. I hope to find a peer support position in DBT to help others in the program that are struggling.
I don't have many friends because most people in my area shun mental illness and don't/won't understand it. So I really wanted to reach out to a group of like minded individuals with whom I can relate with. 
But I hope to become friends with some of you and be an active member here."
376,"Hey im new here ive been looking for a place to talk to as i feel i have no one i can talk to so i hope ive posted this in the right section.

My So Called ""friend"" only seems to talk to me when she breaks up with her Boyfriend.  

Im fed up of being there for her when she has a breakup with him that only seems to last a few days then she goes back to him then never replies to my msgs or calls until the next episode. 

Should i tell her how this is making me feel as a person who has BPD (which she knows ive been suffering lately) this messes with my mind a fair bit aswell. 

I really like her but cant take this feeling of only existing when she chooses."
377,"Does anyone else just enjoy sleeping when there mood changes and they feel low? 
I was just thinking when i go into that bad space in my head the only enjoyment left is sleeping. I can end up sleeping for 15 hours sometimes yet still always feel tired when im awake so sometimes i just end up in a horrible circle.
Just want to see if anyone else does this and feels this way."

379,"as someone with BPD, what are some things that have been helpful to you over the years? either things you have said to or done for yourself or things other people have said to or done for you?

i know the obvious - therapy, dbt - but i'm looking for something more specific. 

i am not expecting some easy answer that's going to make everything magically better - i'm just genuinely asking what has been helpful to you?

thank you for your time!"
380,Hey just wanted to post a postive post as im in a good mood tonight i hope who ever reads this is to 🙂 im gonna play assassins creed valhalla tonight and enjoy the fact im relaxed for a change. Whats everyone else on with ?
381,"I haven't posted in some time so I thought I'd check in real quick.   Life has been progressively getting better over the last month or so, with the exception of a wave of panic attacks about 10 days ago.  I was taking a shower and it just hit for no reason I can fathom.  Started at about 6:30 PM and was hit by waves of it until about 3:30 am.  My initial thought was, I'm dying, which I immediately put down to being in panic mode.  The next day was just dealing with the hangover, I was just worn out.  It took about a week before I felt right again, had some minor aftershocks but nothing even close to what I had experienced before.  Years of therapy kicked in and I was able to deal for the most part well.  My only real issue now is taking a shower, there is a slight fear it would happen again. It hasn't stopped me from showering, there is  just a little anxiety over it.

Overall though I feel pretty good, and with that I feel very blessed.

As always thank you for letting me post."
382,"can you distract me with good things in your lives? I'd like to know you guys are doing well, it'll make me feel a little better."
383,"Hello. I just joined today. I'm a 23-year-old girl who suffers from BPD, OCD, depression and social-anxiety.
I have needed a big brother since I was young in an overwhelming way. Because I couldn't be close to people in real life I sought that online. I got attached to many people who I probably didn't matter much to. After 10 years of searching I still don't have a big brother. I'm still alone and desperate. A big brother is the only kind of relationship that means something to me. I really wish I could find a guy who needs a little sister as much as I need a big brother. All the big brothers I had loved their girlfriends more than me. I hate romantic love so much because of that. I really wish I could stop being alive. Life is extremely painful."
384,"my boyfriend hermit ,told me to come in the kitchen earlier ,he gave me a hug and said 'Lu ,i love my life with you'
i thought that was so sweet and it made me cry x"
385,So I went to my doctor today and they told me there’s nothing more they can give me in the way of meds or counseling for my bpd. As I’ve tried most meds with no success. I was hoping against hope that there was just a wee bit of hope left. I know I’m not strong enough to keep going with no support or meds. Now I can see exactly why my beautiful brother lost his life to this cruel disease. I’m devastated and in tears and in a really dark place right now.
386,"Im really annoyed now i feel i have to rant my thoughts down. But i have a friend i considerd a good friend. 
So we work together and ive sometimes asked her to hang out via txt but now i think about it she never responds or says she busy. So today we finished our shift at the same time for first time and i said we should hang out for a bit she said yeah then my thoughts a few minutes later were saying she will find an excuse to get out off it.
So what happend a few hours later she found an excuse. I just feel annoyed everyone in my whole life finds an excuse to not hang out with me and im fed up with it.
Rant over thanks for reading :)"
387,"I'm really struggling during lockdown with comparing myself to my boyfriend's exes. Although most people tell me I'm very attractive, I can't help but notice my partner's exes were all blonde haired and blue eyed, while I'm dark haired with green eyes.

Sometimes I can go weeks without thinking about this then suddenly I'll try to push my partner away, telling him to go back with his exes (who he wasn't really in a relationship with) and I pore over their pictures until it eats me alive.

At the start of the relationship he was still messaging a few of them as a friend (I saw the messages) but he hadn't told me he had been with them until I found out by snooping later. This really affected my trust and triggered me as I've been badly betrayed by at least 3 ex partners.

But fast forward six months and I'm still struggling with the situation, thinking he prefers anyone, no matter how attractive or unattractive) if they have blonde hair. It drags me down so much and I fear I'll never let this go."

389,"I want to go no contact with my wife's parents, but not her brother and his wife. They have a baby girl and my nieces and nephews are a light in my life. Their daughter is the only way I can get through seeing my inlaws because she is a distraction. All the attention is on her and she makes me calm and happy when she is around. When she needs a nap or they leave, time with my inlaws is torture. All i want to do is escape.

The problem is my parental inlaws live 5 minutes from my wife's brother and wife. We live 2 hours away. When we come down to see them, my parental inlaws expect/are expected to attend as well. Wife's brother thinks we are overreacting and wants us to let my parental inlaws be the way they are because that is how they have always been, they will never change, and family is more important.

I can gray rock my inlaws when they are around but it would be obvious that I am only there to spend time with my niece. I don't think wife's brother would keep my niece from me, but I'm afraid it'll make things super awkward and I will get called out for it.

Does anyone else have this issue? It means the world to me to be in my niece's life in a positive way."

392,"for mental health? 
(Not to heal themselves but an actual online course where mental health is the subject of the study.)
A few months ago I completed a Mental Health Awareness Course and gained a certificate and some sort of qualification. It kept me busy when I wasn't working, so I'd like to find another one."
393,"Today I slept in the longest I've ever slept in before because earlier this morning I had a freak out. It wasn't loud or obnoxious but rather out of the blue and emotionally revealing. I've been going through a lot of emotional burn out and it leaves me feeling numb. There's a lot to unpack but I told myself I'd take a break by just taking one feeling at a time. I've realized when I do that I feel more in control of myself. It's times like these that makes me feel like my mind is spinning doughnuts inside my head. I'm forgetting to do simple tasks like brush my teeth and change my clothes. I've been forcing myself to get up to do those tasks and then I go back to sleep. By the time I get up, it's only a few hours from sun down due to daylight savings. I already have somatic symptoms of depression, especially irritability, so seasonal depression is a downer to end all downers. I try to do things to conserve myself energy by taking naps or having the occasional caffeine like green tea, but I end up getting a sinus headache. This time of year makes me hopeful and cranky at the same time, but I'm at least trying to stay motivated, even a little bit.

As far as BPD goes, I honestly don't know if I'll ever get better. I go through consistent highs and lows and nothing seems to give me a sense of relief. There are times when I've wished for someone to hold me and tell me, ""It's okay, it'll all make sense eventually"" or ""You're as bad as you think you are, you're not wrong for feeling the way you do."" I like to think my thoughts are just malevolent creatures that found their way inside my head with the purpose of turning me against myself. I decided not give into them this time because now I know that trying to fight them won't work in my favor. I need to take time unpacking every feeling, thought, and emotion that occurs. I feel like if I do that each day, I'll become lighter and lighter until I can sense freedom. I've realized when I teeter-totter my symptoms, I'm actually just gambling with those demons. I've done being a prisoner of my mind because it creates a false reality where I'm the hero and the villain. I've realized no one's free from making mistakes and it's a necessary aspect of growth that I'm used to demonizing because of my perfectionist tendencies. If I'm so knowledgeable about my situation, can I allow myself to let things go?

Nothing can hurt me if I don't allow to get to me. I have a choice to choose what affects me. I should allow myself to get to the bottom of whatever's bugging me without it attaching itself to me. If I allow myself to see myself as someone worth celebrating than I'll eventually become that person. I remembered something my mother told me years ago when I was being bullied at school, ""Feed the good wolf, not the bad wolf."" The good wolf represents reinforcing positivity, not necessarily avoiding negativity. While starving the bad wolf means avoiding intrusive thoughts that are backed by facts. Now that I remembered this advice, I'll use it from now on but it'll need practice.

It's a confusing and depressing time that has battling feelings of discontent and numbness, but I'll survive it with my dignity intact. I'll continue to cultivate an identity, these demons won't win this time around."
394,"Context for the recent events:

I have a rocky relationship with my grandmother, as I do with everyone in my life, but especially my grandmother because she treats me worse than my siblings. My mom also notices that she does it as well, and my mom is not crazy like me so its not my mental illness perceiving things wrong. 

For Example one night in the middle of the night I woke up and my grandma was ringing the door bell and knocking on the front door (I assumed she locked herself out) so I got up and went and opened the door. when she saw me she started accusing me of locking her out and I said I couldn't have because I literally just got up, but she didn't believe me and then the next day she told everyone in the house that I locked her out of the house that night. My mom tried to defend me and say she doubted I would do that but my grandma just flipped out and told her that I wasn't a nice person like my mom thinks.

So established: Grandma doesn't like me and accuses me of things I have not/ wouldn't do.

So my brother that just passed away and I have both suffered with severe mental health problems, and have both been hospitalized at different points in time. He had schizophrenia and substance abuse problems and was on a strict medication regiment he couldn't come off of. I have GAD, SAD, PTSD and BPD.

What does this have to do with my grandmother? She believes that you can will anything into or out of existence which sounds harmless and it is if you keep it to your fucking self. But no she believes that people with mental illness (and physical illness cuz she's kind of an asshole) are just not thinking properly like if I just will myself to stop having intrusive and repetitive thoughts about self harming then they'll stop but it's been 11 years now (and I would classify myself as someone who uses their coping skills regularly and has come a long way.) once when I explained mental illness is just a physical illness only it affects parts of the brain (my amygdala is malfunctioning) and neurotransmitters and that it's no different than someone with diabetes and their body system malfunctioning. she said she didn't believe that and that people with diabetes can even will it away if they tried.

Established: my grandma doesn't believe in illness

Finally that brings us to recently
I have not taken grief very well, a lot of my self-harm issues have come back up I feel overwhelmed with even taking a shower or getting out of bed. I am so tired that I can only be up for a few hours before I need a nap cuz I am so tired it feels like  my legs will give out. I know that its normal that I am grieving but my grandmother just wants me to ""think positive and think that I'm not grieving, or don't think about my brother being dead"" or something but all I can think about are all these memories and it hurts all the time and I can't push them away they just happen and I don't know how to not drown in all the loss. Not thinking about stuff is impossible for me and I can't not be tired it is not a choice and I just want her to leave me alone.

I hate her for minimizing how difficult my life can get just because she doesn't have to deal with anything like this. It must e easy to not believe in illness when you don't have any.( and it is not because she ""willed"" it out of existence)

This post is just me ranting so I don't self harm because I am going to stay a recovered self-harmer if it is the last fucking thing I do."
395,"HI I'm new here and english is not my native language so be warned ;-)

I'm not diagnosed with BPD (yet), it's still in the process and I am going to my therapist regularly. I am NOT asking for medical advice or for a diagnosis, I would just like to hear from others who might feel the same way as me because I am confused about some things.

So first of all, do all BPD's need people in their lives and do they all get emotionally attached to someone? When you hear about BPD a lot of the times it says fear of abandonment and being emotionally attached to people and not wanting to be alone. I on the other hand feel the opposite, I don't need people in fact they annoy/bore me all the time.

I have absolutely no desire to put in the effort in a long lasting friendship/relationship. People trigger me for the smallest things and then I break off contact. I don't miss a single person I dumped out of my life and I don't regret breaking off contact.

I'm not even able to feel a deep connection to someone, I never loved anyone before and I don't need it. I get bored easily, and when someone shows interest in me or even love, it weirds me out. I don't know what's wrong with me. All I know is that I have major moodswings and I am impulsive and very sensitive. I will probably never have a lasting relationship with someone and it doesn't make me sad. It's frustrating though and I would LOVE to atleast get along with people around me (especially in the workplace) because otherwise you are seen as an arrogant person with no friends.

I'm not shy or anything, I can be very extroverted and fun to be around but it bores and exhausts me. And people anger me after some time so I don't even try to make lasting friendships. I have blocked so many people put of the blue and never contacted them again (even friends I knew for years) And I don't miss a single person! I think I'm not able to love which is weird but when I think back, I was always like this. 

Does someone feel the same way as me?"
396,Sometimes when I have had a heavy therapy appointment it would be helpful to have someone to talk to afterwards. I know that friends aren't therapists but is it so wrong for me to want someone to talk to? I struggle between sessions because it's all in my head and I feel trapped with it. I just want a friend that I can trust so we can be there for each other.
397,"i think at some point soon i might have to consider ending my life
my partner might have to go away without choice for a while and i can't face being alone again
i have my puppy to look after but i don't think i can and aunt is almost 92

it seems im not allowed happiness without some kind of pain

just feel done and i know i have to step up and get on with it but i right now i feel broken"
398,"Hi all. I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago, while dealing with depression, childhood and relationship trauma, and an immune disorder. Currently going through a rough patch, including recurring suicidal thoughts, except I don't think I have the courage or intention to carry it out so that's comforting.

As life would have it, I've recently had to make major decisions in life, and although I know decisions are win some and lose some, what I'm struggling with the most right now is trusting my own thoughts and feelings. I feel like in every situation, I cannot even trust my own decisions or myself during the decision making process because I cannot trust that my thoughts are logical, not too ""extreme"", not too influenced by my fear of abandonment, dark perception of reality, any other BPD thing you can name, and so on.

Granted, I do have a pretty bleak view of the world and people, including myself. But I like to think that I'm being realistic. I've known for a long time that I am not ""normal"", in the sense that most people around me would probably be a tad more optimistic and upbeat about life, and take certain things less seriously than I would. I also made a pact to myself back when I had a suicide attempt, that I would only continue to live if I truly wanted to live proper. I constantly remind myself that I choose to live for a reason, and I always go back to those reasons to prevent those thoughts from overtaking completely. Suffice to say, this has led to what others might say is a ""go all out"" kind of behaviour, when I approach projects, work, life, faith, relationships, anything really, I like to do 100% and give my all. I have nothing to lose, except my own life at the end of the day. This also makes me feel frustrated when people around me don't understand why I take this approach, are holding me back somehow, or even ridiculing me for taking life too seriously. 

I fear that people will use my BPD against me, and a loved one already has by accusing me of being irrational and frequently does not respect my thoughts and opinions, beliefs because they are ""my BPD"" talking and not me being rational. So I keep questioning myself and wondering if they are right. Honestly, I don't know which way is up anymore, I am derealizing and depersonalizing more everyday, and I don't even know who I am anymore or if I can trust anything I am thinking or feeling. 

I've been to a few therapists, and a psychiatrist, but I've always found it difficult to really get this worked out. I've learned and am using DBT techniques to get through everyday but they don't exactly help with the decision making or helping me to differentiate clarity from everything else in my head. Therapy has been a mixed bag, I always feel like the therapist ends up focusing on one of my ""goals"" during the session but forgets the entire big picture of this world I am in, and then when I leave, sure we have maybe achieved a ""goal"", say ""not having unrealistic expectations of people"", or learning ""mindfulness exercises"", but it doesn't fix my whole worldview. These worldviews have become my reality, and hence I don't know what is right or wrong anymore at this point. Is it strange that I actually like these worldviews? And in a society where we are so oft told that everyone's opinion is valid, are my thoughts too strange for others to accept?

Wonder if anyone else has any tips for this. How do I know where my BPD ends, and where I begin? Thanks."
399,"I’m too much of a coward to do it. My life is a mess


I’m getting divorced
Making my poor husband sad
Being an extra responsibility to my sister and other family members
angry and worried about covid taking so long to go away
taking expensive meds which I won’t be able to afford any more in future
have bad teeth
struggle with motivation for basic things like getting job and license
scared of my future

My sister said take it one day at a time. But each day I feel this burden on me and guilt over hurting my dear husband by wanting a divorce when he said he misses me so much. What kind of heartless monster am I to hurt him???

I deserve to die… if only I wasn’t such a coward. But I can hardly even harm myself so how can I kill myself?

400,"Hey 
I have a phone assessment tomorrow with regards to starting Psyhcotherapy. 
Not really sure what to expect. 
I'm still torn between giving that a go or continuing with my counselor."
401,"A few months ago I had a psychotic episode which caused me to reflect on my life and made me realise I have been a bad person for a number of years and I never even realised that I had problems. Since this, the guilt has been unbearable and some days I just don’t know how I can go on. I just don’t know why I never realised before and stopped my behaviour. I have started seeing a therapist and she thinks I might have BPD. Whilst this may explain some of my past behaviour I don’t believe it explains it all. My therapist just says I can learn to manage BPD but  I guess what I want to know is if it is possible to change? I feel like I have gone through a revelation and I am no longer the same person I was before My psychosis happened, in a way I have seen the light. I am so remorseful and honestly don’t know why I was the way I was - part of me wonders if I was just bad rather than having a diagnosis."
402,"So okay I post about this topic before but not with much detail. 
I'm listening to my music very loudly in over the head headphones and the voices are getting louder. I also don't know what triggered them.

I want to die idk I'm struggling and I can't deal with the voices waffling on at me in the forefront. 

I recently saw a pshycatrist who saw me for four sessions and said that he would get back to me in three weeks to diagnose this as what's wrong with me as well as schizoeffective disorder.
I also know that the voices are there due to untreated eupd no mood stabilizer etc due to trauma that happened a few years ago..
Help x"
403,"I feel like I'm spiraling again. 

How is everyone else doing tonight?"
404,"I am constantly preoccupied with the thoughts that people are actually really shitty and it depresses me. I can't shake these thoughts.
My job involves a large amount of contact with people, some of them are extremely rude, but the rest of them are alright/nice enough. I can't help thinking that even those who seem alright/ or nice enough are actually fake. People just drain me.
Lots of people have malign intentions and are selfish, and though they appear nice, are actually extremely fake and self-centered, and I've noticed many can be easily jealous or only kind to you when they are trying to get something out of you.
Also, when you look at the amount of people that are willing to cheat on their partner (this is around 50% statistically) it just shows you how fake humans are. Many people are considered lovely, and charismatic people, but are secretly cheaters.
Also people are frequently guarding secret judgements of others, and bitch and gossip. In this way, they are fake. I have met very few humans that are actually genuine-hearted and generous, most people just drain my energy. I trust very few people.
How can I overcome this?
Edit: Also people do say nice things too, for example, they often tell me how 'nice' I am, or what a great personality I have as I am always calm, or they say that I am a very sweet person, but this backfires on me as I think some people think I am a doormat or don't stand my ground. Others perceive kind soft-hearted people as 'dumb' or 'unworldly' or 'naive'... and they think it is easy to use me or take advantage. I am sick of people. Anyone else get this?"
405,Feel like I'm dipping again
406,"Hi,

I'm new here so sorry if something similar has been posted before!

I have been with my boyfriend for a year now and for the most part our sex life has been a massive issue in the relationship. After about 3 months of being together his interest in having sex with me just dropped, but still masturbates all the time. 

As someone who suffers with BPD I find the idea of him choosing something else over me/rejecting me unbearable and it causes me to spiral frequently.

My boyfriend is very caring and considerate in our relationship, and despite us talking about our sex life and our needs, nothing ever seems to improve.

Have any of you dealt with something like this? Do you just try and accept the rejection, or is there a solution that works for both of you? 

Many thanks!"

410,"For anyone with an ED, *TRIGGER WARNING, WEIGHT TALK*

Hey everyone!

PSA: This is gonna be all over the place.

Today is a hard day, and I don't normally go to anyone when I'm having binging or restricting food thoughts, but today I feel the need to talk about it. Hope that's okay.

.... So. I gained about a lot in pounds in the last two years. Not that that is bad; gaining weight is normal. But you know... In the fatphobic society we live in, it's hard to not let weight-gain affect you. Of course, it's not entirely society-brainwashing. I for sure have internalized fatphobia that I have the responsibility and need of deconstructing, both for myself and others. It's not healthy for me to constantly focus on re-becoming skinny again.

I used to train about 20 hours a week and since 2018, I've been eating like shit and not exercising enough and feeling really bad about myself for it / for how I looked.

Aware of this, since March of 2020, I've been getting back in the health train, motivated for reasons other than health, as many people are (wanting to have my ""skinny body"" back, for example). I know that I can't have a healthy relationship with my body as long as I try to shrink it, so I am trying to reframe this bad way of thinking by reading books like Christy Harrison's ANTI-DIET or listening to the Food Freedom podcast. It's helping, but I felt like reaching out anyway lol.

I've always had terrible self-esteem, constantly compared myself to others, wanted to be the best at everything, was extremely perfectionistic, etc. I was never happy with who I was, how I behaved nor what I looked like, even when I was hyperfocused on selflessness, worked hard, treated people around me well, was skinny, and had the socially-claimed ""ideal"" misogyny-washed body type.

To this day, I weirdly feel the pressure to look the way my ex would find attractive, the way my mom would look at me as proudly as when I trained a lot, etc.

When I was with my ex, I was always afraid that he would find me fat (he didn't) because having been his best friend for a while prior to being his girlfriend, he would always show me what his physical type was (short and skinny) and I definitely did not correspond to that. When we broke up, he only got with girls who were actual models or athletes, and I felt like the odd one out (I was not fat at all when we broke up; I had what that 2014 Instagram-lingo bullshit would have qualified as an ""Instabaddie"" body, but I was/am 5'8 and wider).

Now, I'm with an amazing guy who finds me sexy no matter if I gained weight or lost. He's been with me through the weight fluctuations and hasn't said a single word about it, which to me should be the norm in how a person is treated by their partner. Of course, if I gained massive amoints tomorrow he wouldn't be attracted to me and that's okay cause it's just personal preference. What I'm trying to say is that I feel no pressure to be skinnier for him right now (like less than 5%). The pressure I have comes from myself (55%) and from wanting others to find me hot (40%).

It's been nice to detach my self-love from another person's validation because I got his by just being me, whatever that meant, in the past 2 years. As I'm getting more comfortable in this relationship and less inclined to wanting to impress my 2-year boyfriend all the time, I'm starting to focus on my health and relationship with myself again. It feels good to reconnect with me JUST to reconnect with me and have it feel the most ""me-focused"" it's ever felt. In the past, I'd always do things to prove something to someone. I still kind of do, but less than before.

I don't know where I'm going with this, but yeah, I guess I just wanted to have an open-conversation about weight and self-esteem, whether related or not related to our BPD, to see if anyone could relate.

Take care xx"
411,"it was a bad night. 

Plus greys anatomy has almost no OG interns left and that just made it worse - theres no way karev would up and leave jo like that especially not after marrying her like an episode or two ago. I think I'll  stop watching now meredith is kinda boring."
412,"I don't hate my inlaws but they can be toxic. My mother in law is allowed to be as rude and verbally abusive as she wishes and everyone lets it go.

I had an incident with my father in law a couple years ago. He yelled at me for something I didn't do, said some nasty things to me, and his wife joined in by messaging me on Facebook. It triggered my BPD but also my PTSD (which they don't know I have but at the time I didn't know I had it either). He apologized halfheartedly and thought I would just forgive and forget.

A few months ago, my wife came out to her parents as trans. Her mother demanded that we come down at her earliest convenience and proceeded to invalidate my wife, bring our year-old niece into it, and tell her that she did not know what a real woman was. She even commented that my wife had gained weight as an excuse to why the clothes she randomly bought us didn't fit.

Her mother then blocked her on facebook, would not answer her calls or speak to her. If she answered my wife's emails, it was curt and interrogating. She tried to get me on her side and call me to talk while ignoring her daughter. She now asks like nothing happened and denies she did a lot of it, but never apologized.

My therapist has told me to stay as far away from them as possible and go gray rock if I have to converse with them. She does not want me to get involved when my wife's parents treat her like a child/employee/inferior person. I did lose my temper a bit with them when they were talking on Skype and went into full on crisis mode. My wife is not used to standing up for herself and sucks at it. Her father is the same and takes whatever licks his wife or sister give him (sister was involved in the yelling incident). My inlaws don't see what's wrong and my therapist doesn't want me to try to explain. ""They know what they did"". The tension and thought of them confronting me about it is a nightmare.

I don't think it would go well if I tried to explain but at least I can say that I tried. It'll trigger me hard. It's a mess of emotions for me. They might try to work on themselves but they might not. I don't want to be around them and they can tell we are pulling away. It feels like I am being childish by ignoring them, giving them the cold shoulder, and not explaining what is going on. I know trying to explain everything will trigger me. My wife doesn't full understand and she has her own issues with her parents now that she is out and other issues that are coming up.

Does anyone else have issues like this with their parents/inlaws? We've been married for 12 1/2 years and although I've wavered between distant and close, I have never been THIS distant. But I've since learned that their behavior is toxic and stuff has happened to make them seem more toxic."
413,"so im 18 and im really not sure if i have BPD or not as im not diagnosed but ive done a lot of research and would like advice or support or anything!!

i really resonate with a lot about BPD and i know i shouldnt self diagnose or have other people who aren’t professionals diagnose me. im seriously just looking for another person take/pov on this so im just gonna word vomit about my expiriences (kind of in short). also, it’s  important to mention that i am diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression (dont know if it’s bipolar or not as of rn) and i know BPD and ADHD can have overlapping symptoms, but as much as im scared to admit, i personally feel that it might be both for me.

so firstly, i really think i favorite person. and right now that person would be my girlfriend. i base all of my feelings on her and i have become almost obsessive and i over analyze and overthink every single thing she says or does to me (i do this with everyone else but it doesnt have as big of an impact as it does for her.) and when she does do something like leave me on read or not say goodmorning or say “night” instead of “goodnight” i get so upset and will start to like space out and everything goes blurry (idk if thats part of BPD?)

another thing i do with people close to me is completely do a 180 about how i feel about them based on ONE thing they do. like if they leave me on read i will get so angry at myself and them and feel like i did something wrong or that they hate me and i end up double texting or pushing them away. (which i always later realize isnt good of me to do and apologize profusely)

which leads me to another thing i do often is apologize too much for everything, if i feel like someones getting annoyed with me, i apologize. if i feel like someones in a bad mood i think they hate me and apologize. and i know thats irrational thinking and i feel bad like i always make things about me which makes me want to apologize even more and its an endless cycle!!!

im also so unsure of who i am or how i act or what i like which makes me frustrated. sometimes someone will simply ask me “how was your dayl and my mind goes blank. like i havent been there the whole time. i swear life just feels like im watching myself through a very fuzzy and glitchy movie screen i have no sense of self.

i dont think ive genuinely been happy for a consecutive week in so long. as long as i can remember actually, though i can’t remember much! but the weird thing is i know in the moment that im struggling but once it goes away i convince myself i faked it and that its gonna last but it never does. someone will look at me a certain way and ill think they hate me. i just feel like such a burden with my crazy fast and extreme mood swings all the time. im scared people are gonna get sick of me constantly apologizing and then doing the same thing i just wish it would stop.

i also dont know if this could tie into BPD or ADHD at all but i also have very weird eating patterns and i always have.

and one last thing i do that ill talk about is everything is so black and white with me. there is no in between. i cant feel two things about a situation or person at once i have to only feel one.

does any or all of this sound like it could be BPD? or is it just ADHD or anxiety or depression? or is this all just normal?

thank you for reading this if you did, any words or advice or thoughts is appreciated!!! <3"
414,"I don’t get angry. Sadness i feel is self loathing. All I do is bake and that’s not too bad.

I’m trying to switch up my morning routine cause I feel like everyday is the same. What is one thing you live for every morning? Mine is cuddles with my animals"
415,I haven’t been on here for a wee while. I don’t even know. Maybe a few weeks. But due to my bpd (not an excuse) my emotions got a bit out of control. And I mentioned things that got removed. And for that I’m sorry. I do want to be part of this group because I can see the positivity and connections that people have. I truly would like to share as well as be able to help others. And I’ll try my hardest to keep within the guidelines. And once again I’m sorry and am looking forward to getting to know you all. Xx
416,I might be self destructive too....in hopes of getting dopamine.
417,I'm slumping hard and I can't stop it. None of my mindfulness techniques are working and I don't have access to the crisis team atm. 111 are a waste of time.
418,"Hi hope you are all ok, I don't know why I'm struggling at the moment but i am. My sleep pattern is awful. I can fall to sleep I don't recall dreaming but i wake up upset, i jump up like someone's getting me, as you can imagine i don't get much sleep. I've also felt quite emotional and irritable at the same time. I don't normally have panic attacks but I've had two in the past week and my anxiety is worse i cant seem to stay still ones it starts . What the hell is going on with me ."
419,My Dog was diagnosed with two illnesses and the vets advised that she was suffering. Absolutely devastated. I was in the room with her the whole time. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do and not sure how to cope with this right now.
420,"Hello folks, 
I've decided I should leave the forum as I'm really not coping with life anymore and I feel my negativity has an unhelpful influence on here. I say things I know I really shouldn't and really don't want to offend anyone or upset people.
I'd like to say (one last time) thank you to all of you who have reached out to me and given me good advice and kind, caring words and many, many hugs. Many people here have helped restore some of my faith in humanity and remind me that not everything in the world is bad or against me. 
I've been hurting very badly lately and the approach to christmas is a terrible time for me bringing up so many bad experiences of the past and reminding me of the spaces in my life that were once filled with people I loved. I have a broken heart that I just cannot mend.
There are several people here who I so wanted to get to know better and become closer to but I was unable to ask or take the first step to allow it to happen. (I hope you know who you are and how much you have meant to me over the times I've been on here.) I'm so low on self-belief and filled with self-doubt that I couldn't risk offending any of you and was terrified of rejection. 
So it is with great sadness that i leave here having been shown such kindness and i just had to write this to let people know how i genuinely appreciate all your help, wise words and compassion. 
I wish you all so much joy in your lives and good things for the future and good fortune in all that you do. You touched my heart deeply and I won't forget that. 
Take good care of each other and stay safe, and if you can...smile and be happy 🙂
I send each and every one of you my best wishes ...
Love, Peace and Happiness
Zaz 🙏

421,"It’s my 30th birthday in a few months and I’m honestly dreading it. I feel like I’ve wasted my 20’s as I’ve been so ill with BPD and an ED. Everyone I know is settling down, getting married and having children but I feel like that is so distant for me. It’s like I don’t want to grow old because the last time I was happy was during my childhood and I don’t want to let that young girl go. I don’t even feel attracted to anyone but there’s also part of me yearning to have children because I know they’ll love me unconditionally but I just don’t want to be in a relationship with anyone! This might make no sense at all but putting it out there in the hope someone might be able to relate."
422,"I keep seeing this question and it honestly really gets on my nerves. I don't see why someone with BPD couldn't be in a healthy relationship or decide to be a parent. I've seen people with other mental disorders go on to live happy lives, so what makes BPD so different and why is it more frowned upon?"
423,To calm down and to think straight.  I'm really worried.
424,"Hey everyone 

I just wanted to say that I’m leaving the forum for a bit for a variety of reasons the reason I wanted to make this post is to say thank you to everyone because once again everyone was really kind and empathetic and helpful I usually come and go from this forum and every time  I come back everyone’s really nice and only ever supportive so thanks for your kindness, I hope you all have much more good days than bad and keep going! I think this forum is an example of how special people with mental health problems are I often see posts from people who are suffering massively and struggling to go on and in another post they’re making kind comments or giving someone support even though they’re struggling!

you’re all very very nice people! Thanks again for the love and kindness

see you all in the not so distant future hopefully! 🤗❤️🌈"

426,Stuck in co states flight mode .muscular knots .knot in throat .burning in my chest .extreme fatigue .constantly worrying .sere headaches and knaws 24/7 and if so how do they cope .......kinda desperate .overdosed last week and outta hospital stuck right bk at square 1 .....
427,"I don't know who I am. All I know is I'm not happy with who I am. I don't know how to be different. I want to feel normal but everything irritates me so much that I can't be happy or accept anyone else in my life. I know it's me. I've been told twice this week that I need help and told by a stranger that I need to take my meds. It's so hurtful and painful. I don't believe in medication for me - having tried and tested different ones for over 7 years. I want friends, love, acceptance but I don't know how to achieve any of those things. I want to be loved for who I am. No one seems to understand BPD, including me. I don't know what I want or where I'm going in life. Feel like it's all a never ending journey and I'm waiting for a car crash. People expect and want you to pretend to feel ok, to make life easier for them. They hate me for who I am, the way that I am but why does no-one understand it's so much more painful to be the person that no-one accepts like how are you meant to ""snap out of it""? It's just a circle. My partner keeps telling me to ""have a cold hard look at myself in the mirror"" because I am ""the problem"". Why can't anyone understand I take a hard cold look at myself everyday and hate who I am and most of my anger and issues stem from this? I don't know the answers to anything"
428,"I dont know whats going on in my head anymore i have very little Close Friends.

I made 2 ppl i consider close friends at work but sometimes i really love them like my best friend then the next day i dont want anything to do with them for no reason at all. 

The odd thing for me is when i cant stand to talk to these ppl at work i can talk to other ppl i work with which i guess is cause i feel no attatchment to other ppl i work with.

Im just trying to understand whats going on with me and i hope ppl on this site can give me any advice if they feel like this from time to time.

I would hate to lose them as friends but also cant stand having them get close to me as i guess i dont want to feel the pain when/if they left and we never talk again"
429,"Are you ever going through something without having had anything serious actually happen but it makes you feel so bad emotionally that you're just like... wow. how is it even possible to survive this. Like it just completely ruins your ability to see anything good and then you think like, if I can feel this way then other people can feel this way and it's so bad that it doesn't even matter that we're ever capable of feeling good again because right now this is unbearable. So what's the point of life if people are capable of feeling this bad. And nothing anyone could say or do would help at all. Does this even make sense idk but my question is, what do you do? Like how do you survive that. Idk I think I might be going through some sort of an episode for the 6th day straight lol"
430,"The Care Coordinator rang me this morning and told me during the call, that 1) she was leaving at the end of the month and 2) we need to discuss me being discharged from the service as she thinks I'm ready. 

?!?!?!?!?

I also have to discuss with my counsellor tonight whether I want to continue seeing her or having Psychotherapy through the same service the CC is from."
431,"I am not going to beg people to love and accept me when they clearly don't care that much...I have too much self-love and self-respect to keep doing that and to keep frantically trying to avoid real and imagined abandonment.

I disabled my Facebook using the Stay Focused app on Nuclear option, which means I cannot change that and cannot uninstall the app.

I am only going to talk to the 1 or 2 people who have proved to be dependable and caring throughout this whole pandemic and everyone else in my scene can stay away...

I finally found the strength and self respect to walk away from people who do not love me because I cannot make someone love me.

Before, I would have just kept seeking reassurance, but not anymore.

Do you have any stories about dealing with the BPD trait of trying to avoid real or imagined abandonment? Is this one of your major traits? How would it manifest?

I realized that there is no such thing as abandonment as an adult, because nobody really owes me anything and it's natural for people to drift away and grow apart.

I feel free."
432,"Positives:
My mom went back to work this week. 
I am on track in all my classes now.
I am on track to graduate this upcoming year."
433,"Today I was searching Barnes and Noble for an oracle deck when I grew extremely depressed. See, I've been getting over 8-year long friendship since the past year, call me sentimental or overemotional. There's a lot of items left over from that particular friendship that leave me with nothing but feeling of guilt and shame. We both are into astrology and spiritual practices, especially witchcraft. I got my ex-friend into it and he fell in love with crystals, astrology, and the whole nine yards. Then again, I'm also the one who caused him grief here and there, especially with my careless actions and words. This erratic behavior eventually ended our friendship and I can't blame him in the slightest. It still ways on me like a stone because of how I feel burdened with the remnants like a few crystals he gifted me. He bought his own stones and I begged him to give me some which wasn't technically fair because the ones he bought were for himself. I was naïve, immature, and a bit selfish in a lot of ways which I've since outgrown. I'm obviously not the same person since last year and this year has strengthened me in a lot of ways. I've contemplated on my past behavior and thinking patterns and have since forgiven myself, but what if it's not enough? I feel this need to tie loose ends somehow, as well give away those crystals because I just can't look at them without cringing. I honestly didn't deserve them nor did I deserve all those so-called second chances, I deserved to be hurt in order to find self-acceptance.

I know it's wrong to say I deserved to be hurt, but in a way, it was wake up call. Now, I know when I'm being completely dishonest with myself because of it. I know myself better enough not to treat others as if they owe me the world. Friends are nice and everyone should have them, but when does it become a obsession? I believe I became desperate, so I expected my friend to feel a certain way about me and that's not fair. Also, he was still my friend and I got wrongfully jealous when he started reaching out to other people, so I was inhibiting his growth in a way. I feel awful remembering the stupid things I said and did because now I realize how careless I was. If I did actually care, then why didn't think twice? I knew I was trying to get back at him for choosing others over me. He ignored months after our last interaction and covered it about by saying he needed a ""break"" and now I know that was white lie.

Now it's going on 2021 and this happened in 2019. I'm stuck with the stones he begrudgingly bought and there's probably nothing I can do to repurpose them. I've changed but everything around me hasn't and I feel stuck with the consequences. I deserve to move on and find a way to restore what's been broken. I've neglected my spiritual practice out of remorse and respect due to that I believe in a higher power. It's been over a year now and I want to resume my divination practices. Any advice on how I can move on without taking any drastic measures?

Thanks for taking the time to read this! Happy Holidays!"
434,But tbh at this moment in time I'm questioning this diagnosis.  I have most of the traits but some overlap with other personality disorders.
435,"What happened to Christmas? 
Am I mistaken or is Christmas not about celebrating the birth of baby Jesus. When did it become a commercial nightmare where parents are swayed to buying all sorts of crap for their kids because little Jimmy next door is getting one. X-boxes, playstation, the latest phone, Nike, way overpriced perfume and aftershave, piles of chocolate, alcohol, stuffing your face with food, credit cards, debt, sending cards where the message of love is pre-written for you, Santa claus,  elves, reindeer, shop till you drop, spend spend spend...
So much for love and goodwill to one and all...
Not a hint of baby Jesus...and this year just.to make sure no midnight services in the church, no community gatherings, just you a TV newspapers and internet saying BUY BUY BUY....
Well you can shove your Christmas. I refuse to take part, I will not conform, I am me and I am free...🙂"
436,"I tried to cry but I cant. That hurts me.

I know now reason of that intrusive thoughts that puts me bad. 

This year is a bag of $""#$""#$""#$2

Why world is like that?"
437,"Okay, so I waited to share this situation because I wanted to see if it would get better, but it didn't. My birthday was two weeks ago and it was honestly a hurtful experience. My dad is an unreliable, arrogant, and jealous person who picks favorites. He also seems to think that I should treat him well even if he treats me unfairly. My sister was also supposed to come over for birthday but then cancelled her visit at the last minute because my niece was acting up. She said she would come over the next day and didn't at the last minute. My sister is closer than my dad than I am and for good reason, they're basically the same person. I have suspicion that they probably talk about me behind my back and that's why she's so estranged from me. She only comes around when she needs a favor and my idiot dad laps it up. Not to mention that she's his first daughter from his previous marriage so he feels the need to compensate for that even if she's well into her 30's. I've tried to be pleasant by trying to be involved in her life, but so far I only exist as a bargaining chip. She only does things with me in order to get something in return and then no one sees her for several months at a time. I'm closer to my younger brother because we've both been neglected by family on our birthdays. Despite this, I'm dead last.

I'm need to get this off my chest because my sister is coming over later. How convenient of her to skip over my birthday and neglect to keep in touch afterwards, but yet, she'll show up for my dad's birthday without a problem. I know exactly why she does it because if she didn't show up for his birthday, that means that she can't ask him for favors. It's a move of convenience for her and as long as she pretends to care, he's wrapped around her finger. I believe that I'm my dad's least favorite child because I call it as I see it. I have nothing to hide and won't hesitate to criticize him. I'm bad at being needy and I'm just stubborn. He probably finds it hard to persuade me and so he doesn't really bother with me. He does manipulate me and makes me out to be this immature and mean person and it's tiring.

After today I'm going back into shell and keeping to myself because my dad has no lick of sense whatsoever and I'm done playing games. I have other more important things to work on besides waiting on people who refuse to change. My sister can have him all to himself, it doesn't hurt me one bit. I just wish I had normal and understanding people in my life is all. Wish me luck, I'm going to need it."
438,"Hi. I've been diagnosed with BPD and there's a few things I can think of that could be causes but which one is it?

- My parents have mental illnesses 
- I was sexually abused as a child
- I was bullied
- I have brain damage from a brain operation

I suffered with bad anxiety as a child and crippling social anxiety but it wasn't until after my operation that I started having mood swings so bad I'd harm myself to make them stop and hearing voices. but maybe it would have happened anyway?

Which of these is the driving cause do you think?"

440,"I am engaged and going to get married in the next couple of weeks. I am 25 weeks pregnant. I met my fiance earlier this year, we clicked and it just seems right. Until my BPD kicks in.

I'll find something out that happened while me and my fiance were using months ago and then its stuck on  my mind and i can't get it out of my head. I dont' know how to let it go. I feel like i just sit here and wait for the relationship to end.

I don't trust anyone even when i think i do....it turns out i don't. So i need advice. we are planning on keeping our son and getting married i just need advice and tips on how to deal with this. or what i can do on my own for now till the insurance kicks in"
441,"so cold miserable and tired
just feel awful"
442,"When I wrote on another support group about my husband and his delusions, and that im tired and leaving my husband, this guy wrote back ""enjoy your divorce"" How could he be so fucking insensitive? Does he think it's fun and games to just leave? Does he just think it's just because of his psychosis that I'm leaving? I put them straight and explained it is various reasons and not just that one. That my schizoaffective and borderline is another reason. That I can't cope anymore.

God I was so mad at that guy! He doesn't bloody understand."
443,"Hi.

How are you all?

Literally, experiencing so much stress right now, about so many different things.

It is hard trying to control myself and my reactions.

With everything that is going on at the moment, I could so freak out and lose myself. Sometimes I dissociate or act impulsively. 

Trying not to let that happen."
444,it's so wrong that people are been turned away from mental health services if they arent seen to making progress .I'm seriously thinking of self medicating .because I'm iin so much physical and mental pain .I'm burnt out and cannot do any of my daily living activities and they think it's okay to discharge people.primarily it's my anxiety that's most disabling .benzos are the only thing that have ever worked lord knows I've tried everything else ........
445,"Does anyone else really struggle with abandonment issues, trust and paranoia ? I don’t want to harass the people I care about but I can be really on edge sometimes and need that reassurance how have people dealt with this without pressurising people ?"
446,"Hello everyone, I hope you’re all having some sort of love and light regardless of what’s brought you to this forum.

I thought I would post as I’m trying to just get some clarity and unsure about it all at the moment. Does anyone have a biof brain fog at the moment ? It’s almost as if I’m confused which side to take, I think knowing myself, my experiences and my own trauma had lead me to understand that I may have borderline personality disorder. I display intense emotions and I spend a lot of time feeling triggered lately. My one wish is to feel peace of mind but I think that’s a journey we are all on.

I recently ended things with a guy I was seeing and I’m not happy with the way it ended, or maybe the emotions that are coming with it? Feeling very abandoned, very alone and almost as if I know that I will experience these same feelings and I shouldn’t. I should be more sure of myself to let it affect me as much as it has.
I also have horrendously low self asteem and zero confidence when not long ago I was feeling good about myself? How is it so high to so low in such a short space of time. 

Does anyone else have these emotions after a short while? Trying to figure out ways to cope am on a long waiting list to see a psychiatrist.

would love feedback or anyone else’s experiences. 
Thank you for reading"
447,...but get me out of here :eek2::eek2::eek2:
448,"I just dont get the fascination with antidepressants or pills for mental health issues. In my experience of them they are dangerous, addictive and no one knows the long term damage they may cause. Feeling sad? Have a pill. Feeling anxious? Have a pill. Depressed? Have a pill. Can't sleep? Have a pill. The list of reasons to take a pill is endless.
Over the years I've tried at least 25 different antidepressants and not once have any of them lifted my mood. Yes they've affected me being so angry by suppressing my emotions. They've affected negative thoughts by dumbing down my mind, they've sapped my energy making me lethargic, they've broken my spirit and sense of adventure by numbing my mind and had all sorts of effects physically such as digestive problems, rashes, dizziness, putting on weight making my body feel heavy and aching...
To be honest I feel they destroy a person's capability to be free, independent and look after themselves, and instead make you rely on a drug to improve your life whilst at the same time weakening your ability to think clearly and heal in a more natural, less chemically intrusive way.
When I say that to my GP, psychiatrist or key.worker they say there's no medication to treat borderline personality disorder (emotionally unstable personality disorder, emotional intensity disorder)...they can't even agree on a name for it..and then continue to encourage use of pills to combat it.
It's a farce and seriously needs looked into...I mean antidepressants are meant for short term use not for years on end. In Scotland last year almost 1million people took antidepressants at a rate of almost 300million pills in daily doses. In England over 7 million people took antidepressants last year. Crazy figures. And the government claim to put millions if not billions into mental health. Where has this money gone, because mental health services in the UK are deteriorating at an ever increasing speed and people are not getting the help or advice the deserve. Forget covid, this issue is way more worrying. The UK is becoming a nation of sedated people and the figures rise every year."
449,"I have a serious meeting on Monday due to absences this year and I am already so anxious about it. The final straw was when I tried to harm myself last week and didn't go in on Thursday.
There is a possibility that I could lose my job. 
That is really not what I need right now, on top of everything else. 😭😭
I understand that obviously I am hired to do a job and I should be fulfilling that role, but I am actually good at my job. The absences have been sporadic and just single days. I'm so scared."

I have also been diagnosed with ADHD and GAD, so you can see how this may come together...
My academic progress has come to a bit of a standstill lately, and I am currently applying to Cambridge as well as US unis (Harvard and UChicago being my top choices). I’m increasingly worried about how my mental health may result in a lasting impact on my future.

452,"I was diagnosed with BPD about ten years ago. After leaving an extremely abusive marriage,I was lost and participated in behaviors that I used to frown upon. I became an alcoholic, would go to bars and meet strangers and go home with them; got into 2 car accidents that resulted inDUI charges that were later dismissed or dropped down. I felt like I was doing ok, with my job, 2 children, and ,a new marriage. But, my ex husband died about a year ago, and with COVID? I find myself steering back to the emotions of feeling hopeless and crying all the time."
453,"So I have decided to leave my husband due to his violent tendencies with his family and fear he'd harm me too, and because he has been so negative and heavy for my soul.

456,"Hey. I've been diagnosed with BPD for years now. Having trouble with relationships. The problem is I've never met anyone and thought I'd like to have sex with them. I'm attracted to certain people's personality and I get crushes but I just want to be around them and be their friend. I fall in love very easily but it's platonic. I was raped when I was a child and I think it's broken a part of me. I just don't want to have sex with anyone. I'd still like to have a relationship though, I'd like to cuddle and kiss but I really don't want to go any further than that. Is that possible for me? Can i have a relationship like that and still keep the other person happy?"
457,"Hey you guys

I really, really need to feel understood. I hate myself for having the thoughts I'm about to detail in this letter. 

I've been in a relationship for 2 years with this AMAZING guy. This guy is everything I want on paper: he's funny, good looking, social, talented, artistic, intelligent, my parents and friends love him, etc. He's been with me through a lot and has helped me time and time again in dealing with my (diagnosed) BPD, OCD, and sexual trauma from a previous partner. In our relationship, the problem IS NOT him. He has been nothing but accommodating, loving, perfect. 

However, I can't seem to just be able to be grateful for how great he is or value him as I should. Since last year, I've started knit-picking things he does often (such as mannerisms every person singularly has) and finding them annoying, finding him less attractive, thinking he's not driven enough for me, not liking his facial hair, etc. I started doubting more and more often whether or not I still loved him because I find myself going from loving him to finding him very annoying at times, in a matter of hours or days. 

A) More about when and why I am in my ""hate"" phase towards him:

When he's too into me, too clingy, too insecure, too loving, tries to initiate sex or kissing too much, texts me too much, or asks to see me too much, instead of being happy, I back off because he annoys me.  

I have extremely high standards for myself; I was raised that way. So even during quarantine, I work my butt off and really work to get those opportunities. I establish a strict routine for myself, workout, focus on clean eating, tidy my space, run a bunch of errands, etc. On his end, my boyfriend goes to sleep at like 3 AM, eats like shit, doesn't groom himself, doesn't clean his room, doesn't drive, and always wears the same smelly clothes. He has a very laid-back, unstressed mentality, which isn't problematic in itself but in comparison to how I function (high-stress and high-workload all the time), it is for me. As for his ""drive"", he does work hard, but not to the extent I do, and he lives in a tiny dirty apartment with no windows with his mom and has been, what seems like depressed, every winter each year. It's not his fault that he's not rich (I'm not either) and lives where he does or that quarantine is making him more depressed, but seeing him be lazy and not correspond to the idea of what my ""ideal"" partner would be like life-situation-wise just turns me off. And don't get me wrong; I've been diagnosed with depression several times in the past and know how hard it is to find motivation, but being in a relationship with someone who has depressive tendencies (just like my boyfriend being in a relationship with me who has BPD and OCD) has its challenges. 

With friends, I have no problem acting like the mom and taking care of them because attraction isn't a big factor. With a partner, however, I just can't seem to be able to take care of my partner AND still be attracted to them. I feel so bad that I cannot take care of him like he took care of me mentally with my BPD, OCD, and sexual assault trauma in the past two years. Instead of being patient and waiting for him to get better / find his motivation again, I just add more stress onto him and make him doubt himself when I'm distant. I hate myself for it. 

I know everything I've written sounds really conceited. I don't think I'm better than him (it's definitely more the other way around lol), but seeing him in a depressed-lazy-quarantine mode isn't helping me stabilize my love-hate relationship pattern with him. And I'm very well aware that it's not good that my expectations towards his work/grooming life are that high, but I don't know how to bring them down. I'm also aware that I'm not in a good place to critique his negative qualities as someone who has so many herself. I just need to vent, so please keep in mind that I know I'm far from being a saint. 

B) More about when and why I am in my ""love"" phase towards him:

In the past, because I'm brutally honest, he'll know when I'm fed up with him or when I'm in my ""hate"" cycle. I tell him that it has NOTHING to do with him (even if sometimes in my head I want him to change certain things about himself) and tell him that I need space to deal with my own flaws. When that happens, obviously he gets really sad and doesn't feel like hanging out with me anymore. This might be a BPD thing, a toxic-shitty-person thing, or a weird ""people like challenges and get turned on by them"" thing, but when he pulls back, I always find myself more inclined to seduce him, be a better partner, find him more attractive, etc. 
........................................................................

I'M SO TOXIC! And I don't know how to fix it. Therapy doesn't really help me with managing my expectations and asking less of others. I know that the main thing that bugs me is when he doesn't have his own thing going on, and recently he has been super busy with school (we're both in school), so that's been helping, but I still don't know how to regulate my love-hate relational pattern. 

Here's the thing: I love this man. He's a best friend, a lover, an adventure partner, and a travel partner and I don't see my life without him. Yes, I'm less attracted to him right now and he bugs me sometimes, but I've thought about it and haven't been attracted to anyone else besides 2 random celebrities. Breaking up isn't the option, and whenever I think about breaking up, both because I fear being abandoned more than anything / because I fear losing HIM specifically, I have a pit in my stomach and start to feel sick. Plus, I don't see him only as a friend. I wouldn't be able to see him with someone else. I know for a fact I see him as a boyfriend. 

I just really need tips and need to feel like someone in this world understands me. I have a sexologist and therapist to become a better human being and get my shit together, but feeling understood is the one thing I really need right now. I keep too much stuff inside and it's driving me nuts.  

Does anyone else with BPD on here also have very different lifestyles and needs than their partner's? What do you do about it? How do you deal with finding balance in attraction/personal space/balance?"
458,"I don't trust anyone anymore. I don't even trust myself. I want to be invisible, I want everybody to move on and forget about me. I want to hurt myself, remind myself that there is blood that runs through this body of mine. This broken, shattered emotional body. I have no desire to live. I just exist in a world where I trust no one. How is this a life?"
459,"Hi all

I know this isn’t technically related to BPD but I know people in this forum so I feel less anxious about posting it (I hope the admins don’t mind - sorry if you do)

When I was little I spent a lot of time in hospital because I had a lot of illnesses and whilst everyone was really nice to me they scare me. I have to go for a lymph node biopsy tomorrow and I’m scared because my mum died of cancer I’m not scared of death more of getting like weak and frail and having people feel pitty or treat me different.

I have a couple of questions if anyone’s ever had one and doesn’t mind answering.

1 - Does it hurt, I have good pain tolerance but it’s the idea of a needle going into a lymph node goes through me (kind of like anything eyeball related.
2- Will the doctor know straight away from the ultrasound if it looks like anything bad.
3- does it take long?

I mean I’m a little anxious and scared because it’s the hospital but I’m more worried because if it was something bad I think I’d just lose my morality because I wouldn’t care anymore and there’s no purpose to life anyway, I mean I think I’m making that sound easier than it is and I’m sure living a life of helping people it isn’t easy to just go nope I’m gonna do what I want, but that’s my fear because I think about it a lot - I would see it as like not going quietly like you only live once right? When I think about it the only things that would be completely fine are animals because I love them very much 😍 and they are completely innocent and there’s no agenda with them ❤

I don’t know why but I feel like a bad person now - hope everyone is having an okay day 🤗"

463,"Hello

So as a man of 33 years old I should probably want female companionship in the romantic sense right? But I don’t like I find women attractive and I find myself like falling in love with them but I don’t want a relationship I want to live alone probably because I know I’d mess it up and cause heartbreak. But what I do want is like caring love Is that weird? Like you know when you’re sick and your mum looks after you or when you’re upset and your sister comes to see if your okay I have a friend who is beautiful and when I first met her i was in love with her but then when my mum was dying she looked out for me and tried to make me feel better and now I can’t see the romantic feelings I had before like she’s attractive but I don’t feel attracted to her she’s like my sister and like I crave love from her but like caring love like a family member not romantic or sexual love ... I would say she’s my favourite person but I’ve got like 20 of them 😬 so is that a wrong thing to want? Like non romantic love just love in general, to complicate matters I feel love for others (a lot) but I can’t really feel it back Like I know people do but I just can’t feel it. Maybe I do want romantic love and just don’t know it :/ I just feel falling in love with one person would stop me meeting and being friends and loving everyone 🤔"
464,"I had posted on family whatsapp group that he’s in hospital and she phoned me and after I told her what happened with him, I confessed that I want to leave him.

This upset her so much - she said I can’t leave him


that he was there for me in my breakdowns and hospitalisations
that we’re made for each other
that we balance each other out hormonally
that he loves me deeply, even though he doesn’t tell me
that we’re the best thing that happened to each other
that I’m going to regret leaving him
that he needs me and I need him
that marriage isn’t easy - there will be sacrifice
that being single isn’t easy and I’ll be alone when I’m old
that his family don’t care about him except to give food
that he was very handsome when he was younger and the girls were queuing to see him or call him. When I asked why he didn’t get married sooner, she said one of the rejected girls could have put black magic curse on him (?!)
his siblings and mostly his brother probably jealous of him
Etc etc…

She wants to even send me gifts from UK (where she lives) to get me to stay with him. So I was half forced to give her a list.

Oh God! She doesn’t understand it’s not his illness that I want to leave him for but his insidious negativity over the years that eroded me away. He’s a good and loving person but I feel depressed just thinking of how argumentative he can get and how I have to conform to his strict religious views. I can’t practice Islam in easy way around him. She said he loves me deeply but I just feel so suffocated.

If there’s one word to describe my marriage it’s this - claustrophobic

She doesn’t understand I need to look after my own mental health right now.

This isn’t about just taking a break, this is about making a break.

Wtf to do???"
465,"I've noticed today that all impulsive things that everyones does, like drink, spend cash, anger etc...

Is not for get pleasure, just for avoid ""that"" inside, ""that"" which is ever chasing you. The most scary thing is that you can't know what is ""that"". All impulsive actions that I do and after I can't stop is not me, is ""that"" trying to posess me. Just I need to be more strong that another people, but it hurts.

Maybe is a stupid epiphany."
466,"hi, so first of all i’d like to say i’m new here and have been looking through other threads and it’s really reassuring to know that others sometimes feel the same way as i do. as someone with bpd, do you often feel like your relationships with other people are jeopardized, or even impossible to maintain? not even just romantic relationships, but platonic relationships as well. 

for me personally, i’ve only had a couple romantic relationships. they both lasted over a year and ended badly because of “my mental instability”. usually it’s my extreme constant need for reassurance or the bursts of anger to do it for them. i feel like when these things are happening to me i’m in a third person view looking down on myself, and then i “snap out of it”, but the damage is already done by that time. i’m afraid of spending the rest of my life alone because i have trouble controlling my symptoms. i’m not exactly sure what i’m looking for out of posting this, but how do you guys cope? specifically with consistently needing validation that someone in your life hasn’t abandoned you? 

also, i hope you’re all having a wonderful day."
467,"have you ever felt ashamed and guilty and angry and disgusted by something you do so you try to talk to someone about it and then they shame you and tell you how bad your behavior is and how you need to accept how bad your behavior is and you need to change? even though the whole reason you wanted to talk about it is because you're painfully aware of how bad your behavior is and how badly you need to change? because same. and its making for hate myself even more than I did before I tried to talk about it. also if anyone has any good news in their life, BPD related or not, feel free to share. id love to hear about the good things happening in your lives."
468,"Hi I'm new I have been experincing rapid mood swings for years its gotten so bad that I have broken things, snapped at people, and have self harmed.
When I was 16 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, then a year later I was diagnosed with mood dysregulation (the doctor didn't bother telling me what it was). When I was 3 I was diagnosed with autism and now I'm high functioning, I'm being tested for ADHD hoping that will give me answers.
I hate being left alone and when someone gives me the slightest criticism I think they will leave me, I overreact to everything and I can't keep myself grounded (that's where the self harming also occurs).
This whole situation has gotten so bad I have had to drop my A Levels at college which I loved doing. I feel suicidal and have been to the hospital because my GP was worried, the crisis team didn't listen at all.
I have been researching about BPD and a mental health nurse I saw the other day says I hit a lot of the criteria.
I've been feeling so invalidated for so long it was nice to hear someone agreeing and listening to me.
I need support and someone to talk to, I feel so alone and confused.

470,"Where do you turn in times of despair?
Today I phoned my key worker but they never returned my call. As the day went on i became more and more disturbed with negative thoughts, worry and deep sadness. I reached the end of my tether by mid-evening and called the Samaritans. 
After an outpouring of grief, pain and heartache I could speak no more through the tears and have since gone through the self-blame, self-hate, mental torture and lack of any hope up until now. 
My mind is in tatters and my body aches with pain and fatigue. I'm in bed now with the walls closing in on me and praying for it all to end. If only I could sleep then maybe I wouldn't wake up tomorrow to begin the cycle all over again. 
This isn't living, its constant suffering. The end feels further away than ever.

471,"I just got all the borderline emotion coming back. 
I can't pin point what it is exactly but the day got off to a rocky start and I started with the self critical thoughts. The day started bad because I was late and I know everyone is observing me, waiting for me to slip up, waiting for me to be late.
I am getting really triggered by a guy at work, older guy, who I HAVE to work with, who stares at me funny all the time, it makes me feel SICK. He has been doing this for a long time now, and it is disgusting and makes my skin crawl. I have to work with him very often and the days when I do, I feel physically sick. It is the way he behaves around me, or he stares at my body, and he tries to flirt with me, or stares at me all the bloody time, or gaze into my eyes. I feel completely sick and my skin is crawling. It reminds me of the night when I was sexually assaulted because the person who assaulted me was staring at me. I noticed them staring, but I never thought anything of it.
I am so fucking tired to death of my life. All the things I have had to live through and the pain I feel.
Of course, I am taking pills. Of course I am seeing a therapist. But I do not see her until tomorrow.
I believe in nothing. I am struggling really struggling to believe my life could improve.
I really thought I was stabilizing, but now these feelings back again.
I'm waiting for the shit thoughts to go, I'm waiting to believe in myself again.

473,"Does anyone do this? I feel abandoned and forgotten when I don't get messages or calls from my friends (the only 2 friends I still haven't pushed away) every day. I feel like I have to be the one who texts or calls first because I care too much and get too attached to people who really don't need me in their lives. I'm aware that I have strong abandonment issues and that I am often paranoid and believe things that aren't true, so there's the possibility that I'm just reading too much into things that shouldn't upset me. But even knowing that doesn't reassure me of the fact that my friends care. Many times they told me that they do care, it's hard to believe it though. I feel hurt that I am always the one who asks other people how they are doing and messages them first. I know it's not good to expect things from other people, but I want to be important for my friends too. I want to matter to them enough to get messages from them without me having to message them first. I want my friends to care how I'm feeling and worry for me. I tried to disappear from their lives in the past, not with the intention of leaving forever, but only to make them realize that they could lose me if they took me for granted, but I seem not to be able to go more than a few days without talking to friends I care about. I wonder if my friends will stop taking me for granted and care about me more if I disappear from their lives for months and don't contact them at all until they are the ones looking for me first"
474,"I seem to have fallen off the ""productive"" wagon, starting in September with a bad 9/11 anniversary. 

You ever have moments where you seem to have fallen down and can't get up, or you can't find the right rhythm to get back to functioning normally? I keep running and leaping to get back on track and I seem to miss it just barely each time. And each successive time depletes energy to try again.

Since September, I have been struggling; with my old friend depression and anxiety. Self-doubt, but thankfully the abusive inner voice has not returned. But it's defeating to feel those tendrils of depression encircle my brain and deplete my willingness to keep trying.

I have also been absent-minded about taking my meds. And oh boy, do I pay for it when I realize I've missed a few days. The self-doubt, the sadness. I sit there trying to identify why I'm sad, and then I realize it's because I didn't take my meds. Which brings a whole other set of sadness of having to be dependent on medication to feel normal.

I hate that one bump in the road can derail; can take the momentum of what has been a productive year, and begin to erode confidence in abilities. It affects my writing, my work, my self value. So that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where everything I write is crap. Then that erosion further impacts performance, so it's like you have one tiny trip, and it all unravels.

The good news is that I seem to have beat the reliance on alcohol. I no longer reach for it when things are difficult. I consider that a win. A big one. But it's not enough. I need to be knocking it out of the park at all times in order to just feel alive.

I'm not where I was a couple of years ago emotionally/psychologically, but this erosion is creating panic that I'm headed back that way. And today is my mom's anniversary, so it feels like I tripped in September and now am stumbling into blackness with her anniversary. I hate that even two years later, she still has this hold on me.

I'm hoping that I will see light after this day is over. That once holding my breath for it to pass, I can finally exhale."
475,"So, I was diagnosed with BPD a few months ago, I also have bouts of depression and anxiety. The thing is, I sometimes feel like there is something else? Although I don't have ideas on what it could be...

476,"On one side I have a challenging husband who at the moment is acting strange - like his temporal lobe epilepsy is making him display psychosis again. If not that, then it’s arguments and disagreements and struggling to see to his needs and illness as well as my own. Not being able to be myself in front of him. Not being able to dance or listen to music in front of him because he's kind of a strict muslim. Yet we do have good times too. Cuddles. Chats. Hugs. Sharing. But things so temporary then the strain and arguments return.

On the other side I have this wonderful mother but every time I share my mental illness or marriage troubles she tells me to accept Jesus as saviour and accept him as son of God when she knows I’m Muslim and firm in believing God doesn’t have a son.

Where on earth to turn to?
Live with husband then have all the stresses of our marriage
OR
Live with my mom and have religious proselytising towards me?

With coronavirus that work was canceled and smoothed, but that never deleted the intense anger and sadness than consumed me by inside (I just tell this history in this forum).

By that reason I was fallin in impulsivity and sadness and I've encounter an guy from the past that have me involved me in a event where I finished shocked.

Last months a friend from internet died, we just have been talk with him last month because I was helpin him to run her blog.

That why I've rejected a good job offer by intense emotions, and no reason. I've been so unstable. Last 2 months I've been start to feel goosebump from nowhere. I'm trying to recover control but is hard.

481,"TW: self harm

So I guess I just need a space to rant. I was told by my neuropsychiatrst I have traits of EUPD so I need to be referred to the community mental health team. This is because I had an attachment to someone then they blocked me so i started self harming out of anger. I have other symptoms too. I got a letter saying that I don't meet the criteria. A few months later and things get worse. I feel like everyone hates me and is angry with me so I self harmed and posted it on my Instagram story to see if anyone would care. Anyway I called the GP again and they said it seems like I have bpd or bipolar and I need to see a psychiatrist to see which one I have. They refer me then I get rejected again! I got refered for counselling but I don't feel like it's very helpful. I don't really feel like counsellors understand me. Anyway, I have a private psychiatric assessment on Monday. And I shouldn't have had to do it but I don't feel like I had much of a choice. Has anyone else had a similar situation?"
482,"I've heard about this but never really appreciated it. I tend to find a favourite person exists in a relationship type thing, a sexual relationship. I become obsessed and wary of them talking to them opposite sex as I think they'll like them more, I have to be there with them at all times and adapt so I like the same things they do and do whatever they want me to. I have cut short other prior engagements to make sure I'm with the FP and stop them talking to other women. I know it sounds desperate and that's how I describe my behaviour. It's embarrassing. My moods are dependant on how the FP acts towards me, if they seem distracted or cold towards me I get very despressed and have gone to bed crying on some occasions because my FP hae not paid me enough attention. It's so stupid I know, even after many years the knowledge of my FP being romantically involved with someone else really hurts. It just reminds me of how little I must have meant to him and how much of an embarrassment I am. Sorry all x"

484,"I went to my local town today. The second time this year. Last time was in August. 
What a soul destroying experience. So many shops shuttered or to let or for sale. Hardly a person in sight and those I saw looked as miserable and downtrodden as I felt. The litter has changed from crisp packets and cigarette ends to dirty, discarded masks. Most shop doorways have these lil Hitler people standing there asking what your business is and saying you must wear a mask. I have exemption due to skin issues and severe pain around my ears but try telling that to the jobsworths. 3 times I was refused entry for refusal to wear a mask and once was told the police would be called when I told them my business in the shop is my business not theirs. I was even refused entry because one of the lil Hitlers saw me being refused at another shop and immediately said on my approach you can't come in here. (The irony being I was just passing by). The shops I did get in were pretty much empty and mostly selling cheap christmas crap.
I stood and people watched for a while. You can't sit on a bench because the police patrol on a loop and move you on. You could feel the deprivation and subversion in the air. People with their heads down shuffling by and coughing into their muzzles...the silent majority controlled by the minority who don't even follow the rules. I didn't know whether to cry or shout and scream.
I decided to try the retail park instead, there would be more life there. No...wrong again. The place looked like a crime scene. Red and white tape everywhere all these new signs, posters, and stickers on the ground. Telling you how many people from how many households what direction to go in what to do before you enter. I can only assume humanity has lost the power to think for itself. 
So I went to my favourite shop after walking in the wrong direction for a hundred feet or so as the signs and taped barriers made me only to find myself at the exit. From nowhere like the transporter in star trek a woman wearing gloves, a mask a shield and carrying hand sanitizer appeared by my side. ""You're at the exit sir she said in a panic'"" ""I just noticed that"" I said. In the most ignorant voice she retorted ""the signs are clear, you cannot be in this area"". I looked at her in disbelief and like any good citizen I said ""stick your shop up your ass"" and burst through the tape knocking over a cardboard sign in my desperate bid for freedom and sanity... as I looked back she was desperately trying to seal up the breach in security that I'd escaped from....
Needless to say I won't be going back. What the hell have we allowed ourselves to become. If this is the new normal then like I said to the brainwashed  jobsworth at the door.....""you can stick it up your ass"" lol 
I will not comply to the total degradation of humanity 👍

485,"so i agree with primary diagnosis of BPD and secondary diagnosis of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder but also it says ocd unspecified
well ocd is still there but doesn't take over my life like it used to
im positive i have dependent personality disorder ,which was one of my first diagnosis then they changed it

should i say nothing or bring it up with psychiatrist? x"
486,"My husband said he's scared of me.

When we disagree, he says I go all quiet then have funny look in my eyes and sometimes i throw things and scream.

He said once he even wanted to call police. And take me to hospital several times but I refused saying I don't need it.

He doesn't know what to do anymore with me and I'm scared of our future too. I don't want to lose him!

I just want to be normal wife but I'm a fucking nutcase with my rages, paranoia, psychosis, voices, anxiety attacks, mood swings, self-harm and depressions (I don't only have bpd, I have schizoaffective and anxiety as well). What a mess!

My husband deserves better... I'm too selfish. Want my way all the time. Too afraid of going out. Averse to socialising. And so on it goes....."

488,"I will try to keep it short.. if at all possible.
Back in 2009 at the age of 17 I was told by a doctor I had post natal depression.
I had already suffered with anxiety since I was mugged at the age of 13.
I was brought up by an abusive alcoholic mother who unfortunately passed away out of the blue in 2017 exactly 4 weeks before I had my second daughter ( she was 49, I was 24... Relevant because I feel it's very unfair ) 
I had my 7 year old to look after and console and had my youngest 2 weeks after her funeral. I have never had time to process this or feel anything about it due to this. 
Between 2012 and 2019 I was in an abusive relationship /marriage with the man I had my youngest daughter with. 

I always thought my behaviours were a reaction to how other people were treating me. IV struggled all these years.. 
Now I have a new partner, who isn't as toxic as I am, infact he treats me better than I ever have been and it prompted me to go back to the doctor in August as I didn't want to push him away, realising he wasn't going anything to prompt my behaviours.. the doctor suspected BPD but said she can't diagnose. I am still waiting for the mental health team to get in touch for a diagnosis, however another doctor since has also said bpd. 

I dont know what I want from this. IV never spoken to someone else who has bpd. IV never met someone who has it. I just feel very alone. I feel like alot of my behaviours are shameful and I can't open up completely to anyone about how I feel or what I think for fear of being judged because alot of it isn't very nice.."
489,"Hello!

hope people are okay! I know that current time’s are making everyone’s mental health worse so massive hug to everyone :hug: 

My question is this I’ve been told I’m empathic which is a common trait of people with BPD which doesn’t  shock me as I can kinds of sense emotion especially fear / sadness even if someone is smiling and says they’re okay. I did a test with a CPN called something like a mind in the eye something or other where you look at cards with eyes and tell what emotion people are feeling apparently my score was really high. I also find it hard to walk away from anyone in trouble or is suffering either physically or mentally my instinct is to help even on occasions where people have shouted at me or said they hate me and a few months or so later I’ve walked past and seen that person crying and gone over to try and help them. My question is this ... could I be right in thinking that our enhanced ability to like sense other people’s emotions is what causes us so much sadness I feel like I’ve got an emotional mind reading trait but it’s heartbreaking because like if someone else is sad I feel sad I just wanted to know if this ability is what is causing my depression - grateful for any responses but I appreciate people are busy and it might not be something anyone else can answer but if anyone can thanks in advance :) X"
490,"i can't sleep at night because im sleeping during the day so i don't have to think and worry
i feel so separated from the world and everything im under huge stress with possibly soon having to be alone for a while

i feel like i want to die

had such a bad day yesterday"
491,"I often read how being diagnosed with bpd is like a light bulb moment for many sufferers. How things suddenly fall into place and they recognise all the signs in themselves. A kind of turning point I suppose.
I too recognised all the symptoms in myself and with further reading felt a familiarity with what others were saying.
But...I don't like to label myself as having bpd. I prefer to see it as I'm just not coping with life very well for a whole variety of reasons. 
I find being labelled with bpd a noose around my neck. It constricts me and slots me tidily into a system where therapy, treatment plans and medication are the holy grail to recovery.
But having followed the expert advice and the treatment plans I find myself no further forward. In fact if anything i am more confused, isolated, and distant than ever.
So yes I am diagnosed with bpd but No... this is not who i am. I am me. A human being who struggles against the changing tides of life along with millions of other people. No amount of medication or therapy will ever change who I am. Only acceptance and letting go of the past will free my mind from suffering. Change will not come from books, courses, therapy etc...it will only come from within."
492,Had my mental health nurse come today she said I can either go in voluntary or be sectioned I’m so scared I just want to run away
493,"this is just a rant I wanted to get out there, if you want to read but don’t want to read it all I wrote a little conclusion at the bottom

I’m just so sick of living with my head. I’m sat here in the dark crying. And I don’t know why I’m so upset. But I just feel like my whole world is falling to pieces. I’m so tired of the emotions. I’m so tired of feeling so happy and good about life and one trigger making me feel like I have nothing and everything is defrosted.

I was on ft with my girlfriend and her friend, he friends saying all of this dodgy shit and they live close to each other so they’re off with another girl to go do some dodgy shit and I just feel so alone. My gf friends friend (the other girl) whispered does she say anything (we met just then on ft) and my girlfriends friend asked this girl wants to know if you talk and my girlfriend said don’t be offended she just doesn’t talk to new people. It’s true I don’t. I get a lot of anxiety and just feel uncomfortable. I particularly felt uncomfortable because my gf doesn’t like this girl. I just feel so stupid. Like the odd one out that can’t handle social situations. Why can’t I be normal.

I then go off camera and I just can’t be asked it’s triggered me and I just feel shit. I was smiling and laughing away before and they were all talking about stuff that I wasn’t involved in. Driving and insurance and when they passed and I’m only just learning. So I already felt left out and there was nothing I could say. Then that girl said that and I just thought wow I really am a freak.

Anyway then they start discussing doing something dodgy and I am honestly the lamest person ever. I’d rather spend Friday night doing a puzzle than go out, but my gf is doing something stupid and dangerous and I’m just angry. Why would she get herself in that situation. Why’s she going out with people so late at night. I don’t like her friend as it is and she’s put her in a stupid situation.

I know I’m overreacting like the stupid dodgy thing isn’t even that dodgy but my girlfriend could see I was off so was messaging me and being nice and saying she knows when I lie and what’s up. I didn’t want to say I was mad cause it’s not fair on her so I said I’m just tired but despite knowing I’m upset she still went out and why didn’t she just stay home with me. I’m so overreacting but I feel like second best. I feel abandoned.

In conclusion: 
I’m just so so fucking tired of feeling emotions that aren’t justified, and feeling angry and jealous when I shouldn’t feel that way and it’s toxic to feel that way. I’m fucking sick of feeling emotions so intensely and so deeply and not being able to show them and having to hide them because they are unfair to feel on my gf. I’m fucking sick of feeling.

494,"Hey everyone! 

So I was recently thinking about how I can never find personal stories of people with BPD who've been able to make progress in their life. I've found articles and statistics on BPD recovery, but they seem to come from a perspective by professionals who treat it and journalist. That thought gave doubt for a while, but I realized that it's probably just more likely that we express how bad were feeling and our doubt, than express progress.

So I thought I'd share some of my own, it's not a lot but maybe it can give a little hope to anyone who feels down. Mood stabilizers have seemed to help pretty well after being on them for a couple months. Like I still feel a range of emotions, but I don't feel so volatile and suicidal. My new job is not great but it's challenging in a way that's stimulating. I've also connected with a close friend that I had a huge falling out with due to my BPD. Our relationship may never go back to what it was but it was nice to have some closure over my last terrible experience with them.

They're not huge improvements, and I obviously want so much more to consider myself ""happy"". But they are tiny wins that make me want to get to the next day and I think that's important.

Please share any progress and other encouraging stories if y'all would like. I'm sure some of us could use it. ♥️"
495,"Hey,

This may sound peculiar, but I feel like I keep glitching?

I don't mean metaphorically, I actually feel like I keep sort of ... I don't know, I can't really explain it, but like I keep having sort of glitch feels? In my head.

It's creeping me out. 

Anyone else experienced this?"
496,This is the third time I've tried to be on this site. I only lasted a few weeks the previous 2 times. I doubt this time will be any different. To the detriment of my own sanity I thought I'd give it one last go...maybe I should say bye just now 🤪
497,"As the title says, I've never met another borderline, well at least not one that would admit it and until this moment I have never really thought about it one way or another, I just accepted it as truth with little research and had no thought to seek out others.

I should also add I've not had any real counseling to deal with my borderline specifically, I was diagnosed at the age of 17.  I did the ""I'm going to kill myself"" phase, I did drugs, I ruined every relationship I could get my hands on, went to many psychiatric hospitals, and went through drug treatment 13 times, but again I never even considered delving into my main issue, until about 70 minutes ago.

So, I was scrolling through YouTube and had a random suggestion for a video called ""back from the edge"" I've never seen it, but I was intrigued. Maybe some of you have seen it, if so, I'd like to know your opinions.

I've watched it and the first thing that came to mind was, ""yep, that's me"".  It's weird to watch people describe my thoughts and behaviors, gives me more insight to what I do and makes it a little less lonely.  No major ah ha moments or huge revelations, just some validation.  I'm oldish now, 49, so my symptoms are reduced but I still struggle at times.  I'm not really sure what my point is but I just felt the need to write.

As always thanks for letting me post."
498,"So I'm at breaking point. I cannot cope with this life anymore. I am far too sensitive and useless to be able to survive. I can count my blessings you know, I have a house and a full time job that I can do from home. Problem is, its not my normal job and my anxiety and depression are making it impossible to learn what I need to do and do it properly. I remember nothing and when people talk to me about work, they may as well be talking in a different language - it just makes no sense. I am working from home and whilst I appreciate that I am able to do that - I hate it. Its lonely and I feel so cut off. My manager is very supportive but I feel like I'm pushing her too far with what I admit to her about how I'm feeling (although she constantly says I can tell her anything) and the burden that I am. She must long for the day that I'm not there and she can get a 'normal' member of staff who doesn't need their hand holding all of the time.

I live with my long term partner which is fraught most of the time. I tread on eggshells to avoid arguments and me being at home all of the time is making it worse.

I self harmed for the first time in ages last week. Made me realise how much I had missed it.
I've done my will and my partner knows who we've got things with like gas and electric etc. 


I feel trapped with no way out apart from suicide. I wake up every morning which such a feeling of dread - its too much.

 

I have no idea what I expect from this post but I just needed to offload somewhere safe.

499,"Does anyone else do this. I sometimes do things that will make a situation worse for myself.  

Is it because I don't think I deserve something or that I feel that I am not good enough, probably a bit of both.

I also feel that when I am feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, which is happening a lot a work currently then I go quiet and grumpy, there are 2 women I work with and not one of them asks me how I am, they just roll their eyes or make comments to each other which are clearly about me.  

I work really hard and feel under appreciated. Then I start to make things worse for myself by being in a mood.   It's like they expect me to be perfect and make comments when I am not, it's like I am not allowed to be annoyed about anything. Then the comments make my mood worse and i feel like a terrible person.  If one of them is not having a good day no one says anything. 

I have started to drink, I don't get completely drunk but am having a few to get me through the next day.  Sometimes I have a couple before I go to work which I suppose is self sabotage as I am making it worse.   I have tried looking for another job but there is not much around due to Covid."

I’ll do it, I dunno :( like I try and be me and show kindness to people and help people and stuff so why is my brain doing this to me X"
508,"Now, this feeling always comes and goes but I caught it this time. It feels like a cross between utter hopelessness and a desire to feel with one with everything and dissolve completely. No, I haven't been on nor have I taken drugs, it's probably just how my depression convinces me to lose all hope. It's a weird feeling but it's almost like a defense mechanism because when I've felt it, I refuse to have contact with anybody. You could say I develop a strong sense of misanthropy excluding living creatures like animals, such as my pets (I should include my family as well), I also have an immense hatred for conflict of any kind and I hate stepping into the role of the aggressor because it literally gives me chronic pain. I'm in no position to censor anybody but when you strive to see the good in everyone, you become afraid you're being taken advantage of. I live with politically driven parents with opinions that oppose my own and with this racial tension, I'm overwhelmed with grief due to naturally being an optimist. Like, if you knew me in person, you wouldn't believe anything was wrong with me because my humor overshadows my emotional side. This is also the reason why I'm conflicted because I still want to be taken seriously.

Right now, I feel hazy with emotions that question my place is on this planet. How can I help people during this time? Are my own thoughts deceiving me? Am I pathetic for having strong feelings towards these crises? It feels like tug-of-war, I'm afraid my optimism is making me out to be ignorant, but it's what I do to keep myself motivated. Truthfully, I just want to gain a new perspective rather than one that are presented to me every day. I don't hate people, I'm just disgusted that I live in a system with ulterior motives."

515,"Last night, I had a series of panic attacks over turning 22 and how time flies. It only seems like I just turned 21 yesterday! Now that I'm aware of what's happening to me mentally and emotionally, I think it's time that I made some lifestyle adjustments. I'm done sharing details about my personal life and desperately trying to befriend others. I've realized my problem and it's using others to help distract me from myself. This habit has been going on for years and now I'm finally cutting that mentality loose. It's juvenile and unproductive! When I was younger, I had a tendency to ask people if they were still my friends and I would act possessive towards them. To be honest, I never had friends and haven't had one in nearly 5 years. I've starved that needy part of myself to death and now accept that my need for people is only frivolous and comes from wanting validation. I'm kissing my false identity goodbye next year because I think it's time to finally meet the person hiding behind my disorder. 

I know unveiling my suppressed personality is going to take time, but now I think I finally know the culprit of my misadventures with relationships with people. It all starts with me and what I'm willingly giving out to others as a way of hiding in plain sight, if that makes any sense? I guess I've had time to think about how my disorder reacts to certain situations and it's mostly a distorted self-image mixed with being person dependent. This side of me reacts badly when it's in conflict with my growing independence. I can see that I'm the older I get, the worse my BPD becomes. I've outgrown the need to be liked by everyone because it's unrealistic and naive. I want to make peace with the misguided child within me so I can take with me into adulthood. I didn't have good role models or encouragement growing up and I hope it's not too late to follow the dreams I had as a child. 

This is my final post for a while, but I'll still respond to your comments. Thank you and blessed be."

519,"Reading this article, reading, nodding at some, reading, then read the section about grudges -- not that I'd ever purposefully set someone up, but man do I ever hold a grudge.

https://www.healthline.com/health/covert-narcissist

My therapist always said that I was firmly in Cluster B and that no one person is every 100% BPD, but now I'm wondering if I'm closer to what my mom was than I care to admit. Which would gut me.

What fits: I love the grandiose, if I'm knocked down by someone at work I just get back up and do laps around them to prove my worth/intelligence, I hold strong grudges, I can be passive-aggressive especially when dealing with blunt and aggressive people who scare me.

But: I also think in black and white, I self-sabotage, I have impulse control, extreme emotional swings (though not as much in 2020 as in previous years), I go through long periods of feeling empty, a lifetime of unstable relationships, and explosive anger.

It appears, however, that anger is shared between the two disorders.

I'm starting to believe more and more that my therapist was right. That anyone diagnosed with BPD will additionally have other traits from Cluster B. All of them have some roots in childhood or other traumas, even narcissists. And then that can be further complicated by symptoms of anxiety and depression which may impact a correct diagnosis, and subsequent treatment -- although I'm not sure DBT would work for someone with NPD -- too much introspection.

It's also interesting that these new variants are emerging -- I had never heard of quiet BPD, or covert NPD, or EUPD before posting here. Mental illness will forever resist the attempt to compartmentalize I guess."

523,"Hey guys,

I have BPD deep trust issues, and just started my first relationship at 31. I meditate, eat clean and exercise, but my mind is always looking for situations to convince me she is being untrustworthy. I've had some people do nasty things in the past, but she is a genuinely kind person, and somehow in the moment my mind is always able to convince me she is ""like the rest.""

I don't start DBT until the new year, but I need to learn how to take my mind off the tracks when that train is coming and I *have* to say how I feel, instead of contemplating what caused her or the situation to act like they did.

Does anybody have coping strategies that work in grounding them? I've been putting in a hell of a lot of work but when this happens, my feet are stuck in the proverbial mud."
524,"Hi everyone,

I really hope it okay for my to post looking for advice on this topic, even though I have never been diagnosed. This really is the most honest I have ever been.

I have suffered from anxiety and depression since my younger teens. I self harmed and took hard drugs and was sexually promiscuous from a very young age. This was all to fill the voids I  had with not growing up in a loving and supportive home where my feeling were never validated. I really hated my family life, I used to have deep dark thoughts about harming my step dad and mum to punish them. I was such an angry, sad lost kid and I really struggled with any sense of self of self worth. I don't really have many memories of my childhood and I can't connect to actually being that kid- all I can really remember was feeling angry all the time.

In my adult life, depression and anxiety comes and goes- that's just how it is. But I feel there's something inside me that's affecting literally every area of my life and I can't relate it to depression or anxiety. This is what that other area feels like-

Work- I go from job to job. The main reason is absence because I will go in to a depression or I just don't have the energy to control my emotions because I feel there has been some level of injustice in the workplace or someone- usually several people are plotting against me or not supporting me. I find it very hard to bite my tounge and have lashed out at managers, colleauges, HR departments etc. Injustic is an extremely difficult thing for me to wrap my head around and I will either react to it by turning a blind eye completely (even though I might angrily obsess about it later)
or reacting to it in a way others just don't. Because although they may feel the same, they know to control their emotions to avoid conflict. Whereas I just see red and I have to express that.
I have been signed off work from periods of 2- 8 months on and off. It's frustrating not to have stability in your work life but I just can't seem to cope with working environments for long periods. I end up jobless, hating myself whilst looking for other work.

Relationships- I think all of my ex's would say 'I turned crazy in the end'
I have been in several toxic and abusive relationships which I think I endured because of low self esteem and wanting to hold on to that person.
When things are going good and I'm with someone who really makes me feel loved and is in contact with me a lot, giving me attention- it's great. But I can go from idolising them on a very intense level to having these horrible thoughts about them in a split second- it's like love turns to hate and this can happen even with my current partner (who is an absolute angel) Over the years I have got better at controlling this ie now, I won't voice these because I know they are based on nothing but this horrible, completely irrational hatred that comes over me . So I hold it all inside but I let it out in other ways like spending time apart from her or taking longer to reply to messages. Then all of a sudden I feel this surge of love and get pulled between that love and hate and I feel like I'm going crazy.
I'm always pulled between the best version of myself and the worst. Friendships are the same. I don't talk to a single person I went to school or college with. I have two very close friends- one I've known 10 months and the other, 4 years.
I struggle to maintain contact with my family, I do try but the second I feel any time of judgement or rejection I cut myself off. I love my family a lot and I do enjoy talking to them, it really confuses me. When I maintain contact, we will speak regularly for a few weeks but then it's back to square one. It's very hard for me to keep and maintain relationships with anyone, really. 

Self Harm- As an adult, I can honestly say I've never struggled with this and my heart goes out to those who do. My own self punishment comes in the way of excessive and erratic spending to the point I've had to turn to escorting to get myself out of serious debt, endangering my safety on numerous occasions. 
I smoke weed some nights because sometimes it's the only thing that stops my brain from switching from one thing to another. Alcohol is really the only way I can socialise. Unless that is, I'm in a really happy place. I go hyper, I want to do all the things I possibly can, I want to achieve and keep myself busy. But that doesn't last, it's constant highs and lows then depression eventually hits anyway.

Reading all that back, I feel a sense of shame. That people don't know the real me. I promote this confident, funny girl who gets a log with everyone. Everyone who meets me warms to me straight away.
But it feels like that's just the surface. I shut myself away a lot, I spend all my time trying to burry horrible feelings that I don't want to let out. I feel like a fake person. That I'm evil inside and these thoughts are eventually one day going to take me over and the 'good version' of me who is always fighting to get through, will just give up one day.

I really appreciate anyone and everyone who has taken the time to read this. Any advice, just anything you think would be helpful, please let me know. I'm just trying to understand why I'm like this.
I wish you all lots of love and peace

525,"I don’t know why but lately I been thinking about terminal illness and I don’t know why but I feel like if I got a terminal illness I’d like become homicidal and it bothers me because atm I’d do anything for anyone but the thought of me thinking about this like bothers me and I know I would as well like I’m not expecting  to be told I’m terminally ill I just don’t like that I get those thoughts.

I think since my mum died life is pointless
I know there’s no life after death 
If you know you’re dying why not just do what you want not like you’re going to be around again 
I remember going to see a mh nurse and she asked her colleague for advice on my case and that colleague worked in forensic mh ... so basically since then I’ve been like they basically think I’m going to be a criminal even though I lived my life trying to be kind and help people.
they were leaning towards a diagnosis overcontrolled bpd even though I feel I’m impulsive I tend to bottle anger up though and then when something happens like when someone almost ran me over then shouted at me I lost my head and I was ready to pull him out of the car and fight my eyes glaze over and I don’t see anything else except that person I cant think of anything and I feel kinda numb to everything like I’m spacing out.

so I guess I am a bad person after all :("
526,"Disclaimer: I am not trying to self diagnose. I understand that this forum isn't meant for that. I just want some insight from those who have been diagnosed with BPD.

Why I think I may have Borderline Personality Disorder:

I have engaged in frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, and I have a pattern of unstable relationships.

During my time in elementary school and all the way through high school, I have consistently felt as if my friends and family were going to abandon me. I would always ask them, “you love me, right? Are you going to leave me? How can I make you stay?”. When I began to feel as if my friends would rather not have me around, I would become consumed by the fear of being left behind. My mind would race with thoughts of being left out, even if it was something as simple as one friend staying over at another’s house for a sleepover, or one friend being invited to a stranger’s birthday and me not being able to tag along because I don’t know the other friend.

Currently, my closest friend and roommate, Britanie, is slowly being pushed away by my behavior. I completely understand why a person would want to distance themselves from someone who has explosive outbursts of anger, but I also become extremely distressed when she brings up the possibility of moving out on her own. My outbursts coincide with my own perception of her not caring enough or doing enough for me. One example is food. When we buy groceries, we always purchase enough food for the both of us, and it is a rule that one is not allowed to touch the other’s without permission. I normally eat up all of my food much faster than her, and when I do, I demand that she give me some of hers. She will calmly explain that this food belongs to her and that I shouldn’t have eaten up all of mine. I become extremely angry and question her as to why she would do this to me, and why she doesn’t care enough about me.

Arguments like this have happened an innumerable amount of times, and after each and every argument, I break down and cry and beg for forgiveness. I then go on to portray the “woe is me” attitude and begin to despise myself.

I have an unstable identity and a constantly-shifting sense of self.

I have changed my interests and vocational goals a multitude of times. I remember dedicating myself to musical theory and composition in high school when I joined orchestra. My entire life became music, and I wanted to be a music teacher. However, after months of this, almost instantly, every single piece of love I had for this hobby vanished, and I felt hollow, like nothing could make me happy. The same thing happened with visual art. I joined many art classes in school like sculpture, drawing, and cartooning. I worked my fingers to the bone painting and drawing many things, and I even had applied to Ringling for illustration and game design. Now, I can’t even bring myself to pick up a brush or a pencil and create something. It just bores me now.
The same thing has happened with wanting to be a lawyer, then doctor, then language teacher, then chemist, then medical researcher. I have an outstanding passion for something, and then, almost instantly, I have absolutely no interest in it.

This kind of behavior isn’t limited to vocational aspirations, as I have also experienced a need to constantly change the way I look, talk, and act to fit my own ever-fleeting desires of self image. I have no idea what my actual voice sounds like anymore because I have been trapped in a never-ending cycle of change

Those two are the main ones from the DSM-5 that I experience. I also experience a persistant feeling of hollowness and boredom. I am almost never satisfied with something and crave to find something new to enjoy.
I have also made suicidal gestures in the past, but have never self-harmed."
527,"So I recently got out of jail and I had first contact with my x relationship today,  the conversation started ok and then it went negative with my past mistakes and being a addict was brought up..  Then she text me saying I'm nasty and self centered and I didn't reply. I don't have many good thoughts these days so to add to that it's left me feeling like a bad person, how can I focus on changing my life when I'm burdened by my past.. I don't have any support, I feel very much alone I try deflecting bad images of myself and the future and replacing them with anything positive but it rarely works and it consumes my energy.. It sucks cause everything around me can turn so detrimental and destructive if I let in.. how to be kind to myself??  so hard when iv been a failure in the past"
528,"im so literally exhausted ,i know im not helping on here much right now and im sorry
im just so weak and tired"
529,I feel like quitting everything. Nothing will ever change because I am the problem; I hate myself and everything around me is shit. I can't do anything right and I hate everything. How can anything ever be better if I'm still me ?
530,"Basically in the past I used to have issues with one manager when I was on a different team, who was absolutely horrible to me when I first started. She was so completely negative towards me (not great for someone with self-esteem issues), had nothing positive to say about me, only to criticise everything and I had real problems with her as she just made me even more on edge. Once she even made me cry because she was so horrible to me and she didn't even care, she just let me go home crying. That's the type of person she is.
There were a couple of managers working with her and they were all really bad with me, and now this is in the past.

Now long time pass and I start working really hard, excelling, doing great with people, the big boss notices me, some senior people like me
and start noticing me. All of that other stuff with the bad managers were in the past. But this one manager who is obviously chummy with her said to me today ""Oh is it still going well for you? Because I know it just didn't work out for you when you were with us"", really unnecessary comment, made me feel like utter crap remembering all that stuff I went through with the old manager and my depression. Now I'm getting really paranoid that the entire managers where I work are all bitching about my depression, or worse that some of them pity me. Many people pity me and say what a 'sweet' person I am. I am tired of being viewed in this sense, would it go so amiss for others to show some respect, rather than just looking at me with this pity? I am super paranoid they have been bitching about me especially as the managers on the old team are weird with me and now these comments. I don't want them to talk to the big boss about me, not that he even has time. It's all so strange, I'm getting paranoid even though I am usually stable. Recently, one small comment can completely make me question myself"
531,"I'm a 20 year old woman who had been struggling mentally ever since I can remember.
At 17 I started self harming because I lost the capability to control my anger and sadness and my black and white thinking was even worse.
That same year I started going to therapy, but my therapist was a very old lady who didn't really help me much. She actually retired pretty soon after I started. So I stopped going and then at 18/19 I started therapy again. My new therapist was a man and he often made me feel uncomfortable, but then again I'm a sensitive person who feels uncomfortable around men in general.
One day I revealed to him that I self harm. That I'm often reckless. And since I go to social studies where I study psychology I'm aware of BPD so I thought I had it. But he told me not to worry and said I didn't have BPD because 1. I don't go and sleep around with random people and 2. I don't drive recklessly. I thought it was strange that he thinks it's not BPD just because I don't have these two particular behaviours. And I don't even have a drivers licence so the latter is basically impossible to do eitherway. Anyways, all the other things that often appear in BPD patients like drinking alcohol everytime they get a mental breakdown or being overly sensitive and unstable are very true to me. I constantly do reckless things when I'm hurt or mad. If I'm sad it's always the rockbottom. There's no inbetween. One time a man I used to talk to decided to block me out of the blue when I didn't even bother him. I started hating and blaming myself. I thought it was my fault and freaked out. My thinking turned completely black. And this happened at midnight so I left my house and ran outside. I ran into a dark and foggy forest crying, not realizing that I shouldn't be in the forest so late. I didn't realize anything because I could only feel intense sadness and pain. I walked on a barely lit up treadmill and spoke loudly (it helps me cope) and then realized there was some man walking in front of me. I got quiet and as soon as I passed him I started running thinking he might turn around and chase me. That's when it hit me that I was acting really impulsive and reckless and was risking my own life. I ran back home crying even more because I could've died that day. When I came back home I sat in my bedroom and kept thinking about the same thing over and over until I hated myself even more. I started thinking that the man who blocked me knows I'm crazy even though I never showed him how I reacted when he did something like this. That night I almost killed myself. But I waited out till the morning to make my decision. In the morning I wasn't suicidal anymore and I couldn't understand why I reacted so intensely. I actually always think I would deal with something calmly, but once it happens I turn into a demon. A demon that destructs themselves and thinks everyone hates them.
My reactions to pain are impulsive and self destructive. Everytime I'm hurt I run outside like a maniac, harm myself, drink or beat myself up in other ways. Sometimes I post some depressive quote on social media but it happens very rarely because I'm so aware of BPD and black and white thinking that I am capable of enduring the pain quietly and reminding myself even during the mental breakdown that I'll regret posting something that affected my reputation. Since I care so much about having people in my life my reputation is everything to me and on the times I did post crazy things I thought I completely lost myself. I was at my worst.
I know something like a block shouldn't hurt so much. But to me it's the end of the world. Fear of abandonment is really and issue to me, but so far I'm still not diagnosed."
532,"Hello, I am just trying to figure out what is wrong with me. With the pandemic, I do not trust talking to doctors. So I came here. I feel I have bi polar or bpd. I have a doctor in the family and seems to think so. The only mental problem I know I have is OCD (doctor i saw told me last year), not sure what else. Stopped going after virus. I came here so you can help me. Thank you for reading and helping me. Do you believe I have bpd?

Here is what I experience:

- My moods shift: I go from sad to happy to angry. It depends. But my moods are like a light switch.

- I even go into a mood where I feel 'extreme boredom', no idea what to do with my life, and leads to irritation. 

*lately I have been controling my moods though. 

- I sometimes (been a while since I felt this) go into a quick rage. I do not hurt anyone. I never hurt myself (not suicidal). I just hit objects. I destroy my own property. I once stabbed my own table after getting into a fight. I do not want to hurt myself, anyone else, just objects. The rage comes and goes. It is fast. After hitting objects it goes away. Go back to normal. 

- I do not trust people: I have a very small group of friends. And do not trust strangers. I feel they are against me. And do not trust their intentions. Even the nicest people. I once even accused my step-father of hating me after being rude to me. He did not mean any harm. I see that now. It takes a while for me to trust anyone. If I feel you are against me, I will think about it over and over (probably my OCD?) And think why do you hate me. My mind can take a situation and turn it into another. People can mean no harm and I take i another way 

- I am paranoid about situations all the time. 

- I go into moments where I feel like everything is over and life is over and a loser.  Ex: I am turning 29 next year. I accomplished nothing in my life (job-wise) and feel I do not have much time left till old age (my 30s). I feel like a fucking loser with no money.

- I have severe insomnia (do not know if that has anything to do. Just trying to name everything). 

- I hate being told what to do: Problems with authority. Annoyed and angry when people order me around. I do something it is because I want to do it. 

Been feeling down for months. Probably the lockdown and now everything else. But I feel down. Depressed. Feel like I took downers."
533,I was just looking at using a mood tracker app called daylio not sure if its any good or not. My moods change a lot so wanted something visual to look at to see if there is a trigger I don't know off. Have any of you used an app like this if yes what app was it and what did you think of it x
534,"Hello, 

My name is Beth and I have BPD. I am struggling so much to deal with it all these days. My fiancée left me in May with absolutely no warning and I miss her terribly. I talk to strangers online hoping to find some sort of connection, something to keep me going. I don't know if I'm lonely. I'm constantly surrounded by people. Family when I'm home, colleagues when I'm at work, friends when I'm out. The world goes on and on continuously and yet I am still stuck here, trying to get through the day. At least today the BPD voice in my head hasn't screamed at me too much. It usually tells me to kill myself and hurt myself everyday. I'm on new medication which I like to take because it usually makes me sleepy enough to actually sleep, instead of me just laying in the dark thinking about dying. 
I'm sorry this post is so sad. But I am sad. And I think I need help."
535,"So me and my girlfriend were just having a conversation and she just jokingly said that’s your fear of abandonment, I don’t get why you’ve got it Ive never abandoned you, then I questioned her if she meant that (just because I’ve explained to her quite a few times, well tried to) but then she said in a frustrated yeah yeah I know voice that she knows that I can’t help it and I can’t control it.

I’m just quite upset. We’ve been together just over a year and I was trying to kind of slowly educate her at the start of our relationship just to help both of us and her understand me but she quite quickly went why do you always bring up your BPD? And seemed annoyed so I stopped that and I try every so often but I just feel so invalidated and unheard.

So I was just wondering how people have educated their significant other? How can I make her understand BPD and myself?"
536,"Hi all, my wife struggles with bpd, anxiety, depression, emetophobia and agoraphobia, she's not left the house in 2 and half years and life has been hell for the both of us, we're on the verge of breaking up after 7 years together and it's cutting me up inside, she's been abandoned twice now by the mental health team at our hospital, they even had a diagnosis of bpd a few years ago and didn't tell us, the first time she was abandoned was because she was to ill for her appointment so called to rearrange and they said they would but instead they discharged her, we only found out in January when they came out again but then was abandoned in July after they had promised her so much help, all they did was come for some home visits to get her out the house and a 5 min walk up the road, and a few breathing exercises, no help with the bpd or anything else and have refused twice in letter saying they have give her the tools to work with to do it on her own, even after I was in tears on the phone to them because she is self harming again and that our relationship has been crumbling. 

Even if our marriage doesn't survive I still want to make sure she has the help she deserves, if any of you know where she can get help with her bpdwould be great, all i want is for my wife to not struggle anymore, we're in the UK, Nottinghamshire.."
537,"If anyone here has officially been diagnosed with BPD or Bipolar. And especially if you are in the UK, Can you tell me what the process is like? Like how long it took, what it cost, what it included for example? That would really put my mind at ease and be a little less disturbing for when I go through with it"
538,"So big change incoming and it really is scary, as some of you know my wife and I have decided to break up, mental health really can put a strain on a marriage as many of you I have doubts understand all to well...

I have a viewing for a house on Monday which I'll be accepting straight away, it's just a 5 min walk from our house where my wife will stay, I'm still going to be her carer because there is some challange she is just unable to overcome on her own for now and it will also help to get her used to leaving the home to pop round and visit our furbaby who will be coming with me, hopefully she has the chance now to stand on her own 2 feet without getting everything done for her. 

Before I do move out I'm going to make sure she is sat with me while we change any relevant bills over to her name, so what I will do is explain to whatever company the reason its changing over and that she needs to talk on the phone and get used to doing this for herself as she has never had to do these things because panic sets in just at the thought of been on a phone. 

I know it's still going to be a long road ahead for her and some people have already said that clean breaks are always the best but in my eyes that's not the right thing to do, I know that I need to put myself first and I will ultimately make sure I don't allow my mental health to drop anymore, but I need to at least give her a bit of guidance when needed, we are still going to be friends, I wouldn't want that to not happen, granted I also don't want to be to involved because if she does have certain types of relations due to the promiscuity I really don't want to hear about that or see her with a temporary guy as this is still fresh and still emotional for me, I am very much depressed and have started taking citalopram again after 7 years of not needing them, she will also watch out for me as taking meds can be rough at the start so if I do struggle I know I can come and stay here any nights and that be OK although I'll try to avoid that as we don't want to fall into any dependence on each other and be back where we started with things going down the pan.

I am worried that if life does turn out to be to much for her to handle she may do something bad to herself, for many years she always asked for permission to kill herself or for me to help so it didn't go wrong because she said she would never just let me find her as that wasn't right so she needed me to be OK with it, obviously I never did, but it's scares the hell out of me that because we've broke up she won't have the need for me to be OK with it, she has promised that if ever she has any thoughts about it she would phone me straight away but I know it doesn't work like that, 

I'm also worried that her friend who has to look for a new place to live is going to try and push to move in (it may sound jealous of me because he's male) but I know that if this happens she will be back to square one and not do things for herself again, we had a chat about it and she feels the same way so I hope that doesn't happen but at the end of the day it's her call, I can only give advice.

I'm really annoyed that I never got a call back from insight yesterday as I need to find out if they provide dbt so she can get the help with that as soon as possible and so that I can go through them to go see the mental health team myself... 

It's going to be a difficult time ahead and I'm so glad that I found this forum as you've all helped so much in just a few days of having people to talk to ❤️"
539,"Hi everyone so my sister got something stolen from her house and we kept getting messages that it’s this certain girl I’ve been arguing with this girl she’s younger that me all day and now I’m sitting here scared shitless because im worried she’s going to post it on Facebook or they will turn up at my house even though they won’t have no idea where I live but I’ve got all these bad thoughts in my head and I feel like TW self harming I can’t tell my family what I’ve done apart from my sister because they would have told me not to get involved I just wanted to help but I ended up arguing and being mean and now I’m scared what should
I do!!!"
540,"My friend keeps sending messages asking about Halloween party plans and I keep avoiding/ignoring them because my friends are purposely excluding her because her boyfriend is really really unpleasant to be around and we don't want him to come. I feel like all of the pressure is on me to handle it and these situations freak me out and send me into absolute panic. I had to take a half sick day from work the first time she asked because I had a really bad breakdown. 

I think if I ask my other friends they'll not really get my position. I feel like with BPD I'm ""allergic"" to these kinds of situations so I gotta take extra precautions to take care of myself whereas people without BPD are more resilient. 

Looking for advice on how to handle these people interactions but also be mindful of my own experience"
541,"Lately with all the added stress of life my mood swings have become much more unstable. Previously any anger I felt would be directed inward, but within the past month or so my anger has been directed outwardly more and more. I feel like I'm going to lose my job because I work in a call center and I get uncontrollably angry on calls that are more stressful than they need to be and that anger gets directed at the caller. So far I haven't done anything or said anything but I am scared that time is coming. I don't know what to do and I feel incredibly helpless."
542,"My grandma is the strongest person I know.

She's the queen of loss.

She's one of the last of her sibling (only 2/6 remaining) (one passed at 16 years old in a tragic hunting accident) (one battled cancer) 
She buried both her parents in 1980 (they passed within months of eachother, one from a broken heart) 
She lost her husband in 1992 (suicide) 
Her niece died in 2014 (aunt becky form an absolutly brutal and unexpected double lung cancer diagnosis after she had a cold that wouldnt go away she died two months after) (becky was also a secret baby born from that 16 year old brother she discovered later in life.) 
And now she's  outlived her first grandchild.

I can't  imagine doing this again and again."
543,"I don't sleep very well as it is but when I wake up I instantly feel a sinking feeling, kinda like a feeling of dread and sometimes I just can't shake it off. Today is one of those days.
I have to get up and go to work and put on a front again. I actually feel exhausted."
544,"I haven't spoken to my care coordinator on the phone for about 2 weeks now because I've ignored her a couple of times and now she doesn't bother. She wasn't very good anyway. 
I cancelled a session with my counsellor last week because I feel like we've kind of lost something, Idk if that makes sense. I just feel different towards here and I really didn't want to talk last week. Maybe she doesn't like me anymore. I do have a session booked in for next week though."
545,"Hey. So during my video session today, I told my counsellor that I feel like the counselling helps during those 50 minutes that I'm actually in the session. However, after that and for the rest of the week, I don't get anything from it. I said that maybe I need to be more pro-active (which isn't easy when you're feeling rubbish). My mind feels like it is racing almost 24/7. What are some of your methods for trying to alleviate this? Or advice that you could offer? She set me a task of trying 5 minutes of mindfulness a day until I speak to her next week (because I mentioned I had a book on the subject) but it just sounds kinda naff to me. I feel like it's now or never and I need to push for changes one last time before giving up completely. X"
546,"I took a screenshot of my counsellor tonight during our video session tonight... I have no idea why. 

I'm not having feelings for her or anything like that. 

I don't know why my mind is fucking abnormal."
547,"Well. I've returned to her this months when I was fallin in panic, but in my impulses I think I overwhelmed her, and she blocked my phone. I'm in control now, I don't want she lose her time in me. In facebook I've send my final message to her, I dont wanna to overwhelme her nevermore... Last words to her was: Someday I will pay my debts to you."
548,"I've been living undiagnosed for a while until earlier this year. Even though being diagnosed has been a game changer, I've found my condition worsening ever since. I'm fighting a battle nobody can see and it's ruining my life. I'll be turning 22 in a little over a week from now and it's giving me anxiety. I still rely on family for most things and it honestly embarrasses me. Sometimes I wish I could just be normal and then maybe I wouldn't be treat like a child. People my age or younger act more mature than me and I'm beginning to believe my mental health has something to do with it. My relationship with my emotional detached father is becoming more strained because he keeps aggravating me on purpose. My mother is the only one that gives a fat rat's ass about my mental health and is doing everything in her power to help me. Then again, I feel like a burden because I feel like my mental illness is partially the cause for her distress to begin with. I'm considering going to a doctor or visiting a clinic because I don't what my options are anymore. I'm dealing somatic symptoms of depression like digestive issues, headaches, lack of sleep, and chronic pain. It's critical that I get help somehow because on top of that, I'm dealing suicidal ideation.

Both my father's and mother's family are estranged and have no friends either. This is a difficult time for me and it has been since last year. I feel cornered by my own demons and am praying everyday that I find some peace of mind. I'm hoping that someday that I'll find fulfillment and a sustainable way to thrive. I'm out of ideas on what to do because I'm afraid that this might be it for me. I feel like I can do is watch the world go by."
549,Well it happened yesterday i have a group of friends that have a group message thing on Facebook. Well I was just joking around with some of my friends about there weight mind you I'm heavy too. Well she took it wrong and even my fiancee was very upset. She said why did I say that and how degrading mind you all my friends we always joke about everything so I wasnt thinking it too be serious well it blew up to something bigger and almost cost my relationship with my fiancee. Well the next morning I apologized on the group message to her well I guess I did t say it right and really offended her this time so she was even madder and made my fiancee even madder mind you this 1woman I made mad is my fiancee's son's aunt hes my stepson. Well now everyone of my friends dont want nothing to do with me. I wrote her a long apology and explained everything but no response. But I got to tell you two weeks ago I began feeling very sick like death and ended up in the er. Everything was out of wack. So then my doctor did an ultrasound and seen my liver failure. Now ever since that day i been getting worse health wise. And i have been diagnosed for many years with borderline personality disorder. But I was feeling in control with it until I got sick and it felt like it was ten times worse. I just feel so much regret because I am always angry never think before I speak and I destroy friendships. It's like a nightmare to me. Now it's almost halloween and the woman I made mad has an annual halloween party well I decided not to go cause it would be awkward and I just know everyone's gonna talk about me too. So I just dont know what to do anymore. I called my doctor today to get a sooner appointment cause i been feeling worse and they i see him tommorrow. I hope maybe i can rebuild something and make it better. Sorry for the rant.
550,"We got his ashes back today, put it on the mantel with his pictures.
It was so hard to hold all thats left of him.
The heartbreak runs do deep I can feel it in my soul. I am not prepared to cope with this."
551,Think she's had enough of me.  She told me what to buy and to make sure I did it right.
552,"I feel very overwhelmed. I have borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphia, Avoidant personality disorder, social anxiety, binge eating disorder, agoraphobia, clinical depression. I have had tons of therapy and been on lots of medication. I am more stable now and better then I ever have been but it just gets too much."
553,"Sorry if this doesn’t read well, I just wrote it all in one (indignant) go. Hopefully someone can advise me on what to do now.

For the last couple of years, I’ve been in crisis. During that time, I’ve constantly had multiple, ever changing diagnoses, but never anything official. I’ve pushed for clarity and been told one thing and then read the opposite whenever I can procure my notes. There’s been endless false information, omitted information and mixups made by psychiatrists, doctors, nurses and social workers in the two separate areas I’ve lived in. Mental health services have been incredibly elusive: not answering phone calls or calling back; giving me endless “assessments”, after which I never get to hear what they made of them. I imagine they haven’t even taken any notes and are just trying to make it look like they’re doing something so I don’t file another complaint. The mental health teams I’ve been under have each spoken over and over about referring me to a more suitable one but that hasn’t happened. I’ve been on waiting lists for therapy, which hasn’t happened. I had a stay in a mental health ward, during which the staff never spoke to me - it wasn’t at all therapeutic, it was more like prison. I recently fled domestic abuse and my so-called “care coordinator”, whom I’d never had one conversation with (my previous one was fired after I complained), told multiple lies in order to force me back to my hometown and avoid their team having to fund my housing. I’m now out of the mental health system and I don’t see much hope in trying to get back in and get the help I’m desperate for - I’m clearly not going to get it."
554,"I'm really angry internally at my sister, I guess she's just so insensitive about everything and it fucking pisses me off. Last night, I got super drunk with my cousin and siblings last night. And I kept blabbering about many things, and my sister just doesnt know when she should not cross a line. I was joking about hooking up with men. Suddenly my sister, I dont know how it started but we started bringing up the topic of me kissing a girl once. she snitched on me about liking girls, when my cousin asked if i liked a girl I said no, and my sister was like nudging me that ""yeah right, you even told me about the summer how you would post a story for the girl' like why the fuck would you do that? snitch on me and the fact that my cousin doesnt know I'm out yet and I'm still not comfortable with myself being out. after everyone went to sleep, I went back to my room and I had a splitting/rage episode. I got really angry at my sister by myself and started crying really about why would she out me like that, I was crying my balls out so I started harming myself again. I just dont fucking understand how can someone be that fucking stupid. two people have fucking outed me and I fucking hate it. Dont I have the right to be mad? Or am I being petty?"
555,"I am thankfully talking to a good therapist right now.   The BPD struggle and all that does with therapy is so so difficult.   I think of it almost like learning a foreign language.   One of the biggest issues i deal with is having absolutely no support system at all.   No one to call or reach out to when I am in crisis mode.  I always hated putting the burden on someone of listening to my problems...which can be overwhelming to them.  I get that... and don't blame them for getting to a limit.   Covid  has made any type of group therapy non-existent.   So.. the usual struggles are even harder.   That is why I have sought out places like this online, but real face to face interaction would be so much better.    I never thought I would come to this point of not having a single person in my life.    Wondering how others are coping with this?"
556,and don't know what to do with myself
557,I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm so stressed and it's all just crushing me.
558,"Any advice on how to cope with loneliness, ESPECIALLY during quarantine? I've lost my friends do to my BPD and for almost two months it's been really difficult not having any relationships to help me cope. Don't really know how to put myself out there and find new people."
559,"Hello everyone.

I've hit the lowest I've ever been, and really struggling to get by anymore. My mental health has been really degrading the last few years and has reached a breaking point to the people close to me. I'm not close to my family at all, and found family in high school with a close group of friends that we were all emotionally intimate with. 10 years later everyone has grown and changed, but I've just been a parasite latching on to their lives. Depression and suicidal ideation has been on my mind for most of my life, but I've been able to cope with the support of those friends. The last 4 years I finally started getting professional help: trying several medications for depression, anxiety, adhd, seeing therapist, but would just not make progress. 

But my closest friends would tell me that I'm not trying hard enough, that there's always more I could be doing. I would take that advice to heart, become most of my friend group took mental health very seriously, a couple have gone to school for it. But it also felt demoralizing... ""Why is none of this working?"", ""Is it just how poor mental health services are in my area?"", ""Am I just a monster, I never feel like I can function as a person, so thats why this isn't working"". Possibly both of these options. Well this kept taking a toll, I'd lash out emotionally in our chat groups, and this would scare my friends, causing them to distance themselves more and more.

 I've recently talked to a psychiatrist, and they diagnosed me with BPD. This brought so much clarity, to learn about personality disorders, and just how SPOT ON every little detail that was synonymous to myself. It brought some hope to me. But then I got laid off from my job, only job I ever got that ""barely"" gave me any kind of financial stability. So then I lost my health insurance. I'm having trouble finding any other work. I get more depressed, looking for relief to interact with my friends, who would avoid me and hangout without telling me. I lost it, lashed out again about how I upset I was. I was considered irrational, and my two CLOSEST friends and roommates had enough of me. Felt so uncomfortable to be around me they'd rarely try to be home, so I decided to move out so they could be happier with out me. Moved back to my parents. A place that im fortunate to have this shelter instead of being out in the streets, but they're people I can't interact with at all, especially with my mother who was so incredibly abusive in my childhood.

 I've lost everyone I love, no more laughing with them, talking to each other, no more holiday gatherings, no more hugs and comfort. I'm trying to keep going, I promised my friends that I'll try to get better...but even if I found the right resources, it will still take a long time. I'm currently using my unemployment to pay for mood stabilizers (i don't think they're effective atm), and scheduled DBT therapy, though it will still be a month to even get stared. I'm trying to find ways to get by, walking in parks, indulging in entertainment, anything to distract me when I feel down. But its just so hard.... 

I keep thinking about my friends telling me ""I'm not doing enough!"". I don't know what more I can do? I've even called suicide hotlines a couple times when I would feel at a breaking point to kill myself, and scarring my self, and they just don't know what to say to me about my situation except ""I'm so sorry..."" and to go to the hospital if I become an imminent threat to my life. But even if going to the hospital saves my life for a weekend, I'm just going to go back to where I was except with a massive bill. Coming on this forum has been the next step I could think of for help, at least finding other people with BPD, instead of finding advice for people on how to deal with people with BPD. 

So just to make all this rambling brief, please, what more should I be doing?

Also sorry for the looong post, I'm terrible at summarizing."
560,"I am struggling with imagining that everyone has abandoned me if people do not reply to messages and texts right away and I struggle with giving myself time time to reply back because I don't want others to feel that I am abandoning them.

Anyone else ever struggle with this?

I know that frantic efforts to avoid abandonment are a bpd issue and wondering if testing my fears out will help?

Like I am going to try and not reply for a day or two and realize nothing bad will happen and then I might not feel so anxious.

I am wondering if this would work or if it's a deeper issue that will require inner child work and other more intense types of therapy."
561,"I need help. I don't feel like go to theraphy helps. Lately my mood is going crazy. It's up and down, up and down. I feel like I can't take it anymore. I feel so much pain and in the next second I found resons to be happy than again so much pain.
I am afraid all the time. I have a bf, he doesn't understand anything even I explain and translate myself everytime. I feel so so so alone."
562,"Hi, I am breaking up with my BF. I feel absolutely stupid that I feel so so so so bad. I know break ups aré hard for everybody, he looks sad but I am on the ves crying non stop, my eyes are hyper swollen, I can barely move. This is so hard. I live with him but I am moving asap. I am getting a new apartment and feel like I will rot in lonliness cause above all there's lockdown. I can not imagine myself alone day after day.

We aré breaking up because we fight a lot and we've has lots of problema cause he has been unemployed and money is tight (i dont want do diagnose him but he is probs narcisistic and very disfuncional). 

I don't know how to stop crying or have hope."
563,"When I see what medical professionals are saying (not just here but real life also) about mental health, medication, about the help available, how caring the NHS are, etc I just feel completely deflated and isolated. I know I have problems with my head and it feels like its misfiring but I'm not an idiot or without understanding or knowledge. I should have understanding of mental health issues as I've been dealing with them for 34 years now. 
I just don't see where the help is. I've been on a perpetual merry-go-round of treatments, therapy, counselling, support groups, medication, mental health teams, cpn's, key workers, etc and yet here I am 51, more confused and messed up in the head than ever. It's last chance saloon time for me now and great change is needed and that change has to come from me alone... 
No more meds, no more ""help"", just me.."
564,Has anyone else talked to their therapist/dr about new thoughts in the mental health field about BPD?    My therapist is talking about BPD and complex PTSD.     I am reading up on complex PTSD which I had never heard of and it's interesting.    Curious if anyone else has thoughts on it.
565,"And by last, I mean longer than maybe an hour or few. I figure that isn’t healthy in and of itself, but it’s so difficult to stay in that happy-sort-of-mode. I wish I knew how to make it stay for a little while longer without feeling drained or eh so quickly."
566,"I realised that it is really important to have healthy coping mechanisms to deal with a crisis, those moments when the strong borderline feelings come up, and it all hits you.

You know those moments when you just feel completely over whelmed by your emotion and you suddenly can't act. It is so debilitating.

Please share your strategies that you have learnt.

Some examples might be: drinking herbal teas, breathing exercises. If you suggest breathing exercises please post a link!"
567,"I recently was diagnosed with BPD and had suspicions for a while now that I was the reason for past relationships not working. I thought it was having epilepsy as a teenager and growing up in a hoarder house were the causes of my behavior to others. Near the end of college, was when I started even talking to guys in a romantic way and have always had less than a handful of friends at a time.

A lot of my dating experiences have started to become a pattern of falling for the guy right away and they seem to feel the same in the beginning. Most were red flags and extroverts that were great winning over any woman. Then I obsess after a few weeks about what we are and feel like they have to text constantly to feel reassured. I fantasize about our futures together, which puts too much pressure on the guy that I am idealizing. Eventually, they do something to minorly make me mad or I just want more reassurance and it kicks them off a pedestal I've made in my mind that they can't be the ""one"" anymore . The feeling is only temporary, but in that short of time period I make rash decisions to unfriend/block them or tell them I can't see them anymore or just pick fights in general.

I've only had one significant other stay through this pattern for a year, but they ended up trying to make our relationship poly without my consent. They didn't physically cheat on me and I agreed to try things with another person in the beginning then didn't want anything to do with the other woman after that because I was confused by the dynamic and did not want to share my partner. Because I was afraid to loose my significant other, I stayed with him even if he was emotionally cheating on me with other women. I started to become an abusive partner because I felt not in control of the situation and constantly paranoid of being cheated on...even if he did by talking to other women all the time then saying they were for us both. He eventually wanted us to still live together as friends while we both work on ourselves. This caused multiple meltdowns and led to me finally finding my own place.


Since then, I have been on dating sites constantly just to have guys to continuously talk to and not feel alone. I was with my partner before that almost 24/7 and missed having a person to go to. Half of the guys I have been on dates with have been only into something casual and the other ones I showed my pattern to fast of fixating or sabotaging the almost relationship with the really kind guys.

I also have hobbies and am trying to rebuild relationships with family and friends that I ignored during my last long term relationship. Several therapists in a short period of time have also helped a little. So, I'm trying to have a life again and not fixate on guys once I do start talking to them again. I just don't know how to let a guy in without oversharing early on just to feel a connection or let my bad mood from whatever is happening in my day be pushed onto them. I don't really want to get to close to guys and have this pattern happen again, but to lonely not to stop online dating all together.

How have others broken similar habits? How do you even explain to potential partner that you have BPD without scaring them off?"
568,"Title probably sounds a bit melodramatic but hey :rolleyes:

I'm just wondering if anyone has kinda been through recovery, fixed bad habits, been through therapy and group, etc etc. I've gotten to a point in my life from my teen years to now (early 20's) where I have been through CBT, DBT, I've been on meds and found one that seems to be alright, I've stopped self-harming, I have given up on suicide and have much less frequent suicidal thoughts, I don't drink anymore, and honestly am the most stable I've been in my life. I've gone from being suicidal every single day, constantly in pain from severe self harm, and multiple suicide attempts each year to being in a stable and loving relationship, renting on my own, I quit my job to focus on myself for a while and am looking for full time work again, and even dug up and worked through past trauma on my own which I think I am doing well with.

However, in all honesty I still have the sensitivity. If something goes wrong or feels like it's gone wrong I feel hurt inside and struggle to cope despite constant skills practice and I get quite bad anxiety until the situation is resolved. I still have days where I am way too sensitive and sometimes suicide does pop into my mind but I am able to shut it down. It still bothers me that I am considered recovered and do not meet the diagnostic criteria for BPD anymore since I was discharged but I still feel like I suffer from it and I am beginning to wonder if this is just what life will be like for me now, if this is as good as it gets.

Does anyone else ever have this feeling? If so, how do you process these feelings? I have tried to use radical acceptance but I feel a bit ripped off to be honest since a lot of people seem to think full recovery is possible, and I am considered recovered, I think I am a lot better than I was and I'm functional but still have these struggles. Many thanks"
569,"I have struggled for 30 years at least with issues that were called depression and anxiety, medication resistant depression and anxiety, then on to bipolar 2 with med resistant depression and anxiety, and now on to BPD.   It has evolved and I do believe that the more I learn about BPD that I am sure that is what is going on.   I've found a therapist and meds doc that I am optimistic about.    The biggest struggle I am having at the moment is trying to get my head around the talk therapy/dbt stuff.   I have such a negative view of a lot of it because it never worked in the past.   I like to think that I am still trying is a good thing, it is just so frustrating that I seem to be ""stuck"".  I have myself so convinced of certain things that some of the talk just in one ear and out the other.   I want to change... have a better life... actually live my life.   I haven't read through a lot of things here yet.  Just wondering if anyone can relate to my therapy struggle and maybe give some advice what to do..  My therapist wants me to make a list of things i want to work on and prioritize them.....   I was like... they are all important/bad.    So yeah..   that's where I'm at.      Thanks in advance for any feedback."
570,"Has anyone tried any complimentary therapies for BPD / anxiety? What did you try? Did it help? How much did it cost? 

I am receiving help from CHMT at the moment but I don't find them very helpful. I have tried medication (from benzos to SSRIs to antipsychotics), it does take away my anxiety but it makes me very impulsive & aggressive/ worsens PD symptoms."
571,i don't offer much advise just support i feel inadequate for not helping more but im tired
572,"Alright, so I did find the list of criteria via Google and here are my notes.
5 of 9? I have 3+?3? or ?4? of 9 (* for those I feel most strongly could apply), *? for those maybe possible, but probably not)

*1Fear of Abandonment-I want to first state that I only truly feel this with my ""favorite people"" or those I depend on. I do not feel this with everyone I know. I can get terrified, but it's not chronic/all the time or for every little thing. Just when things pile up and/or are very big.

*?2Unstable Relationships-I do have a tendency to fall in love very quickly, but again, the real problem lies with those ""favorite people"" or people who are in a position of power/take care of me. I generally don't believe ANYONE can make me feel whole. I use fantasies of people to help me...

?3Unclear or shifting self-image.-I don't believe so? or maybe?

*4Impulsive/Self Destructive behaviors-harmful, sensation feeling behaviors-yes, absolutely! Binge eating, although it's not too too much, but eating for taste over health. And also just like doing too much of something. Too much of anything is never healthy. In the moment, I just feel like I don't care how it could be harming me. I realize it could be and want to do it more.

*5Self harm-i say yes, but it's ONLY thoughts or gestures. I did SH at one point in my young adult life, but now I have many reasons why I don't want to do it (it really hurts-didn't produce the euphoria for me/i do it wrong, and I don't want to dirty up any of my items nor do I really want to use dirty items/infect myself/hurt myself too badly)
So, is it really SH?? idk

?*6Extreme Emotional Swings-based on the title, I'd want to say yes, However, I don't regularly shift so dramatically within minutes or hours. It's usually over a couple of days, sometimes overnight, and sometimes twice a day. So, BPD swings or Bipolar rapid cycling?? I also have observed a more primary mood (either ""manic"" or ""depressed"") with symptoms of the other mood, so more akin to bipolar mixed or dysphoric mania.

7Chronic feelings of emptiness. -I don't really relate to this

*?8Explosive anger.-I get angry and I get a lot of anger directed inwardly as I do outwardly, but it's again, not chronic. It's usually during my menses (and not EVERY time, but it is typical) or in high stressed times...or during that dysphoric episode, but I still control it well enough, for the most part. I used to throw things/break things or scream my head off, because my Dad did that stuff. But when another told me I didn't have to do that, I eventually was able to stop...and I feel better about myself that I can control these things...generally. 

9Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality. - Don't really relate to this one. A couple of times, during an episode there's some suspicions, but it's justified.



So, for those of you with this, do you think it's a high possibility or are my symptoms not really strong enough-in your opinion, of course. I ask because it's really difficult right now for me to find help, but if it sounds very serious, I might try again."
573,"I’m so terrified of dying and what comes next, but at the same time I crave the sweet relaxation that comes with death. The peace. I need it. But what comes after that I just want to be left alone laying down feeling nothing and just resting"
574,"oh im in a grump
i just feel low and not wanted
i think every 30 seconds that my boyfriend will leave me

the only one i know wants me for sure is my aunt

blah grumpy Lu x"
575,"i don't think anything would make me happy
ungrateful idiot i am"
576,"To preface: I have been diagnosed with PTSD in the past due to s*xual abuse from one person and emotional abuse from my mother who had BPD. 

I just ask this because I feel like my mood isn’t consistent in the way that it should be. I might feel miserable at some point and then listen to classical music and feel euphoric by it, way too happy. Euphoria to me feels like an adrenaline rush. And then when I get tired of dancing around or daydreaming, wind down and feel sad or whatever I’ve going to feel again. Work isn’t particularly fun because I feel like I need to be the best and do the best I can so that they value me as a worker, and if I feel the slightest bit of resentment or get any sort of complaint, I’ll berate myself and tell myself I need to do better and start to detach instead. Alternatively, if someone compliments me, I feel much better and then a lot happier. I tell myself that even if I’m tired “you can’t afford to slow down, you need to keep going”. I don’t feel like I have any solid grip on my identity, or at least in how I present myself, because there are several aesthetics/ways of presenting myself I want to have.

When I’m in a relationship, I usually alter slightly to complement and suit the person. I’m terrified of true commitment and getting too close to anyone, because that’s vulnerability and “trapping”, etc. 

I struggle and alternate between a few personalities or moods, which can best be described as 1) “may an older man love me (but purely). I grew up too fast and want to be protected, I want to be a child again“, 2) “cynical, feeling slightly out of place, or jaded, old. Dressing in black and knowing that I’m probably intimidating, feeling unattractive and/or like a freak“, 3) “whimsical, happy, almost euphoric, feeling like a child“, 4) “collected, philosophical, wanting to learn lots of things and feeling inspired, wanting to become talented and learn many skills“, 5) “boyish, mischievous, dramatic, trying to get a laugh from others“, 6) “simply wanting to go back to the psych ward“, 7) dressing in way that is a little out there and “not caring about what other people think”, but also please notice me. Don’t harass me, but maybe compliment me”, 8) “wanting to run away, start again, reset my appearance and how I present myself“

I can be happy and feeling good throughout some points in the day, but usually I ended up in bed at some point crying. Etc. I get bored and tired with myself a lot of the time and it sucks having to deal with myself. I have pretty bad vision, but I appreciate it somewhat because it makes things feel “less there” and more like a blur”, and then that makes it easier to skip into my thoughts and daydream. I used to imagine my favorite person with me and chatting when I’d be roughing it, which was pretty helpful. We broke up and I thought I’d be able to move on and forget him, but I wasn’t even able to do that with the last.

In terms of anger, I can be very passive-aggressive. Not harsh enough to where the person might want to attack me back, but discreetly cold and distant enough to help them realize that perhaps I’m a little pissed. Or if I feel I truly can’t express myself without repercussion, smile and laugh although my voice shows that I’m angry."
577,how to deal with the insurmountable feeling that your parents dont love you....
578,"I have BPD, I dont know how long I've heard them I think they've always kind of been there, I dossociate a lot. 
Lately I hear them all the time, they are all in my head I dont hear them out of my head but sometimes when im stressed I think I can hear noises that I dont think are real, like a car door shut outside the house and I always think its someone coming for me, or just coming to see me and it stresses me out even though i dont have any friends as I've been extremly withdrawn from my social life lately. Sometimes I think I hear people talk about me when they probably aren't. But these voices I've been hearing lately are all in my head, there's a constant narration on what I'm doing, sometimes I reply to remarks they make whilst I'm doing something, we have conversations. As of 2 weeks ago though they've just been very nasty, constantly telling me to kill myself, I'm this, I'm that, theyve also started to tell me they have their own names. I know this is in my head but I have been wondering how real they are, maybe they are parts of me, I dont know. I spoke with my doctor today but was still too scared to tell her, I can't listen to the abuse much longer and when there loud I feel sick and get a sore head. 
My personal hygiene has dropped im rarely washing, wearing dirty clothes. I'm still working 7 days but I fear im gonna end up loosing my job due to being late coming in dissociated and not looking presentable. Some of the voices even tell me just to quick anyway and I agree it would be better but I need my job and my income. 
What is happening to me, i have never felt like I was loosing my sanity before but right now I feel like im going insane"
579,"please don't reply by telling me i don't because i would have done it by now

i can't cope anymore with my puppy
i don't think she likes me

whenever hermit goes out or is upstairs she barks and barks
im worried sick the neighbours will complain and she will be taken away from me

i have dog trainers coming out in december but i read reviews of them online and apparantly they are not very good

so everytime hermit has to go somewhere she will bark ,it might not sound like much but its making me ill

im worried sick
i can't stop crying and i know im pathetic but i don't want to be here anymore

its just one bad thing after another"
580,"Hi!

I'm thinking of getting the book Understanding the Borderline Mother.  I am looking for understanding and empowerment to end my relationship with my mother.  She is not as severe as some other cases but is ruining my life, marriage, and I want her away from my kids.  Do others have experience with this book? Does it encourage ending or staying in relationships with BPD mothers?  I don't want to pretend that this relationship can go on and am hoping for help in leaving...
Thanks so much!"
581,"It wasn't really a funeral it was just a viewing. We could only have 30 people there so it was small. He didn't look like himself, he had clearly been in autopsy too long, he looked like he gained 30lbs since the 3rd and his hands looked like they were made of wax, he looked tired.  

I spoke at his second one, I held both of my grandmothers. 

Is this really my life now? The house is so quiet, he was the loudest most social one he was the family peacekeeper -how does life keep going on? It feels like the days are too long, making it feel like there's more time to miss him in the day.

I walk into a room and forget immediately what I was doing, I  cry every night and for hours in the morning. There's this chest ache that doesn't ever go away. 

People keep saying it'll get better but I don't  want it to stop hurting that he's  gone, I don't  want it to be normal that he isn't  here. 

I know we've had a rocky relationship but he was my big brother and he took care of us when my mom left and my dad couldn't get out of bed. He was the adventurer  who pushed us out of our hermit shells. He's  the one who puts up with our dad when he's being difficult, never leaves anyone behind."
582,"When I was younger I was very selfish, self-centred and showed little care for others or the world I lived in. Strangely, I had lots of friends, was well known and popular and people seemed drawn to me.
Now I am older I have so much empathy for others, treat the world and people around me with respect and at times feel like my heart is bursting with love and compassion for all beings. Now I have no friends, am virtually invisible and no one seems to want anything to do with me. 
Life is strange!"
583,does anyone else ever suddenly hate someone forever after being embarrassed by another person?
584,so i'm gonna launch right into the story. I just met someone who makes me feel butterflies i have not felt in years. I have not felt this way since my first love. it's been about 3 years since ive felt this way. i'm still in contact with my first love but anyway right now i've found myself to be completely and utterly OBSESSED with this new guy. it's only been a few days and i've been having the worst anxiety. He is in a polyamorous relationship with another partner (not hierarchical. i have been poly in the past however those were with people i wasn't this attached to. i have a tendency to flip flop between wanting poly or monogamy. anyway my main concern right now is feeling jealous of his current partner even though i know he and i have a unique connection. ive been completely obsessive since we went our separate ways the night following our date. i feel completely restless and anxious when im not talking to him and constantly have the urge to text him. it's only been a few days and i feel like it would be a bit much to talk to him about all of this as it might be overwhelming and i would probably seem insane. i don't know if this entirely makes sense but i feel so completely anxious. it's like i need his attention. this is clearly all bpd related but i wish it would just go away.
585,I had an episode of slipping not long ago and that lasted quite a while. Ive tried to get my self out of it by training doesn't always work but I enjoy training. At the moment I feel happy and on a high so to speak but this is never long lived especially because its the time of the month soon for me. prob the reason I feel so happy but could also cry if I see something emotional. I hate feeling so happy and high as I then wait for the low and it always feels so much more worse going from a high instead of a neutral feeling. Also leaves me thinking well something going to happen always does when im happy then the feeling of dread and anxiety steps in. ffs why cant I just be so called normal

587,I cant cope with this level of constant anxiety Nd hypervigelence .bpd is so stigmatized .I really wish od stuck with bipolar type 2 and never fought for this diagnosis .at least I was prescribed klopin which helped .yes its addictive but I was o  a low dose.alcohols addictive but they sell that and profit off it on the shop shelves 🤯😟😤
588,"I have been browsing recently and have noticed that some users on the forum has a tendency to use some stock phrases in response to distress shown by others. I am intrigued as to whether this is intentional or whether there is an underlying, unconscious thing people do when faced with upset of others. 

The common one I tend to spot is ""I am sorry you feel that way/have been treated that way etc"" but there are certainly others. 

I tend to find these phrases mildly invalidating though I suspect they are used with the best intentions in the world. I notice that this type of response is often not caveated with an insight into how the person may feel or what they can do about the situation.

Has anyone else noticed this tendency? These terms are not good or bad, they are just what they are. But sometimes I feel over-used to the point of being meaningless."

592,"Hi, I have BPD, anxiety, depression and a load of other fun fun fun things going on. I have always refused medication and tried to ""naturally rewire my brain"" to be well and see therapists and read books etc. But I'm starting to get very very tired of this constant trying. I wondered if there is a medication that has been found to be helpful with BPD? My main concern is overwhelming emotions, they cripple me daily and are such hard work to try and stabilise. Any advice? I am in the UK. Thank you."
593,"Does anyone feel like their EUPD/BPD 'recovery' is purely about other people? Ie. I've managed to stop most behaviour that challenges other people via a mixture of self control AND avoiding triggers. 

But I don't feel better, in fact my mental state is worse. My distress/ anxiety is so bad that I can hardly think/ function. 

This makes me feel incredibly resentful towards MH nurses. For years I was told that I was just 'behavioural' and that it was all a choice. I feel like they promised me health but it was all just a lie."
594,"Hi everyone, I have BPD, anxiety, depression and a few other things going on. I find it very hard keeping it together socially day to day, and afterwards I am exhausted. When I saw a therapist last year they were impressed at how, given what I carry around with me mentally, I was able to force myself to go to work part-time (3 days a week) as they said most people in my position wouldn't be able to cope in a job. I am proud of myself for making myself work but at the same time I am ashamed that I cannot cope with full-time.

When people ask me what hours I work or what my job is etc I am looked at like a lazy part-timer who doesn't bother going to work full-time like other people. You might say I'm just assuming they think that of me, but I have had people respond with things like ""oh, so you ONLY work 3 days a week?"" and ""That must be nice having 4 day weekends whilst the rest of us have 2 days......"".

Yesterday I had another one of these comments said to me, by my fiancé's aunt. She doesn't know my mental health situation as I try to hide it from everyone except my fiancé and parents, but she is also the sort where if she did know about my mental health she would not be sensitive about it.
Anyway, her sarcastic comment and almost eye rolling made me feel very attacked, and this morning I have woken up feeling one hundred times worse with my stomach flipping and in knots and short of breath and angry and upset and panicky all at the same time. Which then makes me want to not exist or leave my fiancé so that I don't have to see her ever again. I cannot shake off the negative emotions when something like this affects me and I function even worse than normal.

I know I shouldn't care what people think, and I try to coach myself to not care and let the emotions go, but I can't help it, the feelings stay. I can't stand the injustice of her thinking I'm lazy for working part-time when actually it is near on a miracle that I manage to do that.

Does anyone else experience these overwhelming feelings? How do you stop them taking over?"
595,"I've been diagnosed with depression and nothing else but I can relate to feelings of emptiness. I feel nothing, like I'm hollow. I often feel like I don't know who I am,  I seem to change my personality depending on who I'm with as I want them to like me and I want to fit it. It's left me questioning who I actually am, what are my likes and dislikes? How can I describe myself when I don';t know who I am? I feel everyone hates me and I need to do everything I can to be liked. I do everything wrong all the time, say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing. I've been accused of being 'too touchy' or 'sensitive'. I get obsessed with people who I want to be in a relationship with and my whole sense of self worth is based on if they like me or not, if they talk to another woman I get so jealous and act stupid to keep their attention. I know my behaviour has been described as 'hysterical' in the past when a relationship has been ended. I self harm as a response to any kind of criticism or strong negative feeling and have done so since the age of 15. I can't express my anger outwardly and keep in inward and act out feelings of anger on myself. When I feel empty I SH just to feel something. I know there's something not right but a lot of the time I can keep it inside so no one would ever know. They know I have depression as a lot of the time I have nothing to say and remain silent or slow and not really 'with it'. I don't know if there's anything else wrong with me but I know I don't want to be here and have attempted to end my life a few times without anyone knowing. Please everyone look after yourselves and thank you for this site to be able to vent and speak to others. Hugs to all x"

597,"I am writing because I believe that this town has done a disservice to many of its most vulnerable citizens, many of whom don’t speak for themselves. The substance abuse crisis in this town is an epidemic, people are dying  in the streets, and something needs to be done.

The health care system has failed those suffering mental illness and addiction time and time again. Oct 04 2020 a young man died on a public bench from an overdose less than a week after being released from the {HOSPTAL}  for the third time since mid August. Each of his hospitalizations became briefer and briefer, I believe, because the staff passed him off as just an addict. He suffered from mental illness and the healthcare professionals at {HOSPTAL} determined that his addiction was not their responsibility and they offered no support after his release.  

This community's approach to the drug crisis and mental health is insufficient, the support to those suffering is lacking. It is unacceptable that someone can reach out for help and be denied because of a lack of resources or general support from our health care professionals. Especially unacceptable for someone to  lose their life less than a week after health care professionals determine them fit to be released, with access to no additional resources.  I see nothing but more loss if something isn’t done to address this problem."

600,"Some things can make me go from feeling good, 1 to feeling angry 10, so 1 to 10 scale in less than a minute. 

Example I was putting a call through to someone at work and said it's Adrian for you from this particular company and he replied do you mean Mike, I replied no he said his name was Adrian. 

He said are you sure, I said yes he said Adrian.   He said maybe he said Adam, I said no he definitely said Adrian he's on the line now waiting to be put through.(I can feel annoyance rising in me quickly and its showing in my voice) He started talking to someone in the background I couldn't hear what he was saying but he came back and said are you sure?   I said yes it's Adrian, Adrian! 

I couldn't help the annoyance in my voice by this time, so he huffed and puffed and took the call.  He came off the phone and said you were right his name was Adrian. 

I wanted to say I know that's what I said I am not an idiot!  But I just said hmmmm ok. It annoys me that I get so angry over something like this, i was ranting at my colleague about the phone call aswell and then I am annoyed at myself for getting so wound up about it and showing it.  I just can't keep calm sometimes.

And i also wonder if people try to get me wound up on purpose to show what a bad person I am or for their entertainment.  Which is cruel"

602,"I replied someone the post that I am going to paste below this. I thought I should make a new thread to share what's going on these days.

Every single day is a roller coaster. Currently, I am taking Quetiapine (Seroquel) 100mg at night, Mirtazpine (Remeron) 45mg at night and Clonazepam 0.25mg when needed.
But most of the time I avoid taking Clonazepam because I feel bad for taking so many medicines, I feel a sense of dependence.

Recently, I am not getting a night of good sleep. My doctor gave me a medicine to sleep. I tried taking that medicine but it gives metallic and bitter taste in the mouth throughout the day. So, I stopped taking that one and next week maybe he will give me another one to sleep.

I am not exactly suicidal but I have thoughts of suicide. Like how everyone around me would react if I am no more. These days I hurt myself a lot, I get angry and I start smashing things or harm myself. It is way out for me from my sadness and loneliness.

With this therapist, I guess it's been a year now. I am improving but the problem with BPD is it takes a hell lot of time to see improvements.

Last month, my therapist and I started working on this book called ""The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook"" by Matthew McKay, Jeffrey Brantley and Jeffrey C. Wood.

I am learning new coping strategies, how to control emotions and how to deal with anger, what alternatives I can use without getting seriously injured or hurt. (Like holding ice cubes)
Apart from DBT, I don't know what techniques my therapist has used till now.

If you are in Canada you can use an app called MY SSP.
This app is available 24/7, you can chat or call with counsellors whenever you are feeling low.

Hope you have a good weekend and a night of good sleep."

Yep think im slipping, I see the signs, im reserved, quite, irritable but like numerous times before im not sure why. May be im a little stressed I have a lot of responsibilities but I always have done and may be im slightly irritated certain people don't consistently pull their weight. I feel people rely on me with out question or thought but I can only rely on some  rarely. This is where I remind myself its always been this way and to pull myself up and get the hell on with it  and have a me day tomorrow as its my day off. Other wise I will constantly be thinking why am I feeling like this when sometimes there isn't a reason, which is hard to explain to others when they notice a change in you x"
609,"Hi, I have BPD, depression, anxiety and some other stuff going on.
Up until a couple of years ago I didn't like being alone. I always had to ring a friend or find a family member in the house etc if I was ever alone. However now it has changed and my favourite times are when I am alone. I love sitting on my own, especially when the house is empty. It's my favourite time, and I know enjoying it this much is not very healthy. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on whether this behaviour is BPD-related or depression-related or something else related? Thanks guys 😊"
610,"Been reducing clonazepam from 1 and a half dose to 3/4 dose over 3 months.

Calls to crisis every other day some 2 or 3 times per day.

Heart feels broken
Crying
Angry
Suicidal Ideation daily
Mind races the instant I wake, what's wrong with me what's wrong with me I can't I can't etc etc etc
Chest and throat pains constant from anxiety
Chest pain feels l likes stabbing me continually
I can only receive negative and cannot receive positive.  

Insights regarding approval seeking
Not feeling heard and feeling deeply worthless so why live?

Doctor does not seem to take this seriously
Psychiatrist dismissed me... She is not expert enough to help me with BPD
No meds other than weaning off Clonazepam cause BPD not treated with meds
Suicidal thoughts increasing traumatization daily
Crisis line not disturbed but helped me to the next step.

Consider treatment centre for withdrawal from clonazepam?
Consider expensive residential treatment centre for mentally health?
CBD oil?

I don't know how I don't give up.

I need some advice. I've been so up and down recently and today it's just made me stop, think and reevaluate my life. 
I've realised I need to be okay with my own company, with my own mind. But how do I do this? I've spent the last 4 years being with someone almost every day and I've realised my biggest problem is I just don't know how to be alone. And how to be okay with being alone.

I thought awww that's sweet (hes 10) but now im like wow how do I feel about this what if we go wrong and my kids will be so effected. I am thinking all this while feeling numb like what the hell is going on with me. Ive always been worried if id get hurt and now im like oh my kids feel that strong about her.

616,"Hi. I am new here and would like to share an issue that I am currently struggling with to see if I am not alone in this predicament. I realize it's highly unlikely but it's worth a shot. And before I get started I am not here to be belittled, berated or talked down to like I'm a child. I am a 39 year old college educated medical professional and have been diagnosed with ""quiet"" bpd since 2010. So with that said....

I am in a very serious relationship with a man that I love. We are engaged to be married (no date yet as we both are in no hurry since we are both divorces). He and I have always been a bit on the wild side when it comes to our sexuality. There are things about our lives that no one else knows.

Here's the thing. I am trying to come to terms with sharing him sexually. He would like for us to become swingers (which initially sounded great since I have always been fascinated with the lifestyle. However, he has become truly the most important person in my life. I've never had this kind of love with anyone else. He's my world. So now we're talking about really going forward with this idea but I am struggling with some SERIOUS jealousy with just the thought. I've researched the entire lifestyle along with the many pros and cons until I am blue in the face. I have done the mental exercises to see what my gut reaction would be and I can say with all confidence that I feel extremely possessive of him...to the point of aggressiveness.

He knows about my diagnosis and daily struggles with insecurities but seems to take my word on anything even if it should be throwing red flags for him right and left. I just don't know how to get past this extreme jealously.

Anyone else been in a similar situation and if so what was the outcome?

Thank you."
617,"I wish I found a guy or an older man or even a woman that would want to be and live with me and would understand my issues and would give me proper support. Bpd is a developmental trauma and I know I lack the experience of having a 100% safe figure in my life who would help me get through my triggers and help me regulate my emotions. I feel like that is impossible though and everyone says so as well (especially therapists) and everyone wants to help me be more independent, when I don't want nothing more than a person who I could be clingy with and who I would depend on. I believe that is the missing experience for people with bpd in general and is actually ""the cure"" for it. Every child finds their autonomy in the safety of depending on a parent and I believe bpd people are stuck in that phase because we never got the proper consistent secure support, mirroring and validation. But I start doubting myself when I am met with so much opposition from people and especially ""professionals"". And I doubt people who could and would want to care for a bpd person like that even exist. And especially not for me because I also believe I am unattractive and ugly (bdd is actually my dominant issue right now). So whatever. I guess I'm just a toxic person trying to justify my dysfunctional and destructive lifestyle. Or maybe I'm right. But it doesn't matter if no one agrees with me."
618,So I have been having psychotherapy through the NHS and the therapist that I see allocated an amount of sessions at the start. Luckily he allowed me to have more and said that he can keep doing them and that he isn't putting an end on it. So it's been about a year and I am grateful but recently I have been feeling so cut off from my past it's like there is something missing. I am finding it really hard and he knows this. Yesterday in my appointment he said that he wanted to say something and then said that he is thinking about therapy coming to an end. He said it could take a couple of months but I was so upset because I know that I have so much stuff to go through and I really can't see me getting it all out and sorted. I feel completely betrayed and also stupid for trusting him and trying to be vulnerable. I need help to work through my past but now it's coming to an end there is a huge sense of impending doom and I feel like the last chance saloon is coming and I'm going to miss it.
619,"I got a puppy about 2 months ago. He has bad separation anxiety and has attached to me. 

For me and my mental health it's great and hes happy hanging out on my lap. 

I had a bad breakdown the other day. I went in the bedroom and was laying on the bed just crying. My dog came sprinting and flew up on the bed and smushed his nose under my chin and started licking me. Once i put my arm around him he just scooted real close and kept licking my cheek. 

It helped alot. My wife and son came in too and were hugging me.

I told my wife i wanted to get him registered as a service animal and she says thats stupid and he can't go everywhere with me. 

But if it calms me why is it such a bad thing? Hes asleep at my feet. Lol on the couch, he doesn't lay on the floor. He isn't an animal.... Lol"
620,I cannot talk to people. All I can do is ask them about themselves and support them if they struggle. I have no personality or nothing to contribute to a conversation. This is why I am unable to have friends. How can you have a friend who does not chat? Who knows what my partner sees in me. I may be a 'nice' person but I am utterly useless. I have had tons of therapy but nothing can make a person learn how to converse.
621,"so its been a while since I've posted here.  I've been trying to find my way with therapy and anti-depressants - with very little success.

Yesterday I microdosed psilocybin (magic mushrooms) - 0.1g.  Today I feel normal.  The same sort of normal I experience the day after heavy drinking - when the nervous system is depressed.

I'm trying not to get too excited about the results.

Does anyone else have any experience of microdosin either mushrooms or LSD to treat borderline personality disorder?"
622,"Hi, I'm new to this forum!

I really need some advice!

My mum, while not being diagnosed, almost certainly has BPD (My therapist even suggested it when talking about her to them). Obviously this caused a lot of issues throughout my life. I love her dearly, but there are issues in my relationship with her. One of those issues is struggling to be honest with her, because when I am I receive a LOT of backlash and it makes her really unstable and aggressive. 

I had an abortion a year ago and not dealt with it well. I never told my mother despite really wanting to at the time. I feel unable to tell her now because a big part of me is concerned she will take me not telling her initially as a ""I don't trust you with that information"" and then think she's a terrible mother and she'll have another breakdown. I'm worried she may stop talking to me or suddenly hate my boyfriend (Who is lovely and was very supportive through the ordeal but she may not see that). She already has issues with my sister's boyfriend (Without any justifiable reason) and I don't want the same with mine.

I found out today through my sister that my mother has had past abortions and it really makes me want to open up to her about it, but again, I am terribly concerned she'll have a bad reaction. I really don't know what to do. 

Thanks

Nattymat <3"
623,"I honestly don't know how to word this and I want to focus only on the title, so it might come off as confusing and incomplete.

Whenever there's someone who's upset or going through a rough time, I'm just unable to help them. (I do feel bad for them internally and I REALLY feel bad if it's something similar to my level of abuse/neglect experience.) But like, I just act weird. I cannot really say anything in the situation apart from feeling awkward and terrible, this even happens when I'm not devaluing and with people I dearly love. I am concerned and worried about them, I just cannot express that to them, so I look pretty unemotional.

When it comes to love, (familial, friendships, partners) I struggle with the communication as well. I struggle with talking extendedly about most things, with replies such as ""You're welcome, if you need any more help again, you can just ask me. c:"" so I'm pretty distant in my conversations (even if I don't mean or want to be, me saying something like that just doesn't seem right so I just cannot talk as nice as they can). I also severely struggle with intimacy, so perhaps the severity or fear of getting close is a part of it as well, ironic.

My upbringing was extremely ambivalent and turbulent and I was never truly loved and wasn't allowed to speak to people as a child, so I have kind of grown up with that habit and I guess that's why I just cannot communicate well like this because I wasn't even given the chance, I don't know but I want to be healthier..."

He’s been great working through things with me and I’ve really pushed his limits at times.
There’s two problems though that keep just making me spiral. First is that, whilst I know he loves me, he never says it. He’s trying to be more outwardly affectionate but it’s not something that comes naturally to him whereas I am hyper-affectionate and very emotionally needy. Second issue is the distance. He stays with me for a week or so and then has to go home for a week and I completely crash the second he leaves. I just get overcome with emotion, I can’t handle him not being here, I question why he doesn’t crash too and decide he doesn’t love me. Basically get myself in such an emotional frenzy that I end up in bed for a couple of days and this happens every other week. I’m currently in this crash. But it gets me so frenzied, I want to break up with him. The relationship is great in every other way but I can’t live on this rollercoaster every fortnight. How do I stop being so unstable?"
629,"Hi all,

I was wondering are we allowed to discuss medications here in the forum ?"
630,"Hi

I've been feeling for weeks that I'm not meant for this world. I'm too sensitive, too weak to manage my 'normal' life, never mind all of the COVID crap.
I'm having relationship issues which are complex and make me feel like I don't count.
I work full time and since COVID hit I've been working from home which although I'm not a  fan of, I do appreciate the fact that I can do it. My actual job that I've done for over 6 years disappeared and I've been helping out other areas. My manager who I've worked with for about 3 hears is brilliant. She knows my situation, knows my condition and does her best to make sure I'm busy, makes sure I'm doing something so I feel like I'm contributing but is not so far out of my comfort zone that it would push me to going off sick. Basically, without her as my manager, I'd be screwed.
I have just found out that she has applied for another job. She hasn't told me directly and I  know there is a chance she won't get it but she is great at her job and I think she is in with a good chance. I'm completely freaking out.
If she gets it then I'll end up with a new manager who won't know me, won't know how best to manage me and who I'll have to start over with on telling them the personal stuff that they need to  know to help me stay in work.
I know I just have to wait this out and wait for her to tell me when she gets it. The fact that she has applied for it tells me she is generally looking for something else. That means even if she doesn't get this one, there are so many vacancies coming up that she'll just go for another.
I do know that she has turned out some extra roles because there are times when I need more of her time (mainly around reassurance) so I know I'm getting in her way. I feel awful, weak and pathetic and hard work.
I want to hurt myself, big time.
Maybe this is just the final sign to make my mind up once and for all, and give up for good.
I just want to scream  :panic: 

xx"
631,"Feel like blowing up. Been a rough day and I'm up to my neck in it. My husband got upset with me - said I mustn't go on like that. When I wanted to sit by him I knocked an empty (fortunately plastic!) bottle over and it clattered to floor and irritated my husband further. I wanted to throw the f***ing bottle across the room I was so mad!! But that would have upset my husband even more.

How hard it is to weather these stormy emotions! Like trying to stop a runaway train! Boiling in distress. I guess I need therapy..."
632,"I recently discovered my diagnosis for BPD, and I say that because I've had the diagnosis for awhile and I just thought to ask my therapist about my my official diagnoses. Aaaaaand she dropped this bombshell on me which, looking at it now, fits me like a glove. I had a year and a half long episode starting back in 2018, and Ive done things in my past that I'm ashamed of. Im 18 years old and just moved a long way away from home for a change of scenery and to focus on creative outlets. I feel my worldview has been tainted immensely, and I no longer see any point in contributing to the normal aspects of society, So I have taken the liberty of moving into a fully creative path. In acting and performance I have been more successful than I first thought (Who knows, I might be in a TV show or movie you've seen, but I won't disclose which one haha). Moving to a new town has prompted local college students to take a liking to me, all of which makes me uncomfortable. Im so scared of getting emotionally attached to someone and driving them off. I won't even meet most people's gaze, in fear a connection might form. I feel like my lack of understanding for others perspective combined with my absent fear of death causing crazy impulsions, I endanger myself as well as others. Forever in need of human attention, Forever without want of human interaction. Frustrated to put things simply. Was hoping a forum like this could make me feel more comfortable about this disorder that has been seemingly pulling the strings of my life for a very long time. Would love to hear similar or different perspectives or any advice at all so pls respond if you'd like!"

634,"Hello all and I hope all is well. 
I am looking for people's advice or suggestions with a particular situation I have been battling for some time now and I want to know how others deal with similar senarios. I am really going to simply things down so all who read this don't get a head ache and they are able to offer clear advice :) 

So basically, I have been very mental illness with BPD for several years now but a couple of years back, I developed a type of 'Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)' which has fucked my brain and body chemisty, and I am in constant chronic pain and becoming more and more disabled by the day. I have also had some tough conversations with the doctors, and we now know nothing can be done, and I will become more and more disabled and ill due to my neuro condition. 

Despite this, I want to live life to the max, even though I can't, but this thought process keeps racing round my mind and I want some reasureance on this please. 

Since I can't work and house-bound, what is my purpose? Justification? Reason to exist?
These questions and similar thought processes keep bouncing round my mind and I am finding it harder by the day to reasure myself what I am doing is good and positive for my wellbeing, despite becoming physically more disabled by the day, and having to manage my mental health along-side this extra battle. 
I find it very hard to justify to myself what I am doing (treatments, therapies, life and routine) is 'right' and my personal routine and management is enough. 

What advise, guidance and ideas could you offer which could help me look at my situation and experience of BPD and disablity differently?

Thank you in advance <3"
635,How to stop hurting yourself?
636,"i have my first psychiatrist appointment in a few days and i feel bad about going and actually want to cancel since there are so many people who have problems a lot worse than mine, but at the same time i'm really struggling. i also completely freaked out about something so incredibly minor tonight and managed to make myself feel suicidal over it and that makes me feel like shit bc again there are people who have it so much worse and i make a big deal out of everything. i just feel like i'm the worst person in the world and i feel like people around me think the same but they're just too nice to say it and it's completely crushing me and i feel so bad tonight and i'm so tired. i just hate myself so much and how i manage to do nothing right. i really need some emotional support right now but i don't have anyone to turn to because, again, no one wants to be around me or listen to my problems since i'm just so annoying and i don't know what to do. (sorry for the rant and thank you if you took the time to read, i hope you're doing better than i am tonight lol)"
637,"In his video on youtube, Dr Todd Grande,  mentions a research study about Borderlines who were in relationships and the following two statements lit my intellectual curiosity on fire like a sea of gasoline. Youtube video title is called, ""How Does Borderline Personality Disorder Affect Romantic Relationships""

The two points of interest that left an impression on me are:

1. In those relationship couples that were in the experimental group where one of the partners had BPD, 51% of the women were satisfied in the relationship and 60% of the men felt satisfied. Although this was not as high of a percentage as what was found in the control group, it still indicated that a majority reported feeling satisfied.

2. ""Only about 20-30% of individuals with borderline personality disorder are dating, married, or cohabiting. Additionally, conducting research on couples is more difficult than conducting research on individuals.""

My thoughts:

It is tragically sad that such a small percentage of those with BPD actually have relationship partners that they cohabitate with. I feel like it takes a special kind of person to enjoy this kind of relationship; however, it is in fact the case that there are some people that enjoy being in love with a Borderline.

When thinking about my past, I often reflect on the most enjoyable relationships I ever had, that felt incredibly intense in a very loving way, and in both instances it had been a relationship with a Borderline. I am not the only person that feels this way, for example, here is a quote from the magazine Psychology today: ""The Drama of Loving a Borderline- September 5, 2019""

""In addition, the borderline’s passion and intense emotions are enlivening to non-BPDs, who find being alone depressing or “healthy” people boring. These partners vicariously come alive through the melodrama provided by the borderline.""

My feelings are that Borderlines are perhaps the most difficult and challenging kind of people to have a relationship with on earth; however, with that being said, try to think about how boring and unrewarding it would be for a professional mountain climber who has climbed Mt. Everest several times to only ever walk straight and level trail paths as an outdoor event.

Personally, and it is just my opinion, when I had not been single and when I had once had the love, empathy, and intense affection of a Borderline, I found that I had to constantly learn about how to develop the best relationship skill sets I could find in order to maintain a rewarding emotional connection. For example, I would have never had discovered the research work of PHD John Gottman and all the work and skill sets that the Gottman Institute talks about had it not been for the intense desire to keep my Borderline partner in my life.

Although I lost the relationship both times, I was constantly working so hard to try my absolute best to keep the person as a forever partner, and sometimes a person just knows what its like to want a ""one life stand"" in an enduring and over time kind of way. They say it is better to have loved and lost than to not have loved at all, and the personal growth that comes from putting in the effort to keep love with a Borderline will always be something I feel appreciative of and feel personally thankful to have experienced.

With this being said, and I plan to talk about this soon, there is one Canadian therapist on youtube, A.J. Mahari, who specializes in BPD and she also is a person recovered from having the disorder herself, and her viewpoint is that ""Borderlines can not, have not, and will not ever love you."" I really have been putting some thought into her perspective although in the future I would like to express politely and assertively why I disagree with her theory. So that will be a future topic for me to write about."
638,"I held my mom while she begged the police to not tell her he was dead and then I told my brother and finally went with the police to tell my father.
i do not think that I am ok"
639,"as i used to people apart from BF think im doing so well

i asked my aunt how she thought i was doing and she thought well ,i asked her why and she said because you don't hurt yourself very much now


this makes me really angry
i have been very low and anxious and had terrible mood swings with feelings of dissociation 
so im just wondering will i now get discharged because i am not hurting myself as much

does is not matter that i have constant suicidal thoughts and thoughts of sh but BF begs me not to do it

you won't believe how much i want to but he says he will hurt himself if i do so that stops me x"
640,"Hi everyone, I have recently been referred to the mental health team as over the years I have had a history of self destructive behaviour. I was sexually abused by a family member as a child, up until the age of 11 and feel I have been emotionally abused by my mother for lots of years. I find it extremely difficult to regulate my emotions and whenever I feel too overwhelmed I get an intense  wave of anger come over me (mostly with my husband) and I end up screaming and shouting/walking out/telling him to leave/throwing things or sometimes drink myself into a state. I struggle to cope with stress and I'm extremely sensitive so when I believe someone has wronged me I think the worst of this person. I also struggle with who I am a lot of the time and try and morph myself into different things when I'm with different people and I have extremely low self esteem. At the back end of 2018 I had a one night stand with someone from work. We were messaging for a while and after a few weeks we ended up in a hotel room. It was the 2nd time I had actually spoken to this guy face to face and once I got there I panicked and drank myself in a state but when messaging I felt so much better about myself. Around this time I was going out with new work friends and drinking heavily when out to the point where I had to be looked after in the night by my husband as I was choking in my sleep. I also fell asleep in toilets and had to be rescued by family members at times who were called by friends and bar staff. At that time I genuinely believed my husband was the problem and blamed everything on him calling him controlling. I can see now that he didn't want me going out drinking because of how I would end up and my erratic behaviour. My husband has only just found out about the one night stand so he is struggling. From the few things I have read about BDP I feel like this could be it as its like reading about my life! does this sound familiar to anyone? Sometimes I think I'm just bad and that's it"
641,"Hi

I apologise now because all I seem to do is moan on here and about my partner honestly I do love her to bits but ….
Shes ill a lot its either headache, tooth ache, dizzy ness, IBS or her mental health which is has depression anxiety and was sometimes is but not happened for a while a self harmer. But when im ill guarantee she is and worse, she will get me a hot water bottle and every so often run me a bath and will get me something to eat but its mainly me tending to her even if im ill. This week a elderly member of my family died we aren't sure cause of death yet but it was traumatic we had to get police to kick door down and she was found dead on the toilet, I also have quite a bad cold I cant shift and im asthmatic, im also on antibiotics for a urine infection, so felt very sorry for myself and tired, well her toothache started which she does have a bad tooth which I have gone on about getting sort but shes scared of dentist so all weekend shes been in pain nothing has helped shes been up all night had tv on and ive hardly slept, running up and down stairs getting what she needs, she been dizzy and almost passed out, I didn't go up to her for an hour or so because I was entertaining my kiddies but went up shes laid in front of bathroom door and said oh I thought id lay for a min but got up when I told her to as couldn't get in to her. I just feel like in general its me attending to her needs all the time and I am a caring attentive person its just in my nature but cant help sometimes this is taken advantage off and feel she does crave attention from others she likes to know they fancy her and from me its for me to look after her...… rant over doesn't help im tired and I work as well as have my little ones to tend to x"
642,"So proud of myself for using skills today!

I flipped out at screwing up some eggs for dinner. No idea why but I went on an F'ing rant at my girlfriend and stormed out, leaving her to sort out the eggs. This would normally lead me to anger, hostility and hours of being annoyed at myself and guilty. So I decided to use TIPP under cold water and it really worked. I calmed down much quicker than I normally would and I have apologised within five minutes. I feel a bit better though I now need to remember I am more likely to be in ""emotion mind"" so being a tad careful! 

What skills have you used today that have helped keep you on track?"
643,"Hi, 29yr old woman here referred to mental health team for BPD.

I think I do have BPD as reading about it is like a autobiography, Sexual abused by a family member until the age of 11, abandoned by mother soon after, she has narcissistic traits and has mentally abused me all my life, along with many many traumatic events in childhood. My father was there but was into drugs.

I'm married with a child, yet cheated on my husband through a one night stand with a colleague who was messaging me (which made me feel good)  who I had only spoken to once before, we met at a hotel, when arriving at the hotel I realised I didn't actually want to do it but felt I had to due to feelings of only being around to be abused so I got blind drunk and was blacking out during the sex, and throwing up afterwards. I had no feelings towards this man and don't know why I did it, I was in a bad place at the time, going out drinking until I passed out, once having to be rescued by the bar staff as i passed out in a toilet. At the time I was blaming my husband for everything as he was trying to stop me going out and getting in this mess, yet I saw this as controlling, he even had to stop me from choking one night when I arrived home wasted.

I have feelings of emptiness and worthlessness, low self-esteem, had spells of bulimia, have complete meltdowns when things get too intense or anyone questions me too much. I have anger issues which involve screaming and shouting, throwing things and asking my husband to leave me and I'm extremely over sensitive and think the worst of people when they say something that offends me. I dont feel like I know who I am, or real"
644,"again.

I am feeling pretty good right now but once I come down I am not going to be happy. I feel so out of control sometimes, I just can't stay sober. I need to ""tone down"" the extreme or jump to a more desirable one. I know its bad but I'm under alot of stress from my family and school is rough, and guys are my most insane trigger of all so I just need help making it through this weekend."
645,"Im in a relation I have been with my GF (Im gay) for 2 years and its been quite hard, She loves attention even if she knows they like her she will still keep them there and make genuine time for them knowing they fancy her, I don't trust easily so as u can imagine dealing with this type of trait in someone is very difficult. I'm actually going through it at the moment theres a woman that just seems to find away possible to message her even though shes blocked her off social media shes now messaging her on xbox but my gf will do things to make me paranoid because she like to see I care and want her but to me shes going the wrong way about it and im seriously considering ending our relationship because I cant trust her, shes cheated in every relationship shes been in but shes she loves me and wouldn't do that but she cheats emotionally I feel.  So yep I really struggle relationship wise id prob be better single forever.

Or may be with someone who isn't attention crazy and who has a friend from back in the days randomly pop up who ive never heard off."
646,everything is always my fault
647,"I watched this video on youtube called ""BPD-Borderlines Don't Cant And Won't Love You or Attach To You"" by  A.J Mahari who is a recovered borderline who is now a therapist that specializes in Borderline Personality Disorder.

Basically, I disagree politely and in assertive way about Borderlines love not being valid or real as is the viewpoint expressed in the video. I would like to write a response to this video that gives my opinion which is an alternative viewpoint and I had been wondering what do you guys feel about what she is saying."

649,"This morning my boyfriend and I had an argument on the phone which led to me having a panic attack and having to be looked after by a stranger in the middle of town. I hung up on him while this was going on and 4 hours later I still haven’t heard from him. 
I am not placing all blame on him at all. I have been very suspicious and accusing lately due to a girl from the past emailing him and causing my anxiety to sky rocket. Years ago he played this girl and i at the same time and chose her over me. He has been a compulsive liar, says he has changed but did lie to me earlier on in the year about something else.
He says he hasn’t replied to her but I just don’t believe him, as much as I want to, but I guess I can’t let go of his past actions.
He said this morning he wants a normal girlfriend. Why can’t I just be normal and he’s sick of all this. He says if I ask him one more time if he’s breaking up with me then we are over.
I am really shocked that he hasn’t contacted me to see that I’m okay, it’s made me feel so unloved and unwanted."

I’m pretty sure my grandma was bipolar or BPD, but tonight I’m convinced I might have caught illness from her. If that’s true then the best way to protect my unborn nephew is to remove myself from his life. If my involvement in his life made him ill then I’d be an awful person. Should I kill myself to save him? I hate being alive anyway, so can I ever be a positive in his life!"

653,"I've been out of therapy for about 4 years. Managing well with school and work.
But I am unable to keep/form real friendships.
I have a boyfriend that I've been with for 6 years and surprisingly, it is going great!
But friends?
I don't really feel the need and it's weirding people out. I have one 'real friend' I text with almost every day. But other than that I don't want any more friendships. I pretty much never hang out with people besides family/boyfriend. And when I do try to search for new friends (because I feel like I am a weirdo for avoiding social contact), I find everyone quite boring. I can't seem to connect with people. 

My current theory of the issue is that I am too afraid to experience the triggers leading to emotional rollercoaster that I used to have with friendships, but I really could not say for sure.

Can anyone relate?"
654,"I've just been prescribed 20mg Citalopram and have spent 2 days reading reviews getting myself worked up about not daring to take it. Scared it will make me worse and that I'll have a big panic attack and go to A&E or that there will be side effects even though I'm not in a good way I'm scared of making things worse. If you take it did you have side effects / how long did they last and also am I being stupid and should I just take it? Sorry struggling with what's best to do, thanks"
655,"I believe I maybe suffering from severe BPD. I technically fit all the criteria even though it's dangerous to self diagnose. I understand that. But I really believe that's why I'm having a hard time with such dysregulation going on with general life. The more I think about it, the more it fits. I'm certainly not proud of it if it turns out to be true. It's starting to feel like theres something really chemically wrong with my brain and I'm dreadfully ashamed of it. I never asked to be this fucked up. I'm sure some of you probably feel the same. I dont get along with my family very well at all. They dont understand why I am the way that I am and why some things are so hard for me when it's so easy for others like getting a job, driving a car etc. I'm royally screwed if I cant take care of myself because no one really cares I feel. They're all burnt out on me and others I feel laugh at me behind my back. I cant tell you how much I want to refute my existence entirely. I feel like I shouldn't be on this planet. I dont know what the fuck is wrong with me. I feel tired, helpless, weak and defeated utterly by life itself. Why should I be here? Others can appreciate life more than I can. I feel like it's an insult I'm alive. I dont mean to.bitch and moan so much on here but really, I have no choice anymore. I may need some treatment even though I'm not happy about it. Feels like I have to overcome so much to do the smallest of things. I feel trapped in my own misery surrounded by apathetic life. I dont think I have much longer here in life. I dont think I'm going to make it to next year. I believe I may be done with existence. Who knows?"

I'm so used to things going bad, things going wrong. It's hard to have hope. When I'm doing something, at the back of my mind, it feels pointless.

Advice? Or just say hey?

The real challenge is to believe I can be free from this illness. I'm fighting but you get tired of fighting"
658,Today I've overcomed my impulsivity. Is there but I got control.
659,"Sometimes I get lost in a daydream (more often than I’d like to admit) and I end up saying out loud what I am saying in said daydream, kind of like how people sleep talk except I’m not sleeping. I don’t know why I do this or if it’s even related to this disorder at all but I’ve been “unofficially diagnosed” 

As well as this, moreover during this I should say, I start to feel like I’m crazy if I’m sat in my room alone I’ll start wincing my eyes and holding my head pulling at my hair with my head down but if I’m out I get really nervous and on edge like I hope no one saw if that makes sense? But even that reaction makes me feel crazy too -.-

this is one aspect but it’s really what is bothering me most at this current time, well that I’m willing to share anonymously anyway 😅 does anyone get where I’m coming from? Or know why I do this or know anyone who relates? I just want to know how to stop feeling like I’m a crazy case that should be locked up"

I think of everything bad and wrong about them, I hate them etc. And I hold that grudge towards them forever secretly even if I act like I'm over it, I think of everything wrong they have done to me and wait for the perfect moment to use it against them."
662,"Disclaimer I don’t have a diagnosis because I’m “high functioning” or don’t meet all the criteria but I have a similarly organized personality my therapist says. My relationships confuse me so much because I have this idyllic view of what they should be like and I think sometimes I’m happier in my daydream land than in reality which just seems utterly confusing in general. I’m a student and I have an awesome family and support system. Nothing traumatic has really ever happened to me. But my brain is like paranoid as heck about people’s intentions still even though my world view is generally very optimistic. I’m scared of getting close to people but I want to be very close to people at the same time. My one sibling is definitely more logical than me, she just has anxiety too. Is this like generic? A fluke? I don’t understand how people are just like humans doing human stuff and not overly analyzing their own every move and having an exestential crisis every five minutes. I’m in therapy and On an antidepressant and I still have these emotional breakdown type things every few months like clockwork with basically no cause whatsoever."
663,"I have friends who are a married couple who took me in and and they kind of took me on as a daughter figure and I saw them as parents that I never had.. my step dad was abusive and I grew up feeling scared an alone. The couple have been really good to me but the lady has some mental health issues and recently has become really paranoid... she thinks people in the village where she lives are after her and she constantly thinks I am up to something and accuses me of things that I have done. I moved out to a place of my own as she was constantly kicking me out for these said things. Sometimes she just doesn’t make any sense. When I moved out I thought things would get better.. but they aren’t.. she constantly accuses me of doing things with people in the village and thinks I am hiding something.. I don’t even have any friends in the village and it’s got to the point that I am afraid to go out because of how she will kick off if she gets an idea in her head. She can be really mean. I am finding each episode harder and harder to deal with. the man is very supportive and actually stand up for me because what she is saying is ridiculous but it’s happened again tonight and I just lost it, I said some mean things like I hate her right now. It’s just can’t seem to control my emotions anymore she makes me so angry and upset. The rest of the time I am fine. I feel so upset because I know that she will try and ruin my life if I try and cut her off and I don’t even know if I want that I just wanted a mum and dad but I can’t live like this anymore.. I’m treading on egg shells everyday.. my self esteem is shit.. I am constantly checking for things that might upset her. She won’t admit she has a problem and then when we do have a row says that she doesn’t want anything to do with me and then once she has realised it’s stupid then ants me in her life again and then denies any of it happened and when he I feel the only way to end this problem is to not be here anymore.."
664,"My son is getting ready to turn 1 and I planned a small bday for him. My mom decided she wasn't coming most likely due to her relationship with the other ppl that will be there. She said she was going to throw him his own little party. I initially said I didn't know about that and then somehow agreed to her buying him a cake. At this point she took the theme from the party im throwing for him and purchased balloons to match. 

Her plan is to take pictures of him with a cake and balloons and just to be in his company..... to the world this willl seem like his first birthday party bc she's going to post it to social media and technically it is his first party bc the day after this, his party that his parents are throwing for him will begin. 

This entire year I was in a severe depression, my mom helped out by watching my son when I needed a mental break. The other day she took him to the beach for the first time. I wish I was involved with that and I wasn't. I feel like im holding resentment towards her and she has a constant need for control and invades my privacy and thats another reason why im having these feelings.

Today when she told me she got the balloons it really set me off bc at first she said she just wanted to see him on his bday but didn't want to go to the party, then it turned into getting a cake and now the balloons.. its just really annoying bc I dont want her taking these special moments for herself but idk if im feeling this way bc of resentment or if feelings are valid."
665,"Hi all, 

This is my first time posting. I was looking to get some advice from anybody who may of been pregnant and dealing with their BPD. I’m currently 30 weeks pregnant, and so far I’ve been mainly in survival mode during the pregnancies.

I’ve had a few really bad episodes, early on in the pregnancy where I have self harmed, which obviously led to a tonne of guilt and shame. Since then, I haven’t self harmed in around 2-3 months now, which is something I’m super proud of. More recently I’ve been feeling very overwhelmed, and anxious and have been having thoughts of self harm and suicide. Whilst I know that I wouldn’t kill myself or my child, I’m filled with shame about even having these thoughts!

Has anybody got any good tips/distractions when you get to this point? Any advice is really appreciated."
666,Hey guys just curious. Can listening to someone with symptoms that you once had trigger you? Idk if it’s bc I’m an empath but hearing someone or even my old self talk about their depression symptoms leaves me feelings down. And now I avoid it. Could these things trigger you? Same with favorite person things. I hope this makes sense.
667,"Hi, I hope this is OK to ask this.
I met a woman from the USA online, and we get on fantastically. During our video calls, she would start to slur her words, and drift in and out. Closing her eyes for long periods even when I stopped talking. I then sent her a song, and she dissected the lyrics, and flipped at me, saying things as if she was the character in the song. It was Kate bushes heath cliff, she said she liked Kate Bush. It was heartfelt from me as I really like this woman, but she was making the woman in the song her, and asking why I left her out in the cold, like the woman in the song. I have tried everything possible to let her know, I sent the song as a gesture, as she liked Kate Bush, but she is addament, I had set a stage to bring about her downfall. I simply can't get through to her that it was a totally innocent song, but she is reading into it and making the characters us. Any advice would be a help thank you."
668,"hi. Im almost 25 and have had sex with and talked to so many guys I've lost track. I've used tinder and bumble and hinge, always desperate to meet a new guy because I fucked it up with the last one after a week. My bpd has affected every interaction I've had with the opposite sex. if they don't want to date me right away, I lose it. if they take too long to answer, I lose it. if they can't hangout, I lose it. when they decide we're done, I tell them I want to kill myself. not because I think im really going to or because im trying to manipulate them but because im just in so much pain that I really do want to die. I obsessively text them. with guys I've been really passionate about, they've blocked me and I've contacted them with a different method. I call them on restricted. I download text free apps to text them. I am humiliated and angry at who I am and the ways I've acted. I recently moved halfway across the country to go to law school in an attempt to start over, and for a few months before moving, I was on top of the world, high on the idea of being able to start over in a new place where I wouldn't run into someone who had witnessed my crazy, whether it be a guy I dated, or their new girlfriend, or their best friend-- in a new place where I could be a happier, healthier, better person. I have now been here for about a month and a half, and for the past 3 weeks have spiraled into a terrible depression because I have now discovered that no matter where I go, ill still be me. and I hate me. im haunted by my past, and terrified of my future because I know history will continue to repeat itself. there is one guy in particular who I am disturbingly obsessed with, and I am at a point where I actually don't think im even capable of obsessively latching on to a new guy because im so obsessed with him. almost a year ago he threatened to go to the police on me because I couldn't leave him alone. I dated someone after him, and became obsessed with him, and devastated by our breakup, but when the news came that I was accepted into school far away, I became happy and good. all of a sudden I was over him, and I still am, but now im back to being super obsessed with the guy before him, to the point where I am struggling to function. all I want to do is talk to him but I can't because he will call the police. I am convinced he is the one for me, but I was such a psycho with him that that door has closed and been locked with a deadbolt. he hates me and I don't blame him. I hate me too. and I love him so much. I want to die everyday and I do not think it will ever get better. I have struggled since I was like 13 with these issues. they have done nothing but get worse. I feel entirely hopeless."

670,"Hello everyone, 

I have a diagnosis of Boderline Personality Disorder, Depression and Anxiety. Everything is going good in life, no complains. My symptoms are increasing daily. I am feeling sad all the time and I cry daily. I don't know what should I do ?

Any suggestions.."

672,"First the panic attack the other day, now this, felt like I've been looking over my own shoulder all day, that wonderful feeling of unreality, I'm better now but it got bad.  Once I was able to acknowledge what was happening I seemed to come mostly back together.  I'm still getting what I call a mild echo effect, for some reason that just fits for me, but my anxiety has been reduced.  I hate not feeling in control, feeling like everything is going to explode.  Like I said, I'm good now, just needed to write.

As always, thank you for letting me post."

I was feelin too much adrenaline but I was controling my anger for do precises comments. I feel better, they were cornered."
674,I've just had a session (video call on zoom) with my counsellor and I'm totally having feelings towards her. I think she's great. I understand that these feelings are not genuine and are considered transference? But it's starting to get to me a little bit for example I feel like the sessions are over to fast and I don't like that I am not allowed to email her in between sessions anymore. I can't ever imagine myself talking about it to her so I don't know what to do. So stupid
675,"I realized that I have created a lot of the pain and turmoil and pain in my life, especially by responding to imagined abandonment, and I don't know what to do...

678,"I have had FP all of my life and I don't think I consciously choose them but when I find one, it is intense! So I recently reconnected with a friend in another country. We have hit it off since this reconnection. When i am talking to him I feel on top of the world but if I don't hear from him, I feel an ache in my heart. This is utterly crazy but I cannot get off this roller coaster! I have told him about BPD and have tried to pull away but he says that he knows of the condition. When i tried to pull away, I gave him no explanation but felt I had regained some control. He emailed me asking why? I felt it only right to explain. He said he valued our friendship but that if i want to go, he would understand but would be a very sad thing. I am caught in this now. I want to be with him, feel him and have cosy cuddles. I want to make him nice dinners and laugh with him. Then on the other hand, I have seen 2 of his exes who are very sexy and I doubt he would entertain anything with me, but then he says he cannot tell without us seeing each other face to face. Which is very true! I didn't ask for this and am now caught in a web!"
679,"I just wanted to say thank you for all of the useful input and general advice/chat I receive in response to my posts. I only joined the forum recently but I know I've posted a fair bit. Sorry about that.
 I've mostly found it a positive thing being able to post on here if I'm having a bad day or when I'm having a knee jerk reaction to something etc. 

I may not comment on other people's posts very much, this is simply because I don't want to say the wrong thing, or am dealing with similar issues myself. I do read them though and genuinely wish all of you well. You are all so brave and although I suppose most of us wish we didn't have these problems or diagnoses, I think you all seem to be such friendly and supportive people. x"
680,"I've never posted on one of these forums and am honestly just so desperate because I feel so alone and confused. I've suspected I have BPD for a couple of years now. Been with my boyfriend for almost 8 years and the last time we broke up (last year) was when I started researching BPD. All of a sudden everything made sense, how I act just clicked.

I had a lot of trauma as a child and always wanted a calm happy life, I manage to stay 'normal' for months at a time and then when stress gets on top of me or I feel like he's pushing away I lash out. We both have drinking problems and he lost his mum suddenly a few years back, has unadressed gried and won't communicate or open up because he thinks he's fine but he just masks it with drinking and weed.

Last week we had a blow out and he abandoned me, he hasn't been home since and every second of the day is torture. Better than last time when he kicked me out but I haven't heard a thing and it's driving me crazy. I know he might need space but just say so, don't leave me alone and suicidal without any support, does he not realise how much I need him to get through this? I know it's not his responsibility I just wish he could see that i'm ill right now. 

I didn't feel myself slipping this time, didn't know I'd got into a bad place mentally and he set me off. I've lost a lot of people to death recently which I think is the reason for this episode. He doesn't realise he should ignore my comments when I'm worked up and retaliates by insulting me which makes me angry and aggressive. I knew he was trying to leave so I lashed out by grabbing his beard and hitting him, then he strangled me and smashed my phone so I couldn't call for help. I'm glad I didn't call because that would finalise things but then I started hurting myself and eventually he told me to go to bed or he would leave so I did. I knew I'd messed up so badly. He's normally understanding and gives me a lot of time for the most part but I could tell he was getting distant and running on low energy for me.

We were meant to be going away with friends for my 30th and he went to stay with them, they were all planning on still going. I feel so betrayed. They think I'm a monster. I sat in my front room alone in the dark on my birthday without so much as a message. I tried to tell him about my mental health problems but he just laughed, he thinks it's an excuse. 

I'm in so much pain, not knowing where he is, knowing this must be the final straw and wondering how I can go on without him. I know I need help but I'm so ashamed that I ruined the best thing in my life, I should have got help sooner but have been in denial because things have been stable for so long. I just want to know if he can forgive me but at the same time don't expect him to because when you're like this how can you promise someone you love you won't hurt them again. I just wish I was different. I don't think I'll ever be happy again. 

Any advice welcome, I'm desperate. Thank you."
681,"My closest friend (which isn't only just a friend, but we haven't really said that we are together) lives in another country and also has BPD. I was going to visit her this week but with everything that has been happening in the world I wasn't able to go... When I told her about not making it, she immediately stopped talking to me. Eventually (after me begging her to reply...) she told me that her therapist didn't think it was a good idea to talk to me until she feels she's ready.

It's been almost a month since then and I feel like I am losing my mind. I have been quarantined for almost a month now without any kind of irl human interaction (which completely messes with my head and my mental health in general) and it kills me that I can't talk to her. Sometimes I get so angry at her therapist for telling her not to talk to me, and I find myself hating a person I haven't even met. I miss her so much and all I want to do is to hug her and kiss her and spend time with her, but I can't do any of that. I can't even talk to her. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed with how abandoned I feel that it almost feels like I'm going to die from how intense the feeling is. And weirdly enough I am not angry at her at all. I understand how she feels. I will forgive her the second she says ""hi"". I'm just... frustrated? Annoyed? It's not my fault the trip was cancelled. The world is literally DYING. But despite my frustration, I miss her so so so bad.

I was thinking of at least sending a message to her to let her know that I think about her and I miss her, but I don't want to mess with her therapy... I am really heartbroken.

I could use any advice or coping skills you have :(

PS: I can't afford therapy atm so I have no access to any dbt skills"

686,"Went to the cardiologist for a stress test and had my first full blown panic attack in six years, scared the crap out of everyone, pulse 180, BP 220/118, good times, only lasted 83 seconds before they pulled me off, still shaking..."
687,"So, in hindsight I’ve exhibited traits of BPD for as long as I can remember, even prior to my diagnosis a few years ago. I would say I didn’t start to “seriously” work on my behaviour until this time last year, and didn’t really hunker down on that until July or so of this year. Overall, we’re talking about 15ish years of unmanaged behaviour/thoughts. 

I’ve gotten better with impulse control, and I don’t lash out with anger anymore, but now I have intense anxiety that I don’t know how to deal with- the anger at least gave me catharsis, even if it was the wrong way to react. I still “mirror” people when I enter crisis. I still see everything as a sign of abandonment. I still assume and overthink. I still think I have to be perfect to be good enough. I see every mistake I make in my relationships as an absolute failure. 

The problem is I’ve come to this crossroads many times before, so many times I’ve lost count. I always have this crisis where I decide I’m going to be better and stop being like this, but then it just goes back to being the same. I told myself in July that this would be the time that I get my stuff together... and like I said, I have made progress. But not enough to be significant. Not enough that I can honestly say I have changed and shed my ways. My loved ones still notice the same behaviours and patterns that I’ve exhibited for as long as I’ve known them. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford therapy. I do DBT exercises when I remember to, and I journal my feelings. I’m so sick of being like this. I’m so sick of hurting my loved ones and always feeling so... unhinged and untethered. 

Part of me knows I can undo all of this and be normal, but I see four years of failed efforts behind me and it makes me want to cry knowing that maybe I’ll always just be this way. I really don’t want that. I know people have gotten their BPD into “remission” and I want that to be me, so badly. I want to be calm on the inside. I can’t be this way any longer, but I also can’t keep promising everyone that I’ll do better and somehow never changing. I need to change, but it seems futile for me."
688,"Hi There, 

I'm new to the site and am so glad I have found somewhere to talk with like minded people. Like most people with BPD I have really good months and really bad months. I also have PTSD and a most recent diagnosis of postnatal depression. I have a gorgeous 8 month old baby who I believe is both good and bad for my BPD and PTSD. I should add that I am battling a codeine addiction too. Other than that we're a perfectly normal family :-) Honestly, you would never guess there was anything wrong we live a very normal life with good jobs and socialising with friends and family. 

To get to the real reason fro my post - I wanted to know if there was an area specifically for parents who suffer with BPD or PTSD or PND? or like me, with all three!! 

If there isn't and I'm not the only one who would feel like benefitting from one them could we try and get something set up? 

Bye for now. 

Loopyloo"
689,I don’t feel real. Is this part of psychosis or borderline? I feel … unreal - fake not real. I don’t know what’s real… am I real? How to feel real? I don’t know myself. … anyone else who knows how it feels?
690,"A well known quote by Robert Nesta Marley. I thought I'd share them on here because I often read them when I feel like I've reached the end of the road in life...

“Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.”"
691,"After around 30 years of struggling to cope with ""normal"" life (working, looking after a home, relationships) and at least half of those years on antidepressants I've (perhaps not surprisingly) come to the conclusion that there must be a different way to move forward in life without medication or therapy. I suffer with BPD, depression, anxiety and the worst of all tinnitus. 
For the first approx. 15 years I worked through things on my own. I left where I lived with a rucksack and sleeping bag, worked in farms short term saving up money and spent my winter months travelling the world. It was a life of sex, drugs and rock n roll visiting some of the most dangerous and exciting parts of the world. I had friends (more like drug buddies) from london to marrakesh from cairo to kabul. I felt I was living the dream. I'd come home occasionally when the money ran out but couldn't get away again fast enough. The stress and pressure of living on the road finally caught up with me as I grew older and I basically crashed and burned out. 
For the most recent 15 years I made a complete break from the previous lifestyle. I moved back to my parents home and gave up all my bad habits. No more drugs, alcohol, right down to changing my diet, no caffeine, no sugar, vegetarian etc. I cut ties with everyone I had known. This was such a big change I struggled to cope. I went to my GP was given medication and went to counselling, psychology, and mindfulness courses. I got a slight lift but whenever these sessions ended I sunk back into a world of depression, self loathing, anger, hurt and pain. As time has gone by I've become more ingrained into the mental health services, seeing social workers, psychiatrists, more counselling and group work, more medication. Again slight improvements then when left on my own sinking into isolation, extreme periods of suffering and not coping. I was on that roundabout over and over ...up and down.... it seemed never ending with little success. I found myself becoming more and more stressed unable to handle my emotions, shut off from the world around me, I crashed and burned again. This time I had a stroke and was left with the gift of tinnitus, balance issues and memory problems. All my own fault and probably the culmination of years of drug use and living on the edge... I accepted that as best I could. 
Around 4 years ago I was diagnosed with ""possible"" BPD and have since been in therapy with psychiatrist and key workers, group work, 1-1 sessions and a range of medication to try and find a balance and if anything I feel worse now than ever before. On the positive side I've studied Buddhism, deepened my meditation practice and taken up yoga, tai chi, and have a range of relaxation practices all of which gives me moments of calm, clarity and self-acceptance but with limited impact on my daily life. I often find theres a conflict between my way of life and the therapy I receive but I try to integrate them and make use of them both. I'm now at a crossroads again and feel I have to choose one way or the other to move forward because things are not improving enough to allow me to have any kind of ""normal"" life. I feel the Buddhist path is the way forward for me as I'm so disillusioned with the medication and therapy and i feel it's doing more harm than good. I mean I am just exhausted, suffer severe headaches, my body is always aching, I'm lethargic, no zest for life and probably more confused than I've ever felt. Something has to change or I feel I'm not going to survive much longer...
If anyone reads this I'm sorry for the long winded story but I have in fact kept it short and removed the most traumatic parts. 
I'd give anything to wake up in the morning and feel energised, happy and meet the day ahead with a smile. I think everyone deserves some joy in their life without suffering and just living for the sake of being alive. 
The only thing I'm sure of is there has to be more to life than this..."

696,"Hey. I've had a bad couple of days.
Started feeling, or at least idealising, suicidal thoughts. Strongly imagining one method in particular. Called in sick to work. Completed an online consult form via my Doctors surgery requesting a sick note. GP called me and said he had written a letter for me to collect and take to A&E as he was concerned due to me sounding like I was planning to act on these suicidal thoughts. Standard visit: waited for a few hours, spoke to a psychiatrist, sent home with a leaflet, got a call from the home treatment team the next day, all finished with now. I keep waking up feeling sick and anxious at the moment. My mum actually came to the hospital with me but she just says things like she ""doesn't get it"" as in I was ""having a laugh [with her] the night before"" this all happened. Things like that annoy me.
I'm really worried about my job now too as I have been absent quite frequently in 2020 and my managers reaction this time was clearly frustration and she kept talking about how they have supported me but they also need to weigh up the needs of the business etc. I just feel zoned out at the moment. Kinda like I'm not really in my body."
697,"Hello I need some advice to do with eupd

I'm moving out shortly and I don't know if my meds are going to be changed

 if they do get fiddled with to help with pshycosis how long does it take for the medication to work an average guide.

My ariprizole has been increased from 15 to 25 but my voices are still bad and my physchiatrist said it's to do with trauma from possible eupd diagnosis I've read that there isn't a pill to help eupd but there are mood stabilizer s that help with bad mood swings.

I'm also on sulpheride 1000mg but as I said my voices are still bad and intrusive.

I asked my parents.if I could stay with them in between moving if meds get increased etc so I can have a witness to see if they are working or not and change in mood etc I know they offer talking therapy if I get offered some more I'm going to take it.
Any advice.would be greatly appreciated x"

699,I self harmed a bit just now. In the dark it’s midnight in the kitchen. Feel dead and just wanted to feel real. Now the sting makes me FEEL again. It’s such a relief… I think I’m really real after all. …
700,"First, this isn't a push for christianity, it's just my personal path.

I have been looking for work, lots of interviews, no invites to stay.  I was saved six years ago but I really didn't know what that meant.  

I'm three months out of prison and thinking that if I get a job, I'll be happy, I'll get my own place, I'll be happy, I'll get friends, I'll be happy.  I'll be able to support myself, I'll be happy...

So until about ten days ago I was really unhappy, having those thoughts of not being here anymore, that made me happy, and that is sad.  I found a program where I live that is a Christian discipleship, a year long with housing, food, clothing and fellowship with other like minded people.  I was invited (strongly suggested) to go on a camping trip with these folks and had a really good time, had the kind of laughing where you wake up the next day and your stomach is sore( No alcohol, no drugs, just people talking).

I feel like I've found a home, I know it's early as there will always be issues, but I feel planted, for the first time since I was a child.  I am cautiously optimistic, I tend to overthink everything though, suprise, I'm borderline.  I think this is my last best chance at being mostly whole, and that is scary, I know I can survive but I'm tired of just surviving, I want to feel full and not have that empty yuck it seems I've always had.  I feel secure and it's not just that black/white love/hate, I'm in a gray area and it's nice and weird all at the same time.  I'm ok.

As always thank you for letting me post."
701,I feel like I cant connect to people. I've felt this way most of my life like people are all on another side of a pane of glass. Like I cant feel any social connection I feel like I might be dead.
702,"I like to believe I am a fun person, j have multiple talents and interests, I'm very kind and positive go everyone I meet, however I can get manic and flood people with information, wether it be an interest of mine, or just delving into deep subjects, I can be overly excitable and men find it overwhelming, they always eventually disappear. It further enforces my fear of abandonment and how shitty I am. I wish I wasn't so eccentric and intense. I'm never mean to anyone but I push everyone away with my intense personality. I have been honest about my past, how terrible I used to be and that im proud I no longer engage in such toxic behaviours, but I feel like it makes people judge me or distrust me, perhaps they trust me initially but then, I behave a certain way and they think I'm a narcissist or something. Sign. I hope everyone is doing well."
703,"i’m 23 yo woman(feel like a child) and I had a volatile fight with my boyfriend of four years and he threatened to break up with me a dozen times, he said i’m completely unaware of how i make others feel.. idk if he’s right? to me it feels like i can feel the worlds emotional weight, but my actions prove his point not mine:/ i’m so sad.. he’s the most caring understanding patient person with me and if he can’t stand me anymore, i feel like no one ever will. i’m not entirely sure we’re still dating. he also struggles with ocd so i don’t know to trust me or him or someone else more because everything seemed to clouded and twisted. my bpd is getting so bad i disassociate at least half the day and the other half i’m experiencing all emotions all the time so intensely... it’s getting bad.. i’m afraid i’m going to ruin my life completely."
704,"Does anyone else struggle with this? Sometimes I am so on top of my BPD symptoms and can spot an episode/attack coming a mile away, and even prevent it altogether. And then other times I'm completely at the mercy of these same symptoms. I keep thinking that I'm improving and going into 'remission' as they sometimes call it, cause I'll go weeks or even months controlling myself like a NT person would, and then all of a sudden, with seemingly no trigger, I will falter. Is this just par for the course? Will I ever 'recover' from my more severe symptoms? For some history: I took DBT when I was younger but haven't had any sessions in years and I'm currently going without therapy. I'm a strong believer in making do with what you have so when I was put on a long wait list for a therapist I decided to refer back to my DBT training and to try and improve on my own . I was definitely seeing results but it's almost like my BPD gets tired of being locked away and will just resurface on its own no matter how much work I've put in. And when I say symptoms, im refering to Borderline Rage and dissociation mostly, as those are the two that affect my life most negatively. I should also mention I have a few comorbidities that make this a special kind of hell. (ADHD, Social Anxiety, Agoraphobia, Insomnia, and a few other conditions that aren't complete disorders.) Ty in advance for any thoughts or discussion. ❤️"

706,"I just posted a moment ago but had another thought, I hope posting like that is okay. I'm new here and have alot to get off my chest so I'll probably be very active for the next few days. 

 Anyways, my experience with BPD is mainly focused on my worst symptom: borderline rage. I can't control it, it controls me. And it's so frequent that it's disrupting my life. It always has. There isn't a time where I can recall not being angry at everything. My phone stops working for a moment? Rage. My bf doesn't ask me if I'm ok when I'm visibly upset? Rage. My friend doesn't check in on me for a few days? Rage. It's messed up. Unfortunately, over the years I've broken everything, from items and homes, to relationships and bonds. I've tried everything to stop myself when I feel the heat rising, and the only thing that ever works is ... And I know how terrible this is.... Hitting myself in the head. It's not a conscious thing, at least not until after the fact when I put thought into it, when it's going on in the moment it's like a reflex. But afterwards I realize the affect it has, which is stopping my rage in its tracks. It's not healthy and I wish I could stop, but right now it's the only thing stopping me from putting holes in my walls. Does anyone relate? Thoughts? Advice? ❤️"
707,"Today while my mom and I were having brunch, she got a surprise phone call about appearing on a game show (I won't say which one for her sake), but she immediately turned it down. I asked her why she would pass up such an opportunity up and she said it was because ""she looks ugly"" and ""our house is a mess"". This obviously broke my heart because I'm always rooting for my mother in whatever she does, but this time it broke me emotionally. I know we're supposed to be cautious with those who are insecure but something about what she said made me angry. I honestly couldn't believe what I was hearing because this woman raised me to be polite and kind person and now she's literally sinking herself into the depths of despair. I tried to explain to her why she shouldn't be so hard on herself and how I much wish she'd take her own advice. Funny thing is, she has said the same thing to me countless times! It honestly didn't matter what I said, she still made sure she threw it back in my face. Now, my mother had a difficult childhood. She grew up the youngest of five siblings without a father and a mother who was a hoarder and a widow. My grandmother was always getting her hair done and was neglectful of my mother.

I can see why her childhood might've traumatized her considering my now estranged aunt would bully her. It has been especially since she found my uncle died because nobody notified her, she found out by chance. Growing up, my mother would ridicule herself or refuse to take photos as a family. This obviously affected because I too suffer from a mental disorder and a skin condition which makes me self-conscious. Today I finally put my foot down because despite my encouraging words, they fell on deaf ears. She made me feel so helpless and she didn't even care how I felt, she just told me to ""be quiet"" and to ""stop talking about it"". I'm an adult woman and yet, she still patronizes me like I have no idea what I'm talking about. Not only that, my dad's a jerk towards her as well. She's had suffer at the hands of him for years and has continuously held her back. She even regrets staying with him but only stayed because she wanted to have children, which she admitted was selfish.

I know I shouldn't be talking about something so personally, but as someone who's dealing with her own issues, it has only made me feel like a burden. My mom always wants my opinion on things and now I'm too afraid to share anything with her because I'm afraid I'll say something wrong. Despite having a close connection to my mom, I don't feel like I truly know her as a person, just as my mom. Does that make sense? I all know her for how invested she was in my brother and I's growing up years, but I haven't seen her for who she really is. My dad has honestly sucked her personality dry and only occasionally and conventionally says ""thank you"" or ""I love you"". I just honestly give up and I don't care anymore. If my mom is going to push me away and then tell me how my ""feelings"" aren't real but then go on a tangent about how nobody cares about her and how she's hideous.

My mom has just let me down and now I'm ready to move out. Sorry, for the long rant but I'm disappointed right now. Any advice that can help pull me through until I'm officially on my own? Thank you."
708,I have ordered a new sim card for my phone which means I will have a new phone number. I do not want my family to be able to contact me. Recently my mum is back in touch with me after a 6 year absence. At first I tried talking to her about how her behaviour has effected me but she refused to discuss it. She texts me once a week making small talk and I cannot cope with it. I then had to text one sister who was angry I had blocked her. I cannot have her in my life either although she only wants to exchange birthday cards. I cannot cope with how they have ruined my life and still to this day will not accept I have bpd or allow me to talk about how I feel. My mum lives 25 minutes away from me so I will never really be able to escape. I know I will hurt them but I cannot see any way out. Every contact makes me feel terrible. I wish I could move home too but that is not an option.
709,"I stumbled across this site recently and thought I'd give it a go. I don't usually do the internet but I was at a very low ebb and struggling with very little help from my GP or key worker and my invisible psychiatrist. So I guess I was looking for some kind of human interaction which is difficult in a world where you have to wear a mask and avoid contact with people. Where we're told that staying apart is bringing us closer together...
So I thought oooh a mental health forum with like minded people and stories of understanding and coping from people who know what it's like to feel depressed, alone, isolated, different, not accepted in the world...
And yet here I am now feeling more alone, more isolated and even further from feeling like i belong in this world. 
The older i get the more confused i become and the less i seem to know or understand. 
I guess I'll just self isolate and shield and socially distance myself away in my empty bubble until Bill Gates decides I can have a life again..."

712,"I'm a closed off person by nature and it has done nothing but remind me of how hopeless I am. People always tease me about how I need to get out of my shell or they give me the cold shoulder because I give off a certain vibe. I honestly have come to hate the term ""vibe"" because people use it to shove their positivity crap down my throat. I'm a geode, I may seem dull or serious on the outside, but inside I'm so much more. It seems like people don't want to take their time to understand me and would much rather go with someone who's already approachable. Since COVID began, I'm stuck with my family, especially my emotionally strenuous father who has selective hearing. I feel like a loser because I don't have any friends, not even close ones, null! I'm stuck at home with consuming thoughts, social anxiety, and body dysmorphia due to a skin condition. I enjoy going on outings but only when I have my mother present with me because I'm insecure when I'm alone. I wouldn't say I'm completely closed off because I tend to talk to my neighbor who has a basset hound named Charlie who surprisingly makes talking easier. I've been thinking of adopting a puppy to become my emotional support animal but I'll have to wait until I'm on my own. I believe the only true companions I have are animals, but I know this because I'm an animal person.

I feel bad that people still judge my appearance because I come off a ""prudent"" or ""somber"" person but I honestly can't help it. I've accepted that I'm just a melancholic person and I wish people wouldn't act so stubborn around me. Even though I'm in my early 20's, I still haven't made any real friends. I think it's also because I'm a bit of an old soul and so people just assume I'm too emotionally draining be around despite them never inviting me to go anywhere. During my childhood, so I tend to take jokes way too seriously. At least I believe that I'm someone worth being around, I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong. All I can say is that maybe it's better this way. The more I try, the more it'll hurt, so I'm going to spare myself the trouble for good."

714,"Hi all,

I am new to this forum and I am still learning to navigate the pages, so I apologize if this subject has already been addressed. It's something I have been struggling with for a long time.

There is no handbook for parenting; everyone makes the best decisions for their children based on what they know. In my case, my parents didn't intentionally hurt me, but I certainly felt neglected and ignored as a child. As a teen, when my mental illnesses really came to the forefront, they dismissed my cries for help as teenage angst even though I begged for professional help. It was a very, very dark time for me. I had to take my mental health into my own hands when I was 21, and ever since then I have been the one teaching them about mental health. I don't think they've done any research without me spoonfeeding them. I've hardly felt supported. Unsurprisingly, I was hospitalized last year, and even still they have hardly done an adequate job making me feel cared for.

They didn't hurt me on purpose. But through their ignorance... I feel like they set me up for failure.  I've been suffering emotionally for as long as I can remember. I love them -- and they aren't bad people -- but I haven't been able to forgive them. I kind of want to confront them, but I'm not sure what good that would do. A confrontation won't give me my childhood back.

Has anyone else felt this way? How have you processed these feelings?"
715,"Growing up, I had a strong attachment to my mom, just like most kids. But as I grew older, and when I realize how different my mom treated me and compared myself towards other people's mother's my mom and my dad weren't particularly good role models. Although, they tried too, I still have so much resentment towards them. Particularly, my mother. I've been experiencing suicidal ideations since I was 14, I'm 19 now and I started socially withdrawing myself then. I started becoming paranoid that no one liked me or I'm so annoying even though I had friends and was kind of 'popular' in school. I stopped going out, and talking to people. I think the lack of parental support in my childhood affected me so much as a teen, I get particularly attached to authority figures, and as well as I have had crushes on my teachers, and in university I've had crushes on my professors as well. Even with other people my age when I get crushes, I fall in love with them without even knowing them. But, I'm so sexually confused, I dont know if I like girls only because I'm scared that a guy wont love me, or if I only like girls because I only like the emotional support of girls. My mom would shout at me a lot over the smallest things, she's so emotionally volatile over the smallest things. And, whenever I just show the slightest annoyance she treats me like I'm a bad person and she would talk shit about me to my other siblings and to my dad and when we fight she would ignore me and suddenly the whole house ignores me as well. I've realize also that because of this, my youngest brother has become a people pleaser towards my mom it's always about her needs. It irritates me how petulant and fucking childish she is. And she does not realize that anything is wrong with her parenting style, she thinks there is nothing wrong with our family. I have intense abandonment issues, and I've self-harm in the past and still have urges to do them again. I've been to a psychiatric ward once for suicide attempts and Ive had panic attacks just being around people. I've also had eating problems as a teen and intense body image issues until now. I would not eat for days, I would go fasting and then suddenly binge-eat. And my family knows how insecure I am about my weight and they don't even realize how much that fucking hurts me and they continue to body shame me as a joke even though I'm not even fat just to get a rise off me or to make me feel insecure. I think I may be borderline. My mom makes the most fucking embarrassing, cringiest, and  unfunny and inappropriate jokes. She always makes fun of me about everything I do. I fucking hate her. And, even the most disgusting and irritating jokes, where I felt she overly overly stepped out of her boundaries was when she joked about me sexually, and she doesnt even fucking realize how inappropriate this is. Just yesterday, I was standing beside her and she was sitting down on a chair and I was joking with my sister then suddenly she went close to me and tried to pretend that she was about to kiss my fucking boob. my sister and i were both like ew and i told her ""that's sexual assault"" and naively she was like is that ""considered sexual assault?"" and I tried to cool down and ignore what she did. And she did it again this morning this time, she told me to hug her and I went to her and hugged her and she was trying to make that fucking joke again, this time she was putting her face on my boob while hugging me on purpose just to try and be funny. Fuck i fucking hate her, i cant believe how fucking dumb she is and her lack of introspection. who the fuck does that? to her own fucking child. Please feel free to message me personally, I really need someone to talk to"
716,"It's always been a popular  expression that ""these feelings are temporary"" or ""this part of your life is temporary"" and ""It will pass."" 

When would you consider it permanent??

I know that not just counselling, medication etc will help, I understand that self help had to be a factor too. 

I've been speaking to my counsellor for approx 9 months. The care coordinator for about 5 months and on medication for about 4 months. I also try various self help techniques. 

Yet I'm still here feeling the same. The only change I guess, is that I'm not attempting suicide every now and then. But I'm still anxious, negative, the myself, don't want to be here, overthink about the past, obsessed with certain things etc. 

It feels permanent to me."
717,"Went to see him today. I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder but today he said I have borderline as well.

There were some previous pdocs that also picked it up but I didn't mention it to him. It was therefore interesting that he also believes I have it

I think what made him diagnose it is my tendency to self sabotage, confusion about self and my violent moods swings and aggression. Also I have had frequent urges to injure my arm. My husband gets scared of me when my temper flares up.

So I guess it makes sense."
718,"Does anyone else, this is probably the wrong word, but like ""fantasise"" about things that are a bit ""out there?""

719,"I posted a thread in the bipolar forum that was meant for this forum. You can read it there if intrested. It is called: "" DBT for none-borderliners.""

I posted it because I wanted those who have a Borderline Personally Disorder, when they read my posts in this forum, shall know that I don't have the same experiences as them. I meant it as being honest and polite.

The reason why I sometimes want to write in the borderline forum is that I now and then need to speak to somebody who understand the special ""language"" of DBT.

Just dont know what to say, but I just want to try understand this diagnosis ive been given recently. I would like to listen to other people own experiences.

I pretty much gone underneath the radar of any mental health care/ support or medication. I managed my own mental wounds (BPD/ depression /Anxiety/ OCD) for 25 years with being in survival mode of fight or flight. From a young age ive had to survive and grow up in my own way not just from a mental aspect ( but socially, financially, no parents etc....) but everything a young human need to develop it into a balanced individual i never received.

But last years a sought of gave up was just so tired of this continuous circle of survival. This is when i was diagnosed with BPD and depression. Its so hard everyday trying to manage my own emotions but also trying to make ends meat, even though i super strong person. Hows do you all manage with your diagnosis day to day?

Thankyou to all who listen to my story and take care"

All I know is that I speak to a private counsellor weekly, a care coordinator every now and again aswell as trying so many self help techniques and strategies etc.  I work although my hours were reduced recently. Also take daily medication. Yet I still feel the same. It makes me constantly wonder if it isn't even worth it??

732,"From the age of 15 it became my responsibility to look after child relatives, I lost my freedom my friends my hobbies my social life. Everything. It got the point I couldn't leave the house without having one of the kids with me, not that they could do anything to protect me because they were toddlers but it was more of a mental security blanket. They've grown up, I moved out of the family home and I started to get a bit of my life back but I wasn't me I wasnt the confident sociable person that I used to be. I was anxious af, insecure just a shadow of who I used to be. Then it fell on me to take care of an elderly relative who's favorite hobby was putting me down especially in front of other people. I couldn't cope anymore I became suicidal but I finally felt I was at rock bottom and needed help. So I turned to my GP. I've been assessed by a psych and been diagnosed with bpd. I don't receive any support from any professionals, on anti psychotics. They've kind of just left me to it but that's a rant for another day haha. 
I've since cut ties with that relative and now live on my own again.  I became so numb, dead inside I spent months not doing anything not even watching tv. I'm now starting to feel I'm better enough to want to start doing things but what? I don't know what I like, what I enjoy I haven't had any hobbies for over 10 years because I spent that time putting everyone else and their needs and wants first. I don't know who I am.

But today it did because I haven't self harmed in many months, probably a year now. But now it's all coming back. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and my doctor told me it will get better over the years. Is this true? I know I can't expect things to just improve over night. And I'm trying to work on my life too. I started eating healthier and I'm focusing on my education (which I avoided doing in years). I also wanted to try focusing on my health even more too. I was doing so well yesterday. Now I'm worried I'll end up in a hospital again because of how I'm feeling."
734,"There is the saying ""life isn't fair"", but did you ever stop to think about how much this is true? This is an epiphany I have recently had.
 
There are people in life who are way ""ahead"" in their life. They are ahead in terms of their careers, property, education, relationships, the amount they have travelled, their confidence, their mental stability, etc etc etc.  They may not have all of those things I listed, but they have at at least some of them. They have always been given some kind of reason to live. These people have been given a lot of opportunity. Opportunity in the way they were brought up to flourish, people actually built their confidence, instead of constantly destroying it.

Sometimes I get really angry, because I realise how much SHIT I have been through in my life, and that I have not been given anywhere near the amount of support, encouragement and opportunities that others have. The worst part is I feel guilty for even complaining about it often, and I feel that I should repress this. People say there is something wrong with you when you want to die, but the truth is, from a young age, I was given no reason to want to live. To name a few things, I was not encouraged in any way to build my confidence, pursue my interests, develop my own character, I was not even allowed to have friends, like other kids. I was always controlled, suppressed, and instead, I had to witness trauma all the time. Why in God's name would I want to live anyway??  I was given no reason to want to be alive. No wonder my brain invented suicidal ideation as a coping mechanism. No wonder I wanted to die so badly.

A lot of it is also bad luck. I get these moments of real burning anger when I realise how bad my life has been. The good thing is I am in a position now where I am able to change it, but still, it does make a person angry when they realise how much has been taken from them in their life. They were given a shitload of pure bad luck.

Am I right to feel angry about this? Yes, I am. So is anyone who has developed BPD. There is a reason why you are like this.
I do think the people that have ""BPD"" and similar problems of depression, feeling like they want to die, etc, they have real, real serious reasons why they are like this, and why they are so far behind in life, but they always seem to beat themselves up about it, and feel like they are failures. Well today is the day that I stop comparing myself to people who have had it way easier than me.

I think it's super important as someone with BPD we compare ourselves to ourselves and follow our own paths. What is the use of comparing yourself to someone who has had it way easier?

P.S. If anyone has ideas of how to let go of one's sense of resentment? I personally think you can't let go of resentment truly, all you can do is empower yourself to change your own circumstances for the better, and make things better for yourself. If you had a shit life in the past and were dealt a bad hand, well you deserve to be happy more than anyone. All you can do is make it for yourself."

739,"Hi
So I've only recently realised I have BPD.  I've had to hit rock bottom to get here.  

My wife won't speak to me, and I only get to see my children maybe once a week - which I know doesn't sound that bad, but it destroys me.  I completely understand her reasons, but that doesn't stop the rollercoaster.  I have completely withdrawn from society, I  am out of work and have no idea how I move forward.  There are only 3 people who I speak to, they are mildly aware of whats happening but don't really grasp it.  I've been unintentionally crying wolf quite a lot on my slide down this slope, which is now backfiring on me.

I'm in the UK, so am waiting on the slow wheels of the healthservice to turn in order to get a formal diagnosis, and potentially some medication that might help.  From what I've read I need DBT, and am happy to pay for this - but just don't know how to make the connection.  All the therapists I find online seem to be individuals, and from what I understand a large component of DBT is the group therapy session, and potentially therapists operating as a group.

Can someone please help point me in the right direction, I feel lost, want to move forward but just don't know how to ?

thank you"

I have been diagnosed with BPD and depression about 5 years ago. I always thought, that if I try hard enough and accept help my life will get better. But now (for about 6 months) I'm wondering if it's possible to live a successful and happy life (e.g. university degree and a fulfilling job, family, children) with BPD. I'm really depressed because I don't know anybody who has a good life despite mental health issues like BPD. 
So now I turn to you for advice.
Do you think that this is possible? Or do you even know somebody who has BPD and lives a happy life? 

Thanks for your answers! :)
Kind regards"
742,"Hey.
I'm due a session with my counsellor tomorrow. Recently been phone sessions but considering having  a video call. I'm just really really nervous about it. Kind of nervous about speaking to her in general for some reason actually. 
Does anyone else get anxiety about speaking to their therapist? If so, do you have any advice?"
743,"I can never tell what's going on inside my head and I'm afraid to be honest with my mother. She's aware I have suicidal thoughts but I don't think she wants to believe it. My dad on the other hand is a numb bum (I want keep this PG), who does nothing but antagonize me when I'm feeling upset. He basically taunts me instead of actually being an understanding father, I think I got robbed in that department. Back in March, I got diagnosed with BPD and I haven't taken any medication(s) since my therapist wants to see if there's any changes first. Since the pandemic, I feel like I haven't made much progress since I couldn't see her in person. It also has made remembering appointments difficult and so I haven't been keeping track thanks to dummy me. Since I've last seen her, I feel like I no longer have BPD because I have an introverted version of it. A part of me knows I have it because I feel slight shifts in my personality, especially depending on what I'm doing or where I am. I'm naturally a quiet person and tend to be sensitive to my environment. When I'm with my family, especially with my dad, I can become isolated from the rest of my family.

These personality shifts have happened more frequently since the beginning of this year. I have trouble explaining but it feels like a dying battery, always charging but never full. I'll have times where I regret even getting up because I can never make myself useful because I'm a burden to my family. My dad only perpetuates these feelings because he always acts like I have no right being the way I am, almost like he's complete disbelief. I hate seeing myself as someone who needs to be fixed rather than someone who needs to be encouraged. Why can't my parents just accept what's happening to me and find a way to improve on it, why is it always about undoing everything? My depression and anxiety is already undoing me, so why bother trying to ""fix"" or ""change"" it when that will only make it worse? Whenever I open my mouth I feel everyone treats me like I don't what I'm talking about, as if they have to reel back what I've already said. Not only that, I have a naturally bad temper so when they react to me, they only make feel more misunderstood.

At this point, I feel like a sore loser stuck with parents who are polar opposites and I'm just in the middle bouncing off of them. I honestly want to move out so I can dealing with my mental disorder elsewhere. I honestly feel like I'm doing something wrong and feel guilty because I don't know where to start or what to work on. I just wish I didn't have to feel so alone all the time and not feel ashamed of my lack of enthusiasm.

I'm just simply not the same."
744,if my boyfriend wants to be socially active and i don't will this part us
745,"Hi there, 
Does anyone know how I get a diagnosis, I think I have BPD but want to be sure before I start going down a private therapy route.

I'm in the SE (Bucks), although, I'm not sure that makes a huge amount of difference these days since everything seems to be being done via video conference.

Any contact details for private clinical psychiatrists who were able to provide a diagnosis, and ideally be in a position to prescribe meds - would be greatly appreciated.

Or do I just go any see a psychiatrist ?  Just not sure how I get a diagnosis - this is all very new to me.

Many thanks in advance"
746,"Exactly what the title says. 
I either feel too much OR not enough for everybody. I even feel like my counsellor is fed up of me."
747,"So aswell as having sessions with a private counsellor, I also regularly speak to a care coordinator on the phone. I also used to speak to a psychiatrist briefly before being discharged to the coordinator. Anyway both the CC and Psych advised me a couple of months ago that I had been referred to Psychotherapy, I know these things can take time and I have made sure to chase it up every now and again, often being told that I would need to wait to hear from them etc. This week I chased it up again and was informed that I was not on the waiting list and I had never even been referred. There is no mention of me being recommended psychotherapy at all. I mentioned this to my counsellor as I was frustrated about it and even she said that they had discussed it with her and definitely mentioned to her that I had been or was going to be referred! So I know I'm definitely not going crazy... or getting any crazier at least."
748,"When I drink, I want to self harm. I don't feel unhappy but it suddenly becomes something I want to do. Anyone else?"
749,"My partner ( whi is in forces) has come back to support his dad as his mums ill.. he hasn’t stayed here ( I’m 5 mins away) and when I offered to go around and help he declined. Now I see his ex wife’s car is outside and Dp is there with a shed of food. I’m so so so sick of being left out. I can’t stop crying. 
I saw my therapist today and (to cut a long story short) she said that not many women would put up with that, let alone one with bpd. 
I wish I could just tell him to F off because I’m sick of being put bottom of the list
 I appreciate he’s worried about his parents but that’s not an excuse to leave me out after 6 years together. 
I feel so worthless"
750,"My DBT therapist got visibly irritated with me today and said, “Vortex. Stop Talking.” (Only it was my real name she said, not Vortex.) I was stunned because my talking was me answering a question she just asked and shuffling thru papers to get the answer. It was like she had zero patience. It’s only my 2nd month of the program and I didn’t know how to handle it. I regressed to a 5 yr old and hung my head. I basically froze and went into shame/shut down. It ruined the whole session and I’m ready to quit. I know I can request a different therapist, but I wanted to see if others think it’s nbd for a therapist to behave like that. Thx for any insight."
751,"Hey all, I have understood dissociation/derealization as not feeling connected to the relationships around me for example; I didn’t feel like a mom or a girlfriend. I didn’t look at my boyfriend like my boyfriend but instead, as just something that was there. I feel like this doesn’t make sense I’m sorry.

Anyways, I quit my job which was causing A LOT of stress and I almost instantly felt sooo much love for my boyfriend and son and wanted to do things to make my boyfriend happy and I was sexually attracted to him again I also felt confident.

I’ve been doing things that make me happy and I’ve been having wayyyy more energy I went from being tired and hardly getting out of bed to getting 5-6 hours of sleep and not even being able to fall back asleep.

 I feel like a human and before I felt more detached from everything like I was an actor in a movie playing a character. Could this be because my anxiety is low or could this be because of depression?

I’m so confused why I don’t feel like this all of a sudden I don’t feel a constant dreaded feeling and I don’t feel down about myself as much and I’m doing things for my son and boyfriend just because I love them and want to see them happy.

I felt a love for my son that I haven’t felt yet and a love for my boyfriend that I havent felt in years. I’m 21 and got with my boyfriend at 15 and my bpd got really bad around 18. My son isnt even a year yet.

So basically if this isn’t too confusing can someone explain how I’m getting better is the bpd being fixed or has my post partum depression gone away or was this feeling caused by anxiety and because the anxiety is low it isn’t happening? Thanks ahead of time for anyone who replies."
752,"So, this is a very long and complicated story but I recently lost three close friendships this past March.

I had a falling out with one of my former friends (male) about 3 years ago and it had been hot and cold throughout that time. My other two friends (both females) remained close with me in spite of the issues with the other guy. Then the guy started dating one of the friends but we all still got along.

I’ve been in a small graduate program with the three of them for about 3 years. We take the same classes together and work in similar settings. I shared some personal issues with them and they were very supportive of me. They even provided resources to deal with the issues.

Then, a few days later I learned that they had shared my issues with my program director. I was a bit hurt by it and reached out to them to talk about it but they completely shut me down. They insisted that they told because they care about me. I said I understand and I’m willing to forgive and move past it. However, they have continued to ignore me and give me dirty looks in classes.

The COVID-19 pandemic helped me distance myself from them but we have since returned to on campus classes. I’ve noticed that they deliberately sit away from me in class and pretend that I’m not even there. It’s extremely painful because I just don’t understand why they would behave in this manner. They are aware of my intense fear of abandonment and always assured me that they would never cut ties with me.

The ambiguity is creating a lot of distress. I feel compelled to reach out and make things right but I know that it can create more problems. I find myself constantly ruminating about the situation and I have no idea how to move past it. It’s extremely difficult to be in the same room as them or run into them when I’m out in public (e.g. the store, coffee shop). When I hear about them making plans to hang out and go on vacation together, I feel extremely hurt and rejected because I know I will not be invited.

I don’t know what to do. Any guidance will help!"
753,im doing it a lot
754,"Good morning,

Over the past week, I have become aware of my self destructive behavior and emotionally abusive behavior. I am wondering if people would be willing share their experiences in dealing with this and their road to recovery. Or if people are currently dealing with this.

Over the past week, I have come to the realization that I have been gaslighting and manipulating my partner. I thought it was simple lying, but it goes way deeper. I made her believe that I was done talking with my ex, and my partner based all of her decisions around that. This includes getting together, moving in with me, and just two weeks ago discussing a family. 

Had she known I was talking with my ex, she would not have done any of those. She made a decision to move in with me and fall in love with me because I lied. It was non-consensual because I withheld information from her.

I felt like I had a very high moral code and ethics, and I have always been strongly against abusive behavior, so to find out that I've been doing it myself is completely devastating. Furthermore, the abuse that I took from my ex was projected onto my new partner by me. The parallels are pretty surreal. 

If anyone can offer some insight, words, advice, or encouragement. I would greatly appreciate it. I have started therapy, cut ties with anyone in my life that was toxic (and their friends), and have been reading a lot of self help articles."
755,"I don’t even know if I’ll make any sense my head is in such a bad place lately. I have been diagnosed for over 20 years but I seem to be struggling as much as ever. I know that things are better than they used to be and that I’m healthier. I feel like I’m so close to having some peace but I just can’t quite get there. And the More stable I become outwardly,  it seems the crazier and more chaotic my thoughts become. I can’t stop worrying for example. About anything and everything to the point that it’s pathological. It’s even harming my loved ones I believe. I have lost all sense of focus and my short term memory is suffering to the point I’m scared it’s something other than anxiety causing it. I’m hardly leaving my house since COVID and spend a lot of time alone with just my cats and my thoughts. My racing and scattered thoughts have made it hard to even remain focused to watch a movie from beginning to end. On top of all that I am in love with and recently moved in with my boyfriend who either has narcissistic personality disorder or at least some characteristics of it. And I’m never going to leave him no matter what. Of course I’m clinging and hanging on for dear life trying to avoid being abandoned which has happened with every other person I’ve loved other than my mom. I feel like I’m stuck in the hamster wheel. I can’t stop or I’d crash and fall and it’s going so fast I can’t jump out. I’m stuck. Any experience or hope out there."
756,"Hello. 

I've struggled with my BPD my whole life. It's been worse the past year after I decided to see a therapist and open up my emotions, which I have mixed feelings about. Was it the right choice or should I have stayed like this emotionless shell of a person just existing. I had no sense of empathy or care for other people before I opened up. Kinda like a survivial mode. 

I suffer mostly with anxiety attacks triggered by being social, even around friends. And destructive rage from even the smallest confrontation my mind perceives as trivial. It can be as little as I want ""this"" for dinner but I got ""that"" instead, and then my mind makes up a big fake story about the reasons and I turn from being depressed to full on rage. This is incredible exhausting to deal with. What are yours best solutions to deal with the rage when you feel its coming?

Even a discussion with my wife about something I did wrong. My mind goes into full survival mode and tries it utterly best to justify my actions even though I know it was wrong, if that makes sense. So my mind tells me all this lies and makes up stories to back up my faults and this amplifies the problem ten folds and it turns into fighting and my destructive rage lets lose. The urge of breaking something is almost uncontrollable, yet I have never been physical with anyone, just that I have to punch a hole in the wall... etc. 

I would love some inputs to manage these situations.

Thank you for your time."
757,Hey. This is my first time posting in here so I'm not exactly sure what to write. I just feel so alone and my counsellor suggested this forum to me. I have BPD and Depressive episodes aswell as anxiety.
758,"Hello. I only signed up to this forum today and was initially anxious about posting, however everyone seems so nice and supportive so far. 
Basically there is a long story behind what I am about to say, however the short version is my relationship broke up in September 2018, I had a couple of relationships before but this was the love of my life, the one and we had so many future plans. The break up, which she did my sending a text by the way after 2 and a half years, broke my heart and I reacted badly - attempting suicide and various other extreme behaviours. Unfortunately, I was arrested in late 2019 for continuously contacting her with fake accounts online. I managed to prevent myself for a while but was arrested again in Januray 2020, again I stopped for 5 months but was arrested again for the same thing at the beginning of August because I found out that my ex girlfriend was in a new relationship and I was devastated. I am now out on bail whilst they download my phone, I imagine I will end up back in court, and I am terrified that I will go to prison as this is my second breach of probation and thought of prison absolutely makes me want to commit suicide before the possibility becomes a reality. I'm not generally the sort if person to get in to trouble or take part in criminal activity and have never been involved with the police prior to this. I don't know what to do. I Apple to my counsellor on the phone yesterday and I actually told her I would rather die than go to prison in which she responded that I don't know if that is the case yet, but the anxiety surrounding it is almost impossible to deal with. I just feel like a weirdo and I don't want to be weird anymore."
759,"Hi.
I have been feeling low for 4 days. I have been crying alot of the time and have tried alsorts to lift my mood. Being around people, doing projects at home, etc. I have cried more in the last 4 days then done in several years put together.

This always happens around this time of year and normally last for months and develops into suicidal ideation. I have had fleeting thoughts but nothing I can not handle. Worried though it will get worse.

Have tried medication in the past with no look and using DBT dont always help."
760,But I can't identify what im feeling and whats triggering it.
761,"When I meet a man I am interested in, I feel like I cannot be secure unless he is throwing himself at me, and basically acting like he really needs me. This is an unhealthy and unrealistic insecurity on my end, and the aforementioned behavior I described and long for is definitely unhealthy. 
As I got older, I learned to better control my actions, like not behaving in a desperate manner, but alas, this internal expectation is still present. If he wishes to take things slow, I immediately assume I am unwanted and unimportant. Not sure how to work on this in therapy and/or DBT."
762,"I idealise suicide frequently, but I feel like I really want to go through with it now"
763,"Not sure if I’m on the right forum? I have EUPD with severe depression and anxiety, also had bouts of psychosis. Anyway my problems stem from things I did that were disgusting in the past when I was 18, which regret, repulses me and haunts me till this day aged 40. Can anyone help?"
764,"I've decided that for the rest of this month, my goal is to block out the idea of suicide in my head. If I get distressed, I will use another coping mechanism, whatever it is. I am determined to re-train my mind. I will try breathing exercises, meditating, praying, coming on here, phoning a friend, going for a walk, listening to classical music, if things get too much. But one thing I will not entertain in my head this month is the idea that I should, could or deserve to die. 

Please, anyone who wants to join me, feel so so so welcome to get on with me and fight this battle with me. 

I will post about my progress on here.

Lots of love out to users of the forum.
X"
765,"Another thread is asking that question but about a wife but it made think of more generally - why do people stop taking their meds.

I was medication resistant and went throu almost all the SSRI's before bulldozing my way through SSNRI's to finally find one that worked with my antipsychotic and after that I was maxed out on my SSNRI. I expirienced side effects that I though impaired my ability to function as a healthy 21 year old girl and had dependance form so when I quit them cold Turkey I went through withdrawl not understanding what was happening. I stayed in bed for 3 days in almost a catatonic state because of the pain and I've been very hesitant, even at my worst, to start them again because of a fear of forming dependance again or not being able to ever come off them and having to sacrifice to tolerate the side effects.

Anyone else have a reason?"
766,feeling down and struggling don't want to be here anymore sorry for being so down and low
767,"Does anyone else ever feel like they are a weirdo?? I have been focusing on this thought so much lately. I know some of my traits, reactions or behaviours are down to BPD/Depression/Anxiety but I can't help feeling like I'm just an odd person and forever wishing I was normal, ordinary, regular. If I wasn't so weird then maybe some things in my life would have turned out differently. Like sometimes, I dunno in a programme or a book, there might be a character that behaves a certain way and I might classify them as strange... then I realise that I am strange myself because of my own behaviours or reactions which leaves me feeling even more like a weirdo person."
768,"If I am in contact with a few people during the day, especially a work day, i often stay awake at night analysing and ruminating on interactions with people.  I think of things like .. why did they say that, what did they mean by that, they don't like me, should I have said or done this,, I shouln't have done that, I feel bad about myself... thoughts like this and it keeps me awake some nights."
769,"It's my 30th birthday next Monday and I'm dreading it. I don't have many friends but that's not an issue. I hate spending time in groups of people so that's not a negative thing for me. I am always so disappointed on my birthday. I end up feeling really depressed and wanting to lock myself away and cry. I always vow that the next year I don't want my birthday acknowledged. I am so bad at making decisions and knowing what I want that I never have any ideas of what I want to do. My fiance tries but it always leads to me feeling bad. I also feel incredibly guilty over him trying and me not being appreciative enough. I feel as though people shouldn't waste their time and money on me. It's like when we went shopping for clothes yesterday. I felt as though I was useless and didn't deserve anything. I hate myself. It's just a fact. And I feel like crap because I'm sure he (fiance) feels as though he can't do anything to please me. Also today is my dad's 70th and because my fiance is going to be looking after our children while I go and see him, I feel as though on my birthday I can't have time to myself without the children because this is my time. I wish I were normal 😭. Anyone else go through something similar? Help, lol"
770,"Does anyone else who sees a therapist or counsellor ever feel like they may be too attached to them?? I don't think I'm experiencing transference but I definitely feel kind of ""clingy"" towards mine and I email her quite alot inbetween sessions :/"
771,"Hi. I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago and have been in weekly therapy since then. 
I have made some progress but still find romantic relationships to be the same. 
I find them very difficult. I was single for several years and then recently met someone, but I am finding my feelings are fluctuating quite a lot. But every relationship I've been in, it has been like this. 
I was just wondering if anyone else had the same issue. 
At the moment I feel almost nothing... Except sad, I guess. Sad that I'm not wildly in love. 
And then sometimes I am so clingy and needy. I wish I wasn't... 
I don't even know if I've ever felt real love. I don't even know if the guy I'm with has, either. Or if he's just been with dysfunctional women. 
Can anyone relate?"
772,"Hello!

I am new here and I would like to know if any of you share the same diagnosis as me: borderline and ocd (especially pure O and body dysmorphia)."
773,"Hi,
My fiancé  mum had an operation last week and there have been complications. She needs to be transferred to another hospital for another operation. He is now at his parents house and I’m ashamed to say I feel jealous? 
why can’t I be a normal person who puts his feelings before mine? 
He seems to worry about her and do things for her that he doesn’t do for me ( she’s a usually very capable 71 yr old).
He didn’t even return from work when I took an overdose.
I sound pathetic I know .
His family still put his ex wife ahead of me and I feel very left out , they are nice enough to me but I just feel ‘ not good enough’ .
Sometimes I just wish i could press an ‘ I don’t care’ switch .
I just want to cry. He’s due to go back to his base tomorrow ( in navy). 
I am fighting the urge to send a nasty text about him  getting comfort with his ex wife ( no proof that’s what’s happening) 
Arghhhh I hate being like this .. all random cr*p in my stupid head"
774,"So if I am in a good mood, then someone comes along I am spending time with and their mood is bad about something that just happened to them it brings my mood down. My mood can change depending on the people around me. Does anyone else have this."
775,"So I’m new here.... 
I’ve found myself having to reach out with others who go through and feel similar ways. Sorry if it’s an essay...
2014 I was in a toxic relationship and had made the decision to end it all on a specific date. In the meantime, through some complete turn of fate I met a woman on a similar forum to this who was Canadian... who I developed a friendship with which turned into much much more. We Skyped daily, with the crazy time differences we both got about 4 hours sleep a day but to cut a long story short she decided she was going to come to Australia to be with me despite my constant warnings it wouldn’t work....
She arrived sept 10th 2014 and the moment we saw each other in the airport, it was something special. She made me want to be a better man. I had spent 15 years jumping from psychiatrist to psychiatrist, psychologist, hospital admissions multiple attempts, but she finally made me see a future for myself. I engaged seriously with therapy and really, for the past six years, I’ve been coping well with my BPD. She immigrated here, I paid for everything I just wanted her to be happy and for 5 and a half years we were. She understood my BPD she knew my triggers, she knew my social anxiety and went out of her way to protect me from them and understand how I was feeling. I made the giant mistake of trusting her with my all.. I would have done anything for her. Anyway the night before Good Friday, we were cuddling on the couch as normal, at around 10:30 she got up and told me she was going to bed, kissed me on the lips and told me she loved me. 
jump to Good Friday I wake up to a text message that “we need to talk” she isn’t happy etc can’t worry about me anymore, wants to find her independence again and is leaving. Nothing I could do or say could change her mind. 
little did I know she had been planning it for a little while, found a place to stay bought herself a new car etc.
I believe that every person has something like a candle that glows bright within them that represents hope, love and our life force.... I had given her access to mine (for the first time ever - I had never done this in any other relationship) and that day she blew it out.
We live in a small town and within two weeks I find out she is seeing someone else. I’m devastated beyond words. I’ve resorted to self harm again... had to move back in with my parents at the age of 41 and no longer can find happiness or joy in anything. 
I honestly feel as though my time is up... I have tried so hard to find other things to focus on, work, study, sport, nothing works. I simply cannot see a way through the darkness this time. 
the anniversary is coming up and I have plans. I’m reaching out to anyone that has ever gone through anything remotely similar (please realise this wasn’t just a normal BPD unstable relationship that inevitably comes to an end) and how they were able to find a way forward out of the darkness and just some slither of hope that gave them the ability to move on... because right now.... I’m back to square one."
776,"Hello everyone I'm new to here and this is my first post. I got diagnosed with BPD about 18 months ago. Alongside that I have GAD, bouts of depression and OCD tendencies. I take 90mg of Duloxetine daily. I'm currently getting help from a psychologist fortnightly over the phone due to Covid-19. Before Covid-19 I was seeing a psychiatrist as well. That got stopped due to the virus. 

I'm a key worker and have worked throughout this situation in quite stressful job. I've been struggling a lot. We're only allowed one person off at a time and I have to have my psychology session before work. Having to go to work after a session is horrible. 

Over the last few months it's been harder to control outbursts at work. Culminating into having a colleague shout in my face telling me not to blame my mental health. They compared me to them going through the menopause and that if they can remain professional then so should I. This all started because I was annoyed about something, gave that person attitude and pulled a face. 

Honestly I feel awful. Really struggling to stop crying. Just extra ordinarily low. Lots of suicidal thoughts. 

Any advice anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated."
777,"It’s getting near bed time and I’m already starting to get nervous. I don’t know why but I always get shaky and anxious, and like something bad is gonna happen. It’s like this every single night."

779,"I have BPD, is it that hard to remember? Maybe it’s because I can seem so ‘normal’ for so much of the time that when I have a bad day or I’m triggered, people are shocked that I do actually have a personality disorder? Seriously I’m sick of having to explain over and over that the way I act sometimes is because of BPD."

782,"I'm starting a new job on Tuesday. My psychiatrist is very confident I will be fine. Everyone I talk to say I will be amazing as it is what I do best but me on the other hand am really struggling. When I actually get some sleep I have very vivid dreams about work. I have constant stomach ache and feel sick. I'm drained. I dont want to take my condition with me. I feel I wont fit in because I believe I am strange. I am trying to take the positives of being borderline. I am very empathetic and so in touch with other people's emotions. I work incredibly hard. However, sometimes these are my downfall aswell. I dont think I can do this. I just want to run away."

An hour of errands later I'm visiting with my mother and my brother texts her: he is checking himself back into hospital.

By back I mean he has schizophrenia and is also an addict he's  been self-hospitalized twice before. He isnt completely present so he needs someone there to understand what the doctor is saying.

 I saw him this morning an hour before he went to the hospital and he said nothing. 

We went to get his car and see him but because of covid they said we cant sit with him through intake and this hospital has alot of staff that treats psych patients badly especially in Emergency so I'm worried for him."

I get very jealous and I’m so scared of my girlfriend cheating. I try to hold it in and not let myBPD affect her but sometimes I snap and it’s not fair on her. I love her so much, she’s my fp and I would die for her in a heartbeat, I literally need her like I need oxygen and so when she shows other people attention I feel  so jealous and mad and like I’m being consumed by abandonment.
 

she wants to go out with her friends on a night out after lock down, they’re planning on going to a gay bar and then she’s going to stay at one of their houses after so she doesn’t drive home drunk or get the bus home alone at night. I told her it was fine, I don’t want my mental illness to affect her life and cause her to be unhappy or control her and put her in an abusive relationship so I’m trying so hard to be okay with it but I’m having panic attack after panic attack, I’m so scared, I’m so so scared by body is constantly shaky and I’m just anxious all the time. I’m so so scared of her cheating on me and I don’t know what to do! I want to say no don’t go but that’s not fair on her again. I have this recurring thought that she’s going to get drunk and get with someone or the girls house she goes back to will have sex with her. I’m so scared. It’s so silly and untrue but I feel like my life is at stake, if she leaves me I feel like I will die. I feel like I’m in fight or flight mode. I’m just so so scared I can’t stop crying behind closed doors, crying myself to sleep. I feel like I’m going to lose my everything to this night out.
 

please please help me. I’m so so in love with her, she is my soul mate, we talk of getting married and our lives together, I love her so much and I need this relationship to work. I would so appreciate some advice and virtual hugs, my mental illness is killing me."
786,"Since stating aripiprazole for psychosis I have been sleeping more regularly. Before I would either sleep all the day and night and the be awake for long time. But last night I only got a few hours sleep. I have been struggling with accepting my diagnosis, the fact that I believe it is wrong and not being sure what i can do about it. I know i am overthinking things but not been in a situation before. I am one to stand my ground till I am proven right or wrong (I do not mind which) but is worse this time as found out (now I'm out of psychosis) that professional have said things about me that to me are not true. I do talk to my psychiatrist this week.

Do you have any advice on how to calm overthinking and/or how I could set the record straight?

Thanks in advance."
787,"It's amazing how our minds can play tricks on us and try and make us believe something that isn't true. I'm having a challenging day today in this regard. It is my boyfriend's birthday today and it is proving to be littered with trigger landmines. I almost just typed ""LANDMINDS"" instead, and somehow that seems more fitting.
I am triggered when he talks to his family members, especially his sisters. I say this because, one of her sisters blocked me on instagram after we got fired for fighting at our job. She had never met me before in person, so I felt like she had no room to judge me for that. Also, his sister and him were close in the fact that she would go visit her without my boyfriend, and they are both black. I also feel super insecure being white and being with him, as I knew his ex is black and I feel like he subcontiously thinks that there is no way for me to understand his struggle as a minority and thus, he would more likely want to be with a person of certain ethnicity. Also, another one of his ex girl friends is chinese. I told him that I'm triggered by being white when most of his exes are some kind of other ethnicity, and he responded with, ""She was Mongolian, if we are getting specific."" He had begun to say this, but stopped himself. That triggered me too, as it seemed like he was holding back because he didnt wan't to tell me something, and thus that he was holding much more back from me. I am convinved that their sex was better, and the sex that he had with his only other white ex girlfriend was better too. 
I even took off work today because I wanted to spend quality time with my boyfriend and make him happy on his birthday. Instead, I am getting triggered over him talking to his family and crying in his face about how I am hurting. Honestly, this makes me feel worse. Like, why can't I just be normal and happy and supportive and the kind of girlfriend I want to be, and the one he deserves. I am sitting in the guest room right now hacking away at the keyboard like it has the answers, like if I smack the keys hard enough, the pain will hurt less. Now this is a ramble. Thank you for reading, thank you for understanding. I was not expecting this day to be this triggering."
788,"I'm having murderous thoughts about my boyfriend's exes. I just want these thoughts to go away. Sometimes, it's hard to be around him because of what I am thinking."
789,"I wanted to go on vacation to the okanagan i told my family and friends and nobody wanted to go with me. Now My family are planning a trip to the  okanagan BUT its a camping trip and my when my brother leaves the hospital hes coming and my mom wants to keep upping the price of the trip.

Its becoming a thing i dont want to do.

I hate camping
I dont trust my brother fresh out of he hospital
I am splitting the cost of this trip and everytime my mom wants to do something i ca t afford she says: you dont have to do it, which is true but I am supposed to wait 2hours while she does something? Plus most of it isnt even her money.
She keeps saying : for my birthday! But it doesnt change the fact that i cant afford to do it. And im not cutting into my university tuition money for it which is what i feel she wants me to do.
What do i do? I already told her the trip is causing me anxiety and when i let her know i cant afford it i feel like she shuts down. I dont understand how she can spend money that isnt hers so freely and she spends her own money so frivoulously. I am not rich but i can make my money last."

honestly don't know where to put myself"
791,"Hi. 
There are a few posts on here about people that have psychosis and have BPD but are not specific and I am look to see if people experience the same as me. 
I have been diagnosed with BPD and severe psychosis but I do not feel that I have the mood problems or abandonment issues. I do not behave impulsively. I do have intense moods but do not change quickly. I have voices that narrate my day and have told me to hurt others. I also see dead people all around me. I also believe that the government are after me and going to make me disappear but this has improved with medication. 
I just wondered what other have experienced."
792,"My psychiatrist asked me if I'd ever been sexually abused.  After some thought, I said yes.   Until that moment I'd have said no.  This was the first time ever that I'd said anything. I was abused from puberty until age 22 when I left home to get married. Until now, I thought it was me that instigated and controlled what happened.  But he was an adult and I wasn't.  
I feel very conflicted about this as he was always the centre of my life and i had a breakdown when he died.  30years later he still has a fantastic reputation.  But now I wonder if he abused others as well. 
Would it help my recovery if i told everything to my psychiatrist/ therapist or is it enough that I say I was abused?"
793,"I was chosen for a job interview but I don't want to go. well, the interview is by zoom but i'm changing my opinions again and angain, i'm feelin a litte bit of pain in my stomach, stress or panic IDK..."

795,Since I lost my job I've done nothing and can feel my brain atrophying by the day. so I signed up for local first aid courses.
796,"Hello - I'm new,

Does anyone find it difficult to go to food shopping/ joining queues at stores, etc. I dread it and regularly have panic attacks when the store is busy.

If you feel the same, I would love to hear about your experience and how you cope with anxiety :)"
797,When I get seriously suicidal my mind breaks and I go psychotic. I was tortured as a little kid real bad and then a lot as a teenager / young woman and a bit as an adult. Now instead of commiting suicde (that emotion that has put me in cardiac critical care) over that emotion it makes me go crazy and walk down the street naked and stuff like that. It always ends in a mental hospital for a few weeks. Is that BPD or my other diagnosis of DID. I do not lose time like I used to. Now I am aware when I break. I go crazy nonviolent. I.signed up with a mental health facility that does daily group therapy sessions today.  This is after I pulled a Lady Gadiva at the end of June and I was hospitalized this past 4th of July (I did it 7 years ago too.) . My BPD is newly diagnosed for me.
798,"Hey guys, 

 

i struggle a lot when it comes to finding a balance in any aspect of my life and especially when it comes to my relationship. I either love someone so much it suffocates them or I distance myself away so much that I hurt them- unknowingly but aware. Im at that stage where I love my partner dearly and there is nothing else I want more than to be with him but we live in separate houses and I find that my episodes happen a lot when I am away from him- although i am only away from him maximum 2 days... 

 

i am very insecure about my looks and about who I am and what I do. Im insecure with my looks more so with my current partner because I know the ""type"" of girl he prefers and they arent like me. He likes ""more chinese/ asian"" girls whereas I am more australian chinese, i dont retain or desire many oriental looks i.e pale skin or thin.


Tonight he watched a kdrama and That made me very insecure. We share a netflix account and i had intially blocked the show off on his account a couple of months ago and he found out today. At first the confrontation/ conversation was fine but then he said he loved me- i was angry so i ignored his message for a bit. And then i finally replied but i got angry because he didnt reply to me within the half an hour mark. I started frantically calling him and trying to get a hold of him. When i finally did i gave him a little attitude and he told me to go away and hung up.


after that i fell into a spiral of not feeling good enough, wanting to not love him anymore, wanting to self harm and not knowing how to get over it.. he said it was fine but i didnt feel fine.


Then i started ranting about everything and now he is asleep and i still feel horrible.. how do i find balance in my relationship and how do i get rid of this fear of abandonment admist a fight?"
799,I was abused badly most of my life and have BPD. I can't stop thinking about all the bad stuff. I was the family scapegoat for my whole life.
800,"i have just felt so low the last 2 months
doesn't make sense
i should be happy x :("
801,"I may be splitting, but it really feels like no matter what I do, people just seem to hate me. It feels better to be non-existent because that way I won't bother anyone. 

Because that's what I do. I'm ugly, useless and people want nothing to do with me. It really hurts to be lonely yet hated by everyone. Regardless of I've actually done anything wrong it is always my fault and it is always I who need to apologize. Why is everything my fault? Relationships are not a one-man show. Take some responsibilty and stop blaming me for everything. I can't even escape it online, as I'm ignored and discarded for better people. I should keep my mouth shut and disappear, because that would make everyone happy. 

I feel so unstable. Why does a change in tone make my heart skip a beat? Why do simple opinions by internet users make my skin crawl? I'm too sensitive and weak. This is a rant, I do not expect replies and if this gets removed I understand"
802,"Seriously, is there ever going to come a day that’s not filled with BPD hell? And if there is, feel free to tell me how to get there. Because I’m so lost, I need a new word for lost."
803,"Hi

I have quiet BPD and I'm finding it so lonely not knowing anyone who understands what it's like. I'm hoping this is the place. 

My husband doesn't get it. He's always asking me to tell him how I feel but he doesn't get that I have huge emotions that go away and telling him that I hate him or that I want to kill myself is just a temporary thing that doesn't need to be shared. Talking of killing myself, I left the margarine out two days ago, he got more yesterday and I apparently forgot to put it away. Now I hate myself. Everything was fine when I woke up and now I want to die. I feel as though anything could send me over an edge. Why can't I get anything right? I don't know where to put the rage I feel. It just sits inside me festering and I end up crying which I don't want to do, it feels weak and pathetic. 

Identity- I think of some new hobby or look based on someone I've seen writing about it on Twitter or someone I watch on TV. I get so happy about it, researching buying things. It feels as though it'll make my life better. Change everything. And then I realise that it's BS. Nothing changes because I suddenly have a new hobby or a new wardrobe. I will always be.... this and I spiral into despair. Anyone else? 

Sorry for the weird introduction. I started writing when I felt ok and then changed it because margarine bought my world falling down. Hi."
804,"I have nobody to talk to and I do not have therapy until Thursday so I thought I would post on here. I realised today one of my friends hardly has any contact with me because she is in a good place. I am happy she is doing well but now I see she was only in contact because I supported her through bad times. It is quite hurtful that people do not seem to like me for me, only for support. I felt upset and tried talking to another friend about it but she made me feel worse because she did not want to talk about it. I realise some people just do not know what to say but I rarely reach out to friends and whenever I try they make me feel worse. 

Not having friends who care has triggered me. All day I felt extreme stress and my mind kept trying to shut down and dissociate. I hate how things like this become overwhelming for me. I feel stupid and useless. I do not know why people cannot like me for me. It hurts."
805,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome when I was 15, and then borderline personality disorder when I was 21. I never got an explanation from the therapist as to what it was and how much it would change my life. 
I was in the hospital for a while because I was over the place, I won’t go into specifics because I don’t want anyone to be triggered. 
I came here for someone to help and support me if you can. My name is beth and I’m from Scotland. I never judge anyone with what they are going through. I think we should be able to share our story without being judged. I’m so scared as this is the first time I’ve ever reached out since my diagnosis,i just feel alone all the time, like I’m a bad person, and that the worst possible thing will happen and I feel extremely scared around bedtime for some reason."
806,"My wife has self diagnosed BPD. She lost both parents at an early age and has very few family in the world.

I met her six years ago, we now have been married for over three years with two young boys and a third due December.

I’m pretty sure we are on the cusp of breakup.

If it wasn’t for the kids, the business and the house I’d be gone like a shot. 

She is horribly depressed and I am so fed up with the relationship and incredible requirements it entails. I’m really resentful and worn down. I imagine I’m not the easiest person to be married to but man... I feel like I’m going insane.

I’m late to everything because she flips out that I’m abandoning her last minute.
Pissed if I don’t do enough to make up for abandoning her, or pissed off if I try to do more before I leave in the hopes of mollify her so she doesn’t flip out...

Requires me to be in constant communication, have an accurate time home and heaven forbid if the plan changes or worse I’m a minute late.

However, while she is out but inverse is never true...

She can make plans at the drop of a hat with zero detail about when she will be back but I need to give weeks or days notice with very clear and specific timeframes and how “I’m going to make it up to her for abandoning her” also need to give her my plan in the appropriate form. 
Can’t simply say “I’m planning to work Monday, looking to leave around 9am” twice on Sunday. Because it will be a surprise Monday at 8am.

Pissed off if I prioritize anything over her

Pissed off if I choose to do the thing I want to do over housework or childcare but will happily do five hours of tv or knitting or craft and demand not to be interrupted so I must take care of the kids.

The hypocrisy of being upset if I do a “selfish thing.”

Most choices or plans I make are described stupid or “that’s a stupid way to do that” but then she is upset that she has to plan everything and everyone.

I am quite emotionally closed off due to my upbringing. That said, im pretty sure it’s a contributing factor as to why this relationship has lasted six years.... I shut down and avoid conflict or simply agree with everything and promise to work harder.

Therapy has helped me understand myself and her a bit better and I’m better at validation that I ever have been.

I am trying to get more in touch with my emotions... However, it is difficult to do so when I get called 

“Selfish; disgusting; scum; dickhead; loathsome; unfeeling; robotic; remote or less than human.

I’m not allowed to talk about this issues with anyone but my therapist as it would be an egregious breach of trust. 

It’s also genius really in a cynical way. Her perception and memory is always correct apparently. If you don’t do anything wrong then ever, you can blame your husband for anything that goes wrong in life. Often the majority of why she is upset is my fault... 
I don’t earn enough
I am at work too much
I want to be by myself
I only choose activities that take me away from her

Feel like I’ve been handed a hospital pass.
Here is a woman who from day one of our relationship told me she wanted kids and that if didnt then we should break it off. She wanted to replace the family she lost, wanted to be a stay at home mum and doesn’t want to work. 

Yet doesn’t want to do any heavy lifting. She demands I earn money but be flexible and at her beck and call. If I push back then I’m valuing the task/event/person higher than her then I don’t love her.

If I point out the lack of logic in this she sparks up.

If I cite specifics then I’m being pedantic or looking to score points. 

If I use generalizations then she cites point by point specifics and accuses me of lying and changing my narrative

This weekend, I watched as she lay on the couch all Saturday. I was up with the boys from 7:30am, did all the Nappies, cleaning for guests, made all three meals for everyone. Put thru washing and put the boys down. Hell, I even obliged her priorities, the cleaning of chair upholstery. The only time I can carve out for my priorities is if both boys are asleep or I’m literally out of the house or she has something to keep her occupied (choir, coffee)

If you have gotten through this wall of text, thanks.

I’d love some feedback and any advice"
807,"I going to try stop saying nasty things to and about myself.

808,"I feel I am a loner, mostly I find it hard to interact with people and because I am sensitive and feel that people don't like, little things like an eye roll to something I say makes me think they don't like me. I just think people think I am weird.

Also if I spend a couple of days alone it recharges me, probably as I don't have to deal with my feelings around people and all that goes with being a BPD."
809,"Hello all, 
  I am new here to the forum. I found it online with a search, when looking for other people with BPD to be understood a little better about this inner struggle I’m having. On top of all that’s going on in the world and maintaining independence and being a mother.... 
 I am currently in a relationship, been together a little over a year and a half. There have been a few instances where my significant other broke my trust by doing some questionable and confusing things behind my back. These things eventually came to light and when we tried to talk things out my partner wasn’t completely honest initially. Later the full truth came out after a while of me questioning them and revisiting the topic multiple times. Which wasn’t pleasant for anyone. I just wanted to understand why they did what they did.(wasn’t cheating or anything) 
 Moving forward we came to an agreement about how to rebuild trust. Does anyone else find it really hard to go back after “splitting” with the black and white thinking? Is it also hard for any of you to rebuild trust once it’s broken? Surprisingly after months of consistency I was starting to feel better. I guess anything takes a great effort when it comes to these things. (For me) 
  But right as I begin to feel comfortable again and I guess “safe”... they broke my trust again in a very similar way to the first time. I feel overwhelmed by the two steps forward three steps back feeling. I’m trying not to split again. Again I’m trying to understand.  If I need to go into more detail I can... But how would any of you handle it? What would you do to help yourself? Cope?"
810,"I came to the realisation that there is a massive gap in BPD people that come from Black and Minority Ethnic communities in the US and UK. This led me to look at why this is the case. 

I found that there are no less numbers of BPD in African and Asian (non-white majority) countries! The rates are the same as for white people in western countries yet in groups I have been involved with (in the UK) there were absolutely no black or Asian people in any of those groups! 

Has anyone else noticed this? I know the rates of BAME people in MH services is lower than you would expect anyway but with BPD it seems really noticeable and the stats seem to prove it. 

Any thoughts?"
811,"My fiancé and I are definitely trying again, he’s still staying at his parents but he’s taken me out for meals/ drinks ... took my children and I for lunch yesterday and booked us 5 nights away next weekend.
however, I’m paralysed by him not being here and staying at his parents rather than being here. I feel so rejected ( he seems to think it’s better for us ) but I just want him here, I’m listless and obsessed .
The rational side tells me to let him be, respect his need for space and that he is trying his best (considering he ended it a week ago prior to my diagnosis) 
Last night I couldn’t get onto our Netflix account and he’d changed the password ( which he told me) but I immediately saw it as a sign that we’re not meant to be together. I couldn’t get the new password to work and got into a right state. He then turned up here and sorted it quickly and stayed the night . Immediate relief.
This morning he got up and left at 8.30 with no breakfast, and I feel absolutely crap and abandonment.
His messaged he loves me but I hate he prefers his parents company to me ... and how long will this last?
I wish I could just do something constructive but I’m sat here on my bed feeling crap"

what non-harmful ways can i get relief from this rollercoaster of bpd emotions?"
814,"In order to better understand who suffers from this problem, I would like to ask you what, according to your knowledge and experience, you think of the following situation.

I speak daily with a friend by message and about 3 or 4 days a week we speak on the phone between 1:30 to 2 hours. In my understanding, there is a connection, it is someone I like to be with, I like to talk.

We met with some regularity, sometimes I thought he was looking at me in a way, he seemed to be seducing me. Or else to train your seduction skills. At other times, I saw that he was watching a lot of other people around us.

I recently learned that he is having an affair with a person, after asking some questions, he told me that it will come to nothing because he has no plans for the future. Honestly, the moment I heard what was going on, I wanted to end even the friendship, he never promised me anything, he never said anything to compromise us on anything, nothing ever happened between us, but ... I felt connected to him and I thought he was alone. I am sad because it seems to me someone with more action than me, arrived and got what I didn't get from him, despite having feelings for him, I never managed to take the initiative. And now I have this guilt.

I know that I am an important person to him. He makes a point of having my friendship, but my heart asks for more.

I'm not sure what to do, if I wait for something (I'm not sure what because the only thing I've had so far is friendship) or if the matter ends?

He is a slow person, careful with words (maybe not to create commitments), I had already invited him to situations that created more closeness but he always refused. And always he said that he does not want a relationship, marriage, nobody."
815,"Went for a walk, first time outside in about a week, and I was highly aware of all the different odors that were around me and it got me thinking, what if we could smell emotions, I know the saying ""you could smell his/her fear"" but what exactly is that smell?  To give an example I think joy is like the sweet smell of lemons, I guess it's a personal thing, but I'm curious about what others think.  I'm coming out of my funk and it feels good and it smells like right after the rain has stopped on a summer day, clean.

Hope, it's a beautiful thing...

As always thank you for letting me post."
816,"My behaviour is out of control and despite my best intentions I can’t change; I just get worse. 
I have been diagnosed with anxiety for 30 odd years with meds galore,cbt etc. 
nothing helps. I’m intense,cold, over thinking, over reacting and then suffering sheer terror at the thought of being abandoned. It’s only after a suicide attempt and self harming that afriend suggested I have Bpd.
I am being assessed privately tomorrow as I cannot get anywhere near MH services ( unless I’m psychotic)
My fiancé is in the forces so we are apart a lot, I think about him constantly, get huge painful anxiety attacks at the slightest thing. 
I’m a grown woman with children, and my sister calls me “ the bunny boiler” because of things I’ve done in the past . I do desperately want to be stable, I can’t bear this crazy life anymore.

so after my partner coming home Thursday for 3 weeks, on the Friday I had a complete meltdown whilst on a family outing ( because kids were grumpy and he went to sit in car)
He took us home and packed his car up to stay at his mums . I made the worse scene ever, kids crying etc. 
he said he’d had enough of walking on egg shells, making me unhappy but said he’d come back to talk Saturday. 
I don’t know how I got through that night.
He came over Saturday evening but said it was over but he wasn’t abandoning me . To me he is ! 
he doesn’t believe I have a mental health problem but that I need to think and not be needy!!!
I then managed to  tip the roast chicken juice down my dress/ legs and ran upstairs distraught.

he came upstairs with some ice and comforted me, he was very loving . He said he wouldtry again at a very slow pacr. He’d stay at his mums but come over to visit.

so now I’m in this terrible cycle of hope versus fear.
Positive... he is being loving, and acting like normal. He’s taking some time out.

negative thoughts... I’ve been downgraded, he’d rather be at his parents, his ex wife lives near by and she’ll be gloating, he’s perfectly happy whilst I’m desperate for him to be here.
It’s agony knowing he’s 5 mins away.
I just want to be loving and let him be ... I don’t want him to be unhappy but yet I’m devastated he’s ok.
I’m driving myself crazy. 
I can’t stand it and having dark thoughts.
I’m so sorry for this long thread , I’m rambling ."

818,"Had a job interview today, the work consists of helping  folks with developmental issues as a direct care professional.  Sounds fancy, but it's just helping people.  I've never done this exact type of work before, I was a case manager at a rehab facility that housed veterans with societal issues, but for the most part they took care of themselves, this will be a lot more hands on, kind of scary.  Was asked why they should hire me, it took me a second, not used to selling myself, but I said that I wanted to be part of something outside of myself.  Not sure if that was the correct answer, but it was an honest one.  I'm in my head so much that I think that helping to take care of others will center me, bringing out the better part of me that has been emerging over the last five years.  I know it's corny, but it's my truth.  I am fairly isolated, people scare me, it takes me awhile to warm up.  In this job (if I get it) I will have the opportunity to be more open and trusting.  Just scared that I won't do well.  Sorry this is so long.

As always thank you for letting me post."
819,"Hello, I'm curious as to whether or not anyone else can relate to this predicament. 
This is where I think I'm at with regards to my condition:
Personality disorder 
Cluster 'B'
Borderline personality disorder 
Sub group ' self destructing. 
I wasn't aware of my condition until my mid-thirties. 
When I approached my doctors for help ,every time all they would do was have a look in their drug bible (mims) and just pull one out at random and tell me ""see how you get on with this""...
PROZAC-MIRTAZAPINE-SEROXAT-CITALOPRAM and a whole host of other ""snake-oils""..

Disillusioned with this and constantly feeling worse, usually accompanied by feeling nauseous and tired , with an added 'chemical hangover ', i became more hopeless. which accentuated my predicament in an obviously negative manner. 
Fast forward 10-15 years, I started to look into serotonin and dopamine levels- because I've used ""recreational drugs "" on and off, since about 8years old.
And apparently certain drugs I.e. cocaine and other's can actually Deplete the supplies of dopamine etc in your brain, so you 'run-out' of your feel good happy medicine. Permanently. 
Turns out I was barking up the wrong chemical trees , so to speak.
This is where an unlikely source of 'saviour has come into play ' 
Ladies and gentlemen, (accompanied by drum-rolls), let me introduce you to!:
GABAPENTINE (cheers,whistling and general hat tossing ensues from me !)
Yes I know this is a pharmacutical company brand name, and there are other pharmacological variants etc but I mention GABAPENTINE, as it's the one I tried.

Within less than an hour I felt transformed. 
I felt almost human. I remember saying out loud to my self "" so this is what normal feels like!"" In a state of shock and elation- then broke down in tears and cried,briefly. 
I think they were tears of joy. The normal route for me is a barrage of  persistent and relentless emotionally charged triggers that get me past the point of no return, then I crack, and bawl uncontrollably like a strung out toddler. 
So on the strength of my medical revelation I went to see my doctor. 
She was not even willing to hear me out. 
Her tone was patronising-stigmatic ( she told me 'they have a high street value') 
I didn't want to sell them-they were to make me better.
She also stated in these exact words 
""This is what I've never got about you Jason- you never seem to help yourself!""
This was her reply to my question about re-referal to the local drug and addiction centre.
I missed the original appointment due to mentally and physically at the time ,not being happy enough in my head to leave my house, let alone travelling a round trip of 10 miles on public transport, to said appointment. 
A rage kicked in and I said "" that was NOT the right thing to say to me!""
With that she started fidgeting under her desk, I'd obviously rattled her with my response and I left ,feeling worse than when I'd first entered with a hope of some positive outcome. 
I later thought back about the drug appointment and came to the conclusion that 
What she was ACTUALLY doing UNDER the desk was trying to locate the PANIC BUTTON. 
any thoughts or suggestions about this, preferably positive would be greatly appreciated.

820,I was supposed to have a video call with my therapist on Friday. I had several calendar reminders in my phone because I'm always worried I'll forget. The time of the appointment came and there was nothing. Obviously not a huge deal because she's busy. I sat at my computer for an hour and a half before I gave up. Usually if something comes up we'll text each other about rescheduling. I didn't get anything. I didn't ask her if there was a problem or if we needed to push the call back because I didn't want to bother her. I know it's her job to keep appointments but I'm so afraid of annoying anyone. I can't help but feel rejected. I have severe abandonment issues and the fact that someone who is paid to talk to me about my mental health ghosted me devastated me. It's there even hope for anyone actually choosing to spend time with me? I don't know what to do
821,"Hello, having to do a bit of (self) damage limitation by isolating my self from pretty much everyone, again for a bit 
Ten days so far.

Feeling toxic, so when I feel this way I sort of shut down everything else. 
Then I'm just left to over analysis my thoughts to an almost molecular level of  disection and depth. 
Which then makes it worse because I start to question my own sanity, my perceived mental state and the very real perceived perception of my bpd.

On top of that also knowing that the ""real world "" has some bearing, or say , as well. 
A tad baffling to say the least.

The crux is that strangers dogs have nearly pulled pulled their owners off a pavement or near a shop ,wagging it's tail and going out of its way ,literally just to say hello. No I am NOT delusional and I DON'T think I am Dr Doolittle."

823,"So for the past few days I've been down I don't know why I could have a trigger but I know what triggers I have, I woke up from a horrible dream and that seems to have triggered this but the 3 days I don't know why it won't stop I feel alone in all of this like no one understands me I've been feeling down and crying none stop it won't go away I can Distract myself as much as I like but I can't concentrate on anything right now I can't feel good or be happy I'm such a mess it's been happening more recently than before and it's affecting me big time my day to day life is just a big saddbess that won't stop only briefly when I'm distracted but I can't keep myself distracted forever I can't sit and watch TV I can't watch other things either like YouTube and stuff I don't know why it's really stressing me out and affecting my relationship and I'm so lost"
824,"I'm really struggling.

I have no value outside of my immediate family. My long-term partner makes it clear that she is sick of me. She is only still with me because she would really struggle financially to be on her own. Plus, I do everything with the house, sort out the bills etc, she has never shown an interest so has no idea. She could do it if she really had to but she would struggle.

She hasn't spoken to me all weekend and has been a complete bitch. She knows I can't cope with confrontation and falling out so she is stringing it out - that's the worse thing she can do for me and my mental health but she wants me to suffer. I couldn't even say what triggered it, not enough for this kind of treatment anyway.

I've been really upset about COVID these past few days. I'm struggling with how much people aren't adhering to the rules. Where I live is back in lockdown. I've been planning to have my niece overnight on Friday for weeks, redecorated her room and everything and now she can't come. If people just did what was asked then we wouldn't be in this position. I miss her so much. Plus, my mum is extremely vulnerable and hasn't been out since the 1st lockdown and her quality of life is affected by this. I just cannot get my head around people who won't stick to the rules. My partner told me this morning that me vocalising my anger is 'part of her problem' with me. She is sick of listening to me. In contrast, she constantly has a strong opinion about just about everything and I have to listen to her all the time.

We definitely have very different rules for what I can do and what she can do. She is very controlling and because we have a secret gay relationship, its hard to talk to others.

I've had enough. I feel worthless and I wish I could just disappear.

825,"Hey, I was just wondering about people's opinions on BDP and depression. I've got bad depression, two suicide attempts and self harm, with suspected bdp. Do they generally go together?"

827,"I’ve had Complex PTSD and Panic disorder since I was 12. When I was 19 I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder which made sense at first, I am impulsive and I have extreme mood swings. But I’ve never had an impulsive or depressive episode for more than a day because my mood fluctuates hourly, I can go from angry to sad to happy to anxious to relaxed in a matter of two hours. I also have extreme unaddressed abandonment issues, I am constantly worried that people will abandon me to a point where it someone moves away, it feels like they’re never going to talk to me again and I cut them off. I cut people off whenever I feel like they’re going to leave and it’s so hard for me to maintain friendships. I’ve also only had extremely abusive romantic relationships, almost like I’m constantly seeking chaos. I’ve been an addict and an over spender for as long as I can remember. I also have over the top reactions when I’m angry even about the smallest things. I’ll start verbal fights, break things and hit myself but it only leaves me feeling worse and more worried about being abandoned when people see me react that way. I’ve had a huge struggle with my self identity, I don’t know who I am and at times I completely depersonalize and dissociate and feel like an empty shell. I have fluctuating goals and dreams so it’s difficult for me to stay in college or keep a job. I feel absolutely worthless a lot of the time because I don’t exactly understand who I am or what I want. I’m not trying to self diagnose and many of these symptoms correlate with PTSD and bipolar, but a lot of bpd symptoms resonate with me and I think I need to seek a professional for a diagnosis"
828,"I am 30 years old, have been misdiagnosed in the past, but meet all 9 criteria as per the DSM for BPD. I have really been struggling as of late with interpersonal relationships, specifically with my fiancee, and with my family, whose abuse I think may have caused the Borderline. I guess I would start out asking how you were diagnosed and what the first steps you took to help were?"
829,"I wish I had that, but it is a lie. People only love you if they get something from you. Love is always selfish."
830,"I just moved and am basically starting fresh which is good, it gives me the chance to escape some old toxic relationships and focus on recovery.
I'm doing alright, and have made some new friends even.
But I 'm afraid to tell them the I have BPD because I tried to test them to sort of see what their response would be and mentioned someone with BPD I knew in my old town. One of them said that ""You shouldn't be friends with someone like that"" and I just laughed with everyone. like a dick.
But now I feel like I'm wearing a mask when we hang out, even though nothings changed I feel like a wall of glass has come up between me and my friends. 
I'm afraid to tell them because people hate people with BPD. 
should I just move on, abandon them before they abandon me (like my BP wants me to do)? or should I just tell them and if they leave me then never make friends again(like my BPD wants me to)? 
kill me."
831,"Yes I know this is random, but please bear with me on this one. 
From what I've ascertained to date is this...
In a nutshell BPD changed me physiologically as well as mentally. 
And maybe something extreme had happened to me. 
Which in effect shut me down,  in a forced shut down manner to protect the core hardware of my mind.
But...
When I was rebooted,  all previously stored emotional files had been deleted.
And the core system of my brain, had now changed and now it's BPD 2.0 in the driving seat. 
My point is,  I'm going through a hell of a time which I'm struggling with. Stress ,some say through certain hormones to do with stress in the first place, this is the thing that changes people. 
I'm thinking about the likelihood of getting a 2nd wave BPD emotional hardware wipe at the age of 50.and wether it will corrupt my inner sanctum operating system. So to speak. Any thoughts or possibly positive advice?"
832,"Hello.

From around the age of maybe 4 or 5 maybe even 6 I remember suddenly being traumatised by a harrowing, hyper real , reoccurring nightmare. 
Then another one, as potently dark and disturbing, with bells on-like it's twisted twin, joined the festivities. 
And they both took up residence. For years.
Could this have been my introduction to Mr BPD. 
Maybe it was part of the grand opening ceremony, in honour, of my parasitic co-host Mr BPD,   as an icebreaker of sorts to 'break me in 'gently,  
I have very very little in the way of memories of anything, like he put them ,my memories etc away somewhere, EITHER as a twisted safety feature, or punishment. 
Strange yes, plausible? Any thoughts or possibly positive advice.  Please."
833,"Well well well well well.... Last night I was creating too much expectatives to that person, but this mornin I decided to cancel the date 2 hours earlier, reasons?? Don't know.. I just do it. That person is bugged with me now.

Please tell me that is not a BPD behaviour. D:"
834,"I'm drowning internally and nothing I say ever makes a difference. I feel stupid for not knowing myself better, but how can I when I've done nothing good for anyone? I can't stand my voice because it makes my blood boil. I honestly hate myself because people end up agreeing with me. I'm an annoying, jealous, and naive human being. People can't stand me the same way I can't stand myself. Nothing good can happen to me now because I've done nothing but cause people problems. I don't deserve anything good in my life, I'm just meant to shunned and thrown away. I'm okay with that! If that's what I'm here on this planet for, so be it! I'll disappear and I'll make sure nobody hears from me again! I could care less if people want to know me because they'll regret that decision anyway. I don't care if I deprive myself because if that means people will be happier, then maybe it's for the better. That's why I don't want to make friends with people anymore because that's just being selfish. I was selfish with someone I dared call my ""best friend"" and I refuse to do it to someone else.

I don't care if my intentions seem ""innocent"" or ""benign"", I refuse to feed that part of my mind because I can't risk hurting another person again. I've only been remembered as that ""weird"" or ""annoying"" girl and it feels like a stain I can't get out. I'm sick and tired of being a nuisance to people, so I'll just disappear. I'll endure the loneliness that's my fate because it's the only thing I have left. If I remain silent, nobody can say anything. Therefore, I'm no longer a problem and I'm no longer remembered as that annoying girl I used to be."
835,"I dno if its the bpd or ptsd that does this is. But even when there isn't anything going wrong in my life it just feels there's this constant impending doom. I'm always on edge, always. I dont have a FP for the first time in my life I think that comes in to play, I just feel so alone and in danger, i worry about everything and anything, things that haven't even happened yet, ifs been causing me to dissociate bad, I'm literally loosing days to it. I just cant relax, doesn't matter what I do, I've tried healthy coping mechanisms, go a long walk, try do yoga etc, that makes my anxiety go through the roof, when I'm outside the derealisation is more obvious, even binge eating desserts and online shopping with money I don't have doesnt take off the edge I'm stressing the full time I'm stuffing my face and buying a dress I don't need cause I don't even go out whilst knowing and arguing with myself because I don't have money for more impulsive shopping sprees. My bodys just in total high alert and everything is suffering because of it, probably loose my job soon if I don't quit because of the random bursts of anger and fear they're just gonna sack me anyway, I'm not keeping on top of house work, I've neglected the few people who do check in on me leaving myself totally isolated even tho I don't want to be, i can't shut it off I'm at a loss."

838,"There is a sentence in this song which goes 
""And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad,
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had"".  For me, in this moment, I can empathize with this notion.  I feel empty, I'm doing things that I like to do, but feel very little joy.  When I think about dying it lifts me a bit, I know this is morbid, but the thought of not existing in my head anymore is enticing.  I'm not going to hurt myself, I still feel hope, but I haven't written anything in awhile, haven't wanted to, sometimes I'm selfish with my pain. I worry that if I let it out, I'll lose everything.  

As always thank you for letting me post."

842,"Trigger warning: self harm, suicide

Hey everyone, this is my first time posting here and I've decided to today because this is the second time I've lashed out at my family after three months in quarantine. My family members are all relatively chill; so chill to the point where we kind of poke fun at each other when we get upset. I used to cause the most trouble as a teenager so they make fun of me the most. Whenever I even roll my eyes at something someone says, they make a big deal about it as a way of poking fun and I'm usually okay with it. 

Since I began university, I feel my anxiety has significantly increased, and I actually have two exams to write next week. Because of this, I've mentioned to my family I need some time, I need to study, and I've explained all morning now that I can not join them outside to hang out because I need to study; the only thing that satisfies my anxiety is completing the thing I'm anxious about so I had to study.

I went to take a bath as a break and I asked my sister if she wanted to do a face mask with me. She came to me and asked if I wanted to go out with the family for a boat ride and at this point, I was feeling a bit like I was being unheard so that did hurt my feelings a bit but I kept it in (as I usually do), until I finally explained I truly can not go because I need to study. This came out more abruptly because at this point I felt very anxious that she was not listening to me, and when I did so, she put her hands up as a mocking ""I surrender motion"" and I felt extremely offended and upset that, again, I was being made fun of for having emotions.

I usually let it slide but this moment really affected how I felt so as she walked out I slammed the door on her and listened to her stomp away; in my mind, I think this was my ""big mood"" mind, she didn't care about how I felt and she was even being mad at me for being so anxious for my upcoming exams. 

I was hurt and called her a mean name before I went to take a bath. She is the closest family member to me and I felt hurt that I called her a mean name but I also felt hurt no one listens to me seriously. There's only so much of smiling after they make a joke or remaining silent when they make fun of things I do that I can take before I lash out again. The bath is a trigger for me because at my worst moments I have attempted to drown myself before snapping out of it. I had thoughts of self harm racing through my mind and I even took a cold shower to try to relieve the feeling of self harming again because I know I'd regret it. 

I don't know what to do. I came out of the bath and everyone had gone out on the boat.. like it didn't matter to them that I was upset as well. 

Maybe I'm being overdramatic. but honestly I'm not really sure. My mind still isn't cleared from how I felt about this situation (it just happened) and I think I just need someone to talk to right now.."
843,"when people online think you are well and happy
when although you may be a little happier
you still really struggle in life and relationships and everything x

 struggle

yes im funny and bubbly but im not just that
lots of the time still want to hurt myself and die and struggle so so badly with identity feelings of sadness emptiness and mood swings

i think 2 people in my life know who i truly am x"
844,"so this is kinda a vent/just in general i feel like i need advice or something .
Im so tired i dont even know if i can write this all because all I've been doing is crying and going through the stages of grief because my FP (Favorite person) just broke up with me (1/8/2020) . it's hard to say but I keep juggling between the stages (if you dont know what they are this is the order: 1) Denial 2) Anger 3) Bargaining 4) Depression 5) Acceptance ) and it's just tough because while I know its for the better, it's still so difficult to accept. I was with them for 1 year and 7 months, it was a LDR and we had so many plans together. I mailed them things and they mailed me things before too and planned to mail more and we even planned to visit each other. Not all of that is gone because we agreed to be friends and the way we saw it is ""we still love each other, we just fell out of love"" if that makes sense. We agreed to keep our distance for now because we need to both heal and work on ourselves with our past trauma and just ourselves in general. We left things on good terms but it still hurts. I really trusted him and gave him my all. I just cant help but feel pain when I know that he's still there. We've set boundaries (we plan to only talk on weekends and stuff to give each other space, etc) but I cant help but feel our relationship is just gone.I keep questioning if I'm still in the first stage or i'm passed that because I know I felt anger. When we called and talked, I realized in hindsight that in that hour phone call, i went through those stages but after that, Im still juggling it. I dont know how to feel, how to cope or what to do. I just feel lonely now. everything reminds me of him. I feel like i'll never get over it."

I can't have an opinion about nothing, , I'm just doing ...I don't know.. I'm just a guy with nothing to lose... I've lost all inside me even if by outside all looks good. Maybe because I'm more sensible than before dunno.............. I don't care what happens with me. Just I'm here for try to support people like you."
848,"I am so lucky to have my partner and a good friend however, I still feel lonely. My friend is so lovely that she has a lot of other friends. My partner is wonderful but he too has an active social life. I just struggle with feeling lonely. If I am not distracting myself constantly then I feel very alone. I am very bad at small talk or holding a conversation which does not help either."
849,"Not sure if this has anything to do with the bpd or not but ever since I was a little girl I've always put on a pedestal the idea of having a boyfriend. Like I've fantasised about it so many times and longed for the day for it to finally arrive. 

Anyway, it did. I had 2 relationships when I was in my teens that just kind of fizzled out- these were back to back. I knew that I was ready to leave the first one, however the idea of being single terrified me so much that I actually waited until I met someone else before leaving the first one. 
When I entered my twenties, I had my first real relationship. I was in love, me and this guy planned our future together, and I felt like I was finally happy. I was finally in that Fairytale romance that I'd idealised so much to myself over the years. I was completely obsessed with him (knowing about my bpd, I tried not to be so consumed with him, but he just made me so happy). 
Fast forward two years later, and he cheated on me. My whole world came crumbling down. It just didn't fit with the story. How could he cheat on me when we were going to spend the rest of our lives together? 
However, after a messy breakup (where I ended up being the one begging him to try and give things another go, that was a real low) I am now single, and I have been for over a year. 
At first, I full on freaked out, but I consoled myself by saying that I'd soon meet someone else. However it's now been a year and I just haven't met anyone who I'm interested in. 
I'm starting to panic again. I used to be quite positive about finding someone, and had more good days than bad. But now they're all bad. I go through states of depression where I just think what's the point in all this, to states of anxiety where I think it's now been 'x' days since I've been single and I still haven't found anyone. 
I think this codv19 pandemic has made everything so much worse because I'm thinking 'if we're in lockdown for''x' amount of months then this means for certain that I won't meet a partner for this whole time' and that makes me panic even more. 
My whole life really is consumed around finding a boyfriend and I can't think of anything else. I've tried making a life for myself outside of a romantic relationship but I'm just so fed up. I just feel like it really isn't fair
Why is it that the one thing I desire more than anything else I can't have? I'm only 22,but I want to be married already. All around me my friends are getting engaged and it's becoming harder and harder to act happy for them when I'm so bitter and jealous. 
Anyway, this post is getting a bit rambling but maybe I'm hoping that some of you will understand my obsession around being in a relationship? I've just been rejected by a boy who was literally my last chance of finding someone (he'd shown interest in the past) he was messaging me for a while and has just started ignoring me. 
I feel really really low today and I can't bring myself out. Like what's the point in life if its going to be like this forever. I highly doubt I'm going to find anyone again. I'm so specific with what I like and then the only boys that I am into (about 2 % of the population) are either in relationships or are just fuckboys who wanna mess me around. 
Any supportive words would be nice right now, I've been stuck in a really dark place all day."
850,"So... I've come to realise that one of my main problems is that I am hypersensitive to any perceived criticism in my work-place. I generally don't have this problem much anymore in my home life but I will constantly seek out acceptance, praise and reassurance that I am doing a good job ALL of the time. Over the past few months this has worsened as I went from a job I was proficient in to a job I have not really done before. I was highly respected in my last position, getting rave reviews and winning awards. To go from that to working with hyper-efficient people who have been doing the job years has kicked the crap out of me!

My new colleagues are supervisors are not the praise types. They do praise and validate but its never quite enough. I find myself constantly asking if its good enough and I can tell they are getting a little tired of reassuring me. I can see why! Every day I ask if its ""been done ok"" and the time they spent reassuring me means they can't get their work done. I work in an environment where you shouldn't need constant praise - its a highly professional environment and everyone expects you to do the job without much fuss (I am ONLY doing what everyone else is doing, nothing over and beyond the call of duty). 

Does anyone else have this? I have been trying my hardest to ask ""do you need to ask if its ok today?"" and I have a stop sign on my laptop to prompt me to stop, think, take a moment, reflect on WHY I am asking and to take the effective position. I don't NEED to be told it is ok but I have this massive complex about being ""perfect"" and this leads to anxiety.

Thoughts would be welcome! Anything that can help me move through this. I will try anything! 
Please don't tell me it's okay to ask and get reassurance! That is a fast-track to reliance on others for self-esteem and that's not cool IMO!"

852,"So, I was diagnosed with BPD in 2010 was put on a waiting list for DBT (never heard anything)  and then somehow went into complete denial.......totally forgot that I had even been diagnosed, just took meds for anxiety and jogged along for the last ten years until two weeks ago out of the blue received a text from Talkworks the local CBT facility asking if I was coping ok or would like someone to talk to.
So, as I am going through a really rough period I answered the text and received a prompt appointment for assessment.
It was during that assessment that the therapist told me that I had a working diagnosis for BPD. Wham! A grenade went off in my world when my denial came unravelled and now i'm having to come to terms with it.  No hiding from the truth, it will get you eventually!
I've been referred for another assessment and apparently if confirmed and accepted there's a possibility of DBT which I sooooo don't want.
I just want my denial back.  I don't want to have this disorder.  
I'm in an intense LDR with a guy in the US - nearly 2 years now - and he has mental health problems, serious depression (Bipolar) and is suicidal so i'm trying to support him through that as well as cope with my own stuff. 
I have no friends, don't want to tell my family of my diagnosis, so here I am posting on a forum.
Any thoughts please guys, i'm really struggling here"
853,"Hey all,

I have lived in fear of my partners suicidality and I think enough is enough. We've hurt each other a lot. I've hurt them a lot. But lately there's a huge crisis causing them to feel suicidal. I don't know how to navigate asking for divorce. 

I sometimes don't know who I'm with. The partner that loves me or the one that hates me. I'm sure it's the one that loves me but this is all too much; sometimes I feel like for their sake they need to leave me. Find someone who will love them better. It needs to happen. I can't give them what they need. 

Regardless I don't know how to ask for a divorce. Especially without constantly worrying about their suicidality."
854,"I'm taking the bus in the dark, there is no horizon or peripheral existence everything is very claustrophobic feeling and all I can see is the ground in front of me.

I keep grinding my teeth and they feel so weak and dry that I can feel myself grinding them away and making the top ones loose. I try to stop grinding but I keep catching myself grinding again.

And then one crumbles in my mouth and I spit the pieces out into my palm and I know I should throw them out the window of the bus but I can't so i keep them in my palm, I dont want anyone to see it. In my mouth i can feel my teeth at the roof of my mouth loosening and the gum retracting more.

When I woke up the first thing I did was check my mouth for teeth and I was surprised they were there! That's how realistic it was."

My job disappeared when COVID hit - I'm extremely lucky that I still have a job and work from home but I have no role anymore so I add no value. My mental health is awful and my manager is doing her best to protect me from being put into a post that will tip me over the edge (and again, I'm very grateful) but I feel so useless, I add no value. If I disappeared it wouldn't matter.

I have issues with my partner and she is great at belittling me, telling me I don't have mental health issues when she knows I have. We've been together over 25 years and I wasn't well when we met. She is really understanding of others with depression, great listener and very fast to support but with me there is nothing. I think she likes the fact that my self esteem is so non-existent that she can easily bully me into doing what she wants. 

I was bullied throughout school and college and now as an adult - there is clearly something wrong with me to attract these kind of people and to give them a reason to bully me.

I want to hurt myself - it will stop my head for a while and I deserve to be punished.

I've just had enough of being a nothing

857,"I have such an awful time with handling changes, and I am currently going through two huge life changes. Beginning next Monday, I will be starting a new job, and in the middle of September my husband and I will be moving into our new house. I want to be excited for these things, but truthfully I am terrified. I worry of the worst happening - my job not working out, and things going horribly wrong with the house (it needs a lot of TLC). Thinking about these things should spark happiness in me, but instead it triggers my anxiety. I wish I could share the good feelings my husband has over all of this - it makes me feel awful having such negative thoughts when he is so positive..."

861,"So starting in adolescence I had severe emotional disturbances including mood-swings, self harming, inventory confusion, and substance abuse. Eventually I became addicted to hard drugs and would have frequent turbulent relationships as well as meaningless sex with strangers. That all changed after I got pregnant. I got sober and totally changed overnight more or less. This change happened when I was about 25-26 so was I just bound to naturally outgrow these behaviors? Was I just going through a rough patch that happened to last over a decade? Or was this just the effect of many treatment centers jails and life experiences leading me to become more self-aware? Or could pregnancy have some kind of calming effect on some BPD’s? I think the opposite is also often true. I’ve also staved off most friendships and relationships for the last 3 years and focused on self-improvement and family. I think I was always more of an introvert and a loner even as a child. To some degree, trying to socialize myself into normalcy led me to use and drink and drove me Insane. Maybe I’m better because I am simply being true to myself now. Am I just a disaster waiting to happen once I get back into the world? Also weird is that I’ve had 4-5 drinks Over the past 2 years and have not relapsed Even though I used to fit the criteria for alcoholism. My mom has and has traits for BPD and my dad has some traits for NPD. could some of my troubles just have been learned behaviors picked up from my parents which changed when I gained The self-awareness That naturally comes with growing up? Im 29 now. I’m far from completely healed. Sometimes I still get upset over fairly small slights but I almost never lose my temper anymore or have any other over-the-top reactions to things. I’m super steadfast and almost never make impulsive decisions except for the occasional small amazon purchase. Etc. etc. I am barely recognizable to the person I used to be. How can this be?"

864,"Hi, 

can anyone else relate to this?? 

when i feel depressed or sad or empty, or any sort of negative emotion, i feel so guilty. my emotions have no rhyme or reason and the effect it causes to others around me makes me feel so guilty. 

i spend my life paranoid i’ve ruined the day or that i’m a lesser person as my moods change and can be quite intense for those around me. 

i just think, what’s the point?? i send myself into a downward spiral by feeling bad about feeling bad, which ultimately causes more negative feelings."
865,"I am currently being treated for depression and anxiety (meds and therapy).

Whilst I do admit that I have suffered from poor mental health for most of my life, I'm beginning to discover that the relationship with my partner, of 12+ years, could be one of the major contributing factors to my poor mental health.

I wanted to ask about something quite specific about my partner and find out if anyone has had experience of this:

My partner is extremely defensive, even with the smallest of things... So, whenever we have and argument, or even just a chat, she will go into full defensive mode, deny everything, and more noticeably deflect. For example, if I was questioning her about something, she would never admit responsibility for something she did. 
Rather than just admit to it, talk it over and move on... she will deflect - focusing the argument on something completely unrelated i.e. she would say ""don't raise your voice with me, I can't believe your speaking to me like this!, stop talking to me like this!, why would you think that of me?, is there anything you actually like about me??""... and many more... ultimately trying to make me feel bad for even asking her. 
She would say these really outlandish comments that are totally unnecessary and unrelated, all focussed towards deflecting.

Accepting responsibility or ownership doesn't enter my partners head.

So, over time, all of these issues that we have failed to reach a solution/agreement on, go unresolved - which puts a lot of strain on our relationship.

Has anyone had experience of this?? Is this just a personality trait or does my partner have a personality disorder??

Additional points: 
My partner doesnt have much empathy, is very cold and doesn't (or has difficulty) expressing feelings of love or affection."
866,"Recently I am hitting a new low as stuff from past comes up in therapy. My depression has been creeping back in a huge wave. Basically my session I had on Thursday was super triggering because my therapist told me pretty bluntly at the end of the session that one relationship I had was continual ""r"", she used the r word - yes you know the one. For me I hate that word and I didn't consider what I had gone through to be repeated ""r"" I just knew it wasn't healthy and yeah, it was really abusive. I think people know that ""r"" is a huge thing and effects people quite greatly so to know that you have been through that and just be told it quite up front was kind of intense.... I am struggling to deal with both my mother's experiences of sex abuse (it upsets her to this day and has contributed to her alcoholism) and her own negative experiences with the men of this world, and my own experiences of sexual assault at the hands of not one, but many men.

I am also struggling with the fact I have never been able to sustain any kind of positive romantic or sexual relationship, despite now being 27. My first ""love"" (funny to call it love) ripped my heart out and treated me badly, and didn't care about it either. I have only ever had dysfunctional interactions and talking about it with my therapist, in a romantic way, I do not trust any single man or woman in the romantic sense. I have had huge trust and intimacy issues and can't just enjoy myself and flirt like normal people do, instead I have got a massive wall up when people come onto me. I feel angry this shit has happened to me, especially when I know of other people in long happy relationships, or the people I see walking down the streets hand in hand, is like a stabbing pain every time. To me that whole thing is shit.

That aside, I am having huge issues around my appearance. It has got to the point where it is everything about me. Even the things I am getting fixed. For example, I am having my teeth aligned currently but it is a slow process and they will not be fully in place until a number of months time, so I am concerned that when I smile at people my teeth look horrendous. I also believe my teeth are quite yellow, and I am not allowed to whiten them currently by my dentists. I am getting a skin treatment accutane, which is a tablet that makes your skin better as I have some acne, sometimes the breakouts can get really bad. I hope this will cure my acne but I am so anxious that it gets sorted and apparently the acne can get worse before it gets better so I am terrified of leaving the house and having to go to work and people will see me with this bad skin. I wear make up every day and cover over the spots but often you can still see the spots through the make up. I cannot leave the house without covering the make up because of comments that have been deeply hurtful to me about the acne that I have heard in the past.  I am also concerned that my hair looks frayed and damaged and dry and it is thinned out due to hormone problems I have. I also have the acne due to my hormone problems in my body. Accutane is the only thing that might work to treat it so I hope it is going to help. I also believe I have a fat face and not enough cheekbones and am obsessing over this, wishing I was skinnier so more cheekbones could show. I think my whole face looks terrible and I am terrified to show it to people every day at work. I feel I am very ugly and this fear is now gripping me. Recently a guy looked into my eyes but just when he looked into my eyes, suddenly I saw a flash image of my own face looking like a scary monster, it was almost like a hallucination. I am getting deeply deeply insecure about even leaving the house and having to show my face to the world, I know this sounds so so vain and I hate myself for writing it, but for me there is nothing worse than people having to look at me. I honestly wish I could just hide myself from the world.

To be honest right now I am feeling like I just want to hide myself from the world and die.

I am so grateful that I have good friends in my life and a caring brother and there are people on this forum who I know care about me and are amazing supportive people, I don't really want to have to burden others with my problems, but I can feel the depression gripping me, and the anxiety too. And it's all telling me I would be better off out of this world, that I am not going to be strong enough to fight anymore.

Every day I am fighting so fucking hard by going to work but honestly I am losing my faith. Listening to sad music reaches me so much more deeply now it's like it's really chiming in with my soul and I can just feel so much death within. It's like the death of all good things, all I know is fear and mistrust right now.

I am so fucking scared of all this shit. I am so confused. I am feeling like a little child in the world.

As a side note this depression is not alcohol or medication related, as I have been religiously taking my anti depressant tablets and not taking alcohol or drugs for a long time now."
867,"I've been very aware that one of BPD sufferers biggest stigma is being perceived as manipulative but is it true manipulation?

Manipulation requires forethought and planning but BPD prohibits this by making a sufferer jump between extremes uncontrollably. Behaviours like lashing out are very in the moment are mostly about getting out the overwhelming feeling and not an planned attempt to change the way someone is perceiving you or behaving toward through a chosen behaviour modulation. 

I'm  not saying that scenario isnt harmful in and of itself or that people with BPD cant be manipulative I just am suggesting many times they get called manipulative when they are in my opinion unable to systemically plan that, their intentions are not to manipulate but to relieve the emotional strain they're under in that moment.

Your thoughts?"
868,"I find that often splitting is framed as the borderline person projecting onto the other person, as though they were the subject of our resentment. I don't think that's always true, though.

On the contrary, I feel as though I'm looking for evidence that I, personally, do not deserve the love or care of my friends. I feel such intense emotions towards my friends that I can easily despair about them never being able to reciprocate it. I don't tend to handle teasing well, even if good-natured, because I don't feel that I'm ever in the zone of trust where I could take and deal 'ribbing' without having second thoughts or overanalyzing it.

This turns into not wanting to engage with the person, feeling exhausted to respond to them; be around them. I turn listless and indifferent because of the emotion overload I'm getting from just loving my friend so intensely. On the other hand, any negative attention can and will be used as proof, by me, that I've been expecting too much back, which will cause me to shut down. This is like, the main way I manage to ruin my relationships.

All in all, though, I guess my point is that resentment isn't always about the other person. At least not for me. Anyone else feel the same way? I know we face a lot of stigma because of the perceived 'silent treatment' some of us are prone to, because people get insecure about what they might have done wrong. I don't really find that I blame the other person for what I'm personally feeling, though, despite being pretty confrontational at times. Would it help to clarify that 'it's not you, it's me' sometimes?"
869,"I had a friend I've written about on here before. He was my only friend and now he's no longer my friend. I'm still trying to process what happened. He started telling me I was his very good friend and that he'd always be there for me after only a week or two of knowing him. He told me he loved me (supposedly all his good friends say that to each other). He started sending me heart emojis and cute teddy bear gifs (we both identify as bears within the gay community). I got sucked right in. 

We had sex and it was the best I've ever had in my life. I'd never made out or had close body contact with a man before and it just felt so right. I wanted a repeat soon and kept hitting on him. Sometimes he'd encourage me and sometimes not. He said something one day and I had to draw out of him that he wanted me to stop hitting on him. I felt rejected and became enraged. Why was I so angry? I'd already started to see certain behaviors and codependencies with him like I had with my wife. For the last 5-10 years of our marriage she'd encourage me and then not actually have sex with me. I got really angry and dumped years of rage at my wife on him. He peaced out at that point and I don't really blame him. Except I had somehow built up in my mind that we had a relationship that could withstand something like that. What happened to I'll always be your friend?

Questions swirling in my mind. Why did he love bomb me like that? What was his game? Why didn't I see all the red flags? Was I so desperate for love and validation that I just ignored them? Was he ever really my friend at all? Why did I build up in my mind that we had a close relationship? Why am I repeatedly drawn to the same kind of codependent relationships?

The thing is, he was a really nice guy and I miss him."
870,"I have been numb for almost a year now and I'm so sick of it. It feels like I'm hollow, like im empty. I know what caused it. In 2019 I was sectioned into my first adult hospital until September the same year. The whole experience was so traumatic for me. Every day something awful would happen on the ward. 

I got into my first ever fight, was asked for sex loads from other men triple my age, almost succeeded with my suicide attempts, got put into seclusion in the intensive psychiatric care ward, escaped for a day and had police hunting me down, had patients trying to kill themselves in front of me, had patients begging me to kill them. It was horrendous.

I know the cause of the numbness, but I have no idea how to get back to normal for me. Numbness to me is the worst feeling a person can feeling. I'm just hoping someone on this forum has gone through the same and managed to solve it. I really need help with this or I will end up committing suicide. I attempted last week and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. 

Thanks for any replies."
871,"I have an investigative mind, so I tend to observe changes in my personal life. Lately, I've been going through old social media accounts of mine and I've noticed how difficult living undiagnosed actually was. I remember constantly seeking attention and blindly accepting friendships with people who weren't actually my friends. It's sad to think how much I was hurting back then and leaned towards codependency. These days, I'm quite opposite to my younger self and have accepted that I only sought out those things because I was insecure. Now, I appreciate having time to myself and frequently go on early morning walks to help me relieve tension from the night before. I bet many of you have gone through transformations in your life leading up to the person you are today, it has got to be one of the best feelings I've ever experienced. Of course, there's still minor imperfections like the occasional complaint or opinion nobody asked for but besides that, I'm grateful. I've had self-esteem issues in the past that had affected the way I dealt with close friends and even family. There was this need to fit in and to be liked by everyone which today I know isn't realistic. I had an unhealthy obsession with making friends, to the point where it ended a friendship I had for nearly 8 years. I learned that being a friend means being present and knowing that your friend also has a life. I basically crippled him by acting jealous when he met new friends outside our friendship. What it taught me is that I need to be my own best friend first and that if I want to be heard, I need to be a good listener as well.

BPD can cause a lot of power dynamics, as well as unhealthy boundaries. Crap hit the fan when I lost a close friend of mine and since last year, I've been in constant reflection. I believe that he didn't talk to me for months prior to our falling out because I was an emotional vampire. He would talk about his life, but then I would make it all about me. There was no mutuality between us in conversations, after my junior year of high school, we talked less and less. I was insecure and seeing my friend thriving and meeting new people only made me feel more inferior. After my senior year, I'd go weeks without speaking with my friend. After we met up for crystal convention, we stopped talking completely because he said ""I need to focus on school, talk to you in May"". Which now looking back, I knew it was actually an excuse because I didn't hear from him in May. In June, we finally broke it off and he tweeted that I was ""toxic"" which broke me. Since then, I've grown as a person and reevaluated my actions and beliefs. I have since gone to therapy and now I feel better knowing I'm finally on the right track. I'm thinking of writing an apology letter to my friend, but I'm not going send it because it's for my own closure."
872,"So I have always had an issue with becoming too attached too soon when dating. After meeting someone that I like its hard... no, its impossible to ""take it slow"" and just let things develop. Instead I get myself emotionally involved and expect way too much then get angry and hurt when the feelings arent mutual or they arent ready to give as much as I need. In the end I am left alone and heartbroken.  I do not know how to prevent getting attached which would prevent the entire situation. 
 I also dont know how to determine if my expectations are reasonable or not. To me, most of the things I expect are just common courtesy things but Ive been told they are too much. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"
873,"Men just want to sleep with me, I almost never meet anyone who wants a genuine relationship with me, even though I am a good person, this just makes me fee so much worse about myself. It heightens my fear of abandomment and overall distrust of men. Which stemmed from sexual abuse as a child. I have been independent pretty much my whole life, but it does get lonely.
Even men online just seem to want sex with me and it's why I uninstall and delete dating apps very quciky. I don't think I will use them ever again. I don't use social media, just YouTube, so that won't be difficult"
874,"Hi, 
my name is Kristina and i'm nearly 47 years old from Germany... I suffer from bpd and depression... If it's possible i'm looking for people I can talk to about the daily problems and can work on my English... Lol..."
875,"i wonder if other people feel the same as I do. 

 I have been really careful during lockdown, I get to see my nephew for the first time in 4 months and his mother (my brothers wife) let me hold him, i was wearing a face mask and then gave him back to her when he started crying.  

Later I got closer to him when he had stopped crying, i was still wearing a face mask and I said can have another hold of him if he doesn't cry and she said no, we don't want people to hold him.  (I was still wearing a mask) this make me feel like i am hated and not wanted and worthless.

Does anyone else feel like this sometimes and what makes you feel this way."
876,"I'm reasonably sure I'm not the only one of us who has been told they're partners are walking on eggshells around them. Mine has mentioned it several times over the last few months. Since my mind really started deteriorating. 

Funny thing is, I feel the same around him. I feel like any little or big thing I do wrong, and he's heading for the hills. My emotional episodes have proven very straining on our relationship. To the both of us.

I'm in a semi-lucid place right now. Last few hours, about 5, have been very draining and tormenting. I'm kinda proud of myself. I distracted myself for as long as I could. Then went for a walk, ending up by the river. 

I'm a water baby. Water is soothing. Calms my mind and relaxes me. Luckily, we live about 4 blocks from the river. So it's pretty quick and painless for me to walk down and sit under the overpass. Watch the water roll over the dam. Watch the ripples. 

Speaking of ripples. I was at the water a few days ago. I was really focused on the ripples. The partner and I have spoken often about the butterfly effect. At the water that day, I really focused on that once I began to watch the water and ripples. 

A violent, yet not vicious event (water coming over the dam) causes a splash. The splash begins the ripple effect. As the ripples spread out, they get bigger and come faster and faster. But what really hit me, as I watched...The ripples eventually slow, until the water is calm again. 

I created an analogy between those ripples and dealing with my BPD, and the effects it has on every facet of my life. Something drops into the water of my mind. Could be anything, good, bad or neither. It starts the ripple effect. Right now, I have little control over my mind and emotions, so the ripples get bigger and faster. 

Right now, I would say I'm smack dab in the middle. Where the ripples are biggest and moving the fastest. After studying the water, and seeing how the ripples eventually smooth out, I have hope. Slim, and barely visible. But it's there. 

Onto the burdens part of my post. 

I feel like a massive burden to my partner. We do live together, have for over a year now. It's been in the last 3 months that things have gone to hell in a hand-basket. Certain events, which I'm not ready to discuss yet, occurred. Things were revealed to me that shook me to my core. 

Ever since then, I've been an emotional disaster. I feel like I have become an emotional burden on my partner. He is dealing with some deeply personal issues right now, and the last thing I want to do is add to them with my problems. 

He and I have always, for 30+ years, shared a deeply intimate connection. I don't mean sex. Something deeper. More intense. We've been best friends. Telling each other things no other living soul knows. 

Ever since these issues were brought into the open, I feel like I have become extremely dependent on him. Emotionally primarily, but also in other aspects. I feel like I need his time and presence more than I have any other relationship I've been in. 

I am very insecure, and constantly seek reassurance and approval from him that I'm not doing anything wrong. And that we're ok. Unfortunately, due to accusations I made against him on Friday, we are not ok. 

I am trying different ways to calm my mind when I feel myself becoming emotional or needy of him. My best coping mechanism is coloring mandalas. There are times, though, that even that doesn't stop the influx of doubts. 

See, I want to believe what he says. But there's a voice that shoots holes in everything he tells me. Makes me question his every word. Makes me tremble, thinking of who he is talking to. Where he really is when he leaves the house. 

When the doubts come in, that's when I feel most like a burden. Because I lean heavily on him. For support and truth. For reassurance. I pester and nag until he finally explodes. 

Any suggestions on how to deal with this? I have my first appointment in a year with a therapist on Friday. That will be the true beginning to recovery. I'm going to demand wholesale med changes. I did research the other night. I'm at max dosage on 2 meds, and exceed max dosage on another. Clearly they've lost effectiveness. 

Hope I didn't ramble too long and make anyone fall asleep."
877,"It's been a bit since my last update from all the stuff. Long story short it was this big ass circle I feel I've made no improvement, I ended up back home - apparently suffering is quantifiable and other people need resources more than me which makes sense but also am I supposed to be full on raped before they'll help? Cuz thats a stupid system. 

I lock every door behind me and it's not a secret and everyone knows they just dont know what to do about it. I've been trying not to become depressed and spend alot of time outside in the sun and enjoy the rest of the summer I am unemployed and finding work has been rough but may as well enjoy the nice weather.

I applied for a living grant program so atleast whilst I'm finishing my a degree this year I'll have some income.

 I dont know what else to say other than I'm trying."
878,"I do not know if there is any point in writing this really but I will give it a go. Recently my mum has come back into my life. She texts me once a week making small talk. Whenever I bring up anything to do with my mental health she changes the subject. Today she was telling me how happy her grandchildren make her. It really hurt me because she was never happy with me when I was little. I told her I am sorry I never made her happy as a child. She said I did and she has nice memories of me. I was surprised I said I never thought she would think that. I explained how I felt she never card because she ignored my suicide attempts. She said she did not know I made any. I reminded her and she had forgotten. I am so hurt she forgot something like that. I told her it hurts me she ignored my self harm and suicide attempts. She said she did not ignore it as she took me out of school. I said, that was nice but nothing was ever done or mentioned. She kept trying to stop me and say we should move on. I explained I cannot just forget the past as it has caused me to be unwell. Anyway, now I am hurt she forgot I made 3 suicide attempts when I was 12. I am also hurt she will not acknowledge my pain or her role in it. I have been crying a lot and feel drained. I feel so unworthy. All my life I have been ignored and dismissed and it hurts. If I try and talk about how I feel I am told I am wrong. 

I am sorry for this post and I do not expect any replies. I think I am just lost and confused."
879,"It feels like I have just realised how much my unstable mental health has affected me. I feel like I’ve been robbed of a normal life for so long and I don’t know if I ever will have the things is desire, like a stable job, marriage and children. I am so tired and so so sad. It feels like there is no way out."
880,"Hey all,
A year ago I told my wife I found her unattractive. We determined that it was resentment that caused me to feel that way, but I often doubt that and think maybe it was her weight gain.

This has given her body image issues and even made her suicidal at times.

Now when she asks I tell her it was resentment, and when I express any doubt she starts digging heavily.

Tonight I told her I might have felt that way because of fat phobia I don’t know how to be certain. And she got triggered and attempted suicide.

What do I do? Do I stop asking myself if it was only resentment and assure her it was just resentment? Do I tell her I’m unsure and have her lose it because “you thought I was ugly”.

Whatever the issue was, I feel that the way I viewed bodies a year ago was less mature than I view them now. We could get into the way I feel but I need  help. I can’t believe she attempted suicide! I am so dumb I didn’t see it coming. suffice to say I feel very shocked and scared.

I could promise her it will never happen again and repress all these feelings but I tried that and it felt like I was living a lie.

I even thought that maybe this is an impasse and we should break up, which is just unfortunate but maybe I don’t deserve her.

At the same time I am terrified she’ll hurt herself if we split up."
881,"Don't. 
If you ""want to understand"" ask your ex.
If someone doesn't want to be with you does not equal a PD, someone you think is a ""bad"" person or has ""bad"" behaviour does not equal a PD. If you NEED to know ask them. 
Stop using mental illness as a label to slap on an old relationship partner that didnt work. 

Go to therapy please."
882,"Can I ask this here? I'm not concerned with whether something counts as a 'BPD' stereotype or not. I just would like to improve my understanding of these relational issues. I would say this is part of my pattern that plays out with me with people. Not in any dramatic way, just low key confusing for people.

I'm not sure whether differences between male and female styles, for want of better terms, might play into it.

If the cycle starts with idealisation, it would seem that's the thing to nip in the bud first? But like for me I think it developed as part of a whole world view in adolescence. But yet I have uncovered a lot of that and I know it's out of synch etc, but yet I still can't stop it happening in the moments.

For me it's not about idealising particular people, due to some valued aspect of them, it's like a whole way of relating to society and power and things. Can anyone relate to that or is that different?

I do actually believe role-play may be part of an answer, like to keep repeating these patterns in a safe way, triggering the feelings but working to change that. But that's been difficult to do consistently logistically - ironically because the pattern plays out with the people doing it, around it.

But is idealisation (whatever exactly is meant by that) the first thing? Or does something else cause that - like what?

Also how does this relate to religions which promote idealising people?"
883,"Hi. 
I’m new here. I’ve been reading some the posts to understand things and I greatly appreciate the time people take here. 
my situation is a little different and I hope I am not at the wrong place. If so I do humbly apologize and would happy to move this to anyplace you feel is better.

I don't have bpd, but am very strongly convinced that my former partner had the quiet variant of this.  She suddenly cut me out of her life in a manner similar to splitting over a somewhat stressful but not devistating emotional issue.  The suddenness , my perception of lack of empathy and forgiveness tore me apart. I my own councelling I described my relationship and my therapist immediately pointed me this potential diagnosis.
To be clear. She has not to my knowledge been formally diagnosed. But as I look back. As I explained our relationship (which is a complicated one) my counceller was very convinced.  I started reading both about the disorder and from former partners and they all seem to be telling parts and parcel of my story. 
I cannot be sure since this is all my perspective. But it matches too too well. 
I don’t know if this is the right place to share my story and seek advice. I hoped to hear from people who have it. To see how they view the situation so I can better understand how she might be feeli my and processing. 
we are over. But I’m having a hard time processing is all.
Thank you so very much for the time and if this is the right place.
Will respond when I hear from members.
Again. Humbly appreciate the assistance."
884,"My mind is in such utter and complete chaos right now, I can't even figure out a title to this post. I am going to try and be as coherent as I can be, but I jump around and segue almost every other sentence.

The environment that quickly allowed BPD to set in began extremely early in my life. I've read that trauma, such as abandonment and abuse, are typical of triggers that identify the onset of BPD.

My biological mother was 19 when I was born. She and my dad were married. Within 1-2 years, they divorced. I will never know the truth as to why. My dad began seeing someone at some point who would eventually become my step mother. 

By the time I was 6, my biological mom disappeared from my life. She signed over all parental rights due to her belief that my new step mother would be able to give me a better life. 

Long story short, my step mother began abusing me before my biological mom was gone. Burns from curling irons on my back were commonplace occurrences according to what I learned from biological life many years later. 

Through out my early childhood development, the abuse was non stop. Physical, mental and emotional. It happened anytime, for any reason. It continued until I was roughly 15 years old. 

During these years and abuse, even as young as 10 years old I became suicidal. When fervent prayers for the abuse to end went unanswered by God, I began hating him. My belief that I am not worth anyone's time, understand and affection began when even God turned his back on me, and continues to this moment as I type. 

Growing up, there were 2 family members that showed me pure, unconditional love. My aunt and grandmother. Up until roughly 6 months ago, my dad was in that category as well. I thought he was my hero as a child. That delusion has since shattered. And left me in even more emotional turmoil. I feel that if my dad, the one person who claims he loved me, didn't care enough to protect me, then why would anyone ever care about me? 

As I grew up, my mind was constantly on alert for when someone would let me down. Hurt me. Leave me. Break the trust I put in them. 

I believe that in order for someone to love me, I can't be me. Because the real me is broken and incomplete. The real me is flawed and disgusting. The real me is unworthy of honest love and not worth being understood. The real me is not worth compassion or effort. 

Every intimate and romantic relationship I have ever been in, I have ended and walked away from. That way, they couldn't have the chance to leave me. That way, my beliefs of being completely unwanted weren't validated yet again. 

I also deal with severe paranoia, bipolar 1 and anxiety. The more I research and learn about Borderline, the more the symptoms and my behaviors make sense. It is a very slight relief to know I'm not just fucked in the head and alone. At the same time, I have no grasp on understanding why therapy, 6 inpatient hospital stays in 3 years, and my meds have done nothing to alleviate symptoms, engender healing or help me control my emotions. 

Meds, I've been on several. Always searching for the right cocktail. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 6-7 years old. Between 2011 and 2014, I was hospitalized 6 times. 3 for suicidal ideation and 3 for suicide attempts. The only benefit since 2011, I was paired with an excellent psychiatrist. He didn't mock me. He listened to me. Took my thoughts and feelings as valid, if uncontrollable. We went through med after med, always searching for one that would help. 

Therapy has been a different story. I make progress, then self sabotage. As my partner says, I take 2 steps forward and 1 back. And he sees it that I'm doing it on purpose. And he's very very right. 

I live my life in black and white. Yes or no, maybe isn't an answer. Fear of the unknown paralyzes me. Because in that middle ground, means being vulnerable to being let down. Being abandoned. It means my beliefs that I am not worthy of anything from anyone being proven again and again. My partner calls it being afraid of success. In a way, he's right. I have lived as a failure for my entire life, I don't believe being a success at anything is possible. I don't believe I am wanted or loved. Surface or superficial care and ""love"", sure. I feel more that I am needed. And when I'm done being useful and fulfill the need the other person has of me, they always walk away. These beliefs have been validated all my life. 

Even now. I've been told I'm not worth helping. I went to the hospital yesterday, begging for help. I went because I did not want to get to the point of being suicidal. Even they turned me away. 

I have been with my partner for 14 months. Our affection for each other goes back over 30 years. We simply weren't able or ready to be together. And we were both young. Through out those 30+ years though, he has been my biggest fan. He was my #1 protector and supporter. He never abandoned me or found me unworthy. He is, and always has been, My Person. 

Our current relationship began really well. Laughing, enjoying each others time, affection and company. It was amazing. I felt truly loved and accepted, for the first time. 

My biological mom passed away November 2018. She left me an ample inheritance. It was finished in probate May 2019 and disbursement was made in June 2019. 

I told myself I would be responsible with it. I wouldn't waste it. I would make my mom proud of me. And what did I do? Blew it. By December 2020, it was gone. 

My partner advised and encouraged me to talk to investment companies and bankers. I talked to 1, my bank. I wasn't working at the time, so they wouldn't allow me to make any investments. That rejection hurt. I believed because they said no, everyone would tell me no. So I basically ignored my partner and went along my merry way. 

That's the beginning of our issues that have led up til now. 

Arguments ensued. Not 24/7, but often enough. Finances were the forefront. Even though, somewhere I knew logically that my partner was very hurt by my inability to take his words under thought and advisement, it didn't ""click"" that it was a real problem. So, the finances weren't the real problem. Only recently have I finally understood that it was how I had treated and disregarded him that was the root cause. 

I have come to understand that the excuse I told myself for not ""doing what he wanted with the money"", is because of issues with my soon to be ex husband (post for another time). Ex husband was so manipulative and controlling with money, I had no access. I had to ask for $2 to go buy a Dr Pepper. 

So very wrongly, and unconsciously, I took those fears of being controlled out on my partner. I believed he wanted me to do what he wanted. That he was trying to be selfish and controlling. So, I ignored him. 

Now, because of the severe issues we're having, it's made me realize that he isn't my ex husband. He isn't trying to control me. He isn't trying to manipulate me. He was trying to be the responsible one, when I was incapable of that. 

December of 2019, the money ran out. That is when I began to spiral out of control. We were experimenting with cocaine. He thinks I had a problem, I do not believe that. Yet. Maybe I'll come to realize that I did at that point. 

I began to view the cocaine as a crutch. Something to numb me and ease the pain and confusion. I didn't listen when he said we needed to slow down. I didn't listen when he voiced concerns. Once again, my mind told me he was trying to manipulate and control me. 

April 2020, he revealed feelings he was having for a female he dated for a few months, 8  years ago. Long story short, I agreed to attempt a 3 party relationship. I believe that if I didn't, he would leave me. Choose her over me. That once again, I wouldn't be worth loving or staying with. I believe he would have abandoned me. 

From the very first day, I didn't want it. This female is someone who I have watched since I moved home in May 2019. Her actions and words have been, and still are, vile, manipulative, underhanded and devious. She is blatant in her feelings for my partner. We have a group of friends that we play a game with. Get together about once or twice a week. Every single one of them has approached me about her behavior concerning my partner. How reprehensible it is, and utterly disrespectful to me. one friend refused to come to our house solely because of her. 

Through out the very very brief 3 party relationship, my paranoia began to build. My anxiety surged to levels it hadn't ever reached before. This female moved in with us, because she said she was leaving her husband and had nowhere else to go (yes, she's married). 

The live in relationship lasted 2, maybe 3 weeks. Until things began to happen and be shown to me that heightened my fear that there were things going on between them behind my back. My fears weren't unfounded. Before my partner revealed his feelings for this female back in April, they had been communicating, via text and phone calls. 

When the relationship began, I went into a crisis state. I was insecure, uncomfortable, terrified and deeply hurt. It was just another form of rejection, abandonment and being told I wasn't good enough. Meanwhile, the two of them were able to laugh and smile. Inside of me, I was drowning and dying. 

It reached a head and I gave the ultimatum. She had 1 week to leave. I wanted to give her a day, my partner said a week so she could find somewhere to go. Someone else's lives to destroy. 

A week later, she left. She promised to give my partner and I time and space to rebuild our relationship. We agreed that maybe we could attempt friendship in the future. My partner promised to keep her at arms length and eventually remove her completely from both our lives. 

Neither has happened. They still talk. Text and phone. Things are being hidden from me. I have asked my partner repeatedly for him to let me know the pin to his phone. He viciously refuses. I did know it. For months. And then this female came into our lives. He has refused to give it to me since. So something is being hidden. 

Or maybe I'm being paranoid. Maybe this is a lesson in trust for me. On one level, I trust him more than I've been able to trust anyone. He's always been there. Supported me. Never abandoned me. On the other hand, my mind won't let me trust him, because my paranoia plants scenario after scenario in my mind. That he doesn't want me. He never loved me. That is planning on leaving. Or is going to force me to leave. That he is talking to her in some form everytime I leave the room or the house. I'm scared to sleep if he's awake, for fear he's talking to her. Everytime he leaves the house and is gone longer than I feel it should take, I believe he's seeing her. Even though she stays in another town 30 minutes away. 

I have anxiety attacks several times a day. My paranoia is crippling me, mentally, emotionally and physically. I accuse him of terrible things, when I have no real proof. I am viciously aggressive with him constantly. I attack out of fear and paranoia. Everytime his phone rings, I believe it's her. Everytime he gets a text, I believe it's her. 

I don't know how to stop it or get it under any semblance of control. And when I try to explain what's going on with me to him, it comes out so jumbled and damn near incoherent, he gets angry and frustrated. 

I've pushed him to the point where he doesn't know what to do. He can't keep doing this the way it's going. And God knows, neither can I. And destroying him or pushing him to the point of leaving is not what I want. We've talked about our future plans and getting married. Watching the grandkids play and grow up. We have plans, dreams and goals. 

The thought of those being thrown away like trash frighten me. The thought of him rejecting me, leaving and abandoning me, reaffirming my belief that I am not worth any effort beyond superficial. 

I know, thought, my priority is getting myself well and healthy. I am extremely compliant with my meds. I go back into therapy the 24th. I've been in contact about med changes and what's been going on with my psychiatrist. He added a med and increased a dosage. I've been researching BPD, not just from a patient's perspective, but also the caregiver's perspective. I've printed out worksheets and information sheets this morning. 

I don't know what else to do. I'm lost, alone and scared. I'm not at the point of self harm again, or suicidal actions. But I don't want to get there either. 

There has to be a way of healing myself and our relationship concurrently. I'm losing hope.

Sorry being so blatant and incoherent with my first post. I feel that if I'm not open and honest, I'm just lying to myself, as well as anyone who reads this. This is me. Naked and raw."
885,"I usually say that my parents understand me, but the truth is they don't. I just hate telling the truth because I feel guilty all the time afterwards. I feel like a bad person for complaining about my parents.

They don't understand what I'm going through. My father has a very arrogant personality and always believes he's right. He used to hit me a lot when I was a kid and never apologized for it. If I were to bring it up now, he would tell me I'm making everything up. He doesn't know me. Doesn't know my interests, who I am as a person. He lived with us while I was growing up, but he avoided me all the time. I got into a lot of fights with him. This is why I was happy when my parents divorced and I got to move to Germany with my mother.

My mother blames me for everything. She even blames me for the money she lost during the divorce. She compares me to my father all the time. If I try to talk to her about this, she'll make me the guilty person and when I apologize, she'll tell me she doesn't want to hear it. She always talks about other people, but hates it when others mention the things she did wrong.

I don't know why I pretend that I have a happy family on here. I always say my parents are there for me, but the truth is they don't seem interested in me at all. I always had to deal with their problems growing up, their arguments and stuff. There were times the police was called because of the fights with my father.

Anyway I don't know why I'm sharing all of this. I'll probably feel guilty about this later but right now I just feel like nothing."
886,My home is becoming a toxic environment and I'm not getting any sleep. I've been without a bedroom for nearly 2 years and my stress levels are threw the roof. I'm having issues with my family and don't have close relatives or friends to help me out. I'm in therapy but I'm healing horribly. I'm having hard time coping with the pandemic and I'm clueless about what to do. Please give me your best advice. Thank you.
887,"I feel trapped today. I sat in the car with my wife just now getting verbally whiplashed for my selfishness and self-centerdness. I can understand why she would think that because I am in a world of profound sadness right now oblivious to her genuine needs. Right now she feels my therapy is just making me worse and I tell her it takes time and that it may get worse before it gets better. She tries but she’s frustrated and angry. I totally understand where she is. I would walk away from me. I cause myself enough shit let alone others.

 I really meant it  when I say my heart breaks when I acknowledge the challenge she has in living with me and my BPD. It feels so unfair to subject her to this. Should I leave and be alone because it’s all too hard and i’m just going to hurt a lovely and good person who has already struggled so much in life. 

I’m overwhelmed and all I want to do is conjure up scores of situations in my life where my BPD has shamed and destroyed me. Rehash all the broken relationships that pain me like an open wound and whip myself for the harm I perceive I have done by my unchecked illness. Then to add more fuel
to my very own BPD bonfire of pain I slowly harm the new relationships of worth in my life, hurting them and leaving me with another truck
load of guilt.

Each day is so very different but merge into one another right now. Oh and then there is the pandemic to deal with feeds my BPD with more irrational fear and feelings of impending doom...

Im waiting to get on to Mentalisation therapy but they say I need to be clean of weed. That’s completely fair but how do I do that after 30 years of chronic dependency. I fear what’s on the other side.

How can I expect people I love to get this to what I perceive to be to the extent necessary? I mentioned that my wife could meet with my therapist. She said she doesn’t want to and that I have made no progress and that it makes me worse. Oh yeah, try realizing that your whole life has been a truck load of unnecessary suffering and unadulterated emotional pain. I may accept and learn to live with it one day but that day ain’t today.

I realize this post is filled with negative affect but so be it..."
888,Does Vortioxetine make you emotional?
889,"im really new to all this and i dont know much about bpd but one of my friends with the disorder really believes i have it and i was just wondering if anyone had any information on splitting on past friendships as well?

like for example i had a friend who would constantly make me question my morality in a passive/aggressive way and it gave me terrible intrusive thoughts and i was so tired of them that i eventually ended up saying something horrible and ruined what was an otherwise salvagable relationship. 

and im distraught because part of me knows that i could no longer be friends with someone who was acting passive aggressive with me and giving me graphic intrusive thoughts, but i look back and miss them so much like... part of me kind of wants to be friends again even though i know that it wouldnt be a good idea because i was never the actual Cause of any of our issues. 

on one hand im thankful that i got out of that despite it being so terrible and on the other hand i keep having to remind myself that things were never perfect between us and i shouldnt wish to be close to someone like that again. 

tldr: does anyone split on past relationships and forget why they even had to come to an end in the first place?

if anyone wants to reply or message me privately with more info or advice, it would be much appreciated!! ty"
890,"I'm in between jobs. Was made redundant from last job but before that I was off sick with my mental health. My job was not helping that. Both myself and my husband felt I needed to work for financial reasons so I got an interview and I was offered the position, unfortunately due to Coronavirus, the position was put on hold and I still havent heard from them. Also in this time I have been diagnosed with BPD. If I'm being totally honest i am dreading starting work. I've had a bad experience from my last place and quite frankly decided I dont like people very much and the way they treat you. I keep being told to get in touch with new employer but I'm terrified they will say ""oh can you start next week"" Just don't know what to do."
891,"Hello good people,

I'm a almost 32yo man, who has been diagnosed not to long ago with BPD.
I always felt I was ""broken"", or ""different"" but could never figure out what was wrong with me, I decided to go to a psychiatrist and eventually he told me I have bpd and narcissistic personal disorders.

When he told me, I sort of put all the dots togheter, and I was more or less relieved that I could name what is the issue in me.

I'm here to ask for advice from people with BPD that have more experience about it, I'm pretty new. I read stuff like ""favourite person"" and I don't understand what you mean, can you elaborate?

Anyways, I always lived with this without knowing so I kinda managed it until now, but I am at a point where I'm struggling heavily on jobs and the constant feeling of unfulfillment. 
I am pretty good in what I do (mostly sales), I can be easily one of the best as I learn very quick, until a point where something clicks in my mind and I think ""this is not what I want to do in life"", and from that very moment my mind completely changes and I hate to be in ""that"" place for any second that passes, hence my performance goes from top3 to last one. Have you had similar experiences? How do you deal with that?

I am always looking for something new, something that maybe can make me feel fulfilled. I now want to start university and eventually become Wealth manager - Private banker. Even if I'm the best in my company I still feel as it's not ""important"", while having a specialization and that kind of career would make me feel as I have an active role in society and so I would feel like... someone. Someone who can actually help other people, while still making good money, as I am a father of a 3yo this is very important to me.

A second question is how do you deal with the extreme emotional fluctuations? I go from feel like a god and nobody can stop me, and when I feel like that nobody can actually stop me to feeling like a bag of sh*t, completely useless and I feel like I want to disappear. HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THIS, considering I have a job that I don't want to lose because when I feel good I like it.

I have so many questions, but those are the first two.

I hope it wasn't too much info.

Thank you in advance."
892,"So. 

I've struggled with self harm since I was 11 years old (I'm 24 now.) I was put in therapy when I was 13, I was formally diagnosed with social anxiety, major depression, and attention deficit (the inattentive/non-hyperactive variant) I have had 4 therapists since then and the moment that therapy stops, my mental health starts declining. There has always been this part of my life that I've had trouble explaining. I have what I call ""episodes"" and ""tracks"" I define a track by getting fixated on a line of thought, that often leads me to cycle through several emotions, typically anxiety and depression. Tracks can lead to episodes, where I feel as though I'm completely breaking down and theres really nothing I can do at that point. For example, I just got the email that told me I could be starting DBT soon, and that started a track of self-doubt, now I feel as though I'm on the verge of an episode. 

I have always told myself that I'm just sensitive or that I ""just have more emotions than most people"" and I've chalked up the tracks and episodes as a combination of ADD and anxiety. I dont think I've ever had a healthy relationship because I just dont communicate or open up to people. I suppose the reason I doubt having BPD is because I dont externalize my emotions. If I did that, then people would think I'm insane and I'd have no one. My mantra has been ""I dont explode, I implode"" I typically isolate myself because the crippling loneliness just seems easier than being vulnerable to any kind of rejection or invalidation. I can handle having no one in my life, I cant handle going out on a limb and being shut down. 

I'm with this person now, and they seem pretty adamant that I do have BPD... we have gotten into 2 different fights about my inability to open up. Whenever they ask me how I'm feeling, or what I'm thinking about, my mind completely blanks and I have no idea what to tell them. I'm noticing now that I dont even let myself know how I'm feeling when I'm around them because if I dont know, then they can't know, and they cant reject me for my big ugly feelings. All I've been thinking about during these last 2 days I've been with them is our previous fights, and I'm now very anxious that I'm messing it up every second that I'm with them. It doesnt matter that they literally flung themselves at me as soon as I walked in the door after a week of not seeing them. It doesnt matter if they're constantly touching me, or say they love me every other sentence. I cant stop thinking about the fights. 

I'm very scared of what I'm going to do to myself if this doesnt work out. I feel as though I cant take another shitty relationship. It has to stop. I really think that if I mess this up somehow, I will give up on all relationships and completely isolate myself. It's just easier that way. 

I'm also very worried that if I go to the shrink and they tell me it's all in my head and I'm just being crazy I will never find a way to fix the lifelong, inexplicable problems that I've had. If it's not BPD, then I have no idea. 

And idfk man, I guess I just want other people who do have it to tell me that I'm not being crazy and that this is an actual thing. 

End rant."
893,"Hi,
I’ve been diagnosed with bpd for about a year. I’ve done some outrageous shit because of it and now all of sudden I’m hating myself at work I can’t shake this anxious feelings it’s literally driving me sick to my stomach I have no idea what’s wrong??? Everything in life seems to be okay but I just feel miserable or like I deserve to be miserable. And I’m honestly trying not chase the closest people in my life away but something in me wants their attention 24/7 today,tomorrow, etc and I really like this new guy don’t wanna scare him away but how do I deal wtf is wrong. Why do I feel this way for absolutely no reason?"
894,"A consultant (who has not even spoken to me) has made the executive decision to keep me on antidepressants. I am SO frustrated. I have taken SSRI’s for 4 years and there is a reason why I kept going back to my doctor.. now I know it’s because I have always had BPD rather than just depression. I know meds can’t cure BPD, but they are a big part in helping control it. I was hoping to try mood stabilisers. I was told simply that I need to ‘focus more on psychotherapy.’ I understand this. But to keep me on meds that don’t work is driving me insane (literally!!!). Has anyone had this kind of experience? I just feel so drained by everything and can’t stop crying."
895,"i just dont want to be conciouss
im not ALWAYS as happy as people think x"
896,"I've sent a message to her yesterday and I say that is better to not talk anymore, because I was a bad guy and so miserable with her. I hope my fríend be happy, she was so warmth and  comprensive with me but I not too much."
897,"Forgive me if I am not understanding the Favourite Person but I'm newly diagnosed and learning about all this even though it's been with me 30+ years. 
So i have had what i think FPs in every area of my life and i have had to, for want of a better phrase, deal with each differently. My FPs do not know that they play this role in my life because I feel they would probably run a mile. 
My current FPs are a husband and wife couple. The wife is very understanding as is the husband but I feel that if I push the husband he would run a mile so I have to tread carefully. We sing together in a choir and I sing in his band and I have known them for over 25 years. I never message him first but if I see he is online I get very stressed if hasn't been in touch. In this instance I would then post something on facebook saying that I'm just not good enough and not worth talking to  but only set it so they can see it. Usually one or both of them get in touch to say they love me and mean such a lot to a lot of people. I feel so manipulative and that is not what I want to be but on the other hand I would be devastated if I didnt have them in my life."
898,Please forgive me for all I have done. I know I dont deserve peace and everytime I close my eyes I see the hurt I have caused. I am truly sorry. My heart breaks.
899,"I am nervous and scared to take on jobs because of my history of loving it at first and then quickly hating the job and leaving! I have had 7 jobs in 2 years. I can’t seem to commit. It is definitely a cycle and I know it’s my BPD. I guess I have not been on the right meds and where that could be changing soon, hopefully I can stick out my next job. It makes me wonder if I’ll ever settle."
900,"Yesterday I talked to my best friend. And I asked him some personal questions and he totally switched into suicidal mode.. and he stopped talking. I didn't hear anything anymore.

It's 24 hours later and I'm really really worried..
My stomach feels like there are big stones in it and I feel like throwing up. Also I have no appetite.

It's not the first time he left but he always promised not to do anything stupid. And this time he didn't want to promise that..

I'm c crying all day, texting, calling... But nothing I really don't know what to do anymore 😭"
901,"I found a job, full time at Home Depot, can't explain how good this feels, was hired on right after the interview.  Not sure if I should post this here but I needed to tell someone. I quit Facebook, it was causing stress, got tired of all the crap.  

I can almost see a future, don't want to get too excited, but this is nice."
902,"Don't want to post, don't want to write, I'm finding that my body is failing me.  Got a job at home Depot working graves putting away merchandise and have found out that the mind is willing but the body isn't.  Pain level is fairly bad, mostly it's consistent, which is worse than temporary big pain.  Thought it would start to get better the more I got used to working, but am finding that at the end of the night it's very difficult to walk, waking up I just feel exhausted.  

The negative thoughts are coming back, I'm a loser, can't hack it, should just give up, no one cares.  Thoughts of being better off dead.  Logically I know that I'm just getting older, I'm 49, I'm 6'2"" 275 lbs, I haven't really worked in four years (was in prison).  I have neglected my body which in turn has affected my health. Again logically, I know I can find another job that is less physically demanding, but mentally I feel as if I have failed.  

As I've gotten older the BPD has gotten smaller, but in moments like this it is huge, scares me what is going through my brain, wanting to self medicate, use again after five years of being sober, want to numb out, not care.  The thing is I still do care, I just need to ride this out, gain perspective, but it is so hard not to give in to the negative.  It infuriates me how my mind is split, that I don't have control of the negative emotions that have taken up residence in my head.

I didn't want to write, but I did, not sure it helped much, but it's a start.  Again I thank this forum for being here, giving me a place to vent, a place to be safe.  I'm not giving up (even though the pull to do so is there)."
903,I've lost all fight in myself. I have now come to the conclusion that I deserve this. I deserve the torture of overthinking. I deserve the torture of not knowing whether my FPs care for me. I deserve the torture of feeling like a failure and not being good enough.
904,"As some background, I've always kind of been a lonely person, I have autism spectrum, so I was never really able to make a lot of friends throughout my life, and I've never really had a relationship, which is distressing to me because I feel a great deal of affection for others but don't really have any outlet for these feelings. Last year, which was my final year at uni, by chance I attended a lecture being given by a graduate student on Roman history, which is a topic I'm fairly interested in. I had a crush on her immediately, so I approached her after the lecture and began talking to her about Roman history, we ended up exchanging numbers. Being borderline, I fell for her very quickly over the course of a couple of coffee dates and taking her to watch a play. It was really devastating when she told me she didn't feel that way, but I didn't want to break it off because I was so lonely and she was the only friend I had.

However, I've found that continuing to be her friend has been terrible for my mental health, I have never gotten out of the idealization phase with her, and everytime I'm around her I experience an emotional high, but I'm always hyper-vigilant about the possibility that she is angry with me. She recently visited me for a week and after a few days of her being around, I had to tell her exactly how I felt about her, and I realize now that that crossed some boundaries because she didn't know I'm borderline and so the intensity of those feelings of love and affection were very shocking to her. While she has expressed she still wants to be my friend, I don't know how to continue like this honestly. It would be one thing if she were my favorite person and she were actually a significant other, which would be more manageable, but if I continue to just have this endless love for her, then I will only continue getting hurt in this relationship. At the same time, however, I don't have anyone else to turn to, I don't have a significant other (and never have, largely due to my fears of abandonment), and I have no other friends besides her. She's the only person I really have any emotional intimacy with, and she's the only person I really put my trust in."
905,"When I was a kid, elementary, junior high, I had a very restless imagination. When bored I would pretend I am some different version of me and create a plot in my head and actually enjoyed that over tv, video games. I could create a story in my head and my imagination was more relevant to my interests then anything on tv or any games, and act it out without saying or doing anything, and it was like watching a tv series or movie in my mind. I create the characters, plot, results and every detail. 

I also used to be really curious about a lot of things, so to figure out what it might be like to be this animal or person I would ‘pretend’ I was them and create a story and character based on what I saw. I used to do a lot of people watching and wonder what their life is like, their house, who their friends, religion, everything."
906,"I dontknow which forum to put this in but as I have recently been told I have an Emotionally Unstable Personality I thought I would post it here. My Dad died when I was 8 after a short battle with Cancer. My life turned upside down. There is no other way to put it. I completely changed. I was needy, clingy, developed OCD, struggled with friendships, became obsessed with people and thought they would make me happy. I relied on them to make me happy. 
I did get married and have children and my husband is hugely supportive. I have thrown alsorts at him that have potentially sabotaged this relationship but he stands by me. Our greatest test was that I had an affair, which he knows about. It was a big slap in the face for me. The man, I wanted to keep in my life, again I thought he was THE person that would make me feel somebody. I wouldn't say I went out for an affair. It was the only way I knew that would keep him being my friend. I thought he would go elsewhere so i had to keep him. He was married also but i was never phased by his relationship with his wife. I was content when he was with his wife but when he was alone i would worry he was talking to other women and i really could not stand that. Anyway, i cant forgive myself, i self harm  i hate myself and I truly believe I dont deserve to be happy."
907,"After a string of failed, disastrous relationships I decided to give them a break.  It was after my last relationship ended in 2016 that I decided not to date.  Shortly after that I was diagnosed with BDP.  For years I always thought it was just anxiety and depression but the BDP diagnosis makes sense.  So now I find myself missing relationships.  Like I know it would be difficult for me to trust, but I keep thinking that if I were to meet the right person he would make me feel secure and happy.  Of course I know that I need to make myself happy first.  So, I'm not sure I'm ready to date, and I also fear that if I date I will be so devastated with the outcome that it will once again take me years to recover.  How do you all handle dating and relationships?"
908,"Sometimes people (my therapist, my mom, and my professor) say that I am brave and compassionate but inside my head I think: ""but what if I am a fraud and I've tricked them somehow into believing i am not garbage but they'll see it soon."" 

Every semester i dont graduate is 1 semester closer to being found out."
909,"K I have no friends so I'll share this here. I went through some old boxes in my grandmother's place and I found hundreds of old letter dating back as far as the 1980s from my great grandmother on my grandfather's side.

Why is this important rather than just cool? My grandpa took his own  life back in 1992 and he had an interesting life as he was in the Navy, faked his own death once to escape his first family, estranged from his family (that raised him) because he learned he was child trafficked to them and was a criminal hiding from the american law when he met my grandmother. And these letter are from his birth mother! And she wrote up until 2014! even asking about me and my brothers.

Her parents were czchek apparently isnt that cool?"
910,"Hello and thank you to anyone who responds to this rant. This is both strange and new to me. I don't really know how to come at this, or what i expect to get from it. I don't know if its confirmation that i want/need, i just know i need some help. I've suspected for a while now that i might have BPD, but i don't know how to talk about it without sounding like a hypochondriac, or just another attention seeking scumbag. The last thing i want is attention, I just want some advice. 

I haven't sought any kind of clinical help for what i suspect is wrong with me, although I've tried counselling and medication for anxiety and depression. It has never helped. Anxiety and depression have never felt like the cause of how i feel; just the symptoms of of a bigger problem. I've always had trouble connecting with people, especially men, on a deep level, and my intimate relationships with women have always ended in disaster. I've had a constant struggle with my sense of identity, and have often felt as though i have no soul, as if i'm a dead and empty vessel. I've supplemented the void with drugs and alcohol, and have recently recovered from four years of addiction to crystal meth. social situations make me incredibly anxious when i'm sober, but when i'm high I can talk to anyone, make friends with anyone. I fall in love instantly and just as quickly fall out of it and descend into hatred. I go from relationship to relationship messing up other peoples lives and feeling sorry for myself even with the knowledge it was my fault.

I'm constantly paranoid about what people think of me whilst simultaneously knowing i'm being an idiot. When my emotions become to much, i either self destruct with drink and drugs or self harm. I have almost no interest in bettering myself academically, its not laziness, i work hard and scratch out a living in dead end working class jobs, i just don't care, I've been told i'm smart or i'm wasting my potential and so on and blah blah blah. 

I haven't spoken to anyone about a diagnosis. I don't know how to. I'm scared i'm just an asshole and nothing is wrong with me, but at the same time i feel so mentally unwell and have done for such a long time. I'm scared about going to my doctor, telling them i think i have BPD and having them look at me like i'm and idiot and telling me i just need to be a better person. Im sick of feeling like such an evil person, and sometimes i don't feel like a person at all. I'm so alone in my head, im in so much pain.

I don't want to be reassured, i don't want sympathy, i just want to know if any of you have felt the same way?  have any of you gotten help? and how have you gone about it? and anything else that might help? ill answer any questions, im not embarrassed about anything, i just want to do something about it and i don't know how."
911,"I have struggled with BPD for most of my adolescence unknowingly and part of my adulthood knowingly. I've always felt different and always struggled to fit in. I'm the youngest in my family and the most directionless and it makes me feel useless and worthless. I don't know how to maintain healthy friendships and romantic relationships because of the constant fear that my loved ones are going to abandon me and secretly hate me behind my back and are planning ways to hurt me. I constantly feel a pit in my stomach like something terrible is going to happen. I've tried therapy and medication to no avail, I can't sleep some nights because the anxiety over day to day functionality eats at me but I also have struggle focusing and finding my path which makes me feel like even more of a failure. I'm always so angry and I just can't control it and it drives everyone away from me and I just can't take anymore rejection. I'm only 23 but sometimes I feel so much older because every day I struggle with all of these feelings and emotions feels like so much longer and I am just constantly weighed down and exhausted by the feeling of helplessness toward my situation. I need help but don't trust my loved ones enough to understand or help because they either can't be bothered to research the things i tell them about my disorder or tell me it's all in my head and that I need to get over it. I just feel a dark cloud over me all the time and I'm tired of it and I just need someone to talk to who understands what this feels like...is anyone there?"

I say to her oh ok is everything ok she like ye omg ffs its nothing …. I think she's setting my over thinking my anxiety on purpose because she knows its a trigger so why do it ????"

914,"So I finally got diagnosed today with bpd it's being buzzing around my head all day and ofc I've spent the entire day googling it. 

During my diagnosis I was prescribed antipsychotics. Now during my research I noticed a common theme on every single website I clicked on, there's no meds for bpd. It's not common to be prescribed antipsychotics long term (1 week+) for bpd...blah blah. 

 So I'm now curious as to why I've been prescribed them and he was very adamant that I stay on them until my next meds review in 4 months. Does this mean I have some other disorder alongside bpd? Have I been given the wrong diagnosis? Or is it normal to be given antipsychs?"
915,Why is it there are some people who you just cannot let down and then there are others who you dont mind letting down and it's the latter group of people who care the most.
916,I can't do it anymore. I'm feeling overwhelmed by it and I'm sick of going week to week waiting for my next appointment. I don't want to feel the way that I feel now. I've relapsed and selfharmed and I don't even care. It feels like a sense of security. It feels like I can do this alone.
917,"Just got off the phone from my mum. I do love her but I'm just never going to be her first choice. She has been shielding for last few months.

My mum said to me she just had to get out and because she had been seeing a lot of my Neice she said she thought she would go up to my sisters. So she made her choice which family member she wanted to have in her bubble. I've not stopped crying."

919,"Anyone else feel like they are ruining their own friendships and intimate relationships due to fear that they hate you? For further explanation, I often drive myself crazy when it comes to reaching out to friends or even my significant other. Even though they constantly tell me they want to hang out and they don't hate me, I still feel like they hate me. Just the other day, I wanted to hang out with some friends but stopped myself because I thought once I joined in they would all tell me they hate me and tell me to go away. Of course once I joined I was welcomed with positivity. Sad thing is even though my mind is proven wrong over and over again, the fear is still there almost every time.

In regards to my significant other, I'm always scared to open up to him or to start the first conversation. I even have hesitation when sending a simple ""good morning babe"" text. Sometimes I force myself to just do it, but still scared of his response. Constantly thinking ""what if he thinks I'm crazy and leaves me. What if he thinks I'm too needy?"" He says he won't leave he likes talking to me, and that I need to communicate with him. Anyone have any advice or coping skills to help with relationships, both friends and intimate?"

922,"Hey, 

I have an ex partner and we have had on off relationship for past 5-6 years. Except once he has been the person to initiate contact and wanting to get back together. Very intense, wanting to marry me but then regressed. 

I however got in contact recently and our contact has been on and off, varying in intensity. I had declared I was not over him and hadn't moved on. I always felt his previous behaviour was never him and it was if he was someone else and recently he felt he may have BPD (not officially diagnosed). I asked him if there was ever a possibility of us getting back together. He said he will answer but didn't want to give a hasty response. A week + later I have not had an answer and also no contact from him in past 24 hours. 

I have read some stuff about BPD and want to know more so I can be understanding. But I wonder if I should wait any longer for a response?

My instant reaction is to think no answer is your answer but I also have part of my mind that says don't jump to conclusions. I'm So confused"
923,"Ok...so this is the first proper post from me on here (aside from introduction), and it has been prompted by something that happened this morning...
Basically, my friend and flatmate ( who is staying with family for a few days) texted this morning and asked how I was doing. When I said I was stressed, he didn't ask why, or even say he was sorry to hear it - he just said he was stressed too. 
This really annoyed and upset me. Why ask how someone is if you don't genuinely care?! I felt unheard, and that my feelings didn't matter and he had just turned it round to make it all about him! He does this quite a lot, or goes on the defensive if I try to talk to him about anything, and I'm getting fed up of it!
He does have depression, and I'm starting to think that he is the wrong person to share my home with, as he's too 'switched off' to emotions most of the time, whereas I'm too 'switched on' to them, unless I've had an extreme bout of them, then also switch off for a while. Trouble is, in the current economic climate, I can't afford not to have him here, and I wouldn't trust anyone else to move in. It was different with him as he had been a friend for years...
I feel as if I'm trapped between a rock and a hard place, and it's really getting me down and making my anxiety worse...
Am I justified in feeling this way about the text or being over-sensitive?
Does anyone here live with someone who also has mental health issues, and if so, how do you make it work? DOES it work when two of you have problems?
Any input would be most appreciated, as I'm at the end of my tether with it all.
And if you don't have any, thanks for reading anyway!"
924,"Does anyone find your brain gets overloaded with having to think all the time that I end up having a blow out. I feel like all the thinking has to be done by me, what meals to cook, where to go on holiday, the shopping lists, who needs what etc. I understand these are general life decisions but the problem is I have to consider 4 people's tastes otherwise they moan about and I take that as a complete fail on my part. I hear you say don't panda to their needs but part of who I am is to keep everyone happy, obsessively and when they appear upset i am totally devastated. Anyone else feel like this?"
925,"Do not know if this is related to my condition but does anyone suffer with extreme emotion when it is dull and rainy. I have woke up today on what has been the umpteenth day of rain and grey. I have sobbed my heart out, I'm snappy with everyone and I'm wrapped up in a quilt watching videos on youtube of spanish resorts. I am totally miserable. Xx"
926,Ok so I am really embarrassed and ashamed about this and needed to get this off my chest. I felt like no one cared about me so I started making fake instagram accounts to harrass myself and tell myself to kill myself ti test and see who cared.  A guy cared a lot so he became my favourite person. Then I kept bullying myself online to get attention from him and saying the worse things I could about myself. He found out what I was doing sonehow and was made to block me but making Instagram accounts to harrass myself became very thrilling and addictive.  Does this make me crazy? I feel like I must be for doing that!!
927,"Hi everyone,

I realise I have never created a personal list with things I am sensitive for. I wonder what your triggers are and perhaps we can help each other out to recognise by becoming aware of those. And how to avoid them to upsetting us? 

I mostly get triggered by:

Note: I also figured that these differ. I am starting to honour those instead of fighting them. 



1. If a partner walks out when there is a small argument or if I even show disappointment. If the person walks out, it triggers emotions of devaluation of my emotions, and lack of respect. When not telling me that the person will be back in x time. If the person would state that they would come back in x,y,z time I would feel better.

2. When someone asks me about my psychological background or diagnosis, but when I ask and they derive or are ambivalent about it, it shows that they have no trust. But I also trust them less. Especially if they were fishing about mine.


3. Anything I want to discuss in a calm manner but the other person does not want to nor gives me a sense of safety that it is alright or just frankly speaks openly in a respectful manner.

4. Anyone who does not follow up their plans (long/short). In like five minutes or less than a day without any urgent life happenings. 

5. Someone who is stingy (that is because at home my parents fought a lot about money). 

6. Anyone who does not act in a way that I feel calm and I can trust the person. 

7. If I still have not met his parents in six months. 

8. He does not want kids. Although I am getting more fine with this. 

I will think of more."
928,"today I've argued with the ones that I live, triggered an explosion anger and there was screams and tears. I was too close to get out from home to do bad things. But i did not do it. anger was increasing like rain :( I hate be impulsive"
929,"When everyone on social media is self diagnose themselves with the same mental illness as you, to the point where you can't even come out and get that weight off your shoulders yourself and share that you have BPD and Bipolar because everyone else is self diagnosing themselves with the same illness. This only affects 2% of the UK population so it is clearly not possible. Meanwhile you're sat there like ""no this diagnosis is official, I am medicated for it"" I absolutely hate that people are coming out as having BPD left right and centre all over facebook without official diagnosis. I find it insulting and it near enough silences me. I would absolutely love to get it off my chest and be open and honest about it like so many people are on social media but I'm so fearful it's going to start a fresh chain/phase of everyone else saying they have it too. I feel like it's the new fashion statement (like braces and glasses were) it's not, it's real for me, it's real for us, and its insulting to both me and you that so many people are self diagnosing and claiming to have it when it's a genuine every day struggle for us. Anyone else frustrated by this?"

yeah how then

where do you even start"
933,"I cN help control my emotions, to a small degree, with colours. I wear yellow alot because it helps me ""wake up on the right side of the bed"" and when I get annoyed i can just think about yellow things  and it helps calm me down a bit. 

It doesn't always work, I Keyed a car wearing yellow once so that's not good. But I find green helps too and blue. 

I stay away from black and red and purples because they help key me up. 

Anyone else?"
934,"This has been on my mind as of late, but I haven't gotten around to talk about it. I'm having a hard time coming to terms with my diagnosis because I'm afraid of what'll do to my love life. I have a tendency to go off the rails emotionally and combine that with what I'm looking for in a ideal partner, it's difficult. I'm a naturally sensitive person, to the point where I can take things to heart quite literally. My emotions can vary from numb to downright intense at times. My ideal man would be someone who is gentle, kind, compassionate with feminine qualities. Someone who's fatherly and also in touch with their nurturing side. Now, my only fear is that my disorder will get in the way of my romantic relationships. I'm afraid it'll invite chaotic people into my life due to my vulnerable nature. If someone knows my triggers, will they end up avoiding me at all costs? Will those ""good"" men decide that I'm not worth challenge because I'm too complex for their agenda? Those thoughts get to me sometimes and make me feel suicidal because I actually want to be a serious relationship someday, maybe even have children. How can I attract a good partner to my life despite my negative emotions? I'm afraid it'll attract harmful people to me without consciously knowing it. I feel like having BPD already makes me damaged goods to some, so it'll become hard matching myself up with someone who's naturally aligned with themselves. I just don't feel like I'm good enough for the kind of man I want in my life. I feel like a bull in a china shop wherever I go due to intense nature. It's like I know what is good for me, but in return, I feel unworthy of it.

Let me know if you've felt this way and if you have advice, I'd gladly appreciate it. Thank you, blessed be!"
935,"so, my neighbour Yenni just invited me up for breakfast.   It's triggered my ""what the hell?"" mode.

Part of my BPD means I'm terrible at reading any kinda ""dating"" signals.  Like, no sign of interest is clear enough for me to think ""This person is interested in me"".

But, over the last few weeks, I'm beginning to wonder what Yenni is after.   Like, she's invited me to hang out and do stuff (like going with her to Home Depot, going for walks, etc), 4 out of 5 nights this week.  And talking about how she isn't happy with her boyfriend, and how unimportant he seems to think the relationship is....

And then there's the whole mess with our former friend who still lives in the building and hates us both.

I feel like I'm gonna be doing a lot of dissociating over the next while."
936,"Hi All!  I originally posted the following in the ""introduce yourself"" forum, but maybe this form is a better fit, so here goes, again...

After half a century of wondering, ""why am I so miserable"" and constantly doing and saying things that wrecked any chance of short term happiness, while my conscious mind was yelling, ""SHUT UP! SHUT UP NOW YOU FOOL!"" my wife of a quarter century enlightened me as to how I appeared to others during one of her abusive drunken blackout jags.

As she was destroying me with the truth, she was confused over my interest in what she was saying.  Sure, it hurt, but when she was in these states, ripping my heart out with her words, she seemed incapable of lying, so I believed her words, because after all they rang true.

After she cursed me for not getting angry, she passed out and I hit the Google search engine to find out exactly my problem was.

In the past I did some research to see if my problem was being bi-polar, but no, I didn't fit the square holes on that test, and left it at that.

On this night while the cursed information was still fresh in my mind, I finally stumbled on a description of BPD and thought, ""Holy Schmoley! This is a text book case of a text book case!  Eureka!  I've got BPD big time, now that I know what my problem is, I can FIX IT!""

What a disappointment that little inaccurate revelation was.  Sure, now I know that the problem is, but fixing it isn't as easy as I would have suspected, as I made zero progress.

After realizing that I wasn't going to fix this problem without huge amounts of alcohol and recreational drugs, I was depressed that I hadn't made this realization decades ago, so that I could have tried a little bit harder to end it in order to avoid this horror show of a life that wasn't going to get any easier.

So, one night while the wife was screaming in my left ear 'till it rang, I decided this would be the night... I've tried before, but was always a suicide chump, as the wife would say as she egged me on.

This night I would grow a pair and end it, IF, a certain event were to take place that night, making it easier to leave this realm.

Before the event took place, I was touched by the universe in a physical and mental way, making me think I was having a stroke, but it was such a wonderful stroke, I then went with it, and have never been the same since.

It took over a year before I accepted the fact that on that night I was 'enlightened' giving me the ability to see within myself clearly.

With this new vision, I was able to stop and think whenever I was accosted by the gifts that BPD just keeps on giving, to ask myself ""why did I do that?""

I use to ask myself that question a lot!  But this time, I was able to, with some puzzle solving effort on my Mensa brain, to come up with answers.

The puzzle solving became easier over the next couple of years allowing me to see what the exact causes of my disorder were.

In a word, the little buggers were seemingly insignificant delusions, the kind of delusions we start building up in our subconscious mind the moment we see mommy's face and make a judgment surrounded by emotion.

OK, I'll end it here since this is where people usually start looking at me like I got worms coming out my nose.

I'm working on mapping out everything starting with myself on the subconscious level, working outward to see things that are beyond my own existence.

So, If this is true, I might be in a place to help others who might be interested in hearing more.

However, according to my model, it's a distinct possibility that by beliefs are delusion.  Therefore, I might now find myself in a place where others can help me to see what I may be blind to.

I had depended on the blackout drunk wife for these truths, unfortunately she has since gotten her wish to die drunk and ugly, and is no longer able to give me the unvarnished truth during her 'states'.

I look forward to anonymous conversations in seeking the truth, since the truth is all there is actually."
937,"I always feel like something is missing inside me. All my life I have felt odd, out of place and alone. I carry a lonely feeling in my heart. Now I have a wonderful partner. There are times we are together that I feel okay but then the feeling comes back. Today that emptyness has been there all day. I can understand why I used to have the feeling but now that I am loved it is strange it has not gone away. I try filling it with food, spending money. These things work for a short time. Is this something that just never goes?"
938,"Reaching out today as I have reached out to my mental health team in the past few days and they haven't really done much to help. I'm a male and I suffer from bpd, since about march I have been starting to feel quite a bit worse then what I used to, a few weeks back I tried to take my own life, I spoke to my therapist and he didn't really seam to concerned, since then I have not felt right, I find it hard to explain but everything doesn't feel real, everything looks hazy and fuzzy. I feel agitated a lot of the time, to points where I find it hard to sit still. The past few days this has got worse, I keep seeing coloured spots float around my vision occasionally I have seen a object that I can see in the corner of my eye start moving like its vibrating then when I directly look at it, it stops moving. I have mentioned this to my therapist and all I have been told is maybe I need my eyes testing. I can understand that if it was just my eyes it could be that, but everytime I have seen coloured spots or stuff move it has been when I have been in a agitated state. I don't think I'm psychotic, I'm not sure what it is? I've been told to keep a note of when this happens and what I was doing at the time. There's apparently nothing currently at the moment they can do due to the coronavirus pandemic, which I don't find fair, I can go in to a pub and buy a drink or go shopping, but I can't get mental health support, I can't enter the building to attend group courses which I think would help. I don't really know what to do really, I drive a car, I work for the NHS in a clinical area and my mental health team are just letting me do this stuff even when I have suggested the idea that maybe I'm not safe to do these tasks. I can't just stop working as then ill have no money. I feel really confused on what to do and any suggestions or other peoples own experiences would be greatly appreciated."
939,"I met a guy on Saturday for the first time, we spent two nights together, he ended up stayed at my home. He told me the same day he wants to be with me in a relationship, I thought it was quick but he was so sweet I agreed, he clearly really liked me and he seemed very much in love (I'm aware of the intense emotions of BPD).

The next day, I  because he's young and whatever else. Which I admitted was wrong. The next day after that I told him I realised it was my irrational fear of abaondment (I have some traits of BPD) and that and I regret it I told him he was perfect all a long and made me happy so I apologized and said we should still see each other this Friday and five it a go. He reacted very defensively saying no, he doesn't give second chances, I was putting him down about his age and he won't take me back. It's my fault I ended it.

When normally he had a lot of insight. He blocked me on everything and told me he may contact me in two weeks when the dust settles then meet up and take things slowly. I don't know if I should or what to think or feel. I like him so much but I'm Saturday here crying as I write this. It was child abuse trauma that leads to my fear of abaondment but when I overcome it and decide to be with him I would have stuck with that and not chsnged my mind. I explained this but just kept blaming me.
I don't know what to do . Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you"
940,"Normally when I am hurt, I tend to lash out and say the most cruel things I can think of to my boyfriend. We have had a generally rocky relationship which has been on and off for four years. I want this time to be different. When I say these hurtful things to him and hurt him, he usually wants to have some time alone (usually about a day), but then I get really clingy and don't want him to leave because I feel like he's going to leave me completely or cheat on me. I feel like maybe I am being irrational and should just give him the time? I do not want to ruin the relationship as I always do but when he needs time alone I feel abandoned, like he hates me, or would do things behind my back. I hate feeling alone when he's gone but would rather leave him his time if its best. I am really trying to change my behaviors. But right now I am having this huge breakdown because he wont speak to me and is upset. I dont know if I can handle the pain of feeling alone, when he is upset with me."
941,"Lately, I've found ways to hurt myself in other ways. Yesterday, I got frustrated with schooling because I'm making up for lost time after not graduating from high school. I feel like there's a stigma around new adults who don't make the mark when it's due. It has sucked the life out of me because it's all my family ever talks about. I do want to finish where I left off of course, but I just feel like the family idiot? Now, if this is you, I'm not here to throw you under the bus. I'm just addressing how it feels to be an adult and feeling embarrassed about not completing school in the traditional sense. It just makes feel like chopped liver? I see people who've graduated from my high school have decent jobs, serious relationships, and best friends they knew since kindergarten, that has just never been me? I've had classes with them and have hung out with them, but yet, don't seem to have the same closeness with people as they do. I'm a lone wolf. What I'm trying to say is that I'm frustrated with how being in adult education has made me feel like a delinquent of sorts? I can honestly say that I have never smoked, drank, or done drugs. I barely skipped class but only did a few times due to depressive episodes, but never to cause trouble or to fight authority. I was into punk culture in my freshman and sophomore year, but it was more of an interest than a lifestyle. I was what you'd consider a ""good noodle"" in a reference to spongebob. I have just been riddled with so much anger and self-hatred that I have started to find new ways to injure myself. I just feel this overwhelming feeling of disappointment like ""I should've never switched schools"" or ""I should've asked for help when I had the chance"", so on and so forth. I know my mental health issues and self-image did ruin my high school experience and I feel like I've lost so much time waiting for the right moment to ask for guidance. When I have seeked it, it all got misunderstood by my school's staff. It kind of haunts me how much I could've done but had no idea I could do it. In a way, I feel like it's too late to prove my self-worth and live the life I desire."
942,"I have BPD and struggle with relationships, even after DBT therapy. I have a conscience, so it weighs on me a lot that my disorder hurts people.

The way I see it, my pain is so great that it spills over to others. As I drown in emotion, other people drown too.

Let me give an example:
My closest friend sometimes triggers my emotions. Even when he is a little hurtful, it's not his fault my emotions are intense... I notice my emotion and try not to show it, but it affects him. He notices the shift and blames himself! He asks what's wrong, gets worked up if I'm quiet. If I explain, he gets mad, we fight, and he blames himself more. I tell him, ""This is my disorder! It's not your fault how deep I feel things and hurt. Sometimes I need space to deal with it, I do not want it to affect you! I do not want you to blame yourself.""

No matter what I do, it affects him. If I keep a distance or am quiet or tell him we shouldn't date, that hurts him. If I let him see the emotion, it hurts him.

Has anyone found any solutions or managed to improve their relationships/keep them?

(Anger is a hard one too, people can still sense it and feel intimidated even if I'm quiet.)"
943,"For the past week my SO/FP has been experiencing bad stomach problems and tonight it got so bad that I had to bring him into the ER.

Realistically, he has only been I’ll for about a week (and only 3 or 4 days out of 7), but my borderline brain is running off the rails, convincing me that this is the end and that he is going to die...picturing my life without him...planning horrible things for myself if this turns out to be the case.

The hideous of abandonment “ache” in my guts makes me feel like he is already gone and I am so, so, so scared that I am getting to the point of being barely rational.

I can’t stop thinking that it might be my fault that he is sick. I have this terrible rage in me and mostly I keep it inside, but I think terrible thoughts and maybe I did this to him?

To make matters worse, they would not let me go into the hospital with him and I embarrassed myself and now the shame from that is an issue too.

I have to get myself together and get ready to handle the news no matter what it is, but I don’t know how.

The walls are falling in...again"
944,"Well I didn't want to talk to her because I was an as&%$&ole with her but I was in panic and emptyness and I needed a logic person because I've found a person X from my past with whit I've done things that I don't like it at all. Well, she was very warm and I used to apologize too much by the damage that I did to her. Finally I decided to not met again to that person X and I told to her, and now she just ignored me. Maybe I'm so so so so so exhausting for her and she listen to me but I was (I'm?) so bad listening and supporting her.

I'm not sad about that, I was an as#$""#$ole with her, now not. I prefer get out from her life ."

946,"Has anyone else had any issues with statins causing issues with their BPD? 

Last year my mental health symptoms got worse and for a very long period I struggled to stay on top of them.  I was beginning to wonder if any of my psych meds were interacting with each other but then I put on my pharmaceuticals hat.  

I dropped my statin and my symptoms cleared up to the extent I hadn’t realised just how rough I was feeling.  I restarted them and the symptoms came back so I stopped them and the symptoms went away again."
947,"Just today I had anxiety and paranoia again. I thought it was getting better after it went away, but somewhere in my mind these negative thoughts are still there.

Just last week I talked to a therapist and I thought everything was going well. I mentioned how during my childhood, I was sexually abused and how my mind goes from one thought to another. One minute I believe myself, the next I feel like I deserved it. Other times I feel like I'm just a liar. She told me that something must have happened to cause me to be this hurt in my life, and suggested I continue getting help which I agreed with. 

I have people who support me. Both my parents care very much about me and believe me, and I trust them. That really does help me a lot.

I just feel awful because my aunt doesn't believe me and her husband (or ex now, I'm not really sure) is being defended by her. I haven't heard from them in years, and a part of me wanted to believe none of it was true so that I could 'move on' but it continues to bother me. My aunt used to care about me when I was a kid, and now she wants nothing to do with me. I try to pretend I don't care and remain 'happy' but really these thoughts bother me a lot."
948,"How do you cope with people telling you that it is all your fault! (Relationships ending, job loss, fights or even in a dicussion)"
949,"first timer here I needed somewhere to spill this shit .
i moved in with this girl last year and we messed around for about a year. I grew a pair and finally told her i had feelings and they said that they were getting over their ex. Basically they are poly and im monogamous asf and its not gonna work.

now your caught up

since this pandemic started we've been stuck in the house together all the time and im trying to not overanalyze every situation and also trying to get over them. if youre wondering how this going its NOT. i wish i could verbalize everything but that would take up and entire saga.

on the plus side im moving to my own place in a month and ill be out of this hell. 

can you tell im triggered***

thanks for listening"
950,"I am feeling suicidal.  My home is a flat within a 'social housing"" block, it's so tiny everybody's practically on top of each other.  Lockdown has made things 100 times worse coz can't escape.  It would take too long to explains all my triggers and issues here, but they're being set off bigtime at the moment and I feel suicidal most of the time. My neighbours don't  understand my difficulties but are quiet and considerate as a rule.  Most of the triggers, however , are related to my home situation and when I've  ""acted out"" it's been because of too many triggers going off at the same time and I just havent been able too stay in control of myself.  My hearing is VERY sensitive and I can hear neighbours talking about me.  Sorry to dump all this here but I just feel so alone"
951,"I'm tired. I can change my opinion in 1 sec. I'm so rational out there, over analyzin everything. But I'm tired about my impulses, the mood swings in hours. Is just venting. I'm so sensible now, I think is good, better than the  f$#""#$ insensible that I used to be for avoid the things inside me. I don't know"
952,"Feel overwhelmed by stuff to the point where I am paralysed, have no motivation i.e. depression, and literally have no clue how I am going to a)organise my things. b)prepare myself and even shower c)get to work on time tomorrow d)make it through the day tomorrow.

The strong emotions are very intense at the moment. For some reason I just want to make it through to the end of the week, but I don't know how I will. Does anyone have any advice for me to calm myself? How can I get out of this negative mindset pulling me down?

I don't see my therapist until tomorrow evening. And even that could trigger me if we talk about difficult issues.

I am concerned that I am about to have a breakdown and will look unprofessional at work. I really am trying to hold it together, and for once in my life, not be that fragile person that people view as incapable due to being a wreck.

I have a long to do list to do but I literally cannot see the point in it. I'm in shutdown mode. This sucks."
953,"Anyone else feel like this.
I feel like love is impossible but I want really badly to be loved, but like love is dead in me after the first person I loved broke me. Now I just feel like I will never love again. I am jealous of people who found their first love and had great times together, great times travelling and someone actually believed they were worthy of love. For me I am always questioning why my person never believed I was worthy of love and used me. I am jealous of people who got to be in these long term relationships and settle down because no one ever believed that of me. I feel like there is something wrong with me, like I am deeply ugly and unworthy of love. I just feel deeply sad and like love is somehow impossible. All is dead within me even though I want so badly to be loved and valued. People always talk shit about how you have to love yourself first and then love comes to you, but honestly, I know people who are loved easily and get into relationships easily and its not necessarily because they have done some deep spiritual journey where they learnt to love themselves, it's simply that someone believes they are worthy of love."
954,"Hey everyone! I've been diagnosed with BPD by two psychiatrists and they got something right because the treatment they gave me (one still does) have greatly improved my quality of life. But the other day I reviewed what BPD is about and I don't feel so identified really. Specially when it comes to relationships. Lots of articles and videos emphasize as a symptom having unstable and chaotic relationships. That I can't relate to. I get along with everyone and never enter in conflict with anybody, and I handle rejection fairly well. The last guy I dated even told me when we split that our relationship had been the most healthy one he'd had. I do have to admit that with my ex boyfriend I was different, I wasn't taking medication yet and I would get super upset, yelling and crying, when I got jealous, and I'd feel terrible anxiety whenever I felt indifference from him. I wonder if the medication alone ""cured"" that symptom. That is not to say I don't get very attached sometimes. But learning about Buddhist non-attachment has helped me greatly with that.

Other symptom that is mentioned often is explosive anger. Another thing I can't relate. I never get angry and I feel very distress when someone around me does, because I hate conflict. Another symptom I can't relate is ""feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality"". 

The BPD traits I did have but got better with treatment are self harm, suicidal thoughts, feelings of emptiness and depression.

And the symptoms I still struggle with and have been the most life shaping ones for me: shifting self image and impulsive, self destructive behaviors. I've have so many different plans for my life, I've dropped them all. I've held so many beliefs and ideals that have changed completely. I've studied several things and still don't have a profession because didn't finish anything. And then the self destructive side: binge eating, alcohol, cocaine, money spending. My urges are my biggest enemy.

What traits do you guys relate to the most and the least?"
955,"Does anyone else stay awake all night thinking about something someone said to them, wondering what they meant, / does it mean they don't like me, / are they planning something against me, / why would they say that... along those lines. As I do."
956,"Not Waving but Drowning 
BY STEVIE SMITH

Nobody heard him, the dead man,  
But still he lay moaning:
I was much further out than you thought  
And not waving but drowning.

Poor chap, he always loved larking
And now he’s dead
It must have been too cold for him his heart gave way,  
They said.

Oh, no no no, it was too cold always  
(Still the dead one lay moaning)  
I was much too far out all my life  
And not waving but drowning.


People see me going through life as constant chatiotic and crisis, they think im waving but right now i am drowning."
957,"It will be my 2and Anniversary on Wednesday.  It should be a time to celebrate. But it isn't. Sadly my husband and I  have been ""roommates"" this past year. Literally no affection romance. We have been intimate 2 times once  on our Anniversary list July and  once in Feb. I am 51yrs and this is my 4th marriage.  I was diagnosed 3 years ago. 

My husband tells he pulled away from me because I wore him down.  I am too needy and he doesn't feel I would ever be satisfied not matter what he did. He is right... I  know I am needy and seek reassurance and validation. He works away from home alot and travels to different cities weekly. I get upset when he doesn't text or message me. He will go sometimes 7 hrs. This triggers me and I get filled with rage. I usually text him ... some horrible or nasty text. We fight and then I am up all night and have an awful day at work. It is a pattern that we have repeated for 4yrs. 
I feel empty when he is gone, I knew he worked away when we first met. I love my husband... I  hate who I become when he is away."
958,"was diagnosed 2.5 years ago. Saw a physiatrist every 3months until covid 19 ended in person visits . Attending 1 yr personal counseling as I live in rural Northern Britsh Columbia. I was referred to mental health local support group at the hospital, but decided not to attend as I live in a small town and work with vulnerable clients professionally.  This weekend I drove 4hr to a hotel my husband was at for work. I was convinced he was having an affair. I think about it now and ... think omg. WTF! He is not having an affair, my rage and anger took over my whole body.  I have always looked for validation from others, I am definitely black or white in my thinking, I suffer from extreme emotions of abandonment issues.  I will end a relationship or friendship at times and think ong what did I just do?? I am intelligent, have a professional career  and yet I think I am nothing one minute and the next I think our office would operate without me. I just turned 50 with 2 adult children.  I have been married 4times.  I have no parents my mom was killed in a drinking driving accident my dad left me at 6...back in my life a few times . Once my 2 children born our relationship ship ended due to his alcoholism. I asked him to call when he was sober...that was over 25years ago. I still to this day wonder why I was not good enough...for my Dad to call me? Or has he not had a sober day in the past 25yrs... I have been told that I am resilient and strong willed stubborn the list is long. I am passionate, loving and fun. I am truly a kind, loving generous person.  Then... it happens the rage over the smallest thing happens. I rant and rage hurting only the ones I love the most. Hurting my husband the most... after I am so sorry and wish I could take it back. I have had and extremely bad week ...nightly arguing with my husband o phone. He has been away 10 days now working to save jobs for 250 people. I have been here sending text , blocking him then telling him I love him etc. I have lost my mind. During the past 3 days I have returned to work at our office as I was working from home. All the pressures and the uncertainty if my husband will get suspended as his boss is wondering omg what is wrong with your wife?? Our 2 yr anniversary on july 01. Well today something I have never experienced.  My whole body in numb. Like a faint pins and needles. I feel like my inside is hollow. I have never felt like this before. I desperately want to gain coping skills and stratagems for a better life. 


Long read my apologies it was not meant to so long🤷‍♀️"
959,So yesterday I had a horrible day and I'm coming to the realisation I'll probably be breaking up for good with my significant other of two years. I feel so angry at myself for not being able to be enough for her and for cheating on her when she was faithful to me. I can't stop thinking about it and I won't get her back probably. I feel so infuriated for not being diagnosed before and avoiding all this suffering.
960,"Hi all
I have been told that’s i have BPD personality traits but not BPD, on top of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. I have also been discharged from services and adviced to get therapy. Feeling worried about my next steps"
961,"I got into a verbal chess match today about nothing, had me worked up until I traced where the actual frustration was, it wasn't anger, to me anger is secondary, there is something underneath it.  The feeling has been brewing for about a week, feeling less than human, can't find work, running out of money etc...

Once I figured it out, I felt better and was able to apologise. Instead of yelling or swearing, I did my best passive aggressive chuckle, which I learned while I was married.  Turns out that I can be less than understanding (jerk) when in fact I just want people to understand (notice) that I'm a human being.  I had a counselor suggest that I always look at my part in any given situation, whether wrong or right, what did I do to contribute.  This advice has helped me immensely, I am able to work out why I do what I do, I still make mistakes but I'm getting better at not repeating them.  As always, I'm grateful for a place to put my thoughts."
962,Since I had the idea I am a bad person I feel so ill. All night I was lying in bed feeling so distressed. I tried acknowledging my feelings and accepting them. I woke feeling the same. I tried to talk about it to my partner. He kept telling me I am not a bad person but I cannot shake the feeling I need to punish myself. He was suspicious I was going to self harm and told me it hurts him when I do it. It has been so hard not doing it. I just want to hurt myself and punish myself. I hate myself so much. I am so messed up and emotional. All I can think of is how much I want to die. I am so useless and stupid. I hate feeling so empty and sad and emotional. :(
963,I have had Favourite People but I find I obsess about people. I love them one minute and hate them the next and if I feel they are kind I then feel guilty about hating them but it's always short lived. I think that is how I describe my relationships with people. I obsess about them and feel they are important to my well being.
964,My feelings towards people are all over the place. When I hate them I want to grab their shoulders and dig my nails in and scream right in their faces. When I love them I hate myself and want to do the same to myself.
965,"Hi, last year i found out about borderline personality disorder and it seemed to make alot of things i was struggling with make sense, especially when looking at quiet type borderline. The black and white thinking(i can go from thinking highly of someone than one bad thing happens, in my head or not and i'll think they hate me causing me to run to avoid rejection), constant need of reassurances, feelings of emptyness, sudden kind of out of nowhere mood shifts, and having very intense emotions towards things good or bad(but bad ones are really bad), and i use to be suicidal(attempted once), and very reckless with money although the last two i don't struggle with as much anymore.

So i went to a new psychiatrist(it had been a few years since i saw one) told them about my depression and social anxiety issues and asked if they could give me an evaluation on if i had bpd. They never gave me a full evaluation but just asked me some questions and had me explain my symptoms and told me they see alot of borderline traits in me but never gave a full diagnosis that i'm aware of but did go about treating me for it and suggested i seek therapy, and put me on risperidone for the bpd symptoms. So i explained all my issues to my new therapist and how i was being treated and she at the very least saw alot of traits as well and was starting my therapy with the goals of improving depression, social phobia, and interpersonal relationships.

Now it's been a few months of me going to therapy and i guess i just wanted final verification on if i have a bpd diagnosis so asked her what all she would diagnosis me with, but didn't seem to want to go with a full diagnosis of bpd but did say how she saw alot of the traits(we had been discussing issues that are tied to bpd, so we knew i had atleast some of the issues in our talks) but that i should just focus on symptoms as with time those can change and thus change a possible diagnosis. She seemed kinda like she didn't want me to worry about having a bpd label.

So basically i'm curious if this is any common of a thing where you'll be treated for alot of traits of bpd but maybe not being given a full diagnosis. I guess in my head i just wanted a yes or no answer but am kinda in a mixed area where i'm not sure if there's a full diagnosis or not, and just kinda worried that if i do have full diagnosis i'm only being treated for having traits, although maybe that's ultimately the same thing? So sorry for the long ramble and history lesson on myself when i just needed to ask how other people came about getting diagnosed and if my situation is possibly common. Thank you for reading."
966,"I hurt myself a few days ago, broke my ring finger on my left hand, busted up my knuckles, and smacked my head pretty bad. I've felt worse so I brushed it off and am going on my with my life. 

but Ive started having tunnel vision randomly throughout the last few days and I think its related to my fall. my eyes are already my weakest sense (I have a series of issues with them) and am kind of nervous that something is actually wrong.

I'm waiting a few more days before I make an appointment but I just want you guys to help me panic less. I have anxiety and its making me stress but it could be nothing."
967,"So, I have started therapy for my BPD. Finally. This is VERY HARD and I have been in bits.

The other day I got into total overwhelm and emailed my therapist for help. Not sure exactly what I wanted but I was in a state. Tried to be cool in email but I wasn’t cool. He still hasn’t replied like 3 days later and I’m now wondering whether he really cares. Is it just my BPD or is he a charlatan?! it never ends. this mind feels so broken and im tired and exhausted of dealing but deal I must. 

I’m really worried i’m overloading my wife who i love so much because i’m in one of those phases where the pain doesn’t cease. I’m yet to really learn or practice pain management/avoidance skills as i’m just so used to giving in to the way my mind is. it’s just easier sometimes after all these years of denial, confusion and fear.

On a lighter note, thank you for being here for me. I can tell from just a few threads that there are some quality people in here with big BPD hearts. Bless you.

Bilbo"
968,"Yesterday I got in an argument with my mother and now I feel disgusted in myself. There's nobody to blame but me in this situation and I don't feel sorry for myself. Yes, I know that I'm not in the best head space, but it gives me no right to act so disrespectfully. Instead of harming myself, I decided to take an approach that would benefit me in the long run. I thought that taking a vow of silence would not only help me learn to be a better listener, but also help me think about how actions speak louder than words. I haven't done this before and it can be challenging at first, but I'm willing to give it a try. I'm not doing this out of pity or spite, I'm doing this as a personal exercise that'll help me appreciate my voice. Words are a powerful thing though and I've learned that the hard way. Be careful what you say and how you say it because there will be people that won't forget them. I agree that I've been the victim and then again, I've been the perpetrator too. I just want to be a better person and have balance between myself and others. I'm tired of feeling sickeningly guilty whenever I do something for myself or don't feel like I'm doing enough for others.

So, with this vow of silence, I'm signing off. Wish me luck!"
969,I'm struggling to be ok. I keep fluctuating between being ok and feeling this intense sadness and depression which leads to suicidal thoughts. I have support but i can tell its hard for my boyfriend. I just want to be ok.
970,"Simple guidelines to a better mental health


Take a few minutes to read and apply these guidelines to your emotional health and become free of the anxiety that plagues your mind.

1. Free yourself of negative thoughts.
   Channel a positive memory or emotion. 

2.  Abstain from self harm. 
 Self harm not only hurts yourself but your environment and others around you.

3. Think clearly.
  Thinking clearly can help accomplish tasks that may feel overwhelming.

4. Say NO when feeling uncomfortable.
   Saying no when feeling uncomfortable is a great way of keeping a positive attitude. 

5. Practice good decision making skills.
   A mistake is not a mistake if a good decision is made prior. Instead it becomes a negative thought or emotion to overcome.

6. Practice forgiveness.
  Being patient helps overcome guilt or shame when practicing forgiveness.

7. Be sympathetic always.
   Show emotional support towards other people and yourself.

8. Accept short comings.
    Whether it is a mental or physical shortcoming, accepting it may be just what is needed to overcome it. 
 
9. Dont dwell in the past instead make a fictional happy place to retreat to. Worrying about the past only gets in the way of your future.

10. Be open to suggestions and help that others offer you. 

11. Abstain from anger. 
 Practicing any kind of abstaince can result in more positive outcomes.

12. Acknowledge accomplishments. 
   Acknowledging yourself does not mean you are full of yourself, just that you are proud of your accomplishments. 

13. Build good self esteem. 
  Building your self esteem gives you more control of your surroundings.

14. Socialize responsibly. 
  By being responsible you are less likely to have negative thoughts.

15. Keep healthy.
   Being healthy doesnt just mean mentally when in your recovery. You have to be physically healthy to. Try some exercises like stretching and meditation to maintain a balanced health.

16. The last step is to remember when one chapter ends, try to always start new one."

My mistake was telling him about it, as that then makes him feel like he is missing out on the party. But it isnt fun for me, when I drink its because I'm depressed. I can tell he is drinking every day because he is becoming moody and easily irritated.

I told my Mum I want to commit suicide. The reasons I haven't done it yet is because I'm scared of dying and I'm scared of what's after. Also a little bit because I know it would destroy my family, but I don't think about that as much. I said to her that I'm just floating about in life not knowing what I want or where I'm going, waiting for that last push I need to commit. Until then I will suffer all day every day.

I don't know what I want from this thread, I'm not expecting replies because it's not really that type of thread. I think it just helps me to get it out of my head.

Thanks for reading.:thanks:"
978,"Today is an awkward day for me and I think you can figure out why. I have been going to therapy since January and have had progress but it's always short-lived. I currently live with my parents in a decent neighborhood of townhouses. It isn't picture perfect and does affect me emotionally due to being in close proximity to people 24/7.  I can hear children playing, cars honking, and a distant but loud train every day. This leads to frequent headaches and drowsiness which worsens my depression, so I prone to taking a few naps a day. My dad has always been oblivious to my personal life and has never bothered to get to know me as a person. Throughout my childhood, he always made me fearful of him and so I never felt like I could be myself. During grade school, there were times when I had emotional outbursts due to stress and has physically harmed me. As a matter of fact, he smacked me on many occasions, more so than when I was a teenager. At 14, he bought me a guitar but never bothered giving me lessons. I just playing whatever whenever. I wasn't open about what interested me growing up because I was afraid of being judged by him, so I repressed them. I had an interest in singing and knew of a woman he happened to recognize from years prior. She was born-again Christian and since I've had bad experiences with religion, I told her I was Buddhist. She didn't listen to me. She made me sing traditional folk songs and read me scriptures when I felt depressed, it was torture. I never progressed vocally and she was eventually fired for fraud.
Whenever I've had a dream, my dad has always found a way to crush it. After this encounter, I had a few more teachers that my dad either knew or chose and they weren't nice to me. One vocal teacher told me, ""Well, just because you love to sing doesn't mean anything will come of it."" Then the next guy was a guitar teacher who always forced me to smile and harass me about my inability to be happy. I ran into him at a music store and admitted he was stalking me. One of the guys at the music store who knew my dad also harassed me and his excuse? Trying to get me to come out of my shell. My dad never stood up for me and he just let it happen! Now, I still want to make music and perform but have crippling anxiety and lack of confidence. I have a feeling that my voice is also destroyed due to singing improperly. He knows I still want to pursue music and has called me a ""proser"".

I don't know what to do and it makes me suicidal. He has convinced me that it's my fault and that he's right about me. I don't know what to believe other than that there's nothing worth fighting for. I'm just a wannabe and that's all I'll ever be."
979,"I have felt mostly numb and irritated whilst at work today.

Then at home, my emotions were great, almost utopian, as I played my guitar and taught myself some new songs.

After which I went for a drive and got super depressed, a particular song came on and then I realised how alone I was on that nightly drive.  I felt despair, I had suicidal thoughts in my head, I felt directionless, confused about who I was and what I wanted from life. I was on the verge of tears but can never seem to cry out loud.   It makes me feel like a robot.

I'm scared this is a pattern I am stuck in and in ten years I will be still bitching about the same problems, forever trying to climb out of the quicksand.

I wish I was going to bed in a better mood."
980,"that i would end my life if he left me?
nobody understands what he has done/does for me x"
981,I live with my best friend and we talk all the time. She knows about my diagnosis and she understands the feelings that I struggle with. I'm a quiet borderline so most of my aggression is directed inwards. I was texting her last night because she was still spending time with her dad and she still wasn't home when I went to bed. When I got home from work today she wasn't home. I've texted her but she hasn't responded. She's also opened a snap that I sent her today but no texts or communication. I know she's an adult with her own life and she doesn't have to text back immediately. My rational brain understands this. But my emotional brain can't help but feel abandoned. What if she's mad at me? What if she doesn't want me in her life anymore? What did I do wrong? I feel so lost
982,"I was doing well for a while controlling my emotions when people are around, but recently I have been failing. 

 I am so tired of how often my moods change during a day.  I can start in a great mood, then something happens and it changes in an instant, then I feel ok again a while later, but not in as good a mood as at the start of the day, 

then once something else upsets me it really affects how I feel and act, I cannot control it, my mood is down.  

Then someone says something that annoys me and I get angry.  It's like this constantly, I am so tired of it.  

There is one person at work who intentionally tries to affect my mood, he pushes and pushes and I know now he is doing it to get a reaction, then he goes to someone and tells them I have issues.

I've gone from a good mood this morning, to coming home and crying with frustration and disappointment, god knows what some people at work think of me, no one cares to ask what's wrong."
983,"I'm so tired of feeling like a loser. Nobody wants to deal with me because they're all sick of me. I went on an evening walk with my brother and my neighbor was there. She has a history of bullying me online and in person. She has literally made it her goal to make sure I'm reminded to hold my breath. Her mother also has a grudge against me for no reason because she believes her demon spawn of a daughter. My brother and I were several feet behind her and went were walking back home we saw her walking alone with her mother several yards behind her. She basically called her mother to come to walk with because she probably felt ""threatened"" by us. We weren't even trying to stalk her, she just happened to be outside when we were, but she acts like she's the victim. She bullied me as a minor, A MINOR. There's nothing I can do because she's got college degrees, a good reputation, and start-up business. She literally has a squeaky clean and cultured facade she uses as a disguise so she can use and dispose of people whenever she wants. I know I can literally choose not to care, but she still torments me because she literally pretended to be my friend and mentor. She literally charmed me into being her friend and her mother was in on it the whole time and called me her ""experiment"" and nobody would believe me because she's Bosnian. She has a rocky background and before she moved to my city, she lived only several miles from here. I'm feeling suicidal because my mother literally gives me no chance to speak on what bothers me and I can't help but come across as rhetoric and aggressive. It's like I'm supposed to suffer in silence and wear a mask if I want crap in my life to work out. I'm just so sick and tired of being blamed and made to feel like a loser. I'm. Fed. Up."
984,I do not know if this is mental health related but a lot of the time I feel like a piece of hair or an insect is on me. All night I have felt a piece of hair is on my face. I checked the mirror and keep rubbing my face but there is nothing there. It feels so uncomfortable and really stressful. It is just so weird. Does anybody else get this?
985,"I was so stressed , nervous, sad, angry by no reason. I was feelin so impulsive. At time I'm writin this I feel stable by no reason too. Is rare, I feel so so rare. I'm in control of me, of me and my impulses. I don't give a sh#$"" about vicious. Dunno If me would feel stable more time till a next trigger.  Sorry for slang."
986,I suffer with memory loss. Today memories came back were my ex often wanted to spend time with his family but I was hurt and upset thinking he should want to spend all his free time with me. I never had close family or friends and thought if he loved me he would want to be with me all the time. Now I can see how unhealthy this is and I feel so guilty. I told my current partner and he said I was the same with him when we first met but he made me realise it is healthy for him to have friends. I asked my partner if I was being controlling with that behaviour and he said I was. I feel so guilty and sick thinking I was controlling. I was just so lonely and afraid of being abandonded that I ended up acting that way. I feel such a bad person. Now I am wondering if I am actually like those people you hear about who are abusive to their partners.
987,"Hello 😊
I want to ask person who are diagnosed with BPD about friends. Do you have alot of friends and it is easy for you to make ones? If you do does friendship last long? And if you don't have alot or any I would like to hear your toughts why. 

I appreciate all your answers.😊
P. S. I'm not an english speaker."
988,"I'm sorry everyone I must be giving you whiplash.

I applied for an internship and I'm thinking g of applying for more. No more menial jobs. Trying to step toward my career. Even though I won't be graduating on time.

I took some stuff even though I said I wouldn't.

I think I'm spinning out. I'm up and down like crazy."
989,"How to deal impulsivity. I try, but this mornin' I eat a lot of sugar and cake and I bug a guy from the past for no reason and he blocked me. Yesterday I was in deepness today I'm hyperactive.  There a nature way or something.

EDIT: I don't know why I bug that guy, I try to be better person everyday. Holy damn."
990,Do you have one? What is it like for you? I guess I always had one but not sure if they are good for me.
991,"I met a man on one of the gay dating apps recently. Like me, he's very open and honest about his feelings and we've become very emotionally intimate in a very short amount of time. I was feeling borderline suicidal one day and I just poured everything out to him. He mostly just listened but talked about having similar experiences and emotions. I think I felt truly understood for the first time in my life. 

He kept talking about staying positive and it really resonated. I've been feeling very good about myself for the last few weeks, after a long sustained period of depression. I feel like he's the man I've been looking for all my life. Something I never got from my father, my brother, or any other man.

The thing is, I've started developing feelings for him, but I know it's not normal to be in love with someone this soon. I haven't even met him in person yet (next week I'm hoping). I keep telling myself it's the BPD, that all the validation is like a drug to me. 

I just can't stop feeling like this is going to end very badly and I'm scared. I'm scared I'll screw this up with my usual BPD behavior. I'm scared it will end on a bad note and I'll be left alone once again and feeling suicidal."
992,"I'm an older sister of a younger brother. We're about 5 years apart, I'm a late 90's kid and he's an early 2000's one. He's still in high school and has a variety of both close friends and acquaintances, yet, he's a quiet kid. We have this tradition of going on a long night walks to discuss our thoughts and feelings about life. We've had successful walks where everything we've said is practically telepathic and unsuccessful ones where we've argued over nothing. It's one of the activities we do that strengthens the bond between us, as well as loosen up our nerves after a stressful or confusing day. Recently, about a week ago, he gave me a dilemma that involved him feeling like a sore thumb amongst his friends. He claimed that he felt left out because all his friends seem to have something interesting going on than he does. This struck a chord with me because I too have felt that way and still seem to. I'm an adult and haven't really had a best friend or a group of friends for that matter, so I both could and couldn't relate to him. I was a loner. I've dealt with on and off depression for years and with each year, I feel my mind slowly burning away like an oil lamp. He gave him advice (the advice I have yet to follow) and told him to banish the voices of all his friends and meditate on what he truly wants. I continued by encouraging him to write down anything that comes to mind, even if it looks strange on paper. I told him that if it looks strange to him to accept it and realize that's the real him talking without any other influences.

A few days pass and he told me, ""I did what you said and you changed my life."" His friend came to the door and they spent a few hours together. He recently told me he met a girl while over there and now he has a girlfriend. I literally gave him advice that I wish someone would've told me and I realized how pathetic my life is. I'm both happy and sad. I'm happy that I've made a profound impact on my brother whom I love immensely. Then again, I'm sad because I'm still feeling stuck and haven't had that a-ha moment yet. I'm glad about what I did, but why hasn't it happened to me and yet the answer came from me?"
993,I quit my job.
994,"I am dying!  I just don’t know how much more I can take, how much more my relationship can take, how much longer I can keep functioning at work.  I’m to the point that even what should be a fun weekend with friends is nothing but stressful. I have seen multiple doctors and psychiatrists and therapists since 2010 and no one can pinpoint an exact diagnosis and NO ONE CAN GET TJE MEDS RIGHT.  I’m miserable 3 weeks out of every month at best.  I have been doing all the things the doctors say I should be doing, circadian rhythm, exercise, eating right, that stupid dialectical Therapy book... it rocks my world every time they adjust meds. I’m at the end of my rope. The BPD traits seem to be what is effecting me most in quarentine.... I realize no one here can diagnose me or prescribe a medication but I am just curious what kind of meds you are on for BPD.  I over react to every little thing and take everything personally… Even when I know I’m being unreasonable, I can’t stop myself.  Does anyone else experience this specific symptom?  Is there a medication out there that will help that?  (DBT has NOT helped and I’ve tried multiple times).  Seriously, anything anyone could suggest would be so appreciated"
995,"I sometimes wish (like right now) I could step away from myself, not that I would want to be anyone else, just want to drift off, no thought, just the essence of being nothing. Just feeling unworthy of anything, this is temporary, I know, just hate when it hits."
996,"Hey, how do you deal with sudden feelings of overwhelming anxiety and dread? I was doing OK but all of a sudden I seem to be spiraling down again."
997,"So I keep zoning or dissociating in and out of my day today.. I seem to be loosing track of time or forget what I was doing altogether
Any one else experience this if so what do you find is a good way to level or even yourself out x"
998,"Hi. So ive been with my boyfriend in the house for 90 days or so due to covid. I really love him but It has been soooooo damn hard. We argue all the time, our discussions become circular and really frustrating and we go on for hours until we say something profoundly hurtful and thats when we make up. I know this is a harmful dynamic but we cant stop. This and feeling like I am not enough in anything that I do has me suicidal. . I feel it like a heat in my head and overwhelming selfhate thoughts. I started harming myself again. Sometimes I do it to calm me down. Nothing else calms me. Now, I feel More suicidal than ever. I am a rational person and I know this would be a horrible moment to kill myself and wont do that to my bf, mother, cat, but I had never wanted to die so bad. The impulse is so strong. I dont feel un control of anything and I feel all my life is messed up, I Let down everybody and dont deserve anything. I am on my meds and have had therapy for more than two years, despite that my bdp Is getting worse. Dont think there Is much more to do. I feel do guilty for having toxic behaviours and hurting my bf. I feel like a horrible person. Intrinsecally broken.
Words of wisdom, success stories, someone who feels like this, I guess anything (ir nothing) Will help.

Sorry for my lack of motivation or justo being whiny. Comming here and reading you makes me feel less alone"
999,"I have noticed when I feel things at an extremely high and overwhelming level. I got really upset and cried for such a long time, crying is rare for me, even more so at how long I had been crying for. I was standing and it was like I was frozen but I was looking around the room. I felt very strange because I knew I was there but it felt like time had stopped still."
1000,"So months ago my church made my favourite person (who also goes to my church) block me on social media to try to stop me from being so attached to him. I'm really suffering and haven't felt happiness since.  All I want to do is to talk to him. I miss him soooo much and I'm really suffering with a horrible, empty depressed feeling.  

Is there any way to make him not be my favourite person anymore so I can get rid of this suffering? 

Thanks :)"
1001,"I have been on an antidepressant and moodstabiliser for my bpd for about 15 years. It took many years of trying different medications to get the right combination. Suddenly my mood stabiliser (amisulpride) stopped working. I was given quetatine but could not tolerate it. That meant I had tried all the mood stabilisers. I was then given propernal (an antihistamine) which was to help me sleep and reduce anxiety. Even on half a tablet it was too sedating.

I am now just on my antidepressant (vortoxatine). I feel very depressed. I cannot face going back on a mood stabiliser as it caused me to be hungry all the time and I already have a binge eating disorder. I got many other horrid side effects too.

I am unable to do DBT as I cannot do group therapy. I have had many bouts of various therapy and next week I start my third bout of CAT. My question is, is it possible to just be on an antidpressant? I am concerned this clinical depression will not lift.

Thank you so much to anybody who has read this."
1002,"Hi Everyone -

Through reading a number of self-help books and better understanding the illness the last couple months, I've come to the indefinite conclusion that it stems from my mother's side of the family and the deep traumas that lie within. Histories of drug addiction, suicide, and potentially sexual abuse. This side of the family has been neglectful to look at these issues head on. If both my mother and I have BPD does it make it increasingly difficult for us to attain stability in our relationship if she is not medicated and in therapy as well?"
1003,"I was having a good day at work today, until this afternoon when one of the guys who is so annoying asked me if something had come in and I said yes, he said so it's come in? when? So I looked up the date and told him.  He said so it came in then, I said yes again. 

He then said do you know where it is, I said I know it's in the warehouse but I don't know where in there  but so and so does he put it away, if you ask him.  

He then left the room to take a phone call, he came back in and said so to carry on our conversation has the stuff come in then?.  I said yes it's in, I have said yes 3 times now! I'm afraid my tone was clearly annoyed. 

So he just looked at me and then walked away.  I kicked myself after for getting annoyed, I have been doing good recently by not reacting to things and pausing,  talking to myself to tell myself not to react and it had been going well, so I feel bad about myself for failing. 

There's nothing more from him for the rest of the day, however an hour later I accidentally left my cup on a cabinet and forgot I put it there, 

I got told off by one of the managers for leaving it there and I said it must have been when I was on the way to the kitchen and stopped to pick something off the floor then forgot about the cup.  

He then said that's not good enough I put it in the sink for you, you need to be careful because of Covid 19 and that's the 2nd time in a week I have had to pick your cup up from somewhere it shouldn't be. I'll drop a grenade in here if you do it again.

  Like it was the worst thing in the world to do, I felt like crap since and it's played on my mind. Why would he say that. That's horrible."
1004,I changed my mind
1005,"that I always become friends on forums (generally i mean) where my friends keep getting in trouble? Not just here i'm talking about all forums i been on then i get dealt with ""by association"" like ""this member did something and this member is friends with the one that did something, we beter put her on our watch list as well (best case scenario) or ""we better get the punishments out against both members"" even if literally the only thing i did was be friends with members who got in trouble

as i said i am talking about all the forums i been on"
1006,After I had therapy yesterday I cried and cried. I rarely cry so this was strange to me. I hate myself so much and it stems from the way my parents raised me. Today I feel so sad and coped by overeating. Now I feel really guilty and ashamed for turning to food. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up but I know that is impossible. I struggle with my self hatred.
1007,"Hi there everyone. As the header suggests, I'm a newbie here looking for support and generally looking for others to chat to about my mental illness.

I've been treated for depression and anxiety in the past and been on and off antidepressants for years but I am still not feeling that I've made any progress.

It was just before Christmas that I discovered BPD and I am currently waiting for our mental health service to give me an appointment.

It says that I have to have at least 5 of the 9 symptoms, I can say that I have at least 8 and the 9th is still a possibility.

So, any help and an ear to listen would be truly appreciated"
1008,"Since I got out of the hospital two years ago I haven't felt like a real person. Everything is just going and I'm going with it, every day much the same and slowly I feel like I'm barely moving. I'm not out of control or ruining my own life but I'm living slowly in this never ending stretch of boredom. At worst Struggeling against my talent for failure but and at best making minor steps toward healing. I am bored of my life.

But now I'm in this chaotic space where my emotions are unstoppable moving like lightning up and down my disorder at it's best and worst. I'll destroy everything I touch but I was able get out of a bad situation.
I am advocating for myself and think I can pursue better than I had before but I also want to stay in bed forever.

I feel alive and miserable. 

Is this the best I can hope for? Is feeling better this soul crushing boredom? Or feeling alive is me barely surviving being crushed by repeating the trauma cycle and poverty?"
1009,"i feel a bit guilty coming on saying i feel bad when i havent been helping others
plus i feel like i have no right to feel bad

1010,"So haven't posted my full story yet.
Im 24 years old and moved out of my parents house about 8 months ago. My dad was extremely emotionally/physically abusive. Any time I messed up instead of teaching me how to fix things he would hit me and call me names. When I started my first job he would take the majority of my paycheck as ""rent"" but since I was being forced to stay with them through emotional manipulation I dont think it was fair. I kept trying to please the bastard but whenever I would try to do something for him he would criticize me about it. I ended up dating a girl who for the first year of our relationship seemed like the perfect girl but after the first year she started cheating on me and also emotionally manipulating me to make me think it was my fault. She would constantly accuse me or cheating on her and convinced the whole school (senior high school year) that she was the victim. Fast forward 8 years from then to current days I found a girl who really cares. But the emotional and physical abuse I got from my dad and my ex is still with me my parents are constantly trying to accuse me of abandoning them. My mom texts me frequently to tell me that I'm causing my dad stress and physical illnesses because I left and hurt him. And my dad constantly calls and texts me saying how I'm causing my mom high blood pressure and telling me I'm killing the both of them by leaving. (My dad was always relying on my income to pay his bills) 
All the emotional and physical abuse I got over the years has taken a toll on me and I recently got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder more often times than not I find myself hurting to the point of self harm and alcohol abuse. The girl I'm now with is my fiance and refuses to give up on me even tho my mental state causes alot of problems in our relationship. I'm always afraid that she's out cheating when she is late coming home and sometimes it leads me to think and say horrible things to her. I keep remembering the lyric
""I meant it when I said I wanna get well!"""
1011,"Hello,
Within NHS diagnosis can you have strong psychosis and just have a Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis? 
Psychosis can be part of BPD, but can it be as strong as believing in mind control, that the government is controlling one's own mind?
Or would that be only schizophrenia?
I have previously been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder within the NHS, but I think it was because they did not realise how strong and bad my psychosis was (I was too paranoid to tell them I was suffering mind control).
My GP now tells me I probably have schizophrenia. 
It is very confusing.
So just reaching out to see how psychotic people can be under the Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis? Can it include mind control? Or do I need to be reassessed like my GP thinks?
Many thanks."
1012,"Hey everyone,

I'm feeling very down and unhappy. I can't find any joy in life at the moment. I'm fed up with everything and everyone in my life. 

I think I'm feeling life this because I had to stop taking some of my Quetiapine medication after it was causing me really serious side effects after recently being increased. 

Since I've decreased the Quetiapine dose my mood has plummeted. I'm at rock bottom. 

Can anyone give me some advice on how to make my mood better? 

Thanks in advance."
1013,"Just wanted to mention something a therapist said to me recently.

It is her view that every person in therapy (and not in therapy) are trying their best given the situation they find themselves. I find this really refreshing from the messages of ""you don't want to try"" or ""you don't want to change"". She went on to say that despite this we still need to try harder to solve our problems and maintain our motivation. At first it made no sense. How can you be trying your best AND still be expected to try harder?

Then it made sense. When you are at the gym and you start with 5kg weights, that is all you can lift at the start. If you all do, however, is lift 5kg for the next 10 years you will only ever lift 5kg. She meant that whilst I am trying my hardest I still need to push that extra little bit further to move to the next stage. 

Any thoughts on this dialectic of ""trying my hardest"" versus ""need to try harder""?"
1014,"I know I haven't been around much, I have been stuck in depression since christmas. Not being able to concentrate or focus on anything. Jumping from one activity to another without finishing, clinging on to the people I know for company and companionship. Neglecting myself, waiting for court....
Final hearing started on 17th February. On the 19th I testified. 3 hours on the stand with 1 5 minute break. I did not crumble. My barrister and support worker were really proud of me. 
There were some problems with the medical evidence relating to the injuries my baby presented with, which means his final hearing has been put back until 31st of March, but they went ahead with proceedings for my oldest son as waiting for a year and his separation from me has taken its toll on him. 
The judge decided that he should be returned to my care 😁❤
I know there are people on the forum who will want to know what happened
I hope now I can start to get my life back on track and get back into a routine ❤"
1015,"Hello, when I reached out for help to the CMHT (GP referral) I fell sick after an assessment by two senior staff, and due to this illness became unable to leave my house.  At this point I was informed home care might help.  This involved being allocated a care coordinator.  At first I was excited to have support at last, and it didn’t matter that I was stuck indoors.
Huh, how THAT cheerful optimism soon changed.

Cut a long story short, I have had a false diagnosis out of nowhere by this (very young) CCO (care coordinator) of alleged EUPD.  I haven't been assessed.  This girl just made it up. 

Have been too sleepy (long story regarding council landlord neglect) to continue working with the advocate (who has kindly agreed to keep the case on pause while I am sick), but I want to ask,

has anyone else had a false diagnosis?   By this I mean no assessment to determine even what illness you might have, as in my case.

I had just a randomly written Care plan, with strange and mostly false information and even wrong date!  Has anyone else had this type of experience with mental health staff?"
1016,"I'm trying to not say fuck it and throw away my whole life. 
Its typical of me for 1 bad thing to lead to me sabatoging everything. And right now that's the last thing I need.
I was late to work yesterday (3hrs) because i was just stayed in bed. I don't like my job anyway I'm bad at everything anyway. 
But i ended up going in (even though it was really late) cried a little which made me feel humiliated and now I want to quit again. But I got up and came to work today. 
I haven't talked to anyone people keep texting and I don't know what to say so I say nothing. I don't really have it in me to try and modulate my own feelings for them so I'm isolating to the extreme. 
My emotions are out of control. 
I'm trying to just focus on hour to hour  and not focus too much on the future or any what ifs 
Maybe I should just quit and move to a whole new province and start a new life nobody from my past will even know."
1017,"Hello
I’m new here and trying to connect with others who will hopefully understand. Recently the empty feeling that usually lives under my rib cage has been growing and I’m starting to feel it almost everywhere. My purpose in life and place in the world doesn’t exist right now. This is not something I can easily explain to just anyone and I don’t really have have many people to talk to except my therapist. Hopefully some of you may also understand this feeling. As much as I would never wish this feeling on anyone, I hope I am not alone. What do you do with this feeling? How do you cope?"
1018,"So I am currently diagnosed with 'EUPD traits' as I am awaiting a full mental health assessment.  However I do suspect that this is what I have. 

The question I want to ask is you know how this is often caused by childhood abuse? How old is too old to go through something to be affected in that way, if that makes sense. It's just because I have had a stable childhood until age 15 when I was sexually abused and harassed by an ex boyfriend. Was I too old to develop potential EUPD from this? I hope that makes sense. 

Also I'm new here so I would appriciate someone to chat to about this and things I have been through in general."
1019,"I dunno why. I was sad yesterday and in deepness, out of reality my brain was no workin. Now im ok I don't give a sh### about vicious."
1020,"Maybe I should've just let it go. I'm feeling pretty alone right now and I'm on the edge of quitting my job and falling into a depression. 

I saw my mom today shes sad she didnt say it but she is. I don't want to make my mom sad. 

I mean it could've been worse I've survived much worse.

Plus I feel really alone.

Have I ever sounded more bpd? I have no idea what I'm doing."
1021,"So I have BPD...

but I am also caring, giving, generous, a good listener, loyal, I am kind to animals and children, I care about family, I hate injustice to anyone, I am organised, smart, self sufficient, I work hard, I am creative.

So BPD is not all I am, we all have some good qualities, what are yours.."
1022,"I don't know who might need this today but this verse in one of my favorite songs has helped me through some really hard times I hope it helps someone who might need it

Listen- I know it's simplified from the other side
It's easy to gloss over all the messy reasons why
And it's easy to forget where you've been
I guess that's what the scars are for, huh?
When we were 15 we wouldn't dare let that shit be seen
But now it seems mutalation's gone mainstream
I see you at my shows, scarred up from head to toe
Like there's no point even trying not to let it show
Cause we all know, emo kids like to hurt themselves
Too many feelings and not enough self control
And I mean, does this mess any of the rest of you
It's an epidemic and we're cool with it, don't question it
But it bothers me, our scars are currency by which we're measured
Like let the record show who let it slip and who held it together
*moderation* and *moderation* and honorable mentions
Posers who still *moderation* themselves up for the attention
I don't care your intentions, I just want you to know
My self-hatred never took me where I wanted to go
And at the end of the day, you know I still had to face
That I can pick at the pain, but can't *moderation* it away
And you know what else I can't do is give you ten good reasons not to
I've racked my brain for clever sayings of all the things you ought to do
But you know, I think if there was something I could say
They'd have thrown it on a brochure- and sent you on your way
So I'll keep doing what I always do: drag my heart to the piano and make it sing for you
I'll keep doing what I always do: drag my heart to the piano and let it sing for you"
1023,"So, there's this childhood classmate I ran into back in 2018. I have since seen him but never had the chance to confess that I wanted to reconnect and hang out sometime. He works at our grocery store, so he talks to my parents quite frequently. Since at the time it was quarantine (today's our state's final day of it), my father thought he'd do me a favor and give him my phone number (big mistake!) He did this on Sunday and I was excited to talk to him. I wanted to get to know him as a friend because I don't develop feelings until I've known them for a while, so I saw no harm in what was happening, neither did my parents. Monday came and went. Then on Tuesday night my dad came back from running an errand and said that he had a girlfriend and she found my number. My dad continued on saying that he told his girlfriend I was a ""childhood classmate"" and that he didn't know me personally. I can understand from her perspective but on the same note, I still felt cheated because I waited too long. Now, I don't know what will come of it since I didn't ask my father to do it, he did it to make me happy. I have been depressed and in need of some company, so you know what it's like to have parents who want to see you smile again. It actually kind of broke my heart and now I don't know what to do. I just keep thinking how happy he must already be and maybe I'm better off without him. All I know is that I wish I would've reached out sooner because now I feel like I'm intruding on someone else's relationship, despite it only being friendship."
1024,"I probably won't update for a bit after this but I wanted the people who asked to know that I'm safe and have a place to stay for a couple weeks. 
I've been talking to shelters and victims services to see if they can help me find a place. 
If anything changes I'll let you know but for now its just navigating services. 
Ps. I picked up my cat so atleast I have him with me."
1025,"Fifteen years ago I was in the hospital and diagnosed Bipolar NOS. For the past three years I have been questioning that diagnosis. After doing a lot of research and reading books, I relate a great deal more with borderline than bipolar.

Has anyone else been misdiagnosed as bipolar or has a dual diagnosis? I’m fairly confused."
1026,"Hoping someone with bpd can let me know if they go through similar or anyone who knows about it can give me their opinion my dad mentioned last year he believes I may have it and finally going to doctors tomorrow and mention it hopefully get a serious diagnosis...

my name is J.
I have stuggled with mental health since around 11 onwards
I have been to countless doctors
I have been diagnosed with anxiety/depression but a lot of symptoms I believe match up with borderline personality disorder.
Tried lots of medication etc...

Firstly I have had a history of trauma since young and a lot of different things still impact me today and find it hard to cope and not hang on to the past (which I really do want behind me) but believe reason I can’t is because I still haven’t dealt with a lot of what’s in my mind.

I am very Impulsive and has at times caused me problems in life, I don’t think things through or if I do decide to change my mind but can’t because I’ve already had the impulse.

I have the most manic moods when I do get stressed/upset/anxious and often verbally attack whoever is closest to me without realising how mean I’m being I can scream and throw things or sometime I try not to let it out and if I feel like I’m going to reach that point I will hit myself very hard because I can’t cope with the pain that’s inside me

or I will be severely depressed and tell ppl who are close to me I want to die which is not nice and hate myself for it I feel like I’m trying to get help and am scared because of how impulsive I am and how low i get at times.

one of the biggest signs I may have bpd for me is that I do see people in very back and white. I either think you’re amazing or nasty person. No invetween. It’s hard because I can judge people as bad even though I don’t know them vice versa. When I say I see everything as either black or white that’s even with even my own family. they can be the best and really love me or if they hate me and are sick of me and want me to leave them alone.

I am attached to people too quick and find it hard to be alone, I struggle in social situations at times and will go through conversations I have had blaming myself for things I might have done wrong or thinking someone said something to deliberately hurt me.

I feel really bad for the way I am and don’t want to be toxic/affect people negatively and hope I will change I try really hard to not let the way I am effect myself or people that’s why I think it may be a personality disorder
Deep down I am a kind and helpful human I think my mental health just get in the way :(
 
anyone’s opinions will greatly be appreciated and just want to talk to others about it

 also think I might have a sort of PTSD and cant cope with sudden loud noises from people (doesn’t even have to be that loud) my anxiety goes the the roof and go into defence mode even if there is no danger???"
1027,"""whats wrong with me when happy hurts""

Never before have I heard a lyric that spoke so much to me. I recently got diagnosed with BPD my fiance actually was the one who suggested I get therapy. For the longest time I didn't understand myself and my emotions and why I acted the way I did. My fiance is an angel she stuck with me through so many heart aches. I'm looking for advice from anyone who knows what BPD feels like."
1028,"I am against medication for BPD, I don't believe there is any medication that helps a BPD personally and actually there is no medication recommended for a BPT.  

I know there is a couple of therapies  for BPD, one is DBT and CBT.  One or the other can work for some, but if not what do you do, you can visit a psychotherapist if you can afford it, or try to manage your emotions.  

I have got better at managing my emotions recently, I can control them more than I used to , although there are still times that the emotion just comes out, such as anger and I react if someone I know does something that hurts me, it is like I forget all the times they are nice to me and focus on the time they are horrible. I go from liking or loving them to hating them the next and it shows, that is hard to control. How I feel about myself is hard to control, like berating myself -did I do or say the wrong thing etc.  also and I have abandonment issues.

I hate the term borderline, it makes people think you are on the edge of craziness or something, which is why I don't announce it, it could change how they feel about you, make them on edge or notice every little thing you do and say that's because she's borderline.  It gives you a label.

Interesting statistic and this is quite a lot of people with BPD...

Around 1 in 100 people have BPD in UK, more women than men are more likely to be given this diagnosis."
1029,"I WILL NEVER BE OK NEVER EVER EVER IM RUINED AND GOD HAS MADE THIS LIFE NOTHING MORE THAN A PUNISHMENT. I THINK ITLL BE OK AND THEN IT ISNT THATS THE JOKE OF IT ALL. I CANT LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE  WITH THIS ITLL NEVER BE OK.I DONT WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE EVER 
IM DONE 
I WANT TO BE DEAD"
1030,"I left. 
I just packed a bunch of my stuff and left. I decided that even if I am wrong and he wasn't trying to mess with me by deliberately setting off my PTSD that he's the reason i have it and i cant live in the same house with him.
I'll let you know when I figure out where I'm going."
1031,"I've tried to make friends and reconnect with people. I've tried getting my life back together but it falls apart. Maybe I haven't tried enough and have just given up on it all. I'm distracted by every little thing and my mental disorder gives me a short-term memory. I honestly believe I'm getting dumber every day. I'm hopeless.

I thought venting out my problems would help me but I feel like everyone knows too much now. Whenever there's a problem I need a vent, I question if it's even worth it. I know, it's exasperating! I need to step away from this for a while instead of presenting a new problem all the time, like, what is it now? I literally have nobody to talk about anything, so I feel like a total airhead whenever I need to talk to someone. I wish I could put it plainly, but having borderline has made me into stark raving, attention-seeking nuance who can't decide if she loves or hates people. I feel so annoying and codependent on everyone's reassurance, to the point where I'm paranoid and uptight. I'm so overwhelmed by my desperate need for validation and action that I could just scream. I'll never know myself until I starve my insecure critic and then who knows what'll happen, maybe I'll have a life? I just need to walk away for a long while, wish me luck."
1032,Oh sweet death i welcome you with open arms make this as painless as can be for ive had to much pain in my life not much longer oh sweet death i welcome you
1033,"Does anyone else get overwhelmed by the emotion they are experiencing? Today has been a bit rough, in that I am feeling extra emotional, and it just feels like every little thing makes me want to break down and cry. I've steadily felt that crying feeling behind my eyes (not sure if that makes sense to anyone else?), and I cannot seem to make it go away. I just hate how intense my emotions can get, especially when I know they are out of line/I am being 'ridiculous'. I don't really have a reason to feel this way, and yet at the same time I cannot seem to help it. Maybe I just need to let go, and have a good cry..."
1034,"I sometimes wonder why, outside of my family, why I desire/deserve someone to love me. Being borderline I've done so much unhealthy bonding with the opposite sex that I question ""why try again?"".  I'm 49, my borderline is way smaller than it used to be, I still have panicked moments, scared of even saying hi and then thinking ""they are probably a stuck up asshole"", or ""they could never like me anyway."". Even with this thinking, I still want someone reasonably ""healthy"".  Someone that I could talk to like I'm writing here, someone safe-ish, no one is perfect and I've learned what gray areas are, took like 40 years.  This will probably should pathetic, but I want someone I could cry in front of without being embarrassed.  I haven't cried in 7 years, don't know why, it just won't happen.  I just got out of prison a week ago and found out my ex is married and has had a kid, I'm happy for her.  I know that if we had stayed together she would had never gained what she has now, I'm grateful that she was strong enough to walk away.  I just needed to write, get it out, maybe one day I'll get what she has.  There is a movie quote from The perks of being a wallflower, ""we accept the love we think we deserve"".  I'm now at a point where I think I deserve better than what I've done in the past.  Thank for letting me write"
1035,Im serious when i say this I have nothing to live for ive lost everything. Ive tried picking myself back up It doesn't work so here i sit with so many ways to end It but im to much of a coward
1036,"Hi. Has anyone found lamotrigine any good for treatment of bpd. 
Have had to come off amisulpride due to high hormone levels 
Only started on 50mg going up to l00mg gradually
Also on pregabalin for a year 
Really struggling with suicidal thoughts since stopping amisulpride
How long will it take lamotrigine to kick in
Not really sure this the right medication for bpd
Thoughts please 
Many thanks"
1037,"Ok, I have just been told that I fit all the criteria of this condition but they wont say it is a disorder. I have an ""Emotionally Unstable Personality""  I'm good with this and feel like a light has been switched on. My Psychiatrist did comment on the fact that I have maintained a relationship with my husband for 20 years but I hastened to add that I totally believe this has everything to do with my husband's faith in me. I have sabotaged this relationship since day 1 but he has totally stood by me and he firmly believes what I do is totally out of my control and promises to stand by me so I am sitting on the fence regarding BPD causing you to not maintain relationships. This guy is holding on to me. Xx"
1038,"I am a 50 year old male and brand new to the forum. I'm not yet diagnosed with BPD but do exhibit  most of the traits. I am currently starting counseling with a therapist. My life has been filled with unstable relationships. A romantic relationship recently came to an end due to one of my ""episodes"" that resulted in a verbal outburst and some erratic behavior. 

I am embarrassed for what I did and for how I acted. I feel insurmountable guilt and shame for hurting her. She let me into her life and opened up to me. She loved me. I sabotaged that. 

It's taken me all these years to finally realized I've been the toxic one in many of my relationships. I've started the process towards seeking help and recovery. I'm committed to getting better. 

Right now, the feelings of shame and guilt are overwhelming. Has anyone else experienced this and any advice on how to get through it?"
1039,"Well since my teacher of university sends me a mail for do lots of work weeks ago( I'm finishig my carreer, With coronavirus  the work of that mail was cancelled) something was destroyed inside me, that day I feel lots of anger and sadness, now I tend to be sad, but I know that I can feel better for 1 week and control my mood, at least for care my family, but I can't is hard. I'm a little bit scared for coronavirus kills my parets, I don't care If anything happens to me since 2019 September, my last year of university was when all begins."
1040,"Idk it sucks. I thought I was getting a better handle on my mental health these past few months but I hit a real hurdle this week and it seems like my progress went out the window. I feel like I’m in a worse place than where I started. I’m still relatively new to my BPD diagnosis and while I’m relieved to know I have a name to my struggles I now also feel like there’s more pressure to not make mistakes. Like “okay you have BPD... therefore you can’t mess up like you did before”. But then I do mess up. I become this whole other person. When I’m splitting I have this holier than thou, hypocritical,  evil monster inside of me that clawed it’s way out and hurts the people I love. It’s like a completely different person. I cringe with the things that I say. When I’m not splitting, I become horrified when I hear other people say the things I’ve said when I’m splitting.

And then I dwell on it. And add it to my “reasons why I’m horrible” list.

I’m trying to get better for everyone around me but it seems like I’m my own enemy hindering my own progress."
1041,Am reading alot about eupd recently as have been schizoeffective for nearly twelve years and they now think I'm a paranoid schizophrenic with avoidence disorder.. not really sure what to make of the new diagnoses but pleased to be finally getting somewhere x
1042,"Geez, I'm pathetic. I've recently been arguing or having heated discussions with my significant other regarding his brother (who is super selfish and a jerk) and a lie that my s.o. has become entangled in. To give the shortened version my s.o.'s brother works for an industry that their parents would never approve of. So he lies about it. My s.o. keeps up with the lie. My s.o.'s parents ask my s.o. do chores for his brother because apparently his brother makes a lot of money and is therefore too busy to do his own adult stuff. His brother wears the company's gear in front of his parents while talking about how great work is. (they think he works in the food industry). My s.o. wants to work for that industry. I said he will be a liar by working for the same company as his brother (which is basically a double edged sword because he knows it's wrong but he wants to help his family). He wants to support his parents who are having harder times during this economy. My s.o. claims to be a Christian (I am not but I truly respect it!) and the way he defines his Christianity goes against his actions. He doesn't want to stress out his parents because they're older. It's a tangled web of frustration for me. I don't like the way my s.o. has been treated because of his brother's lie. A lie that he acknowledged is wrong. Now my s.o. will be more involved in the lie by working for this company. I feel like I'm witnessing my s.o. become someone I never thought he would be. 

That's basically it. I argued with my s.o. and I aired it out on an advice Reddit because I really don't know why. It was basically a big Mistake. One person had commented. They basically told me that I was a self-righteous person and that the reason I mentioned Christianity was for sanctimonious reasons despite me not being a Christian. They used a couple curse words and they said my bf's family was a shit show. I should stay out of it. the Bible doesn't disapprove that industry. We should all get our heads checked....

I commented back to correct told them they could have commented nicely, and that the points they used to attack me were misunderstood and all I wanted was advice. 

They apologized and gave me honest advice and I commented back nicely thanking them. And acknowledged that in some ways it isn't my business because it's not my family. 

I saw that someone upvoted their attack reply to me and then I started to spiral more. 

I felt guilty and told my s.o. He's sad that I aired out his dirty laundry. I apologized. We're okay now but I feel terrible. I deleted my account and not the post and I'm trying to get it deleted. The whole ""internet is forever"" has spooked me good today. I wish I never did it. I was so impulsive today. I went from 0-60 real quick. I made that post during work because I was wrapped up in my emotions. I ignored my work just to post something I've come to regret and was attacked for. For the record, I was really seeking out advice at the time. For some reason I thought it was a non-problematic post but I guess it was? Anyway I was triggered. I shouldn't have done it. I'm a terrible person. The internet is forever. I shouldn't have been so impulsive."
1043,My husband is very popular and successful. I have supported his unwarranted insecurity for 3 months! He is a top employee who wins awards every year but he had to play the “whoa is me” card. He made more money on unemployment. So he is going back and I go back to complete isolation. Virus has nothing to do with it. I am just not worth people or a life!! Otherwise I would have one!
1044,I try so hard not to dwell on the past but for last couple weeks i feel like ive crashed and burned I dont wanna live anymore. Ive lost so much and everything i do or touch turns to shit so why keep trying my psychiatrist is a joke my therapist Judges me. I just dont know what to do the people Who claim there to help dont.
1045,"True or false: if nothing can be done about a situation, There is no point in continuing to try for something that doesn’t exist."
1046,"No meds for 67 days.  Can't tolerate. Tried so many over 20+years and had to stop.  Have been getting worse.  I'm worse now than I ever was before I started down this med route.  Doctors left me.  No one could probably answer this: Could all these years of medicine trials have caused irreversible brain damage?  Today a 3 minute watch of protests had me crying uncontrollably.  I feel so deeply for people, all people have a goodness about them, I believe that to the core of my being.  Meds seem to have taken away my ability to relate with others and to be creative.  I so wanted to be part of this very humane protest but my sensitivity prevented me. Will I ever come back?  I feel like walking dead or a walking slobbering machine."
1047,"I wanted to take a moment and thank the moderators, thank the community, for constantly picking me up every time I fall down.

i have found such strength, and more importantly courage, by the discussions that have happened here. It’s the only place on the entire internet where I feel safe. And that safety has given me stability I have never known in my life.

We are all broken souls, but it speaks volumes of the compassion and real care that comes from here. We are all propping each other up.

You are all equally special. You are dealing with your own pain and trauma, yet you find the time to help others who are struggling. That speaks volumes about your character and who you are.

In a world full of people who care only for themselves, you continue to give, to soothe, to empathize.

Please recognize how valuable you are.

You are to me."
1048,"Everyone who has been keeping up with me... Yeah, I seemed like I wasn't a lost case. That I was going to work hard. That I was going to make things better. I had all of this desire inside of me and I tried absolutely everything to get better. 

My FP, who happened to be someone I experienced strong romantic attraction towards... He kinda ""ended everything"" last night. 

He just couldn't deal with it anymore. Not that he didn't want to try, but I think my symptoms manifested in a way that was just too tiring for him as last night was the last straw.

He made it clear that he wants nothing to do with me anymore.

I don't even know what I feel. When stuff similar to this happens, I brush it off as being their fault and it's a lot easier for me.

I know this is my fault. This is entirely my fault.

I pushed away the one thing I wanted to keep the closest.

I spent all night dreaming about our conversation and when I woke up I wished so hard for it to have been nothing more than a scary dream. It wasn't.

I started therapy again. Yesterday was my first session.

I thought I was doing so well.

""People don't feel loved when they are being controlled.""

I wish I could have done better. 

That I could have avoided all the suffering I caused for us both.

If my BPD symptoms didn't come to ruin every thing... It would still be healthy and acceptable.

I'm not going to get into great detail regarding why this happened. The quote probably explains everything.

I'm not going to get into detail regarding why I loved him so much. Everything I've done probably explains everything.

Right now, I can't stop crying. It just won't stop. It doesn't even feel bad, it's just a stream.

Today was going to be a nice day for him and I also kept him up struggling all night.

Hope wasn't worth anything. I couldn't change the way I am. No matter what I did, it was always there, and I was always suffocating him.

I am so tired of being myself. I am so tired of being confined to this horrible existence."

1050,"Lately, I've been feeling strange. Everyone around me is normal but they're strange at the same time. Nothing about my life makes any sense and yet others are making sense of theirs. I'm stuck in a place that's supposed to be my familiar, but it isn't? Everyone is wrapped up in what they're doing but I can't ever be alone, so I become tired and bored. Yet, I want to be alone but it has to be with nobody? If I'm not completely alone, I'm just bored. I have no friends or family, just my nuclear family. My dad is completely ignorant of my existence and my mother seems mellow. Same with my brother, in his own space chatting with his buddies. I'm just staring into a void, devoid of joy and wanting to escape any way I can like an itch I can't scratch or a drug. I have dreams but what if I'm meant to stay in place as everyone goes on without me. What if nothing comes to fruition and then I have no choice but to escape permanently."
1051,"I'm trying to not be but my rage  can come on so quick and its immediately at 100.

Theres this ex friend of mine whose he biggest fing fraud and scam artist. She used my triggers against me when we fought and I ended up trying to kill myself and then she told everyone I knew and even tried to call my job. She told everyone I just did it for attention And I couldn't defend myself cuz the hospital took my phone while I was there.

This was about 2 years ago
And I've come a long way and I'm proud of my success trying to focus on my future.

But I saw she was interviewed in the paper lying and lying and telling a bunch of half truths. And she calls herself a social worker but she isnt shes a community event organizer for a nonprofit. She calls herself a mental health advocate but how can you be one and devalue my suicide attempt and my reaching out for help.

And it makes me mad to see her lying face lying again like always. She presents herself as an advocate for foster kids but in her interview again its ALL about her and how she had a rough life and how she deserves more money and a free ride in life.


I hate her.
I hate myself for being triggered by her at all."
1052,I guess I am too stupid to follow the format of this app because I cannot follow any conversations. So I’m obviously too stupid to even get help. I read threads and can’t figure out where they are coming from. Maybe I’m just too old for this forum
1053,"I remember that across from where I lived there we three girls that I hung out who bullied me. One day they told me to close my eyes and turn around because they had a surprise for me. They snuck an airhorn behind my head and since I'm highly sensitive, I screamed and cried. It traumatized me and after that had a lot of emotional problems. I have a theory it probably effected me emotionally and did something to my brain because I haven't really been the same. I'm still sensitive but also desensitized at the same time. When I think of the memory I remember how much I'd be better off dead because I pursuing will me gaining hearing loss. It happened when I was so young but it's still so painful. I haven't lost my hearing but I think I will one day."

1057,"In my last post, I talked about how I've felt that nobody cared that I was still hurting. I found that to be true, until yesterday morning. Nobody knows because I haven't told them and now I feel like I'm being selfish. I'm not the person I thought I was, I've become stubborn and difficult to talk to. I speak rhetorically, not as engaging or thoughtful anymore. You could say it's because I've numbed myself over time, now I'm hardened mentally. If I could describe myself as a young teenager, I was a ""happy-go-lucky and bright"" girl who was aware of her adversity but had a need to belong. Now, I feel like I'm on a crusade (whether if I realize it or not; it's true) to be taken seriously and to compensate for insecure feelings which make me come off uptight and self-absorbed at times. I'm not proud of it because it has caused an internal struggle within me. There's one side of me that wants complete integration and creativity. Then, there's another side that wants total control and perfection, even it means sacrificing her sense of belonging and joy. It has made into a paranoid, obsessed person! At least I can admit that there's a problem and I don't know how to make peace with it. I'm not right but I'm not wrong, I'm just lost! How do I make it about me without disregarding others in the process, it seems like brain acts on a pendulum pattern. Feelings are never integrated, they're either good or bad."

But mostly she likes to makeup rules so she has a reason to criticize people
We all got called back to work and its been 2 weeks she goes on vacation across the country to visit her bf
Which is fine cuz her temp replacement is really chill and so easy to work with but shes coming back soon and my bpd impulsiveness keeps telling me to quit before she gets back.

I need some help talking me back down.
I need the job
There some of the highest unemployment rate since the 80s possibly years of economic recovery and i still have a job (one that's not the worst all the time) but man I hate her. Shes not even here and I'm triggered by the idea of her returning"
1059,"I'm starting to realize that despite going to therapy, nothing has changed. I'm not the kind of person that believes I need to change in order to fit into society, in fact, it's quite the opposite. I feel like therapy has given me an opportunity to understand myself better rather than question what's true or false, it has helped in that respect. Although, everyone around me seems to be oblivious to what's happening to me, especially my parents. I feel like their oblivious to the fact that I'm still hurting because I come off predictable. I honestly hate being an emotional person because people tend to chastise and disbelieve me. When I'm going through suicidal or angry thoughts sometimes the only thing I can do is scream or throw something. I feel like I give off bad vibes without meaning to, so nobody wants to get to know me. I feel like being diagnosed with a personality disorder makes me feel I'm walking around wearing caution tape. People can forget that despite intense feelings that I'm still a sensitive person who's going through a difficult period. In my household, I have a stigma for being the ""angry, rebellious 20-something"" and everyone seems to think I'm always either angry or depressed, that I take myself way too seriously. Truthfully, I know that I can take myself seriously sometimes, but it's not in the way that everybody else sees it. I take myself seriously because I have to understand myself better and know what's a joke and what's harmful to my psyche. I have to be my own advocate sometimes because I'm the only one I can talk to and listen to. I'm realizing that I'm living in a harsh reality and that the people I need may not want to make themselves helpful. I'm living in a time where people can choose to be your friend and then decide what part of you they like best, then leave. Nobody cares that I'm still hurting because they rather believe I'm just angry and need to shut up because I'm ""dampening"" their positive vibes. I get it, for all you know, I could be primadonna with BPD with everyone chained to me at all times. When in reality, I'm through all this alone, one day at a time and I seriously need a friend right now. There are times where I wish I could live in a bubble and be my only interest, but it's impossible because I see everyone as a potential friend. It's a curse. 

Anyways, this is my last post for a while. I needed to express my thoughts/feeling somewhere, but I need to break to recoup because life is overwhelming right now. I hope people can resonate with me because not only do I want to reach out, but hopefully I give others the courage to reach out to me.

1061,"Once again, I'm sorry for all of this. Until I manage to talk with a therapist next week this forum board is all I have, and I've been running around options like wild. I know that there are ways around my problems, and I know that there is hope...

I just feel like I'm not ready for this. Right now, at this moment, the person who my symptoms flare the strongest with is also the person who I feel greatly in love with. And I have no reason to complain! I've been open about my mental health situation, they said they would support me. I have been open about the fact I would have my small episodes every now and then, and they said they would support me. They are pretty much... impeccable. I have absolutely no reason to complain, and that's exactly why I'm writing this post.

I know myself. I know what I do. I know what BPD makes me do. 

I've seen it happen in the past too many times. Most of the time, I would blame the failed ""relationship"" on the fact that the person didn't love me enough. Now I acknowledge all of my problems, and I acknowledge how I'm the wrong one when it comes to this. I feel like progress has been made, and I'm desperately looking for therapy to help out with things too.

Everything seems to lead to hope. This is very positive.

But I am terribly scared of messing things up with this person. I've never felt this way before and I'm so exhausted of all the feelings my condition has been giving me due to the affection I feel for him. It's everywhere.

He doesn't text me but has been online since I sent my last messages -> I overreact.
He starts sending smaller replies because he's getting tired or has other life matters to take care of -> I overreact.
He mentions being excited about doing things with people other than me -> I overreact.
He doesn't always ""give back"" when I feel like I've done something great for him -> I overreact.

Most of you probably know that the list goes on. What surprises me is how much I KNOW that these are overreactions of mine, but that I cannot seem to stop them at all. It's to the point where barely talking to him makes me feel suffocated, because I can't be at peace for a moment. It's unhealthy. And that notion only makes it hurt even more for me. Why? Because he is the healthiest person I've ever come across. If I didn't have these problems, I am sure that this would be amazing and you would probably see us both as another one of those cheesy couples who just seem to have lived a fairytale.

Many times BPD makes me connect to people who are highly dependent like me, and we usually get along until they start getting bored of me. But this is completely different. He isn't dependent at all. He admires me and cherishes me, he has his own really interesting life and he gets a lot of stuff done without an excessive need for attention or anything, even though he appreciates how much I can give him.

And maybe this is why I feel so bad about it. Maybe this is why I understood that I needed treatment. 

This isn't like other instances of my BPD displaying where I essentially got met up with people that were bound to be a self-destructive relationship. I can actually see a future in this, and it's the first time I've been able to seriously think about someone I have feelings for in such a hopeful way. Usually thinking of the future boggles my mind because I seem to get these overly affectionate feelings for people who displayed quite a few deal-breaking red flags at first. 

Not him. The ONLY red flags he presents are red flags to my BPD, which is horrible. He is a busy person, he is a social person, he has a lot of good friends and reasons to be out and about... All of these things are absolutely great, but they are terrible for my BPD and this time I do not want to give into it. We both have our own upsides and downsides (being that my biggest downside is definitely the fact that I'm BPD, while all he has are a few issues that I would be more than glad to tolerate for as long as I could)

We haven't been too intense when it comes to ""relationship"" things because we are both the type of person who want to wait and see if it's something genuine and worthwhile (a common motto we share is that everything worth having comes with difficulty) so I'm also very thankful about that too. It's like my mind knows exactly what it wants and how to deal with him so that we may live a nice future together, but then my BPD symptoms attack every single hope I have for treating him like I would anyone else and also for this to actually happen.

It's self-sabotage and I know of it. I can see my BPD killing this before it's even happened (which is also something that rarely happened with me, normally I always saw the ""killing"" as something that came from the other side) and I am just so so scared of the inevitable fate this seems to bring me. Even now, I cannot cope with the feelings he brings out in me and I've tried countless times, countless techniques. It's awful. I really am trying.

Which leads me to my main point. I know there is hope for me, and I know that I can ease my symptoms with therapy and a lot of hard work. I know this.

But I also know that it doesn't come easy. I won't be able to make it all better in a week. (If only...)

This will take a LOT of time of self improvement and hard work, and I just KNOW that if I stay with him while I'm starting this journey, I'm eventually going to damage everything because right now my symptoms have been quite untolerable. I can't deal with them, I simply can't. I can't deal with every one of our positive interactions being hindered (I'm not hurting him with it, I'm actually doing a GREAT job at keeping it all to myself, but it's the feelings I keep for myself which are completely doing my mind over and it's just not healthy at all) and I feel like the best way to deal with this would be to pause everything and get back to him once I feel more capable of dealing with my emotions.

But how can that happen? If I tell him this, I'll spend my days in pain knowing that I've created distance between me and the one thing I want to keep the closest. How can that happen, if my BPD symptoms only seem to get worse when it comes to him and I'll not be able to find any improvement if I can't consistently practice against my own emotions?

(I only feel the BPD symptoms when it comes to people I fall in love with OR when it's friends/family who I normally trusted but have done something very bad to break my trust. Other than that I'm perfectly normal and I experience no problems whatsoever when it comes to this.)

I do not know what to do. I don't want my memory of him to be one of pain, neither do I want to start hating him (something that BPD seems to be keen on trying 24/7) and most importantly, I do not want to bring him any pain in the future (which I know I will, I just know it... with how intense my bad emotions have been getting at these small things?)

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Does anyone know what to do? I'm going to tell the therapist about this as soon as I get the chance but I'm aware that this will take a while and my symptoms won't vanish just by me being aware of them. The pain this is giving me is becoming quite untolerable, the other night I felt like I was going to die of guilt.

The worst part is that things have no reason to be this way. He is great. He cares for me, he loves me. He has done nothing but show support and comprehension about my condition, as long as I'm able to maintain respect for him. Our moments together should be nothing but fun and exciting (we really get along together and there's this amazing connection between us two) and we both KNOW that if things could continue the way they were, we would definitely be together sometime in the future. It's just right! I've never been able to set aside my wrong-doings before, but with him I'm able to understand that it's my fault. 

I wish I could just love him, you know?

I wish I could give him everything he deserves.

I wish I could appreciate everything he gives me without my mind instantly finding something to pick on.

I wish I could be happy and live free from this torment that's trying to take away the thing I want to care about the most.

It would be easier if I could put this part of me to sleep and just see where it would take me, but the pain is always there. I feel like I ""have"" to make a decision, or else the pain will become overwhelming and eventually kill me. If I could I would just keep taking the blows until I could deal with them, but I feel like it's going to drive me insane to have to consistently go against my feelings all the time.

I almost want to destroy the relationship on purpose just so that it isn't me by accident, but the cause will always be BPD and that's what I hate so much. Why does this have to be a curse that guarantees a certain destiny no matter what I do? I thought that being aware would help... but it really doesn't.

Everything inside of me is conflict. I feel like I can't be with him because my mind will find something to create a monster out of, but then I feel like I can't not be with him because that pains my heart, having to spend time away from the person I love... and gah... It's so confusing.

I don't even know why I'm posting such a huge rant on here. I feel like it's pointless. But I really want to know what to do. I'm on the edge right here and I feel like even though I'm aware of the problems my BPD is bringing me, I may be taking an impulsive decision due to it and I want to avoid that as much as possible.

Could anyone who is definitely in a more lucid state of mind than I am, tell me what seems to be the best thing for me right now? I would really appreciate your help.

(I'm sorry for constantly posting about similar issues, but this is something I am really struggling with and I have nowhere to turn.)"
1062,"How do you guys cope in crisis mode? Nothing i do stops the negative thoughts and reunification, I've tried anxiety apps, walks and deep breaths but I just cant stop it.

1063,"Hey everyone, I'm here again...

I wanted to know if anyone has advice for not allowing your feelings to get blown out of proportion over minimal things. Today I was talking with someone who is important to me and we were having a really great and fun conversation, of course, like all things, it eventually started to die out (from his part, not mine) and after asking him if everything was okay he said that he was just busy trying to get his stuff done.

Normally that would be easier to accept, but we actually had a conversation the other day where he explicitly said that he would appreciate it if I could be a little less ""hands-on"" when he was busy, so I automatically started feeling a lot of sadness and guilt because I was driving something that was bothering him. After he understood that what I was trying to express, he told me that it wasn't a bother at all and that sometimes things were simply unpredictable and that he was glad he got distracted to spend time with me.

But now I feel really bad for misinterpreting the situation and I'm really worried that he's going to hold this reaction against me, because it's as if we were going really well and then I managed to do something that just ruined everything... Is there any way to avoid these types of reactions and misinterpretations? I mean, he quickly told me that he was busy but even so I managed to keep feeling bad about it (still am) and it's like the guilt is consuming me even though he told me it was all okay. I am really scared that he may have gotten disappointed in me and that he won't want to spend time like that with me anymore because he's worried that I'll just end up ruining things again... 

I feel very distraught right now :/

Does anyone have any tips for how to deal with this? Deep inside I know that he will probably move on from it, but I can't stop feeling this overwhelming guilt."

1069,"Hello everyone.

I'm Volbe and I suffer from BPD. I have known for about a year, but I've been going through a lot of difficult personal issues and I was unable to pick up proper therapy at the time. I'm greatly hoping to do so in the future once things pick up, but I would love to start healing now.

I've fluctuated from awareness to complete belief in the psychotic ideas my mind gives me. Ultimately, the people who I develop these feelings for (it's only unbearable when it comes to my FP relationships, I can usually cope when they are regular people) become ""evil"" and they ""never really loved me"" (when they were simply tired of dealing with my issues, which I get) and this used to completely undo any awareness that I had. 

""Sure I have some mood problems because of it, but it doesn't mean that I deserve to be treated like that!""

That was what I used to think, and what allowed me to continue nurturing feelings of anguish and despair over the smallest signs that those people would leave me at any time, or that they stopped loving me.

After some relatively painful experiences, I've been trying my best to hang in. 

I have met someone who is special for me. He is my FP, and I'm sure you all know the feelings associated to that... The other day he did something minimal, which was leaving me on read and only replying a few hours later (which really confused me because he always made a point of not reading my messages until he could answer them) and I had a rather shameful display of all the emotions that brought to me. 

We've talked a lot since then, and they have been highly empathetic with me, which is something that I feel like I do not deserve as I can now see that I'm most likely going to destroy things with him at some point.

What has given me hope is my newly gained awareness. After the event happened, I didn't doubt him. I wasn't scared that he hated me. I was sure that it was just a misunderstanding, even if my feelings had gone to their extreme at that moment. I was able to say ""this might not make too much sense, he hasn't ever treated you wrong after all!""

My problem with this is that I'm quite sure that it will happen again. I know that I will most likely be able to tell that it's wrong when shortly after it happens, but I worry that he will get tired of all the mess I make, even if I stop holding it against him right after. Last night, he said something very minimal which triggered me a lot, and I spent all night crying about it even though I was able to tell myself ""this might not be true"" although I still needed to ask him for reassurance... When I did, he was really worried and tried his best to let me know that it wasn't true, and my feelings quickly shifted to guilt for accusing him of that. 

Usually, whenever this would happen more than once, I would leave the person and assume that it was their fault for not loving me properly. But this person is different. I do not want to do that with him. 

I know that these are my fears and insecurities trying to talk me out of something that has nothing of harmful. That's why I want to fight them! 

But I struggle. I know I will struggle. I want to avoid overreacting to little things, however. I want to live a life where I'm able to feel alright about all the things he may do which currently trigger this part of me.

I want to live a life with him.

Honestly, I was going to cut myself off from him not because I wanted to avoid him abandoning me, but because I was aware that there is a high chance I may hurt him. I feel like a monster with huge hands who tried to pluck small flowers and cried everytime he killed him. Now I'm understanding that I've always been picking up these flowers in the wrong way, and that it isn't their fault, it's mine for not being careful.

I want to be able to reach a point in life where I do not have these overwhelming irrational emotions over the smallest things he does. Just thinking about that possibility makes me cry a little, because I think I never even used to see this as true?

Now I feel like I can, but I have a lot of doubt. What should I do, where should I go...? I know that therapy is the answer, but I need to hold out for a little longer (even more so given the financial problems the COVID-19 situation has brought most of us) even though I don't want to ""postpone"" him in any way. I don't want to say ""okay, I'm not doing well so I'll talk to you again once I'm getting help"" because he made it clearer than ever that he wanted to stay by my side while I work through this, and not after I get through this. He's always been so honest about things, and he's admired my desire to work towards coping better in the future.

I really don't want to disappoint him though...

Could anyone who is already recovering/has recovered give me some pointers about how it is for you? How are you able to deal with triggers, and how are you able to coexist with your FPs/cherished people? If possible, is there anything in particular which helps you?

I've bought myself ""The Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Workbook"" and I'm hoping to use that as my starting point when it comes to learning how to cope better. I'm just really scared that I won't be able to do things on my own, and I guess that I would really appreciate some support from all of you on here.

Borderline Personality Disorder and my past trauma really scare me. It still terrifies me to this very day. But I want to work hard to not only fight against it but also work WITH it and allow myself to live a better life. All I know is that I cannot continue living dominated by it all the time.

Thank you for your time, I did extend myself a little with this... This means so much to me. The fact that there's still hope for me."
1070,"Okay, let me just get this off my chest. Why do my problems always feel compartmentalized or shunned in real life, but celebrities seem to find a way to benefit and market off mental health? Am I the only one that can see through the popularity of problems like depression or anxiety (being the most common) suddenly beginning to water down on how severe it can really be? Then you're left scratching your head when a situation comes up and you're second-guessing whether it's even worth trying to reach out. There's just something about the sensationalism involved with mental health and celebrities that's only making it harder to become recognized when grappling with day to day tasks and so on. Same with being naturally introverted, I always feel typecasted by ignorant people because I appear or act stereotypically. I wish celebrities would butt out of us commoners problems and recognize that they say or do does affect how we're represented. I get that there are good people in this world, but there aren't enough of them to prove that the representation has gotten better. In fact, they make me feel like I'm living a cruel joke!"
1071,"Hi there.

I really need help with this one. I’m in a super supportive loving relationship with my current partner. I love him so much and there is no one else I want to be with - he’s my soulmate.

but I keep thinking about my ex from two years ago. Not because I want to be with him. I hate his guts and it was such an unhealthy relationship. But I’m super scared I’m gonna wake up one day and be back with him. I know it’s irrational but it’s such a Real fear. I don’t know what to do or why this is happening?"
1072,"I hope in five years I'll have a story to tell which will inspire people who suffer from mood swings, hopelessness and constant failures. I want to look at the bigger picture and not put too much attention to the details. I want to genuinely feel good about myself - honestly I'd be so lucky."
1073,"I've found my boyfriend has lied to me about six different things in the last few weeks, all to do with his past relationships. Since I found out I can't eat or sleep and feel sick to my stomach. I can't escape and take my mind off it during lockdown.. I don't know how to cope anymore. He promises he won't lie again but he's already done it so many times. It's making me unwell."
1074,"Quick disclaimer, I have not been diagnosed with BPD or any other sort of personality disorder. I have been diagnosed with depressive disorder, stress, and anxiety, but I know that what I am experiencing is not depression. I have just recently started with counseling again so I haven't really had much time to speak to my counselor about this, but she believes that I could have BPD, or perhaps bipolar disorder, and is going to refer me to be tested soon. 


I've always been sort of suicidal, I've never seen a point to life. I always said that if there was a button that if I pressed it then I could cease to exist, then I would press it in a heart beat. Life seemed like such a waste but now I have become religious and I know that I need to stay alive. I've had depression and anxiety for most of my life, but it began to change into something else after my suicide attempt.

A few months before I began to spiral down and down, I became so full of hatred, sadness, and envy. My depression came back and so I couldn't be bothered anymore and I decided to kill myself. Obviously I survived, but I changed so much that day. I became relaxed, I stopped caring, I stopped being so envious and realised that if I was patient then everything will work out, I believed in God, and I had so much motivation. I don't know what it was but within a few hours I went from a miserable, depressed, and incredibly drunk, to a new person. I began to have so much energy and hope, and it continued for a few months. But then it died down a little bit and I've been spiraling again ever since. Thinking of certain things that had a huge impact on my mental health before and during my attempt makes my heart burn, my mind to become so stressed, and also makes me upset and hopeless. 

Orgasming affected my new manic mood, and that is still the cast, but it has changed. I'm not longer manic, but I become depressed if I go a while without ejaculating. I want to do nofap because I know that it is a sin, but I don't feel like I can actually do it. I went around 29 days a couple of months ago but I felt so depressed by the end of it, and I'm beginning to feel sad again. I get a huge high (motivation, anger, energy, hope etc.) the couple days after ejaculating and then I suddenly crash, without seeming to come back up again. I think that it could be possible that this is a trigger to me, I don't know. I don't want to use the word trigger because I am not even sure whether I actually have BPD. I'm not going to go into my symptoms and make a case where I think I have it, because that's not the point of this, but I just want to know whether it is possible that whatever I have can be triggered by these things.

Thanks"
1075,"Hey everybody, emotions are very high right now but I’ll try and keep this simple. 

My best friend has been going through a hard time, she’s been really struggling with the lockdown and recently started taking new anti-depressants that she says are making her feel really irritable. I’ve been trying to support her, listening without giving unwarranted advice, but she said something to me a few days ago and I don’t know what I did to upset her.

I sent her a message asking how she was feeling and she asked me ‘did (insert her boyfriend’s name) tell you to ask me that?’. I was shocked when she sent me that. For clarification, a couple of weeks ago her boyfriend sent a message to me and another mutual friend asking if we could facetime her because she’d had a really bad depression episode the night before (which we weren’t aware of until he told us). I didnt know it bothered her that he asked us that and regardless, I’m really upset that she said that to me.

When she sent me that message, I responded with a simple ‘no’ and neither of us said anything else until the next day. The day after she sent me a message that just said ‘sorry’. This is probably just me, but I don’t think ‘sorry’ is enough of an apology when you’ve said something so hurtful to someone checking up on you. I want an explanation, I want to know what I did to make her so angry that she’d treat me like that. I didn’t respond right away because I was feeling pretty angry still, so a few hours later I just said ‘I’m still hurt right now but thank you for apologising’ and she didn’t respond. Now I don’t know what to do, we haven’t spoken in nearly 2 days and I have no idea what she’s thinking. Im still upset, not so much now over the initial incident but more so that she isn’t saying anything? And I don’t know what I did in the first place to make her angry? I don’t know, I’m just upset and I don’t know where to go from here."
1076,"I have a turbulent relationship with my father that's not even my choice. I'm suffering symptoms of borderline, so I need more reassurance and motivation than most people. For years I've suffered being under the microscope because of him, and he even bailed on me by convincing a doctor I was bipolar. Yeah, you heard me! I willingly admitted myself to a facility just to have him lie on my petition. I was only 18 at the time. I felt desperate and clearly should've known better. I will never forgive him for the stressful weeks he put me through just so that he could get a vacation from me. I bet that's why he did it anyway! Anyways, I'm tired of his unreliable ass speaking for me. He uses the fact I'm introverted and shy to his advantage! He's a narcissistic and manipulative person who is unapologetic. During my childhood, he barely paid close attention to me and even abused me countless times. Now he sugarcoats those events as ""parenting"" and ""discipline"", despite remembering them as unnecessarily harsh. On one occasion I remember I was having trouble with my homework (I was being bullied in school at the time) and wanted to go on a car ride. He willingly took me on one after I nagged him (I was 11), so he gave in. As we drove out of our complex, he was extremely tense. When he got to a stoplight, he shoved into the car door. I started crying and he began calling me horrible names. He took me to a trailer park neighborhood and coldly states, ""if you don't finish your homework, you'll end up here."" After that ordeal, I remember crying myself to sleep that night and felt suicidal for the first time. At 21, I have no choice but to live with him until the pandemic ordeal subsides. He barely talks to me as an adult and when he does I take it with a grain a salt. He's notorious for breaking the promises he keeps and is a secretive person. He has always picked favorites and tends to only be strict with me. Recently he talked to a guy I had a crush on in elementary school and apparently my dad told me that he talks about me all the time. That could all be a bunch of bull or told him about my personal life. All I know is that he can't be trusted. Growing up he wanted nothing to do with my struggles and never wanted to get to know me as a person. I'm tired of him pretending to care because I know that means he wants something in exchange. What kind of person expects their children to respect them when they themselves are disrespectful towards them? He's worsening my condition and I want the courage to cut the cord once and for all. Any advice on how do go about estranging myself from my dad?"
1077,"Hi,

I am brand new to this forum and hope this question is appropriate.

27 year old, white, male, British, University educated, white collar occupation, middle class family.

For a long time I have struggled with maintaining long term friendships and relationships with people, mostly manifesting in me cutting people off for slights that maybe most people wouldn't even notice. Nearly every single person in my life past and present has at some point been cut off, with me doing the cutting off exclusively. Normally this will happen due to something that I understand to be, in normal terms, insignificant, but to me personally stirs great anger and resentment. This has happened in work contexts, social contexts, physical relationship contexts, family contexts etc. I've cut off everyone from my Mom, Dad, closest friends to loosest acquaintances. At some point I will feel the urge to reunite that friendship / relationship when the anger has passed over days, weeks or months, to which most have been very receptive.

What I often notice is that I have two competiting voices: rational and irrational, with the rational voice telling me I'm being sensitive and paranoid and the irrational voice telling me I am totally justified and correct. The irrational voice ALWAYS prevails in the short term and that will lead me to blocking them on calls, texts, social media etc.

I find I also go through extreme mood swings whereby sometimes I'm hyper social and life and soul of any social gathering, and other times completely hateful of society / people and the mere thought of an interaction ignites a strange feeling of hateful snobbery, that I'm somehow above people.

I have no history of self harm or suicide attempts but have had suicidal thoughts and feelings.

My medication history is limited to X1 daily 20mg Paroxetine (6+ years) for a historical health anxiety disorder which is now cured but persist with taking the medication to avoid withdrawal / relapse.

Thoughts appreciated and if there is any additional information I could provide please highlight.

Thanks."
1078,"I felt angry most of the day. I tried not to think about negative thoughts. This morning everything seemed fine. I just think I'll go to bed now. I don't know why I'm like this.

I guess I'll just write my thoughts out the way I'm thinking it. Because I don't know how else to explain it. I worry about confusing others this way, and I'm sorry. But I really don't know how to describe it all. I feel so angry at myself. I just try so hard to be positive and remain happy, but nothing seems to work. The thoughts about self harm are still there in my mind and I'm trying not to pay attention to them. I don't know what to do. I get jealous and depressed and I compare myself to others. I don't want to be real and I don't even want to exist at all if life is just going to continue being like this."
1079,"Hey all, I’m seeing a therapist and we’re only a few sessions in but I sought out for therapy because I discovered what bpd was and relate to 8 out of 9 symptoms with most of them being severe. I’ve pretty much self diagnosed at this point but I’m still waiting to see what the therapist thinks. Anyways I’m more aware of the symptoms now I can recognize them and one thing I’m really starting to notice are mood swings. They’re so intense and these moods last a few days at a time really. I have a few great days where im more motivated, happy, beautiful, in touch with reality for example on these days I REALLY enjoy sex and have sex maybe 2-3 times on the low days. My boyfriend can try to grab my boobs and I push him away... I don’t like to but it’s like my first reaction, I pretty much refuse to have sex and if my boyfriend really wants to and I’ve been in this mood for some days I will but I’m not very into it and my mind wonders off sooo much. We’ll be having sex and I’m moaning/reactive but literally thinking about a conversation I had with a friend or a meal I ate that day it’s so annoying. I hate it. Anyways during this period of low days I feel terribly insecure like I’m hideous, I have no enjoyment in music, tv, singing, seeing people, I’m nervous to leave my house and my anxiety is so bad I dissociate probably 20 hours each one of these days... these days are soo dreadful and I spend most of them confused, anxious, hating myself and crying I may even wish I was dead on some of these days because my symptoms are so overwhelming that I see nothing else but negative things. I feel like I suck at singing and everything I may actually be good at. It’s just terrible. I feel like I’m depressed as well idk what’s wrong with me really but i hate the low feeling so much In comparison to the good days that I over eat and eat shitty as well each one of these low days I will eat a pint of Ben and Jerry’s, and I will be extremely anxious until I get it, I used food as my therapy and sweets if it’s not that it’s shopping online I’ve spent thousands of dollars this past month shopping online I would also drink so much which caused major issues in my relationship so I haven’t drank in a while but I mainly eat myself sick and blow tons of money on stuff I don’t need :( idk how to get out of these low periods time just passes but during them I’m damaging myself so much when I would drink I’d have maybe 10 shots back to back to get as fucked up as fast as possible so I didn’t feel the misery and depression then next thing I know I’m fine again motivated, confident not as dissociative etc. I’m tired of these lows and highs it’s like I never know when it’s gonna happen and I feel like I’m on an emotional rollercoaster. It’s causing me so much distress. I feel like the low periods fuck up my life I’ve gained about 60 pounds in the past year. I’m only 21, I just started experiencing bpd symptoms in the past 3 years or so. Before then I felt life my life was controlled and on a great positive path And now we’ll my life is this way the more weight I gain the less in control of my life I feel the more self cautious I am and the more social anxiety I have the fear of leaving my house is so strong. I just need my life to get back in order I am seeing a therapist but it’s starting slow I want a change ASAP. I just feel lost. Sighs. Thanks for listening to me vent, thankful for your time and comments"
1080,"hi 

I suffer of the above but also have a social anxiety disorder.

I am on medication for the personality disorder but not the social anxiety disorder.

firstly,are there any meds for social anxiety disorder ,else,what can I do naturally to treat or overcome it"
1081,"Hey all! I want to ask advice from anybody who did substance abuse and recovered from it. Or anyone who feels like being sober is a torture and who's always searching from something to do.

Since quarantine began in Argentina month a a half ago, I've spent a significant amount of money in cocaine. But it hasn't last, so I've binge eaten, drank till I get drunk, and do weed. I hate the last things I mentioned. I do them not to feel sober, but I don't enjoy them! I become so slow and hungry. But cocaine! Ufff, then you have me watching lectures from top universities, reading, having high quality conversation to lots of people, listening to enjoyable music, passionate, in a good way. But as soon as I run out of it,  it's harmful vices, junk food, alcohol, weed. Which are actually healthier, but for the behavior they trigger for me, more harmful. I need help :("
1082,"I'm an emotional wreck who's having doubts and feels pathetic. I hate the world and everyone in it. Nobody's good enough for me, but I'm not good enough for them. Everyone's got somebody and I'm just living within a void. I want to reach out but fear it's too much if I reach out I'll be rejected. Murderous perfection. I'm always curious and then I give up on myself. I hate this feeling of being overwhelmed and everyone beats me to it. The one thing that keeps me going inevitably becomes the thing I hate if it brings me upsetting memories. Why am I given more reasons to give up than to try? There are people who love being alone and there are people with lots of friends. Then there's me, I hate people's company yet I want their company. I neither alone or lonely, but I have no one. I have no contacts, no cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. I'm just existing as I did before this pandemic and It'll be the same after.

I don't see the point in communicating if means I'll be picked apart word for word. Why be friends with people who talk amongst themselves. Why, why, why?! I think I'm just not meant to be liked, they lose contact with me on purpose. I guess I'm just needy or boring or cursed."
1083,"Hello, I'd like to share this with some of you who can understand. Lately, I've been in a spiritual depression and have been revisiting the divine aspects of my life that emphasize connecting with nature and other realms. My spiritual journey has been rough considering that I have a tendency to look to others for answers rather than myself. There were definitely times where I've questioned my worth solely based on the fact I couldn't connect or find my kind of people. I've had moments of skepticism and was agnostic for several months until I realized I did desire a spiritual awakening. As of late, I've delved into the practice of Shamanism and intend on applying it to my life, the only problem I seem to have is my emotional baggage. How do I combat suicidal tendencies, erratic emotions, and irrational thoughts while aligning my craft with it? It seems as though these witches and shamans have gained enough experience to crystallize their thoughts, but I feel like I contradict my belief system, especially with negative emotions. My worst emotions are jealousy and resentment towards strangers. It's difficult to get out of your head sometimes and it can make practicing patience an impossible task."
1084,"I just don't know who I am. It feels like my soul isn't a part of me or something. Like I'm some kind of robot going through life. Sometimes I look back on what happened through the day and wonder if it actually happened or not. I used to have an obsession with the number 8 and I feel this thought coming back to me. I'm scared of that happening. I saw that number everywhere years ago, even in the hospital I was in. I don't want to go back to a hospital. It feels like I'm going backwards in life too. I'm not getting better I guess. My emotions change every second and I still don't know who I am."
1085,"Hey all, new to this place and really hoping someone will have some life-changing advice. 

I've been with my partner for just under a year, and have known from the get-go about her mental health (BPD, C-PTSD, manic depressive). I've done a lot of research/reading about BPD in particular, and I recognise that a lot of what's happening with us is pretty common, but I'm still struggling to understand it.

She's always had a tricky relationship with alcohol, and lately it's gotten a lot worse, and we've ended up in hospital or having an ambulance out several times. She's been referred on to a local addictions support team, and will be going through detox soon, and she wants to get sober which seems like a good first step.

Throughout our relationship she has been the most loving person, more so than anyone I've ever been with, and I've never doubted her feelings for me. Over the last couple of weeks though, she's been cold and distant and pushing me away. She suggested that we should take a break for a couple of months because she doesn't want to put me through the stress and difficulty of her detox and everything that comes along with it, and because she needs to just focus on herself. (I should point out that we also live together, which makes it rather more complicated.) She repeatedly said she doesn't want us to break up, and it won't be forever, and gets upset about us not being together. I suggested that we don't need to be broken up, that I love her and support her and understand that her focus should be on her recovery and not our relationship. But now she spends all her time talking to a friend of hers, drops everything to go to her when she needs something, and spends her free time with her. I guess I'm just struggling with the fact that she seems to have just switched off her feelings for me, and that this time she said she needed for herself she really seems to need for someone else. She barely talks to me, she answers me in one word texts, she doesn't tell me she loves me, or really show me any affection at all. She'll ask me one minute if we can go away for the weekend, and in the next breath will decide she's just going to stay at her friend's instead and stops talking to me. I seem to mean nothing to her any more and that breaks my heart.

Do I just accept that her feelings for me aren't there any more?

Sorry for the wall of text, just really need some guidance.

1086,"I hate my father. My mom lied to me all my childhood and told me I just didn't remember my dad or that he was too busy with work. The truth is, (even though he has always been married to my mom and always lived with us) he never wanted me. My mom struggled with postpartum depression after I was born and my dad was just absent. He did not help my mom or help take care of me. He stayed out and partied with his friends. He forced my mom to pack him lunches for work, cook him dinner, do his laundry, all while she was taking care of a newborn on her own practically. After learning the truth, I truly cannot stand him. Not only that, he still whines until my mom cooks dinner, makes him lunch, does his laundry, etc. My dad also gets jealous when I need my mom and attention is taken away from him. He's an actual manchild. 

Today I got in an argument with my father as usual. He does not understand my mental illness and does not try to in any way. He put me into this rage state it was so scary. I mean he's made me feel this way before but I couldn't hold myself back. I started screaming at the top of my lungs ""i hate you"" and banging on the table until I couldn't breathe. I started crying and shaking afterward. 

Nothing takes these painful intense feelings away. My chest feels like it's on fire and I just want to harm myself or break something. I took a xanax and it didn't help. nothing helps i swear. I want to go to the psych ward but I can't afford it again. I've always known deep down in my gut that I don't belong on this earth."
1087,"Hi,

I’m not sure if this is the right place and I know people on this site can’t diagnose but am just looking to see what other people think. Basically, the diagnostic characteristics for BPD are similar to what I’ve experienced in myself. 

Since being a teenager I’ve felt that I’m different to other people. The characteristics I think I have are:
1)Intense relationships- I often put a lot of importance on people and get upset when they leave or suddenly turn against them if they disagree with me
2)Risky behaviours- in the past I’ve had periods of binge eating, drug taking and overspending
3)Self harm and suicidal thoughts
4)Intense mood swings- can go from suicidally depressed to planning how I will become a millionaire in the space of an hour
5)Don’t have a strong sense of self- my career goals and life plans change often
6)Feel empty often- I think this is when my control issues start to come in and make me want to lose weight or self harm and after that everything goes downhill even if I stop losing weight my mood just plummets.

Because I usually have a bad period for a few months and then manage to pull myself back together often people don’t think I have a problem- my friends think I am dramatic and over emotional (I haven’t spoken to them about my thoughts about bpd but just what they say in terms of my behaviour).

I have a tendency to get better and pull myself together for other people and just push down any problems I have but then over time the smallest thing can happen and it just sends me into a spiral and I end up self harming and suicidal. I often have small blips (at least once a month) where I get very anxious and don’t eat but then tell myself to get on with it and am “fine” again.

I’ve been signed off work and the OH doctor said I was “vulnerable” in the report and temporarily unfit for work but my GP said I had low mood and prescribed Citalopram. I feel like this is not the full issue and I need to have some kind of therapy to try and resolve these issues and leave them behind. I am capable of pushing everything down and moving forward but I know that next time I get stressed I will fall back harder. My intrusive thoughts at the moment as well as the self harm are much worse than they’ve been before and I can barely leave the house or do housework.

My parents got divorced when I was 7 and I lived with my mum and sister until I was 18 when my mum died of cancer. I wouldn’t say that the divorce was traumatic but I know that people with bpd often have had a traumatic thing in their childhood so I don’t know whether the past events could be linked. 

I may just be being dramatic and just be having a period of low mood, but this pattern of behaviours feels like something more complex. I also know if I say to the doctor I feel I may have something like bpd he will not take me seriously so I just wanted to see what other people thought."
1088,Its weird I haven't had nightmares in years but last night I dreamt of someone (a man) putting their hand over my shoulders (which is a trigger from my sexual assault) and it felt so real that in my dream I felt my dream self shutting down you k ow preparing for it. And then taranchalas fell from the sky and landed on my shoulder/cheek/neck and it freaked me out so much I actually woke up and jumped out of bed. It took me about 20 sec to realize there were no taranchulas on me but it took longer to remind myself nobody touched me.
1089,"Hi everyone. I though thought I would share a positive note in my journey, because we all need some positivity - right? 

For a few years I would get a prescription for antidepressants and stop taking them after a few days (or weeks) after starting because I felt like it made me ""mean"". I got a new medication but it always made me sleepy, so I stopped taking it. But I think the sleepiness was partially due to bad episodes of clinical depression.

Last Thursday I was really upset. I've been letting small things get to me very easily. I've been misinterpreting some normal conversations as criticism. So I decided to try my meds again and stick to them for at least a month. (I'm taking Doxepin, btw)
It hasn't been a week but I already feel a lot better.

I romanticize my depression. I believe that if something bad happens, thats part of my story. I'm a character who went through something bad... and I'll wallow in it forever. I'll be a martyr for that event.

Thats so ridiculous. I finally came to a realization that maybe I'm not the type of person whos brain chemistry will ""allow"" me to be ""happy"", or get over things. Maybe I actually do need this medication. I've tried to do things my way for years and I'm constantly unmotivated and sorrowful.

TLDR; I'm feeling a lot better. If you're sad, please consider that maybe you need help to not be sad anymore. Sorrow is like a comfort blanket for me. But I've got to learn not to rely on it anymore."
1090,"Hi all, is there anyone looking for a friend with struggles similar to bpd from Dublin, Ireland? I don't have the diagnosis but experience a lot of similar symptoms and can relate so much with bpd struggles. I'd like to be able to talk about it with someone who can relate and understand so I don't feel so alone. I am looking for a new bff so if there is someone interested, let's chat?"
1091,"I need some comments on a situation I’m dealing with.. I’m so depressed and I think a lot of it stems from relationships issues. My boyfriend is my favorite person and when he’s upset which he’s been upset a lot lately, it just completely ruins my mood. I feel soo low and down not happy very stressed and hopeless. I have this feeling of impending doom I just get so overwhelmed and my emotions take over me all at once it’s too much and I’ve been like this almost every day. My boyfriend shows obvious signs of being upset but denies that there’s anything wrong I ALWAYS take it personal and it ruins my mood so much. Anyways lately I’ve been so anxious and my symptoms of bpd have gotten worse.. my mom tries to be very involved in my sons life. My boyfriend and I are new parents this being our first son and her first grandson.. my boyfriend hates my mom and has said it countless times talks crap about her which is another stressful thing I have to deal with. My mom has completely spoiled my son always gets him gifts and clothes diapers etc without me asking and is always doing things for me as well. She’ll come over and drop off food or bring me random gifts. It’s a bit excessive but I’m always grateful but my boyfriend gets upset when she comes over and stays in the room the entire time. Says stuff like that why does she always bring stuff she doesn’t need to etc. I see it as overly nice gestures but I’m always very very appreciative where he on the other hand is always upset over it.. so back to my mental state. I just feel like I can barely handle the things life throws at me bc I’m so emotionally unstable it’s insane, I’m crying multiple times a day having frequent panic attacks, very depressive moods to the point where I hardly ever want to get out of bed. I never leave the house bc of low energy and anxiety. I also am the only source of income in my family right now she I work and I work a stressful job. I just feel so emotionally exhausted and when I tell my boyfriend these things he’s sympathetic from time to time but most of the time he responds liek this “we’re parents. His parents not your mom not mine. We HAVE to learn to deal w it and he also needs to learn to deal w us . How can that happen when every time things are a lil tough you ready 2 pass him off. I get upset and stressed out but you don’t see me saying someone needs to come pick him up” this is what I’m wondering if I’m being too sensitive over. I had a stressful week and my mom agreed to watch him one of these nights so I could get a break. She’s very eager to watch and care for him and offers to watch him most of the time I let her and this really upsets him. My mom watches him once every couple of weeks with the exception of a couple of months passing and she had school or job related things preventing her from being able to. I feel like the WORST possible mom I’m not neglecting my son or putting him in harms way but I feel like I’m not emotionally stable enough and it makes me feel like the worst mom. Sighs so when he said this to me it validates that he also tells me a lot that he does more for our son than I do I personally feel it’s bc he stays home with our son while I work so yes he does but he expects me to completely take over when I get off of work and I try my best to take care of him all alone but there are times I need my boyfriends help and he says stuff like I take care of him on my own when you’re at work I’m not able to reach out to you for help. Is he actually being rude or just stating facts someone please tell me I just feel like a terrible parent. :("
1092,"2 years ago I made a friend - it went typically fast - became best friends and then everything I did involved her. Hobbies, interests, other friends, just really loved her. We spent time together whenever we could and it seemed like a mutual friendship at first. But I was constantly worried they would leave me, find other friends, distance from me. She always was really close - telling me she loved me and I adored it and would do anything for her. 

She also has complex mental health issues - sudden anger and depression spirals and involve a lot of outwardly expressed anger-pushing people away, making very dark concerning comments with no trigger warnings (i want to be careful how I describe this). when she is happy I am brimming with happiness, when she is a dark place, I am terrified I will lose her, or that at any moment she might stop wanting to be my friend. 

She knows and understand how insecure I am and how my thought processes work. since lockdown her depression has been so much worse - she has felt more and more distant and become angrier and angrier at everyone around her. She barely interacts with my posts anymore but I am always checking on her and replying. Yesterday she turned that on me and I have felt emotionally destroyed since. She was panicking and spiralling, I sent two replies, carefully worded, making sure I didn't say anything wrong, she replied  - I didn't reply straight away, wanting to get it right. she then replied to something else we were both in, so I replied there thinking maybe she wants to be distracted and not think about it. she started deliberately ignoring me and then made a mean comment in reply. Then two vague posts about me not being there for her and laughing emojis at the concept of us being best friends. then she deleted her accounts leaving a final message that was extremely concerning. It was scary. I sent a message saying I loved her and was she safe. she didn't reply for almost 2 hours, yet did to a mutual friend immediately to say she was ok. 

so knowing what she tweeted before deleting was triggering to me, she pointedly didn't reply, and my panic escalated, to the point that the mutual friend and I were discussing calling an ambulance until we realised she was deliberately not responding to me. I talked to three friends who all admitted they thought there was a major emotional imbalance in the friendship and that my mental health is not being considered or acknowledged at all. I got a couple of generic kinda messages hours later as if nothing was wrong, but I'm incredibly hurt and don't know what to do. Other friends have said she lashes out at people closest to her - but it's never happened to me like this and I don't know how to recover from it.

I'm torn too - do I message? Do I not? Is it unhealthy? Everything I do is connected to her, so I don't even know what to anymore. There hasn't been any contact so far today - she might get angrier if I don't initiate a conversation? Or is she wanting space? 

I've not had a close friend last this long before and I'm desperately trying to hold on and feeling crushed.

Would really appreciate your thoughts as I feel emotionally crushed and don't know how to cope with this."
1093,"Hi guys. This is my second post. I decided to make another post going into more depth about my situation: I’m reaching out because my girlfriend just broke up with me (wants to take a break but I don’t believe we will get back together). I never physically abused her. I just emotionally abused her. I said really hurtful things to her when I’m hurt or upset. Like I’d say I hate her and she’s disgusting and horrible and a piece of shit etc. just a bunch of really cruel words and she never did that to me back (well except last night she said “fuck you, you fucked up my life”) this was a really loving person who’s done a ton for me but I split so much and whenever she’s not perfect or I feel like she’s letting me down or not doing something my way, I split really bad and call her names and push her away. I’m really so abusive and yes I’ve been in dbt therapy for a few months and on meds but I’m still so fucked up and I did deserve for her to break up with me. No one should have to stay with someone who’s abusive and I am that. I’ve been this person since I was a kid and I don’t understand how I’ve gotten this fucked up so early on. Like my trauma doesn’t even seem severe enough for me to have grown up and became such a monster. No one will ever be able to love and stay with me romantically and that’s all I want. I want a life long partner more than anything and she was suppose to be that but she’s throwing in the towel at 5 months."
1094,"We have been up and down for a while. I didn’t trust him much due to gambling and drug issues plus he went on a night out in March and ignored me all night, knowing it was one of my triggers. I kicked him out after that but took him back as he promised to make changes. Today he just walked in after work and said he didn’t want to be with me any more. He wasn’t horrible, just explained his reasons. He packed his stuff and he’s gone. 

I know I can be hard to deal with, I am very emotional and some days I’ll be really down. I have high expectations especially with cleaning standards around the house. I change my mind about things all the time. I need reassurance. I like things my way. Everyone has their flaws. But I have so much love and care to give. I’m selfless for those I love and care for. 
He made my anxiety so much worse by ruining any trust I had for him with all the things he did throughout our relationship, and he wasn’t ready to deal with the consequences of his actions. He’s just walked away. 

I know I deserve more than that. But why does it hurt so much?"
1095,Hi I’m new here. I’m really depressed because my girlfriend wants to take a break due to me hurting her so much emotionally. We’ve been together for 5 months and now she’s breaking up with me. I just feel like I’ll never beat this bpd. I’ve been in treatment for a year and a dbt group for a few months and I’m on meds and yet I still push everyone away. I’m so miserable and just feel hopeless.
1096,"Hey guys, great news I have avoided dissociation for nearly 4 days now... coming from someone who dissociated almost 24 hours a day... :( I don’t want to go back to that state. Does anyone have any tips on preventing me from dissociating. Idk what I’ve been doing differently. I did have a mental breakdown Friday night I cried so intensely just sobbed and I couldn’t stop it wasn’t a panic attack though I’ve had those countless times but this was so intense and my boyfriend just sat there and held me. I did pray afterwards and we both felt better. After that no dissociation and I’ve been dealing with this constantly for years now pretty much all day I only have a few hours if that at a time where I’m myself and that’s so random and rare. I love being in touch with myself and my surroundings dissociating is awful can anyone help me stay like this??"
1097,"I'm pretty sure my dad has emotionally neglected me throughout my childhood. Now, whenever I act up or am distrusting, my mom compares me to him. She says I'm tactless just like him. It made me feel severely depressed and now I hate myself even more. I don't want to ever be like him, but I guess it's too late. He messed me up!"
1098,In november I told to my friend I've suspect BPD and I left her. I traited her very bad but she is always supporting me. She send to another friend for ask for me but I don't want talk and damage anybody.
1099,"Im having hella mood swings lately (ie why I'm posting so much) I just raged for like 4 hours at any poor person to cross my path. It's like I don't realize that's what's happening until it's over. Now I'm feeling kind of guilty. 

Its feels so seamless. Like obviously having my work shift pushed back is gonna make me mad. And then obviously when people tell me to calm down I'm gonna be more mad.

How do you catch yourself when your switching moods and it feels normal?"
1100,"I don't wanna be empty without emotions, I prefer feel anger or sadness even if I'm triggered for a stupid things like an email."
1101,"Was having an anxiety attack earlier, still not 100%, but I used dbt to identify the emotion, observe what it was doing to me, trace back the cause, then applied mindful self compassion to self soothe.

I talked to myself with the type of kindness and care I usually only reserve for my friends, and never myself.

And you know what? It worked.

i feel soothed and calmer than I was an hour ago.

its such an alien feeling, talking to yourself, telling yourself that it will be ok, that what I am feeling isn’t my fault, that I deserved to be protected, that I am cared for.

but I did it anyway.

maybe it will only work this one time, but at least I opened my mind and heart to care, even if it’s self care.

for those of you who don’t know about mindful self compassion:"
1102,"Is anyone on here like a chameleon? I feel like I am. Since my dad died when I was 9 I feel I lost sense of who I am. I became what I felt everyone wanted. If they were loud, I was loud. If they were quiet, I was quiet. I can't remember life before my dad died only afterwards which is just so chaotic."
1103,"I'm sick of feeling like a joke to people. It's like I am a punchline/ joke to people and when I offer to do something, that I am very competent in doing, people will decline and come up with an excuse. I'm sick of it I just wish people would take me seriously and accept my help. It's not like I would charge anything to do it as I will be glad to be able to help out."
1104,"I’m talking to this guy, right? Because of lockdown and all that jazz, we haven’t been able to meet up; we mostly text. It’s been 3 weeks, if that’s important. 

Anyway, we used to text every day, and about everything too. he would say things like, “you’re so beautiful and intelligent”. “I can’t wait until we can hang out”. “I’m so excited about you”. we’ve shared a lot with each other. 

but in the past 3-4 days, it’s been dwindling. I sent him texts like we normally do with one another and I get one one-or-two-sentence response. We don’t talk for more than 10 minutes. He takes a whole day to respond. I’m starting to freak the f*ck out. I can’t tell if he’s suddenly sick of me or what, I just don’t know. but he’s liking my photos still on Instagram... anyway. 

when he does text me, I get extreme anxiety because I think it’ll be him saying he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. it ruins my day. I know and recognize that he has a life outside of me, just like I do outside of him! I just can’t control how I feel and it really sucks. 

So, in light of all of that, I panicked and deleted his contact info/number and deleted him off of everything. I know that was a huge overreaction and lapse in judgment. when I feel scared, like someone is about to leave, I just do it for them. 

anybody know what they would do in my situation to help it? should I message him? should I just leave it alone?"
1105,"I'm dealing with a lot of paranoia right now. I don't know how to fix it. I didn't sleep well last night, but I got a few hours of sleep.

does anyone know?
How did it get its name?"
1107,I am diagnosed cptsd and ocd I have been told by a psychiatrist in the past i had bpd/eupd Traits the problem was I was under 18 so I never got a diagnosis of personality disorder I do agree that I had/have some of the symptoms from the age about 16 to 18 my symptoms were fear of abandonment dissociation self harm violent mood swings emotional dyregulation ect now I'm better I don't know if that's to do with the fact I'm on medication because symptoms have disappeared such as aggressive mood swings and crying and self harm  ect since I started meds a while back but I still have fear of abandonment really bad self image I don't know who I am basically identity issues chronic feelings of emptyness and boredom mood changes within hours I know nobody can diagnose on here but does this at least sound like bpd should I see a doctor I'm kind of like well what's the point going to get another label because I'm working with a person centred councilor to help my lack of identity and stuff
1108,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for a few years now, it started when my dad attempted suicide. I have since struggled with controlling my emotions and started to try various tablets prescribed from the doctor, I also tried online counselling and self help using silver cloud but didn't work. I feel my symptoms are a lot stronger than the standard anxiety, I can't control my anger or upset and cry over the silliest things which I don't understand why, I have smashed two phones out of anger and often feel the urge to lash out, again for no obvious reason. My partner leaves me to calm down but I get so paranoid and give myself panic attacks feeling as though he is going to leave or I will tell him I am leaving and instantly regret my decision, this is over nothing major just a small disagreement. I can do this a few times a week or my moods will switch multiple times each day. My partner is struggling to put up with my moods but when I go to the doctors they make me feel as though its normal for someone with anxiety to go through these things but I've spoken to my dad who suffers with severe mental health and he and my partner thing I have bpd. Is this normal anxiety or should I seek a second opinion from my other doctor? My symptoms are getting worse as years go by and I would like to control my behaviour and paranoia."

1112,"Please help me:

Me and my fathers side of the family have always had a strange relationship, my parents divorced when I was 9 but I was always daddy's little girl. I spent every holiday and christmas with him and my nan and loved them more than anything. However, as I got older and found out more about the divorce I realised he wasn't a very nice man to my mother or to me and my brother. He became very manipulative and mentally abusive and I started to see the man he really is. 

About 4 years ago I was sitting having a sunday lunch with him and my nan and things just kicked off. He started talking about the divorce and how he did absolutely nothing wrong and was the perfect husband. I replied and said what about the time you hit my mother - he went mad and said she had it coming, shes a B***h etc. He then turned his anger to me, I just decided to get my stuff and my hamster and leave. He followed me and said that I need to take my shoes off to go on the carpet. I just carried on walking and he grabbed me, pushed me over and beat me black and blue. As I got in my car he said he never wants to see me again because I am my mothers daughter. My nan just stood there and didn't say a word...

I haven't had any contact with either of them since and tbh I have been a lot better mentally since cutting them out of my life. Then my Nan got seriously ill in February and I decided to reach out to her and tell her I love her. She was so warm and lovely on the phone, she asked me to phone weekly because she missed me. 

Here's the problem - I have recently found out I'm expecting my first child, their first grandchild / great grandchild. 

Part of me wants to reach out to them and tell them about this amazing news, I don't really know what to expect if I tell them but I almost want to give them a chance to be better people. However, if I am doing better mentally without them in my life do I want to open up the floodgates and let them in again? 

My family are supportive of any decision I make but they don't understand the BPD and how it affects relationships.
Basically Im asking for advice and other peoples experiences to help me make this hard decision please ??"
1113,"I've finished my carreer today I'm not happy for that, I hate it, that just drowned me to depression and suicidal/existential thoughts and anger. Now I'm neutral but I'm scared that I can't feel ok for do the things that I like."
1114,"Hi guys,

So I've suffered with BPD for a very long time but was only diagnosed just under 2 years ago. I also suffer with severe anxiety, anorexia, body dysmorphia, and a few other mental health challenges.

I also suffer with a condition called Pseudo Seizures, which is like epilepsy but without the label. These fits are brought on by anxiety, which at the moment is sky high due to the lockdown and everything going on in the world right now. I am also a Support Worker so I have been working throughout this whole pandemic, I am terrified of catching the virus and now have a few weeks off due to being on the Covid ward the other day. Again this was because of my seizures. I haven't yet told work about my seizures, I do not feel safe at work currently because of how bad my seizures have gotten lately. I am now having multiple seizures a night, and they are only progressing... My doctor is happily putting me on anti anxiety medication to see how I react to them, I used to be on anti depressants however I refuse to go back on them as I had such a bad reaction to them... So I'm hoping that this works for me so that I can go to work safely and happily. 

I really enjoy my job, however because of the nature of the role it's very mentally draining sometimes, I'm a carer essentially and I'm scared of going back to work until I am adjusted on some kind of medication to make my life easier to live, but as I'm on probation I'm scared that if I get signed off, they're just going to let me go because they can replace me... I just need a little bit of advice if anyone would be kind enough to give me some insights. 

Many thanks x"
1115,Does anyone else ever feel like they know what they actually look like? Like what I see in the mirror is so different than what people describe me to look like. This is 10x worse with my body. Its so strange like sometimes i see pictures of my self from different angles and it like surprises me idk. Wondering if its just me or..?
1116,"Warning: this is another vent, but I'm just slowly emptying out every possible thought at the moment.

I seriously can't believe myself, I don't understand why I'm constantly switching back and forth. It's almost like I forget why I'm upset even though I should be remembering why because my sole purpose to have a clean slate. How can I, if my mood keeps deciding to change at inappropriate times. Logically, I do want balance and clarity, but my moods say otherwise and that's beyond frustrating. It's run-of-the-mill, random, and completely out-of-touch! It's like I'm serving two stubborn people but only one of them has the right idea. There's a soft, delicate side to me who wants to able to be herself despite being vulnerable. Then, you have my jaded, outrageous side filled with negative anecdotes that make me want to resign from this life. It. is. exhausting. PERIOD! There's nothing more annoying than having to continually remind yourself that you're thinking or acting outside of yourself again. There's no way of knowing why this happens, but I know it's imposter syndrome. I know that being confused about who you are coming with the territory of being a human being, but for me, it's at an abnormal rate! Usually, you get encouraged and end up at least finding a way to relieve your stress, I'm desperately searching and I feel like people are just sorry for me. Whatever it may be, it's worn me down into a shell of a person. I'm tired."
1117,"Quick background: I've recently started dating this guy, we'll call him John, for almost two months now. We've gotten very close, and I really see a future with him. I've been diagnosed with BPD for two years, and it has always played a significant role in my romantic relationships. 

Since the time we've been together, I've had good days and bad days. Sometimes I make a huge deal out of little things and end up hysterically crying to a point where it's extremely hard to snap out of it. 

Last night, after a rough day, I vented to him for close to two hours, crying a lot. I have pretty bad insomnia, and when we went to sleep that night, I got really anxious, started having a panic attack, and, in turn, got upset at him for not trying to make me feel better. He consoled me and told me he wasn't upset with me for keeping him up so late, but I still felt so guilty.

We eventually got to sleep, and this morning he acted completely off. He texted me from work saying that he needed to spend a night away from me to have some alone time and get sleep. Even though he said it's nothing personal, in my mind it feels as if this is him slowly distancing himself from me before ending things altogether. 

Sometimes it feels as if no one will ever want to be with me because of my issues. Therapy has helped, but I still have difficulties controlling my behaviors often. Even if I'm not targeting my upsets towards him, I still feel SO guilty that he's coming home to an emotional rollercoaster after working a long, stressful day at work.

I don't want to lose him. Any advice or encouragement would be much appreciated and I thank you for taking the time to read this."
1118,"I'm...I dont know just what's real anymore or if I'm even making this stuff up or just if its real 
My parents were suicidal since I was 12, and I dont know for about 6 years and every second day they would talk about how they should die and kill us with them, I didn't knew apparently that I should not really think or overthink about it, but I just kept living in a different world I would think about it all the time and I would had these crazy headaches, they weren't normal, I used to scream, the pain was so loud I dont know. They went away and those feelings too, then the other day I was in a small fight with my parents and it all came out, all those feelings and everything and now those headaches are back and I dont know I my nerves get so tensed i twitch. And i feel like 4 different person in a day, I can feel it I dont know, it's not my mood, I just feel, it's just I dont know, like somedays ago this happened in just around 2 mins ""I'm going to suicide....wait what why would I suicide why was I thinking it....I'm going to suicide.....wait wtf....I should sucide"" I dont know anymore if it's figment of my imagination or im thinking too much, I dont know sometimes it's all just like a mp4 playing, sometimes
 I just wake up in pain, it's just there"
1119,"A few years ago I had an affair. Something I deeply regret. I wasn't going out to have an affair but there was this man in my life and I thought he was the bees knees. Well tbh, I idolised his whole family. I felt part of something. I thought my life would be worthless without them. They gave my life purpose. Anyway, I noticed he had his head turned by another lady and I couldn't have that. He was mine. I had to turn it back. I did everything I could. I lied about who I actually was. He had a high sex drive and was into porn. I decided I had to like that. I went against everything I believed in. In honesty I was a virgin until I got married. I'm still with my husband. I am flying of regret and this makes me feel worse."
1120,Soo..i have bpd and ocd and im with  someone who doesnt like affection or have much of a sex drive ( he has cheated so i dont get it ) he calls me clingy alot and other exs have too but i do my own thing alot i exercise i watch tv by myself im doing a degree but at night time if i dont get affection i get really upset and i know i feel soo weak and wish i was stronger    can anyone else relate ? I get so much attention from men but only in a sleazy way not on an emotional level
1121,Does anyone have any advice on avoiding dissociation or want to share their experiences with it. Idk anyone experiencing this and I just came to a realization that this is what I have and why I’ve felt weird for the past 2 years... for me I dissociate almost all day and when I come to I just feel like I’m peeking through my life and I get to experience life and feelings and relationships for a short while and then I disappear again. I feel like someone is living through my mind and body.. and I feel I compare it to the movie get out... there’s a scene where one of the characters comes back to their self and I feel that way when the dissociation is over.
1122,"I woke up today after a night of aggravating stomach pain, I honestly felt like I ruined mother's day. My mother understood why I had slept in and so I went back to bed shortly after we ate dinner. Today I felt my brain had been emptied out somehow, there wasn't anyone there? Usually, I have interesting thoughts and opinions but since the beginning of the year, they don't exist. I've been living each day with that same numbness and can't seem to channel it into anything but useless babbling. I feel as though I'm judging everyone but myself and seem to resist time alone due to painful revelations. How come I haven't moved on? How come everyone's realizing their truth and I haven't? Why am I so unbelievably stuck? I just stormed out of bed after whirling inside my head and just started aggressively cleaning my bedroom. I consider myself an adaptable person and have a need for constant change, so being stuck in a depressive episode feels having my lungs filled with water or being barely alive. It has been 7 years of on and off self-deprecation that seemed to always shift from serious to minuscule each given day. Now, at 21, it feels like it's beginning to become internalized because being an open book makes me look ""overdramatic"" and ""unconvincing."" Truthfully, I just find it emotionally exhausting, and now when I'm upset, I just get very quiet. I've hit that point in my life where I want solitude and nothing else, that the attention I thought I wanted is only making my emotional health worse. I don't if I'm desiring to retrieve into my own world is an act of resistance or a sign of depression, but honestly, I don't care. If I truly need time to myself to figure who I am, then so be it! I tired of parading around my mental health because it's literally becoming a painful joke on my part and if it did matter to anyone else, then how come I have no friends? I think I need to learn to value my time alone instead of looking for someone who'll distract me from my depression. I need to realize it's there and it will be until I decide to accept it because nobody else will!!"
1123,"Recently I read a post on reddit about a woman asking how to support her BPD husband. I usually don't get worked up over social media but this triggered me. It seemed like she was blaming everything on him, what therapy he needs to do, what he needs to work on, how awful he is that she's wanted to leave him many times. It made me think, ok but what therapy are YOU willing to do. Then I realized I was actually reacting to how I feel with my family and it had nothing to do with that post.

I've taken DBT and I'm proud of myself for having the awareness of being triggered, I took deep breaths and I did some cleaning. I decided to journal on this since it's obviously a big trigger for me. At one point I typed ""I don't feel loved, I feel put up with"" and that really resonated with me. I'm the crazy one, I'm the one that needs to be fixed. I'm the one that needs to go to therapy to be ""normal"" like my family. I'm the one they put up.

So really, it's that I believe I'm unlovable and defective. And that's been proven over and over again throughout my life. If my family can't love me, who can? How do you love yourself when your family has pointed out how wrong you are over and over?

I can feel how deep this goes and I want to deal with it now. I don't want it popping up over and over. Does this resonate with anyone and any advice for how to work through this?"
1124,"Last weekend I almost went to the psych ward. I've been taking my meds late or not at all, not getting out of bed, not showering for a week at a time, and feeling empty. My mom and I got into an argument where I was shaking with rage and I was screaming. I could feel how badly I wanted to end my life, it was literally palpable. I get this weird feeling in my chest and I'm just so ready to do it.

Fast forward a week later... I am doing way better. Cleaned my room, showered, everything is back to normal. Except I can feel myself going back to my old self-destructive ways/coping mechanisms. I think I have an addiction to sex? I don't understand it. I think it's because I'm always chasing after attention and validation from men because my dad was never in my life. I hate it so much. I feel disgusting and dirty and I can't verbalize this to my therapist or a friend even. What is wrong with me? Why are my boyfriends never enough for me? I'm so scared of myself and I think I'm going to cheat on him this week.

I guess my main concern is: is this my mental illness/trauma at play, or am I just an awful person? Does anyone feel this way at all?"
1125,"recently I’ve started dating this guy, who appears to be normal (he’s slightly depressed but pretty normal compared to me  and I keep thinking, is it worth it?

last July, the boy I loved commited suicide. He was diagnosed with BPD, just like me. He left this world without me even though he had said that he’d never leave me, he won’t leave me alone, etc, etc. And it crushed me. I really can’t describe the pain. He was the only one for me, but he left, all he left for me was a note saying “I always loved you”.
I was in a really bad shape so I started going to therapy, and it helped a little.

I thought I will never meet anyone ever again, but then I met this new guy last month, and he’s really nice to me. But the thoughts won’t go away.
I constantly think that he’s gonna go and leave me, I can’t see why anyone should be interested in me, well the last guy killed himself, right?
I like him very much but I feel like a burden, I feel down most of the time and I think I’m pushing him away. I feel insecure, I feel like he’s seeing other women without me knowing, I feel like he hates me but won’t tell me (‘Cause he’s really nice). 
I tried to talk to him but he won’t really talk about these things, when I ask if he wants to break up, all he says is “no”. We can’t meet and talk because of the lockdown, So I keep thinking over and over again. I get paranoid and I feel insecure, hurt, angry, depressed, worthless, frustrated and overwhelmed, all at once and then I wish I was dead Cuz I can’t communicate with others like a normal person. I break up with him in my mind and then get back to him (again in my mind). can’t talk to him about this and it see s like he doesn’t understand what I’m talking about.
Sometimes I try to talk to him but he seems busy, besides I don’t think that talking about it will actually make a difference so I just keep it all to myself and suffer in silence. I don’t know what is real and what is Just in my head anymore."
1126,"Can it be only 1 in their entire lifetime? Like 1 true love? or do they have multiple episodes/favourite people?

does a bpd episode happen only when they have a favourite person?"
1127,"Hello forum users, 

I've stumbled across this forum when doing searches about bpd, I'm not diagnosed but my relationship ended seven weeks ago (he ended it) and since then I've struggled to cope-

He was a really kind, lovely man and I pushed him away with my behaviour, I exhibited alot of behaviours associated with fear of abandonment (testing, clinging, getting really angry, becoming increasingly controlling about him being with his friends the more fearful I got, would check his facebook/insta, wanted him to take care of me and would feel rejected/like he didn't love me when he refused) 

He broke up with me and said he couldn't handle it, I since when abit mad and text him a few times saying that I missed him and that I was extremely sorry, I also got really drunk one night and text this random girl who I'd had suspicions he was speaking to (he wasn't, it was in my head). 

I feel so embarrassed, alone and generally like an awful person, I feel I've lost someone really special and I don't know who I am anymore, I've always been a little emotional but never acted like that, although I did have a binge eating disorder for years and suffered with social anxiety. I've never self harmed though, although I've fantasised since the breakup about telling him I'm going to kill myself so that he would attend to me (I'd never do it), 

I feel desperate and would like anyone's advice or input or just abit of support, since I don't have anyone to talk to irl. 

Thank you if you read all that."

1130,"As the title says, I have known from a young age ever since I became aware I had some sort of cursed infliction due to my messed up childhood that I would not live a full life, nor come to a good end. Recognising how ugly and unlikable a person such as myself can be, how people want to be as far away from me as possible when I'm going through literally the worst mental torment you could possibly imagine. To me the idea of suicide is a comforting thought, peace and oblivion with no more pain. I do not believe in a god, and I certainly hope there is no afterlife or infinite multiverse we endlessly fall through; not unless my mind could be different in one of them. I feel someone like myself, or I'll just speak for me here, I feel like I can never live a full life. Only a quarter life if that. I have failed professionally to achieve the heights I know I was capable of and it is too late to change that, I have failed in relationships to be good to those I love and hold dear. I have failed in almost all of my friendships, unable to relate to most people and shunned by the rest. It's like people can smell mental illness, like the scent of carrion under rotting leaves. They instinctively ""See"" you and move away, disgusted but unsure why. Now I simply toil my days away existing, reflecting on infinite regrets and sorrow, or seething over humiliations with a desire to pay it back a thousand fold. I have almost become agoraphobic, and misanthropic to a point I can almost not tolerate to be in the presence of anyone I don't consider a friend or family member. The idea of trying to work a minimum wage job in a team, with other people sends shudders through my system and yet I want to work, I want to earn money so I could at least try to experience more in life. (I have worked on and off from 16, I'd say 70/30 split 70% being in employment) I wanted to travel more, climb mountains, experience some of the most beautiful wild places in the world - nature is where I feel most at peace and at home, alone without another person in sight... Dreams as high as the stratosphere, but a reality of grubbing around at the bottom rung of society experiencing nothing. The idea of another 50 or 60 years of this makes me choke out a derisive laugh. Death will be a release when it comes and I will welcome it. What are your thoughts about death? Stigma or not? Should it be respected that some people just aren't meant to be here, or can never live the life they wanted? Or is life sacred and my views abhorrent?"
1131,"Why I need feel that, for feel alive. In the morning I'm almost empty."
1132,"I'm hurting a lot and can't see a therapist or psychiatrist because of my family situation. I just wish that I knew what was wrong so I could deal with it. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but I came across this list of nine signs of BPD. I really resonate with a lot of it but I don't know if I'm right or not. figured I'd type out how I relate to each...

Fear of abandonment. I constantly feel like all my friends hate me. I'm always afraid that they don't want me and that they want me to leave them, or that they will leave me. I often get very anxious when I am alone, but I don't know how to reach out to people when I need help. Sometimes it gets to the point where I can't stop thinking people hate me and I feel paranoid (not saying I am paranoid, just how it feels)
Unstable relationships. I've lost so many friends over the years. I try my best to be a good friend, but when my mental health goes bad, they leave. I've never had a boyfriend. My relationship with my parents was absolutely awful until I went to college. Things aren't awful now, but I don't feel an emotional connection to my parents. I don't feel like they're my parents. I feel disconnected. Also, along with what I said in the first bullet point, I'm constantly afraid people will leave.
Unclear or shifting self-image. I can absolutely love myself one minute and then hate myself to the point of real anger the next. My thoughts about myself go from accepting to hate and loathing.  
Impulsive, self-destructive behaviors. When upset (normally in one of my really bad self-loathing phases, or just extremely depressed) I feel the need to hurt myself. I've self harmed once, but usually I hit myself in the head or on my legs over and over. I feel like I can't control I also have thoughts about wanting people to beat me up because my hate for myself goes so deep that sometimes I feel like pain is the only way to release what I feel.
Self-harm. See above, plus know that I was suicidal for nearly two years (up until two months ago) and still have ideations nearly every day.
Extreme emotional swings. My mood is extremely unstable. I can go from feeling amazing to having intense suicidal thoughts in less than fifteen minutes. The same goes for going from a low mood to a high mood. I feel intense anger but it is always directed at myself, not other people. I also feel unable to think clearly and properly most of the time.
Chronic feelings of emptiness. I always feel like I am nothing, and have no one.
Explosive anger. Like mentioned before, it is nearly never directed outwards - but fully directed to myself (hence hitting myself until I bruise, etc) 
Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality. I spend a lot of time feeling distrustful of people, and also feel spaced out and out of touch. I don't know dissociation well, but that might be it.

There's more than this that's going on, but I'm just sticking to the bullet points I found online for now. If anyone has any thoughts it would mean so much to me."
1133,"Hello all,

Just wondering how many of you are dealing with this pandemic? I myself work in Healthcare and I deal with anxious patients all day. The facility i work with has cut down hours and its become hard to complete my job in a timely manner. All the while people are now complaining about having to wear masks. Just to give you an idea, I'm an obstetrical sonographer and I sit within a foot of my patients for about anywhere from 10- 45 minutes at a time. To make matters worse, I'm the only one who has to deal with ""visitors"" because it's the ultrasound. I get the attachment to that ultrasound screen and the baby and wanting to have your loved ones there but I alone am being put at a greater risk. The visitor has to leave the office for the follow up appointment with the doctor after. 
So frustrating and I don't feel that anyone understands what I myself am going through. Though grateful to have a job, I'm having to work faster and take more precautions as a result of the virus and have also been told that we will not have the funding for my new equipment that was supposed to arrive this summer. Feeling hopeless, dealing with my anxiety and that of my patients. I hear all the time that I'm a ""hero"".....sure doesn't feel like that"
1134,"Hello everyone, 

I hope you are all well.  Quick question, could this be considered a BPD trait?  

In my head, I just had a bad hour in work towards the end of the day, to someone else the mistake I made is not as bad as I am making out.  But to me, it feels like the end of the world. 

Suddenly I have this urge to download a dating app, something I have sworn off forever but right now I feel the need to connect with someone, just to feel validated.

I'm not going to download the app because I hate those things, instead I'm going for a nice bike ride.

Any feedback will be greatly appreciated."
1135,"Hello, I thought I'd share my experiences with a borderline personality disorder. For me, it's on the anxious/depressive side of the spectrum. I tend to have mild symptoms where I never truly know who I am or what I want sometimes. For instance, I'll interrogate myself and lose track of my motives. It can also rear its ugly head through irrational forms of thinking. When I'm at a low point and am dealing with suicidal thoughts, I can have impulsive thoughts of self-harm. When I hit an emotional peak, I tend to want to make immediate changes (even impossible ones.) It can be exhausting dealing with people, especially when I need constant reassurance during an anxiety attack.

My BPD symptoms are mostly mild and tend to affect me emotionally rather than physically. Lately, I've been easily agitated by people and have ranted a lot. I just want to find validation because I want to prove that not all BPD symptoms are the same. Thanks for hearing me out."
1136,"Hi y'all, this is my first post. 
My favorite person and I went to school together, but were sent home due to the pandemic. Needless to say that being in quarantine away from my friends and without any routine has been very difficult on my mental health and is making my BPD more active than normal. 

All of a sudden, I want absolutely nothing to do with the girl who has been my best friend the entire year. I know that it isn't true, but right now I can only picture her as a terrible person who never cared about me. She called today to ask why I've been so distant, and I went off on her. I purposely said very cruel things to upset her. 

I know that deep down I care about her and I don't want to lose her forever. It was like I was watching myself and begging myself not to push her away, but I couldn't stop myself.  I feel guilty because I know that I upset her, but I can't feel anything other than anger at her right now. 

I'm not really sure what to do, any help would be appreciated."

1139,"My husband filed for divorce yesturday. In the beginning I absolutely idealised him, we were together just over a year before he proposed. We got married and shortly after I started feeling empty and depressed, i completely turned on him. The thing is, he is an amazing person but my view completely changed of him. I got the feeling he didn’t want kids, didn’t enjoy sex and my whole mind just went against him, I suddenly knew he wasn’t the guy for me. Well here we are two and a half years later. I’ve tried to see him like I did in the start, but I just can never see him the way I did in the beginning now. I’ve been evil to him, put him through hell, my mind won’t even let me remember what we were, I just can’t see it. Everyone asks why I turned against him and left him, and I have loads of reasons, but even I know they aren’t proper reasons. I guess my question is, and this is my fear, has anyone ever come full circle and fallen back in love with someone they completely split? I pushed him away to breaking point, and he broke to file for divorce yesterday. it’s so confusing being in my mind seeing what I’ve don’t but having no power over my thinking at all. Thanks guys"
1140,What do I do? I haven’t been diagnosed but after years of research I know I’ve had bpd since at least 7 and I’m 40 now. It’s getting worse and I don’t know what to even do. I take Effexor since 17. Increased dose. Still bad. I can’t hold a job now. I’m a teacher and the job has gotten too much for a regular person so I’m screwed. I’ve tried other jobs. I just feel empty and sad all of the time. I don’t know how to get help. I need a miracle as I fit this to a tee. I have a family. I don’t want to die but I can’t help it. I have attempted suicide and actually did die once before but was brought back to my disliking. I have no friends at all and distant husband. I’m alive for my kid. I want to do more though. Does anybody know how to fix this? My mood swings are getting worse as I age and my self image is so bad I want to self harm. How do I stop this? Who can help me? I want someone to shock my brain to make it better.
1141,"Hello, I have borderline personality disorder and have terrible feelings of abandonment and low self esteem. Let’s back track a little my relationship was the closest thing to perfect and we had so much trust in one another and we were happy mostly all the time. We’re at a point now where we argue every day. My feelings of doubt in myself have rubbed off into my relationship. I constantly feel like my boyfriend is going to leave me and I’ve pushed that idea so much that tonight he brought up needing a break. The one thing I’ve feared most is on the verge of happening... I feel like I’m not good enough for him and that I don’t have any self worth. I told him tonight that I need him to tell me more that he loves me and that I’m beautiful... in his case he thinks he says it plenty and asked is there ever going to be a bar set that will be reachable because he says I want to hear those things a lot because he already feels he says it enough. I told him if I could have it my way I would constantly hugged kissed called sweet things and be told that I’m loved constantly. I said that I want to feel confident that you’re in absolute love with only me and no one else and that I’m the most beautiful thing he’s ever laid his eyes on. Because of my low self esteem and anxiety and depression I just feel so shitty so I’m looking to him to make me feel better. And he’s at a point where he just can’t take it... he says I stress him out and he just revealed to me that I pressure him into doing things and try to manipulate him to do things I want him to. The other night I asked if he wanted to go for a walk.. he responded with no and don’t ask me again.... I was appalled and said well what the heck why did you respond that way and he told me that it’s because I always try to change his mind and pressure him into doing things he doesn’t feel like doing. I know he’s right because I was immediately going to say well why not it’s nice out it’ll be good for us. All of these things immediately came to my head and he said that before I could get them out... I would definitely say I’m realizing the issues with my bpd more now. Before I had no idea at all that I had bpd but being mindful and seeing a therapist is really helping. Anyways my boyfriend and I have our 6 year anniversary on Wednesday and he’s telling me that I’m too needy and that I stress him out constantly and put pressure on him to do things and he feels like he will constantly have to compete on my happiness etc. what are you guys’ thoughts does anyone have any advice or is anyone dealing with this? sighs"
1142,"Not sure where to post this, just have to get it out though.

Feeling super sad (melancholic even?) missing someone. We went like months talking daily, even multiple times a day to them just disappearing without a personal goodbye (although I saw them mention something about a difficult time with others). I just can't help but feel devastatingly lost without them though. I mean, we talked of very trustworthy things (I mean we were very trusting with each other. We both even spoke of insecurities with each other which we assured each other all was good). But things don't feel good right now, for me and possibly them too. On the one hand, I worry about them and want them well, on the other hand, I feel so lost and alone without them. That is not to say I don't have others I cate about and who care about me, but this was just special. It's like we really knew each other.

All of that said, I'm feeling like I need to be angry to move on. I mean, this sadness is keeping mee up at night, and I was nothing but kind and compassionate and yet never got a reason really why they left or for how long. I'm not sure I can even handle it if they do come back to me now. (No, please come back! It's just this waiting and not knowing is driving me crazy :( )
I just wish I had some sign whether or not they'll be coming back and if we can resume our friendship. But yea, I feel sick and upset, angry even that I got no notice and I just feel all this grief. If they come back, it'll be like them coming back from death but like i didn't know they were dead. Eek! Am I getting too vulnerable here? Am I going to regret saying some of these things?

I just feel so emotional and angry at myself for letting myself get attached and hurt again...yet how was I to know? I dunno. All I know is I feel really shitty today, and many days since this loss. Bleh! 

Thanks for listening!"
1143,"I was diagnosed with BPD (or EUPD) just before the lockdown started, which has thrown a bit of a spanner in the works as I don't know when I will be able to start accessing the appropriate treatment. 

I remember though, when I was diagnosed I felt almost euphoric. I was already pretty sure that I had BPD as I hit all the markers for it, and had been living with it for ten years or more. So anyway, I was euphoric. I finally felt like I might have a chance at being understood. I phoned my parents and I told them and I felt like things would change - I spent a lot of my teenage years suffering from explosive emotional outbursts, excruciating anxiety and suicidal thoughts and tendencies amongst other things, only to be told by my mother that I was just doing it for attention (which, as you can imagine, only made me worse). 

But the thing is, the diagnosis doesn't change anything. It doesn't miraculously cure me, or make me a more tolerable person to be around. I haven't really told many people aside from my parents; I don't suppose I really have any close friends to tell anyway. I guess my point is that just because I have firmly identified what my problem is, it doesn't suddenly mean that the problem is fixed. 

In fact, it is possible that the diagnosis has made some things worse... Now that I know for sure what it is I have, I find myself fixating on how I will probably never have the kind of romantic relationship I want because I know from the past that I get needy or clingy or freak people out by being hypersexual. Or I worry about telling people in case they then use it as an excuse to dismiss me even when I am being logical and/or rational. My mum keeps telling me not to tell people, not to trust people... I don't think that helps though. I don't feel like I should be ashamed of it.

What are your experiences post-diagnosis?

P.S. I know all the talk about my parents makes it seem like I might be a child, but I'm a full grown woman in her mid-twenties just FYI."
1144,"I was discharged from secondary care nearly a year ago so do not have a psychiatrist. I was previously taking antipsychotic medication, with bad side effects so made the decision with my psych to come off them when I was feeling better. 

My problem at the minute is anxiety. I’m having quite physical reactions. I think I would benefit from an antidepressant. Would my GP prescribe this? I worry that my GP might not want to prescribe medication without the opinion of a psych due to the complex nature of BPD. And the fact there are no official medicines for BPD. 

Also, could anyone recommend a good antidepressant for BPD, that I could discuss with a GP? 

Thanks :)"

1149,"Hello everyone,

I am new to this forum, so please bare with me on this one...

So, I have been having problems with my mental health for many years. I have been getting treated for social anxiety / depression for a long time, with varied success. 

I have always been pretty unstable in my life, depending on stressors, but one area of my life I have struggled with is in my relationships. I have very low self esteem, very sensitive to criticism, and have a fear of rejection/abandonment, which seems to always be in the background. 

I struggle with regulating my moods, and this can change often. I can be in a relatively good mood for example, and lets say a love interest doesn't text me back for a full day or few hours my mood immediately drops. What worries me is the severity of the mood, its not just fleeting mild irritation/annoyance, its anger, rejection and really low mood. Its like all my value is tied to this person, and I don't know who I actually am.

Also, I immediately jump to conclusions, and that person can go from being a lovely person, to horrible, and ""what if they are ignoring me"" what a vile person. There is no in between. 

I struggle to regulate my moods, and I am very rarely continually optimistic or motivated.

One day I can be full of hope, have structure in my head, and the next day I feel nothing, no inclination to reach my goals nothing at all. 

Its very frustrating, and then I usually get agitated and depressed. Which leads to me drinking a lot (alcoholism) to cope. 

I'm currently on Sertraline for Depression / Anxiety, but it isn't working so well. I've had 3 different types of antidepressants but they don't work. 

I think what I need is a diagnosis / assessment, and a mood stabilizer. 

How easy is it to get on the NHS? I assume that it will be very hard to get help/treatment on the NHS for a personality disorder?"

1152,It has gotten to the point where I'm ready to stop talking to every significant person in my life aside from my family. All I can think about lately is how everyone will abandon me and that pain that comes with it. I've had a partner for about 3 months now and I feel like I ruin everything. He says things have gotten better and he wants to be with me but I feel like he is lying. Maybe this is just my brain saying this or its actually how it is I don't really know. nothing feels okay right now. How do you manage wanting to cut everyone off in this type of situation?
1153,"Hello. I am new here and I need some clarity. I've had severe anxiety issues for years, but I always felt like something else was wrong. I come from a broken home. I was around the age of 8 when I first self mutilated. I fell into a horrible depression at 13 years old and told all of my friends that I was grounded. Through the years, I had issues with substance abuse and even got arrested a few times (DUIs and all). I have always seemed to get myself into toxic relationships with every intention of leaving. I feel guilty about things that I did in the past (even as a kid) and feel anxious most of the time. I just feel like emotions are always imbalanced and lost. I do not want to kill myself, but I feel like I would not mind if a tsunami came and wiped me out. I know that this is not healthy thinking or feeling. I have been through a lot in my life and overcome a lot of obstacles. I feel like my psychiatrist is helpful, but she does not understand like other people who are going through the same issues as me. Can anyone relate to what I am going through? I feel like I have borderline personality disorder."
1154,"I hate that this is true, but I have discovered if I go more than one day not taking my 20 mgs of Prozac, my mood plummets, my resiliency dips, my temper gets shorter.

Sometimes I will forget to take it by accident then try to figure out why my mood has plummeted. And then I realize it’s because I missed a day.

I never forget my quetapine at night, so objectively the Prozac has impact too.

Part of me resents the fact that I will probably be on meds for the rest of my life. I hate being vulnerable and reliant.

But man do I notice a difference."
1155,"Hi there,

I am a woman with BPD. I always in relationships doubt my value. I question who I am, what I am to other people, and what it is they like in me. I know what I hear, that I am beautiful, nice, smart, special... But these are only empty words for me. I often feel like an empty shell, like I am a constelation of many different personalities and traits, not that I am an individual with a set personality.   

I can feel like a very unreliable person, even though I want to believe that I am loyal. I always experience anxiety in my romantic relationships. Because I feel like a shell, responding to the environment I am placed in, I keep on wondering why they like me, what they like in me, when I myself don't even know or, rather Feel myself.
When I don't feel myself, how can they feel me?

I compare myself to other women very much. It doesn't matter how much my boyfriend or close one's try to convince me of that I am wonderful and this and that... It is like I can't take any of that in. I can get furious when other women are talking or looking in a certain way on my partner. 

I want to know... Does one always feel like a fleeting personality? Is it possible to become more grounded in oneself, and feel more like a whole person?

Are these emotions of not being a consistent and stable person, just feelings spooking inside? Is it possible that I can appear to be more consistent, reliable and ""whole"" to my surroundings than I feel inside?

I want to find a stable life where I don't do things I don't want to do, a life where I can stand firm in what I believe in, and not let me get abused by selfish people.

I have countless times felt that I am a hopeless case. That I will miss the love of my life, because I make wrong choices that will make me loose him. 

I want to know, are all with BPD struggeling with doubt of self worth, and that it is just something a part of the syndrome?

Thankful for any insight I can get, or just someone with BPD who knows what I am talking about and can lend me some support in this.

<3"
1156,"I fit with the crieria, intense unstable relationships, extreme reactions to feeling abandonded, not knowing who i am, long lasting feelings of emptyness, difficulty controlling temper etc. It was even suggested to me by a friend who i hurt/

I offered her a queer plutoic relationship ehich of course she rejected after 6yrs of loving me but of course i felt ectreemly abandoned and angry. So angry and the shit i say when im angry, 'I'd take pleasure in seeing you cry', 'hope you scream my name when you cry', i could go on. I posted about it on my vent which she read by accident so of course she has no more trust in my now and will probably never love me again (i warned her). I feel like shit but also feel empty like my actios dont have consequences. Shes the only friend i have left sp i fucked that up. Im happy lockdow means i dont have to leave the house but she wants to meet up after over coffee and slowly build up trust. but also i feel like i could urvuve without her but of course i couldnt. im low key fixated on wanting to get ito uni so i can make new friends and completly chnage my aesthetic and personality to fit in and then cut her off so i dont eber have to confront myself and my actions. I want to dissapear. IDK if anyone has any advice pls send it my way"
1157,"Hi there. I haven't posted in a while. I'm still struggling with BPD, but I just noticed something that I hope I can get an answer to.

I usually keep a daily planner so I can write down when I take medications, exercise, important things to better my mood.

I've noticed that I have more ""down"" days near the end of the week. It isn't obvious to me why this happens. I don't have a M-F job that would mean that I'm depressed when I'm home. I don't have any other habits that specialize the weekend.

Does anyone have any insight or history of ""sad"" days that reoccur in patterns?"
1158,i want to tell my psychiatrist at next appointment that i love her. I know she can't be in a relationship with me because that would be illegal but i really want to say to her that i am in love with her and i fantasize about her 24/7 since a few months and it's becoming difficult to get treatment because i know this love will get worse over time and hurt me.

1159,"Hi guys thanks for having me here..
Ok , I haven't written in a mental health social forum since I was suffering of social fobia on my early 20s.
My name is Ivan , I'm 32 and I think I am borderline .
I'm from Italy but I live in England for almost 7 years now.
I'm struggle with relationships, friendships, jobs, ( never had a job for more than 2 years). I'm selfharming sometimes, ( at least every month) getting angry , paranoid, sad, happy and emotional all in the same day.
I've never got what I wanted in life, I'm always thinking that people are jelaus of me and sometimes I step back when there's a chance coz I think I don't deserve it.
I'm supershy with girls even if I'm not a bad looking guy,  I had a 4 years relationship but it didn't work, obviously I'm blaming myself for that.
Last night I had an episode of anger and I harmed myself, smashed a cupboard, like that from nothing, I was watching something and suddenly I behaved like that.
I'm in 40ntine for 6 weeks now and I have a lot of time to think and analyze myself.

Thinking about my past, my past behavior and my relationship with my family and friends.
I have 9 out of 10 symptoms of the BPD and it's really difficult to get diagnosed by a professional here unless you go private.
I need to stay off work for 2 more months and I think I'll get more mad than I usually am.
Would be nice to talk to someone who understands, I feel lonely and abandoned all the time, feel like  noone can understand me I feel lonely and I feel like other people are better than me all the time.
Can't even enjoy my hobbies and my interest anymore and I'm having suicidal thoughts from time to time.
Thanks for listening,and thanks for having me here."

But they always do the same thing that ""im feeling sorry for myself"" or ""maybe if you weren't so weird and emotionally stupid people would wanna talk to you and you could have something"" and its just made me feel like maybe its my fault that people dont wanna be around me or maybe im just being a baby and needa grow up and idk im just lost yk? I just wanna find someone thatll be with me and be okay that im not a ""perfect"" person.. Idk idk i just feel stupid and alone and yea"
1161,"Hi everyone. Just joined after reading about quite bpd and feeling like it fit me perfectly.

I'm from a broken home. Mother was schizoaffective. I ended up in foster care. My dissociation began at an early age. I had no emotions until age 12. I'm 35 now and feel like I've lived my whole life in fantasy land. Panic attacks started early (age 6). No attacks now but I'm ALWAYS on edge. I tell ppl I idle high. I feel empty often. Life seems dull. I'm a recovering alcoholic (2 years). Alcohol was amazing. It made me feel alive, able to relax and 'connect'. I miss it all the time. Had to quite once I started drinking all day. Anxiety got so bad I couldn't leave the house. Took 5 years to get 2 years of sobriety.
.
And now......I'm just blah. I'm high functioning and I'm sure everyone thinks I'm doing fine. But I'm not fine. I'm miserable. I feel like no one I know could possibly understand. I'm in a stable relationship.....and honestly I think I'm in it just for the comfort. I'm afraid to be alone. And this person is sweet, kind and loves me. I don't feel the same. Never did. But we were friends and I knew they liked me. I was in an unbalanced state. Things were falling apart. They were a life raft. And maybe it's a fine relationship and I'm just too fucked in the head to really see it/feel it. I truly don't know. I treat them well. Certainly never want to hurt them. But this person is.....not very realistic in their thinking. Believes in healing Crystal's and that they can communicate with angels.......get it? Soooo trying to discuss this simply wouldn't be productive. So here I am. On a message board. I'm definitely codependent 100%.

I've done counseling for a long time but I JUST now realised how much quite bpd fits me. Never been diagnosed. Primary issues have always been anxiety and depression. But I also dissociate all day, everyday. It's like I live a double life in a fantasy world. Frankly I'm deeply embarrassed by it. I've never been able to talk about it. I feel like a freak.

I feel.....hopeless, terrified.....of a life in constant struggle/tension. I feel stuck. I don't really have many friends/family. I avoid talking to a couple of them bc it may cause issues with my s/o......I know this isn't healthy. But I'm walking a razor's edge with my sanity and any blow up could topple me. I'm doing very well on the outside right now. Good job, benefits, saving money. None of which I've ever been good at maintaining. I'm desperate to maintain that.

Anyway, I appreciate any input here. It felt good to put this out there."
1162,"I feel my brain is in like automatic mode. I don't have the ability to think about how I'm feeling in depth anymore.

1163,"I was trying to tell bf how I felt and it just like wouldn’t come out right. He says that he thinks we’re not a good match but that I won’t admit it to myself. No, I’ve realized that at least rationally. I was telling him I’m feeling sensitive and need him to be extra gentle. The past couple weeks I just haven’t been feeling the love as much as before. I don’t think it’s his fault I just want his help to get back to that place I was in before, feeling emotionally close and excited about it. I’ve been feeling off. He thinks I’m trying to force our relationship into working and that we can’t predict how it will go or if and when it’ll end. I don’t want it to end ever, for many reasons including the right ones. I didn’t mean to get into such an intense discussion and I feel guilty for that now. He’s sick and it tired him out. He’s fallen asleep. (Snoring lol). I love him so much, like I really genuinely do. At times his attitude seems brazen to me. At times being with him doesn’t feel as much like home as I think it should. Idk how to fix that or if I’m worrying about the wrong things. Whenever I try to tell him it seems stupid. But at the same time I know we’re like not on the same page in many big ways. I just try not to dwell on those. They might be sneaking back into my head. 

The thing is I’ve always had anxiety, just not this much. Not quite. But he and I started dating at the same time we started grad school. Those are a lot of changes and a lot of stress. I went from breezing (autocorrected to breeding, yikes) through college with all As and lots of praise to a grad research position with plenty of criticism and “let’s start over on that project again” that I find super discouraging and honestly depressing. At the same time bf wanted to know about my past relationships, and when he was disappointed to learn something he didn’t hide it.  We differ in a lot of ways and even after the early relationship jealousy wore off, we still get into our fair share of disagreements. I’m not used to confrontation or even disagreeing. I either don’t get close enough to people for them to give a crap how I think or I just concede because I don’t care. Now it matters. Now I have to share how I feel. I have to stand up for myself. I have to know my stance and express it, at work and at home. I’m not so hot at either. I easily fall into thinking “that stung a little, it must be super wrong for someone to say to me”. Especially with bf. 

I’m a people pleaser. It’s hard to accept that I can’t always please my boss or my boyfriend. I wish that bf would just tell me what I want to hear but he’s a realist who will always give me the objective truth. That includes that he loves me. That he thinks I’m a cool person. And also that he sees us being probably too different to work. And that he still wants time to focus on himself. Idk how to focus on myself or how to be content with my rose colored glasses being swiped from me. I really just kinda want those back. I’d LOVE to have a life of ignorant bliss. My brain and my emotions are tired."
1164,I think most MH 'professionals' in UK have serious problem with their own MH...most of them have Narcisist Personality Disorder and they struggle to deal with their own self...I will assess them every time I meet someone from MH services in UK...they need a shock treatment...urgently....
1165,"I have a relatively new friend (since this past December) and he's really my only friend that I have in the area. Obviously he has his own life and his own life problems but in the past couple weeks it feels as though he's consistently avoiding me or forgetting about me. The other week he started messaging me and then (3 days later) told me that he just got busy with house stuff. He promised that he wouldn't do it again but then yesterday I messaged him because he was starting to do the same thing. He said that he was just going through some stuff and that he'd call me the next day.....well it's the next evening and so far nothing. 

The logical side of my brain is saying, he's obviously dealing with something, it doesn't mean anything about you, this is not a reflection of your self worth. But the BPD side is just screaming that it's my fault, I must have done something wrong, why does he hate me? I feel like I've been absolutely spiraling for days about it. I go from hating him and wanting to scream in his face and delete him from my life to hoping that every time the phone goes off that it'll be him. 

I know that the best solution would probably be to let him go but you all know how hard that can be and I guess I just need a bit of support in the form of hearing the same thing from others who think like I do."
1166,"I have official diagnoses of OCD, anxiety, depression and autism.

Today I phoned the mental health team I'm under and told them that I am concerned for myself. My mood swings are absolutely terrible. These last 2 years, my moods have been really up and down. So, for example: for an hour each day I feel extremely depressed, then after that I feel happy and elated, then I feel depressed again but not as bad and then happy again. This repeats itself over and over again. This is all throughout one day.

Honestly, one minute I love everyone in my family, then I think most of them are irritating and annoying. My views on people differ everyday. One minute I want to help people and then I don't want to help them.

I am also very impulsive. I eat loads and binge like mad. I did once go on a gambling spree as well and spent all my money on gambling. I have bad impulses to eat and eat and eat. I cannot stop myself.

I once had a friend and I could feel us drifting away and I was so scared of losing him. In the end I did lose him as a friend.

I've never had sex, but I really badly want to - and I really want to try to have sex with a female as well (I'm female myself).

I have been suicidal before, but have never attempted it.

I mean, I don't self-harm.

I also get excited when it's bed time because I get to masturbate and then sleep for about 12 hours.

I'm going to see if I can get assessed."

Like I'm at a point where I visualize fake fights that might happen and when they don't I'm just more and more tense.

Wanna fight with me?"
1168,"Hi all,

My fiance suffers from BPD and just recently asked me if there was any way to enhance the relationship with her favorite person. I don't necessarily like the idea of her favorite person being another guy, and from everything I've been told and read she can't really help it. However last night she asked if she could start sexting and exchanging pictures. Not really sure how to take it or what to say. Any advice?"
1169,"I keep trying to figure out who I am. Like my style, my personality, sexuality. But I can never put my finger on who I am. 

Anyone relate?"
1170,"Hello, 

I hope you are well.   I was wondering what everyone's experiences with empathy towards tv characters and people in real life were like?

I always feel sorry for tv characters that are outcasts of society.  I am currently watching a British TV show called Friday Night Dinner and feel tremendous sadness for a character called Jim.  Whilst what he does is funny and really the highlight of the show, I see past the comedy and observe a man that is looking for social acceptance which is crippled by his awkward persona.  I get the impression he is just really lonely. 

This attitude extends to my personal life, I always root for the underdog and try and prop up people's confidence in the workplace, particularly when they don't appear to be a popular member of staff which is through no fault of their own, they just try too hard.   This landed me in a difficult situation once when a member of staff confessed they liked me and I wasn't interested in them.

I look forward to reading your responses."
1171,"I struggle to forgive anyone of anything horrible they do or say to me.  I remember everything like this.  

I can still be in contact with the person but whatever they did always pops up now and again and I limit contact with them for a while and it's like it just happened.  Even though in some cases it can be years or months ago when it happened. They likely have no idea why I am avoiding them or being off with them because they don't know it's because of a thing they did a few months ago still !.

One example I have a friend who now lives abroad and we keep in contact online and I see them around once every 3 years.  The last time I was there everything was fine but then something she said hurt me, I got really annoyed at her and shouted then we had to pretend everything was fine the next day as I had another few days left abroad with her, the rest of the time was good.  

Then when I got back we exchanged a few messages and after some comment I made about what she said, she replied you are a hot mess.  Those 2 words really got to me, but I managed to act like they didn't. Nothing was said again about it but even after all this time they still hurt, like is that what she really thinks of me."

1173,"Good grief! I feel so absolutely crazy thinking the way I think. When I am bored, which happens quite often, I fall back to a default behavior in which I just cyber stalk people. Not in the creepy, I know where you are at every minute of the day type of way but in a way where I want to know what their life is like now. What they’ve been up to since I’ve last seen them.
I’ve been exhibiting this behavior to an extreme with a guy I had an “almost relationship” with five years ago. FIVE YEARS AGO. Back then I never kissed a guy or even been on a date with a guy. In fact, I asked him out myself (thanks to a friend at the time who convinced me...who I no longer talk to because I’m a terrible person). I guess I idealized this guy so much in my head. We came from similar backgrounds, he’s handsome, athletic, and kind. I literally wondered what a guy like him was thinking to agree to spend time with me. We hung out on our college campus when we could. He texted me frequently. Like every other day. But the catch was that he went to go play sports abroad. Or rather he went to try out for a team abroad (this was the semester after we met) He would come home in between. And we would see each other sporadically during that time. He kept texting me and Snapchatting me during his time abroad. He knew I never kissed anyone and we always made jokes about me being innocent. During this time I was filling out an application to study abroad. I was getting hopeful that he could be my first kiss *eyeroll* but after months nothing. Finally, on what would be our last hang out I told him I’d be studying abroad. He could tell something was off with me that day so I had to obviously tell him. He tells me that he got a contract abroad. I wanted to see him more and he said we would just be reminded that basically we will not see each other anymore. So I was like okay. And he kissed my forehead and that’s the last time I saw him.... or so I thought.

I went abroad (I completely transferred so I was no longer affiliated with my previous university) and I could not get him off my mind. I engaged in risky behaviors with guys abroad but I could not let this guy go. I frequently checked his social media and I did wish him a happy birthday to which he said thank you for. He sent me a snap, I sent him one back and that was that. No replying or anything. And I was like oh okay he probably thinks I’m weird and wants nothing to do with me but why would he send me one? Whatever. I got more distracted in the foreign country while still cyber stalking and that’s when my BPD and depression and anxiety started to become more evident (a lot of other factors played a part to my mood). I actually returned home, skipped a year of school, and transferred back to my old university. I had completely deleted him from my social media at this point but it was pointless because his profiles are public.
Anyway during this year that I’m not in school I see his Snapchat (I did this stupid thing where I added him and unadded him. I even tried to talk to him through the app because it was the only contact I had left of him but he ignored me, naturally) and I see this girl. I go to his FB and find the girl and she has the same name as me and comes from a similar background. I came to find out that they were friends in high school. I’m crushed even though I shouldn’t be because it’s been a year. 

After this gap year, I go back to my old university (not the foreign one, the one where I met him) and who do I see? HIM! my chest is heavy and I avoid, avoid, avoid and walk toward my class building. I see him sporadically on campus and sometimes I would casually walk past an area he would be at and even studying in the same area because I wanted to see if he would say hi or notice me. But nothing. I also seen him walking with his girlfriend (same one) and it like crushes me. My last semester there, I begin to realize the time period that he takes a class because it was near an area I would frequent. And I began to notice him leaving at the same time on these particular days.  So I would sit around that area (not the immediate area like far away but still in my line of sight) do my work, and kind of look up when I know he’d be heading to class or leaving. Creepy I know. Mind you, I’m in a relationship with someone I love at this point and still am. I kept feeling guilty over feeling like this. Like I wasn’t hardcore stalking him but it made me so uneasy that he was on the same campus as me when I thought I would never see him again. I really had no desire to date him but I was curious about his life and what he’s been up to as a friend but I could never bring myself to actually talk to him because I was the one who initiated no contact. Deleting him and what not.


Anyway I’m still in a relationship but I still check up on him and his girl. I don’t know why I do it. I wouldn’t date him ever again. But I hate myself for stalking. I guess I do it to see if his life is better than mine and if that girl is better than me. But I really wouldn’t want to date him. I guess I’m bothered over something that never even happened between us. We never became a couple and I guess it kind of stings. I also look back at my behaviors toward him and how much I had idealized him so much and realize it was very much BPD (wasn’t diagnosed then) and I shudder. My life probably would’ve been a different story if I didn’t behave the way I did with him (self conscious, insecure, immature). It’s going to be five years since I’ve officially parted ways with him (when we agreed to stop hanging out) and I’m still in a relationship with my very loving, kind boyfriend and I feel so guilty. I love my boyfriend so much. But why do I still stalk?! I mean I cyber stalk other people too (ex friends and sometimes old flirty flames) but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth because it was a former romantic interest. Why do I do this?"
1174,"I’ve very recently been diagnosed with BPD. Prior to diagnosis and currently, I can’t help but spiral into memories of my past actions. Like I can’t even go back to Disneyland because it reminds me of when I was 16 (I’m going to be 25 soon). It was our annual high school trip. I was yelling obnoxiously on a pretty slow roller coaster (I had seen my friend do it the year prior on the same ride...and she got laughs...this year I stupidly copied to get attention...I thought I could get away with it and be the “funny” one in my group) well anyway there I was a 16 year old girl in the car with my friends and a family of four in front of me. I’m next to my friends (like 5 of us?) and I start “panic” shouting like a little girl for fun. I mean my friends were screaming and yelling too (but mine was obnoxious) I mean my friends found it funny but the family in front of me did not. I can’t forget the little girl’s face probably 6 or 7 looking back at us and the mom too. Because of how obnoxious I was being (...maybe they were looking at my friends too ... we were a group of teenage girls after all) I could tell it was my screams that was making them not enjoy the ride. The dad I front of them yell “Can you shut the hell up?!” (He’s with his son maybe a little older than the sister). And I couldn’t help but feel guilty. I saw them getting irritated but I still persisted. It took the dad to yell at us (most likely me because my voice was the most annoying and loudest and obnoxious (I was panic shouting like a little girl ...it was not a scary ride I was just being a dramatic dumbass teen trying to get laughs...stupid me) for me to stop. I feel so guilty because I actually saw them getting irritated and I feel like I ruined the experience for that family because of me. And I keep remembering the little girls face...good grief this was like almost 9 years ago...I can’t let it go...And that’s why I can never be comfortable setting foot in places where I behaved like this. This is just one example of many examples. And sometimes it’s not places it’s people. I’d like to think that I’ve changed but goodness I can’t stop thinking of memories like this. I’m also so shocked that I only started to own up to my wrongdoings and past actions at this age. Why did it take me up until 25 years old to feel somewhat more mature in the way I interact with others (college was no different than high school for me...hence why I wouldn’t want to step foot on my college campus again)? Can’t help but feel like “karma” (if there is such a thing) is finally coming back to bite me. I no longer have sustained friendships, wallow in sadness a lot, have been constantly struggling to find who I actually am, and just feel like a waste of a person sometimes because of the person I was and who I am now. Almost every place I go to (still live at the same place I lived at since high school) reminds me of my horribleness. Or even interactions with people from my past makes me feel sad. Ugh, sorry I’m spiraling but I’m finding it hard to forgive myself when I feel like for the past 25 years of my life I’ve been one of the worst people to be around."
1175,"Does anyone else always get this? I worry about things that I realize aren't serious. But for some reason it bothers me. I'll connect things to each other, like for example I'll think I'm guilty for not placing a jar of pickles down the 'correct' way (or what I think is correct). Or I'll feel guilty about thinking of a certain number and believe something bad will happen because I'm an awful person. I worry all the time.

I think it's gotten slightly better with the medication that I've been taking. But I still worry. My doctor says I have borderline personality disorder and that it will get better over time."
1176,"I'm a male, on the young side. Never had a romantic relationship. According to my psychiatrist, I 'display a concerning amount of BPD and BPD-related traits'.

Should a person like me even be allowed to have a romantic relationship? Is it moral for me to even consider such a thing?

Apologies for any grammatical errors."
1177,"I can't even move to do the most basic of tasks like washing up or putting on the clothes wash. I am just basically trapped in my own paralysis. I have tried stuff like exercising, going for a walk to the park and meditating but I get back and I still feel the same. I feel angry about the past and the cards that have been dealt to me, and I feel like a wasted life. Yes I am seeing a therapist and yes I am getting support, but I can't MAKE motivation, it's like my whole mind and body have just shut down. You might call it procrastination. I just feel completely worn down.

The worst thing is I am 27 in a few months and I feel like I've wasted my life. I've had no relationship, just abusive encounters. 
People say at 27 you have your whole life ahead of you, you can't say you've wasted your life as you're so young, but let's be honest, so many people have done so much by this age. My therapist said to me today maybe those people haven't been through what I have gone through and that's why they can do what they can, which is true, but it doesn't make me feel any better. I feel absolutely wasted, like I've wasted my young years. Please someone tells me it gets better. If someone could just give me somehow motivation to believe that something is going to get better, I would be able to motivate myself"
1178,"I feel like I'm losing a battle. 

My wife years back has been struggling with BPD, and I am for sure the type of individual that can take on a challenge and especially with the amount of patience I have built up over the years. 

Slowly, my wife and i have been drifting. Relationship wise as a whole. (Understanding this is from one persons perspective and please take what I have with a grain of salt because I truly need help). We werent as happy as we used to be, dates seemed like chores, effort on my part never seemed to be enough and my words I have to use was like walking on broken glass to ensure I didnt set her off. 

Some days she was happier than a pig in poo! Other days she couldnt stand the thought of laying a finger on me. 

Now things are brcomung quite estranged especially since we have been quarinteened. She goes on runs/drives to ""get out"". I cant help but to think my existence itself is an issue to her, but I just truly wish i could find that silver lining of not feeling like I cant be myself and that I am living in a relationship where I am not an issue.

We have seen therapy through counsellors and therapists, I feel they were great for a while, but it slowly started to taper off and the things the therapist started to mention my wife wasnt entirely on board. 

I truly wish there was some way I could help her  happiness even on the days where I may be in the negative light. 

Again, I am fully supportive of my wife, I love her to bits and all I ever want is the best for her and her to be as happy as she humanily can be with life, our relationship and me. 

Not too sure who will find this helpful, I truly do not mean to brush BPD with a negative brush, these are just me thoughts and feelings I'm experiencing through this challenging time and would like to know how i can assist or make things better for my wife and our relationship.

I will never give up, but I do feel like I'm losing.

1180,I was diagnosed with BPD and GAD in my early teen years (even though there have been a couple doctors that have told me I was too young for this diagnosis) my anxiety had gotten worse and worse as the years go by (now 32) so bad most days I can’t leave the house. My BPD has overtaken me over the past few weeks and i don’t even know who I am anymore. My doctor put me back on Topamax since that’s the only medication that seems to work for me. But why does my BPD hit me like a brick? I am stressed.. in the process of selling and buying a house.. but it seems like it came out of nowhere and next thing I know.. I’m in a parking lot with about to quickly end my life. that’s not me guys!!! I ended up taking quite a few of my anxiety meds and passing out in my trunk of my suv for 4 hours until my friend spotted my car and brought me home. I’ve never taken it to this extreme before! Has anyone else just randomly went off the deep end over just being stressed? I know stress effects us different and hits us harder.. but whoa.. it took a couple days of being out of it and secluding myself until I realized what I had done.. and i was completely embarrassed.
1181,Well. Is normal feel lots of depression in the morning when you wake up and in the night you feel good?
1182,"Hello everyone. Newly diagnosed and finally all the missing pieces have fallen into place. That is why I cannot really connect, I do not let myself connect as I know it will rarely last. The stability comes from my cherished partner, who is never letting me down. Last year I ghosted three of my friends, after having a trully painful and agonizing period with anxiety, hopelessness and panic to try and hold my crumbling FP in my life. I am now understanding that I seemed creepy, clingy, tiring, weirdo and a bore. I had to move away, in order to establish some health and balance. There is no grey, and I completely erase people when the panic reaches an agonizing point, or when I feel I don't need this in my life anymore. People don't understand why or how, I have lost so many friends over the years. I had an abusive childhood, lots of trauma and lots of bitter loneliness, self harm, and helplessness. Victim of rape, of constant belittlement, and parental violence in different forms. I want to stop splitting and learn how to take steps into reframing, find equilibrium and seeing the different colors, not just black and white. No money for therapy and bad economy where I live in general. I will try and educate myself and hope to find something that works for me in the forum. How do you deal with splitting?"
1183,"Idk. I feel really BPD-like (I’m not diagnosed, but I’ve been told by professionals that I have traits. They come and go. That’s what I mean, otherwise I wouldn’t use a disorder as an adjective. No disrespect to anyone with it, trust me I feel ya) with my boyfriend and I was pretty rude to him just now. I think I was set off because he was short with his texts this morning and I’ve already been so emotional lately. But I’m especially set off because my fears are coming back. Fear of not loving him, not being a good match. A lot of times when I’m with him I feel I’m not really there or he’s not really there as I block out most of my strong emotions to allow myself to function and not just like cry lol. That’s scary. This past week I’ve felt like that a lot. Like I know I love him but I can’t feel it. Then it’ll hit me when I’m back home and I’ll block it out. Then I’ll get really angry. I felt justified in my anger till I talked to him. I realized I was talking in circles and making no sense. I’m going to take some anxiety meds but hopefully they help me. I apologized to him also."
1184,"I'm not feeling very well lately, work and other events are putting me under a huge amount of stress and I'm feeling I'm relapsing. In someother post I mentioned this and I was thinking back to it a lot and to the therapy I interrupted sometime ago. I never got to work out somethings that I'd like to talk to someone preferably anonymously. 

I don't remember events from this period that well, but in my childhood somewhere in time when I was maybe 5yo there was in kindergarten this woman that took me to this out of order bathroom and locked me there sometimes and did things to me. And I from the things I remember from those events it was really very wrong, but I was just a little boy and didnt understand any of it, i think, but im not even sure if I did or not, I remember being upset for being locked there and trying to hide for it not happening again, but as a kid I dont remember feeling it was all as wrong as it actually was, as a kid maybe just thought it was a weird adult that like playing with kids pee parts which is weird but as a kid you dont understand a lot of things adults do. So anyway I'm bothered a lot by it, because it makes me feel terrible now but I also wish it didnt leave a trauma and maybe I'm overrestimating the impact it had on me? I never got to talk about this other than for a few minutes to my therapist because it feels very weird and humiliating. Well Idk, I'm feeling very low lately, I wish things could be fine and that it's all really just stress from work and personal life that's making me feel like regressing in my mental health state."
1185,"I have been working with my current therapist for the last two years. It’s taken me a very long time to start talking, and start trusting her. 


However, I am going to university this September, and it is in another area. I am going to spend at least the next four years there until I finish my course. 


I am not sure if I should find another therapist to work with nearer my university, or I should stick with the one I have now. If I carry on working with the same therapist it means I will have to travel longer to get to therapy.


I am scared if I find a new one, I might not get on well with her/him, and it might take another two years before I open up.


Any of you been in this situation?"
1186,"Recently got dumped because of my BPD. I don’t really blame him, he is a great person and has been a great boyfriend. BPD can make you very difficult to live with. Trouble is we’re in lockdown together. I don’t know what to do. My emotions are simultaneously all over the place but I also feel numb and emotionless. Want to self harm, but we’re still sharing a bed and I don’t want him to be upset that he’s upset me. Would contact mental health but we’re sharing a small flat and don’t feel comfortable talking openly within earshot. We plan on still being friends. We’re forced to stay living together due to lockdown, but I’m terrified of the thought of having to move. I’ve really liked living together, this flat is great but I can’t afford to live here alone.
Honestly, not sure anyone can help. Don’t even know what the exact problem is. I don’t even feel bad, I just know I feel weird. Weird can be very dangerous for me."
1187,"I have been struggling with this quarantine and my relationship lately. My anxiety and depression is getting worse and it seems like my mood swings and feelings are becoming unmanageable. I love my boyfriend but lately I’ve been feeling really upset about everything he does. I feel like my mood shifts so rapidly. I’ve been sort of cold and ignore him just because I don’t feel like talking. He gets upset and leaves me alone but then I get angry that he won’t initiate a conversation with me or pay attention to me. But then there are times when he does give me attention and I don’t want it. It makes me feel gross and I think it’s a trauma response.  He tried to hug me in bed and I told him not to and when he rolled over to get on his phone I became furious and got up and left. I don’t understand why I have to feel this way, I wish I could manage my emotions. I feel so guilty for making him feel bad. He is so patient with me and tries to understand as best he can but I’m so scared that I’m going to push him past a point of no return one day. That I’m going to ruin our relationship. I don’t know what to do, it’s driving me crazy. I started having impulses to self harm, and I haven’t don’t that in over a year. I’m having a hard time dealing with all of this and I feel so alone and empty. When I lay in bed next to him I feel lonely. When he hugs me I don’t feel anything. I worry that this feeling is never going to go away and that I won’t ever be able to be truly happy."
1188,I feel like I only really have BPD traits during PMS. But like a week out of each month is still pretty unfun 🙈.

1191,"I joined this forum to see if anyone with BPD has had an issue with this as well. Ive been diagnosed with BPD, but have started to struggle with something that I dont quite know how to put into words. The closest things I can find to describe it is dissociation, depersonalization, or just anxiety? I really don't know.

It's something that I've noticed throughout my life in small spurts but has gotten a lot worse, and frequent, recently. I'm a pretty confident and mentally present person, but when I am in social situations with a lot of people I feel like a part of my brain shuts down. It almost feels like a high, or being slightly drunk. I forget what I'm doing, or how to articulate myself and I get really nervous, it's like being in a fog, and all my thoughts stop, and I am unaware of what is going on around me, which is really scary for me

I switch into it so quickly too, I've found particularly that it happens when I go to the grocery store. I can know what I need, and can feel confident, but as soon as I am around strangers it's like my mind goes blank and I am separate from my body, it's like trying to run away from something in a dream, but it gets harder and harder to move? that's what it feels like trying to come back to myself.

It's started to happen in situations aside from grocery stores, I'll be meeting my friends somewhere public, and as soon as I enter a busy place it's like I shut down, and cannot find or see them, even if I pass them multiple times. It's easier to cope with it when I am around people I know, but it's still there and it's getting really frustrating. I'm airing on the side of it being social anxiety, but I am not afraid of people? or being in crowds? I'm just afraid of this emotional wall that comes up in my mind"

1194,"What do you think causes us to have BPD?  Is there a theme to people who have it, something to do with their childhood or other reasons that show why people have BPD."
1195,"Okay, this might be a long one, so bare with me here... 6-7 months ago I started dating this guy. I have NEVER hit it off with anybody so well, EVER.
Back story with him - He had a child with his high school sweetheart and that baby unexpectedly passed away at 3 months old. They handled the death very differently, and it ultimately caused them to split. Not necessarily on bad terms, but they knew they didn't want to be together anymore. Fast forward a couple years, he had met somebody else and gotten married to her, and ended up having a little girl. This mom made some very bad life choices, so they divorced and he has had sole custody of their daughter for a few years now. His divorce was finalized right around the same time as I split with the father of my children (VERY toxic relationship, but I was with him for 7.5 years).
Well, we had both been single for about a year and a half when we met, and had an AMAZING connection immediately. Honestly it was a bit of a struggle at first because after years of mental abuse from my ex, I had never been treated the way a lady should be, so it was a bit uncomfortable getting used to somebody who actually wanted to spend time with me, do things with me, and actually help me accomplish things that I wanted to do rather than just use me. He makes MY priorities a priority. For the first time in my life, I had a legitimate PARTNER, rather than a manipulator like the father of my kids. I finally started getting used to the idea of feeling safe, and like I had somebody who would never hurt me.
Then on Christmas (a few months into our relationship already), his ex (the mother of the child that passed away) posted on facebook that she was pregnant. He pulled me aside that night and revealed that he was scared because he did have a random 1-2 week fling with her over the summer because they wanted to see if they could try to make things work again (They obviously couldn't, and they went their separate ways again), but based on her gestation, the timeline matched up that the child could be his. She hadn't said anything to him since the summer, so we decided to assume it wasn't his child unless she reached out to him. New Years day comes around, and of course she texted him to tell him that she's pregnant, it's his, and she's due soon.
You guys... That DESTROYED me. He has reassured me over and over again that even though he's going to be part of the baby's life (assuming the DNA tests prove that the baby is his) he does NOT want to be with her, and sent me a screenshot of a message from her that said she dreaded telling him because she didn't want to mess up his relationship with me. I know he's being honest with me but this has shaken me to my absolute core. My anxiety and depression have both been through the freaking roof since we found out, and I don't even know how to cope with this. He has been 100% transparent and honest with me every single step of the way, talks to me about it whenever I feel that I need to talk about it, and is just super reassuring considering he knows how insecure I am about all of this. I truly do trust him, but I've come to realize the second that I become insecure about something, my subconscious automatically puts up a wall and tries to self sabotage things. If I love him, trust him, my kids absolutely love him, and overall I just want to be with him, how do I stop my destructive thoughts that make me think I need to leave the relationship? I know without a doubt these negative thoughts just stem from fear of abandonment or just being hurt in general, but I subconsciously keep looking for flaws in him to convince myself I need to jump ship. The fear is causing so much paranoia and causing me panic attacks on a daily basis. He didn't do anything wrong considering they hadn't talked since the summer and their fling was before he and I ever even met, so why am I feeling betrayed? Or maybe it's more jealous than betrayed? I can't seem to identify WHAT my feelings are, just that the bad ones are trying to consume me. My insecurities are making me too scared to take any of the next steps in our relationship. How do I get past this? I know it's not an issue with him, it's something within me. I just want things to feel secure again.
*Side note - I'm not sure if this is relevant or not, but the baby was born a couple weeks ago now."

Finding it hard lately so wanted to join a forum and this was the first one to come up on google :) I’m 26 I was diagnosed with bpd in October of 2019 which was a relief as for many years I knew I had something bigger going on than just anxiety and depression as they had been diagnosed some 10 years prior. At first i thought it was fantastic as I could learn about it and relate and a lot of things made sense. 
but I’ll cut this short. 
I feel like I’m in a dissociative state like more than I’m not in one.. it just becomes a safe place for me like a place where I feel protected. But I don’t have control about entering that state it’s out of my control just every so often I think wow I can’t remember the past week/month.. it’s bothering me because I have a personality that I feel is being wasted by being in these states it just makes everything worse and harder as I’m not facing any issues just pretending they don’t exist. I don’t have any control about when and how long I’m in these states. 
but any tips on how to not be in this state would be great.."
1197,"So in my job, I get along with a colleague pretty well.  We talk about a lot of different things as we share similar interests. One day they made a passive aggressive comment on my intelligence.  I was a little taken back by this comment and was immediately filled with rage, I had to do my best to hold it in and stop it from spilling into the workplace.

I decided the best course of action was to ignore this person because they had enraged me that much and told myself never to speak to them again unless they said hello first.   I even went as far as to label their colleagues from the same department as 'the enemy' and to avoid them at all costs because they were part of the same problem.

Thoughts?"
1198,"I am so confused. My boyfriend said I had BPD after he looked through my phone on a trip to Mexico we took in December 2019, and saw I was talking to other guys. I was talking to other guys on a dating website, because I was afraid of losing my job and he wasn't working at the time, and I just wanted to make everything perfect. I felt like we needed the best of the best in our home and I wanted to decorate and make everything like a high end magazine. He did not tell me he looked through my phone but the energy was different. I was struggling with anxiety and  playing mom the entire trip. (it was a work trip for him) I was happy he was working and I thought he may do something nice for me. I'm use to getting gifts in relationships, but in our relationship I felt unsettled. I never admitted to him but I really never felt like he could provide for me,and he picked up the subtling and one time even said ""You don't think I can provide for you."" I felt so bad, I didn't want to admit it. 

In Mexico he came home, and I was reading a book by The Dali Lama, and kind of projected onto him how we shouldn't do things for money, we should do things with love and compassion. He got so upset, and started scrutinizing my work in marketing. I was triggered and started pacing back and forth from the bathroom and my voice got louder as I tried to state my. point of view. He sat back in his chair and said "" do you really think I actually believed you went toHong Kong and Thailand, by yourself"" He was insinuated that I went to see other men. (note this was before the two of us were together, and I actually went their for my own adventure but it turned out to be the most traumatic and lonely months of my life.) I exploded. I yelled so loud, for him to leave. (I turned into my mother) I couldn't find my phones, I went down to the lobby accusing him of taking the phone,then I found the phone and sent him an uber to go stay with his friends who were traveling through Mexico. I slammed the car door, and told him to stay there. He never came back. I spent the next week alone in Mexico City, getting yelled at by my boss, for the marketing launch having issues. I tried to hard to make it work, I couldn't think clearly, I just cried and screamed for the entire week. I felt abandoned and he ignored me. I was so embarrassed afterwards. He sent me a message and links about BPD, and at first I was insulted then I looked into it. I called a counselor and the last day of our trip he took me back, well he at least let me come stay with him. We missed our flight, and he must of thought I was irresponsible and always missing flights after that. I wasn't sure if when we got back to Miami we were going to stay together. I begged him to help me. He said he could send me up to his step moms vacant apartment in NY. Even though I had a place I used for airbnb in western NY i could of used. We decided to try and make it work, if I would go therapy and get better. But instead of getting better I got worse. I just wanted to please him and make him happy. I ended up becoming suicidal, and lost all cognitive abilities, eventually losing my job. I stopped taking care of myself, I gained weight, started binge eating, my roots grew out, and I looked like a broke off from reality, Boyfriend put me in the spare bedroom. I was so uncomfortable and lost. He started drinking more, and he cancelled our trip to Costa Rica, and took another girl. When he did that I didn't want him to go. I went to counseling and afterwards I ended up at a restaurant/bar, I normally never drink, but I just threw up my entire life in a 30 minute counseling session, and my boyfriend was going on a vacation with another women. I started to drink, and I called my boyfriend to send me an uber. He never answered, turns out I was dialing the wrong number. I finally made it home...drunk... and I wanted to talk to him. He was upset, and because of my state of mind I couldn't control my emotions. I ended up throwing his passport out the balcony window, cutting up his ID so he couldn't go. He missed his flight and then the next day I gave him his spare passport. He never forgave me, he sent his friend the following morning to escort me to the airport,he sent me to California, I'm now staying with my Grandfather, and he has all of my things. He ignores me, and I've given up trying to contact him. He said he wants nothing to do with me and to get help. I know I have issues, but he definitely didn't help. He always made me feel stupid when I had work calls, he would be in the background waving his arms like a crazy person, trying to tell me what to say, because I never could say anything right. He also pretended to talk and flirt with other ""imaginary girls"" on the phone on the balcony, i guess it was supposed to make me jealous. He used so many drugs, we bother used ketamine, and he used cocaine, and lorazepam, and some other pharmaceuticals. He would always try to leave me before I left him. He would say things like, once you go to counseling and get better you'll probably leave me. 

Any way sorry to make this so long.

I cried and I know he is disgusted by me. We both started to hate each other, but I feel like I am suffering and can't get out of this dark place. I lost my job, I lost my home, my boyfriend, and now I'm across the country with a suitcase of clothes I don't want to wear because I've gained so much weight, and a Grandfather I barely know, and get annoyed with, because I am over judgemental of his failures in life. I judge my family for being broke and failing financially and in their relationships. I know this is wrong but I get so annoyed with them. It seems like everything is triggering for me now, and I am completely aware of my maladaptive behaviors. 

I don't know what to do, and now the entire world has shut down because of the invasion of this virus. Which also causes me so much anxiety.

I know I have issues but if anyone read this mess of confessions, please feel free to be brutally honest with me."
1199,"I'm the only who likes that mood? Anger drives me to unpleaseant, impulsive, irrational and adictive things (sexual 
preferably) but when I'm depressed by days or hours I feel good,(In control, very rational, no impulsive, no sexual desire, etc). Even the good mood change is great. But the anger is a dark thing, I'm so bitter and sarcastic a little bit when I'm fine."
1200,"Hi, I have Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder. (New name for Borderline)

I‘m currently an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital. I am having issues with sore, receding gums and am paranoid that my teeth are suffering. In the last few weeks a gap has opened between 2 of my teeth. I keep studying photos of my teeth from previous years, comparing them to how I look now. It’s consuming me and dominating all my thoughts. I‘m pretty obsessive about my teeth. Here are photos of my teeth 1 year ago and now. I think they look dramatically different. Am I just overreacting? Thank you"
1201,"say if I message someone and they don't get back to me within 2 days max. then I can't rest, it pops into my head a different times during the day wondering why, I alternate between worrying and trying to work out why did I do something wrong? to feeling angry at them. I got a reply back from a message 3 days later and it's not like they were working or busy and it only takes seconds to respond.  

Then another friend I messaged on fb has not even read the message even though he is been on fb a few times in the last 24 hours since I sent it. At times like this I get close to blocking someone but I am scared to because they will think I am crazy or they might be glad. Am I crazy though, is it an extreme reaction."
1202,"I think something is wrong with me. 
I cant manage My interpersonal relationships if 1 is succeeding the others suffer. And I feel I'm in this constant state of exhaustion in trying to maintain them. 
I feel pathetic for not being able to manage basic relationships other people appear to managing fine."
1203,"Hello internet. I am diagnosed with BPD. I'm not sure how this disorder exactly works even after two years of diagnosis. But I'm sure something is really affecting my life for long. I'm quite young. I want to address here on how I am unable to actually make a change in my life which is necessary. The reasons are weird for me. In the past, I searched on Google a lot about self - help advice, and I tried on my own too. Later I went to therapist(s), but I always felt I have a hard time following what they're saying. I am on medication currently (and my psychiatrist also suggests going to a good therapist). These experiences have made me really demotivated. I also feel that I am making no progress at all because I want to stop having mood swings, where at one point I am willing to face anything, and other - I am on the verge of suicide. It sucks because I am scared of what I'll do to myself one day. I don't want to recognize myself as only a person 'who has BPD.' I really don't like being told much about this mental health disorder because it gives a lot of anxiety.
(I hate saying this, but I stopped my medication for a while because of taking other medications for my physical health.)"
1204,"hi, 
i’ve had previous relationships and my last was very intense and toxic
now i’m in a new one and my commitment issues and mood swings have become extreme
i also feel triggered just by being in a relationship because my previous one was so traumatic for me
i’m not good at opening up to anyone so i don’t know how to talk to my s/o
i think they will end it soon and i can’t let myself care about it so i don’t get hurt 
i always push people away and never let them in because of trauma but i actually want this relationship to work i just don’t know how

would be happy for advice or to talk to someone with similar experiences
xoxo

1205,"Hi, I have always struggled with feeling like a hindrance to people. I feel it in my intimate relationships just by having needs that have to be adressed but I am also super sloopy and distracted so I am always causing this little, stupid accidents like spilling water in the bed or breaking glasses and I always get angry or annoyed reactions cause it is so frequent. Now, quarentined with my boyfriend it has become a real issue for me and him. He gets super mad cause I know he thinks this can be avoided if I am more cautious and I just feel like a stupid mess. I have tried being more cautious all my life and I cannot seem to be able to stop, my mind is always elsewhere. I do not understand why I am like this. I would want to be perfect and not bother anyone by being so. I don't care about this sloopyness when I am alone but when it bothers people it really breaks me.  I feel like I don't deserve anything cause I am such an annoyance, that I don't even deserve to be with him, I am actually having suicidal thoughts. Now I am super depressed and don't want to leave bed but I know he will think I am being dramatic or that I don't want things to get better."
1206,". . . .don't know where to start. 

Well actually I do . . .having a plate of food and glass of wine thrown at me whilst eating dinner with my three young children this evening . . .all because the kids conversation was annoying her and she couldn't control it or her own unfounded emotional irritation. When I gently tried to create a boundary by suggesting we should all change the subject the rage appeared, zero control lots of shouting followed by the meal ending all over me and a flip flop being launched, missing me and hitting the middle child in the face . . .today started as a relatively typical Sunday, but as ever on a knifedge and this time finishing with hurt, anger and upset. 

I have been in this relationship for nearly 25 years. Typical knight in shining white armour story - very attractive and seductive partner, listened to all my young angst and became a good friend. She was a little bit fragile, physically my type but a little needy, a little aloof and needed a lot of attention - my love and loyalty would surely resolve some of her quirks and all would be well . . . .

At the beginning I had no idea there were any real problems. We were in love. Systematically demonising my friendship groups, picking 'our' friends, controlling my world effectively was all swept under the carpet as I just wanted to make her happy. She was very successfull in the workplace initially earning a lot more than myself but always seemed to be in friction with someone or something . . .I listened, after all I loved her - this was just the way of the world?

We had 3 kids in quick succession. Our relationship had become stormy but the physical side was intense and on her own she was mostly a pleasure to be with, especially if we talked about the kids. Our friendship groups stagnated but she seemed happier this way. To be fair she was technically an excellent mum to all 3 kids when they were babies. I pulled my finger out and started to work really hard, my career progressing beyond her own so she could eventually give up work for over 5 years. Even though she now has returned to work I provide everything . . .she contributes pretty much zip even from her own earnings. 

Life becomes more complex, situations change and challenges hit from all sides with the added responsibility that parenthood brings . . .which in my whistle stop tour leads us to today - middle age and sub teenage kids that are growing fast. Her rages started to become more and more random and intense about 3-4 years ago when I started to look for answers. I knew something was wrong but didn't know where to go with it. She refused all offers of help and as a high functioning individual put her rage down to post natal depression. On a similar evening she attacked me and cut my arms with a broken plate as I raised them to defend myself - I told my family who recommended I speak to my GP and raise the situation with Social Services. A letter eventually arrived in the post but nothing was taken any further . . .I forgave her - for the millionth time. When I told my siblings of this event (I'm one of 4 from a stable home) they actually said if I had been female and she male they would have 
come round immediately and removed all of us from the house . . .interesting that because I'm a 6ft, large man they haven't . . ?

Shortly afterwards, and with help from a family member with some experience in this arena, I started to investigate BPD and to be honest, reading posts on forms similar to this frightened the sh*t out of me. But it was like reading a book of my life to date and her symptoms and actions were . . .text book. She comes from a broken home, dominating mother with no real understanding of love, alienated from her father who stills lives locally but ran away from it all years previously after suffering physical abuse, she seems hell bent on repeating her own family cycle but refuses to admit anything is wrong . . . . .it is ALL apparently my fault. I have offered help, I have offered support, I have consistently been a loyal partner . . .to no avail, the trip continues its unhappy road to misery. Glimpses of happiness (usually on expensive holidays) do sometimes reappear, but the majority of my life is, to pardon the pun, spent walking on eggshells. 

I am now at a major crossroads. Middle age and living with someone who doesn't really know how to love. I've realised my loyalty will not defeat her problems. Its painful - the kids are starting to see it and I worry about their own strength and ability to form their own adult relationships. My heart says leave - its not too late to rebuild myself and I deserve love - I'm kind, loyal and generous - surely I deserve some of that in return? The look on the kids faces however if I walked out the door would destroy me forever, they know who I really am. . .she would also justify her own behaviours if I did this (she's always saying I don't love her / leave me in front of them) and I fear parental alienation would be absolutely inevitable. I cannot risk this whilst she is in denial of her own being; I think she knows she is in pain but cannot find her own solution.  

My head says stay - the kids need some kind of stable influence and whilst she loves them in her own way (she is their mum) her love is always conditional (this evenings display being a perfect example) . . .and they are learning fast. Surely I should wait until they are old enough to understand and survive themselves? Surely if I stay I can at least try to provide some kind of emotional stability? I think I'm willing to sacrifice for this, however will my own well being be so damaged at the end game that a new relationship of my own would become near impossible . . .?

Really really need advice - she refuses to go and see a professional. She claims she has already done so and that prescription medicines are no help (most are strewn all over our consistently chaotic and untidy house) . . .I could go on, but sincerely do not believe much of what comes out her mouth these days . . .lies upon layers of lies quickly become her truth and she's a master in the art of manipulation and deceit whilst accusing all those around her of the same traits on a regular basis (including my family - her latest demonisation targets). I still wake up every day hoping this is all a bad dream . . . .but it is clearly my reality. I am adept at taking every day as a new one and live in constant hope . . .this is now almost fully depleted hence this post . . .

HELP . . .!!!!!!!!"
1207,"So its hard to explain this in a tldr way, but i'll try my best to summarise. I was abused mentally, physically as a kid, I was neglected and thrown away by my father, I was not something he wanted to love, but something he showed ""love"" on occasions, I only have a few fond memories of my father, and memories to say the least are not my strong point since I tend to forget everything now. I can barely remember my past before age of 13 apart from really traumatic stuff. I could go on forever of how my past was, but that is the major part, my father was a drunk who's last words to me before I told him I don't want to see him anymore were ""your worthless, you'll always be worthless and you'll never be anything"" or so to say. I have been in recent contact with him again at a family funeral, of which he was not remorseful at all and infact told me I've been brainwashed and that he has done nothing wrong and he wants me back in his life... ok then. anyway on to the reason why i'm here just wanted a little back story for reference (there is WAYYY more to it). as of now I have gone through multiple stages of depression, anxiety and fear in my life. from anorexia to obsessive eating. but I now live in fear all the time, it become really bad when my anxiety just started taking over, I had panic attacks everyday and thought I was dying. however I am slowly getting over that. my main concern is my personality, I feel as if I have two sides to myself, a side who is compassionate, loving, kind and caring who would do absolutely anything for anyone and try his best to cheer peoples day up, I even had one person say to me ""you know has anyone ever told you, you know just how to cheer people up"" I thought to myself that can't be me CAUSE I'M A FUCKING USELESS PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT **** who only breaks and destroys people to make himself feel better. my other side is pain, anger, impulsive and destructive, I hurt myself and others and have no control of what I say, I have said horrible things multiple times to my girlfriend, and I messaged other girls on a sexual impulse and have got caught red handed and would still blame it on her. its not just her but all the people i'm close with... I seem to just break people and destroy them, I also can never cry ever, I don't feel like crying, I have sadness but can't cry, I just have a straight face, someone could die infront of me, I wouldn't cry I wouldn't show expression.. but then I build up all this pain inside me and let it out in a suicidal breakdown where in the past I have attempted to injure myself, overdose, punch walls, destroy my stuff, and I cry and cry and cry and cry, and think of all my bad memories they come flooding as if I was dying and my life flashed before my eyes. tbh I don't even know if this whole thing is making sense, I never know how to explain myself as if my body just wants to hold back information. and when I try to explain something like this I get emotional and just start writing random shit after random shit. whatever. who fucking cares anyway i'm just another worthless human writing about his first world problems on the internet. i'm better off dead. thanks people for reading I dunno if I could explain anymore. I don't have the capacity to do so lol.

ps: therapy really doesn't help."
1208,"My partner has recently left me and I find myself wondering how big a part of that did my BPD play. It was always a fragmented relationship to begin with but after my diagnosis of BPD I felt I could now perhaps understand why things was so difficult at times. However I found it increasing harder as I didnt know if I could trust my thoughts or feelings anymore. If I was over reacting or under reacting simply because I was afraid I was wrong about something and my BPD was simply blowing things out of proportion. Therapy tells my I was in an unhealthy relationship, that I was controlled emotionally and mistreated but since my diagnosis I really dont know what to believe as I cant seem to trust my own thoughts or even memories anymore. Has anybody else had similar issues possibly from this condition in a relationship"
1209,"I suppose one of my main questions is why my partener with BPD (not confirmed) doesnt want to have sex with me or be intimate at all, he says he loves me most of the time. On bad days he is wound up by me and feels he doesnt love me and hes not sure why but generally he loves me and doesnt know why he isnt interested in sex with me. He says he isnt interested in anyone else but he has been messaging other women on a couple occasions including explicit photos. He says he doesnt get anything out of it and he wants me ..... How does this work? Whats happening... Ive already posted about our whole story. I Know he feels bad for what hes doing to me but he keeps doing it. I feel like I have lost my best friend. I am wanting to be there for him and help him thorugh but I feel I just make it worse. After talking to the doctor and the mention of BPD I have done heaps of research and I feel I understand more. Can anyone relate to this? I know deep in my heart that hes not just another a**hole. Thanks"
1210,stupid me x
1211,"Hey, I've been going to therapy for nearly 6 years now. Last year I changed from my old psychiatric therapist to the new psychotherapist. It's not going very well. My old therapist could not figure out what my diagnosis was and my new one has no clue what to do with me. He worked out the hypothetical diagnosis in the first session which was avoidant personality disorder, dysthymia and social anxiety.
But he mentioned a lot that he is not quite sure what my problem actually is. Though he compares the things I tell him with bpd patients and their thoughts.
Its not the first time that people thought of me as bpd. 
Still I'm not sure of me having this personality disorder. So I want to know what it is and want to know what makes one bpd. Here are the questions:
What is/are your fears about? Do they focus on friendships and partnerships? 
What are triggers and where do you find them? How do you react to them?
And what about love? Do you had a lot relationships or can someone with bpd also find them to stressfull?
What type of bpd do you have(or is there just one)? How do you react because of your bpd type?
What about your self image( including looks and character)?
Do you trust people? If no, why dont you trust them?
How does this idealization and devaluation look like on the inside? Do you tend to openly show dislike or avoid that person?
Do you have an example of a 'situation' or an experience of the questions above?

Sry for asking so many questions but I'm kind of frustrated with how therapy is going and I just need some clarity. I finally want to know what is wrong with me. Maybe I have bpd but maybe I dont. But I will never find out if I can't get a clear picture of what bpd is."
1212,"Hello everyone, 

I recently scored 81% on an online test for BPD, whilst I am waiting to see someone professionally to explore this possibility further, I thought this might be a good opportunity to speak to others diagnosed with the condition.   One of the extremes in my personality is my relationship with alcohol, which could help be an indicator as to whether I have the condition or not. 

I haven't drunk for a number of years but when I did, I would say 80% of my drinking experiences were negative.  I could not drink in moderation and would spend the night chasing the buzz it gave me.  This resulted in me being hospitalized on a few occasions, hitting out at my friends, blacking out and waking up in random parks and streets.  I have walked on railway lines and motorways in the early hours of the morning to take shortcuts home instead of doing the sensible thing and staying on a pedestrian path.

I must also state that I have a condition that I take medication for, which can impact your mental state when mixed with alcohol.

I also consider myself an adrenaline seeker, I enjoy extreme sports and once had the spontaneous urge to spend 3 hours doing a mini-triathlon where I did weights for an hour, rode my bike for 1.5 hours and ran for 30 minutes.

Does this resonate with anyone?"
1213,"I've been looking to dye my hair for a while now, but I don't know what colour would look best. 

I am a male with jet black hair, does anyone have suggestions what colour would look best or bleaching my hair. I have never changed my hair colour so any advice is welcome."
1214,Hi guys. I just want someone to help me. I have been having problem with my interpersonal relationships with people. Just broke up with my gf because of just this silly thing. I have many symptoms of the disorder but I can’t confirm because access to a health professional is not so adequate here. I don’t know. Please I just need someone to help me.
1215,"Odd question - can you picture yourself in your mind?  Like, can you see an accurate ""picture"" of yourself?

Personally, I can't picture myself accurately at all."
1216,"I have BPD and life is hard! Especially at the moment! I’m so anxious, all the time. Sadly I have had to move as I was living with my Grandma. My parents won’t have me with them even though I have asked many times just for a few months (while the lockdown is happening). My Dad has my sister and brother but he won’t have me. My mum doesn’t want to because she thinks they don’t have space. I should move in with my boyfriend but I don’t know if I want to. I feel so helpless and so alone, I’ve cried a lot this week and last week and now I can’t sleep because I’m letting my emotions control me. I don’t know what to do. My Dad gets annoyed because I ‘hold onto things’ or that I ‘remember negative things others have said’. I think it’s hard for anyone to forget being called rude names or people who are close to you saying hurtful things to you! Does anyone else get this kind of feedback from their family or loved ones? How do you deal with it if so?"
1217,"I’ve been struggling for so many years with mental health and it’s gotten so so bad in the last year or so where I’ve been basically just thinking of suicide or self harming. My doctors say I’m depressed and have anxiety but honestly I really don’t think it’s just that.
I feel so extreme with my emotions and I always have, I cry all the time or switch from happy to sad. I feel like when I overthink I spiral out of control and feel so much emotion that I can’t control my behaviour. I end up hurting myself to cope. I get extremely paranoid and lately I’ve been arguing a lot with someone I rely on. I realise now that it’s unhealthy how much I rely on him and how upset I get when he doesn’t reply fast enough or sometimes I feel like he’s annoyed or disinterested from his tone and he has reassure me a billion times and I still won’t stop picking a fight with him. I’m scared he’s getting sick of me and is gonna leave me and I’m scared of being alone. I hate being alone. I can’t be alone. I’m scared of myself when I’m alone and I don’t want him not to be there because then what would I do? I take things too personally and I’m so sad all the time. I think every day for about a year and a half I’ve cried to sleep because I feel so vulnerable and so overwhelmed with emotions. And I really don’t know why I’m like this. I just don’t feel like anyone can understand me because i don’t feel like depression explains what’s in me, I don’t feel like anxiety does either. Only recently till I started researching I looked at bpd and realised the whole page from symptoms - people’s experiences summed up how I felt. I just want it to be valid. I just want to stop feeling this much.
Ive also started randomly wanting drugs or something to help me feel anything but this feeling. I can’t work out why I feel how I feel anymore and why I’m so scared all the time."
1218,"I am finding this lockdown is starting to have an effect on my mental health. Work has closed until the lockdown lifts, which is not likely to be for another 3 weeks at least,  it has only been 2 weeks so far but it is hard to fill the day with things to do, there seems to be too much time to think. 

I can log onto work emails and I find I am getting really irritated with someone I work with emails, I just want to say something sarcastic in reply sometimes, he is a really annoying person at work, not just me at work who thinks he is so annoying,  but I find him harder to deal with than others can, probably because I am BPD!

I go for up to an hour exercise each day and have run out of things to do in the house.  I cannot meet up with anyone and I am struggling.  I have BPD and did have CPTSD from an ex relationship that was emotionally abusive (not physically abusive)  I have recovered from that in the main, but with all this time on my hands I am ruminating about things from the past including that bad relationship.  

I am starting to find it hard to get out of bed in the last couple of days, Someone I messaged yesterday has not got back to me, so I am ruminating on why, what have I done, why haven't they replied. I can only see me feeling worse as time goes on like this, I know we have to do this but it is hard on people's mental health."
1219,"So I'm currently isolating at my boyfriends family home, along with his mum and dad. I'm here because he asked me to come as we are at university together and I can't go back to my family home as there isnt enough space (his parents have a big house and garden) and i would have been left on my own at my rented accommodation back at university. 

It's not like we havent spent extended periods together before, we go on holidays and often just stay at each others house for weeks at a time. 
But 2 weeks into me staying at his parents he's asked me to sleep in a separate room so he can have some space alone. i already feel really lonely as although his parents are lovely to me, this isnt me house and i dont feel completely at ease, and I already have intense separation anxiety from my family and from him but he seems to disregard that and not even ask me how im feeling, I feel really alone in this big house and this has nearly pushed me over the edge into full breakdown/dissociation mode. I already spend most of the day on my own here, going for my excercise and doing uni work alone, the evenings and nights are the only time i feel comfortable and at ease when we eat together and go to bed. Id ont know how to combat it or address it with him, and theres no where else i can go . Help???"
1220,"Does anyone else lash out when they feel like someone does not like them. When someone talks to me in a horrible way or I get a sense they don't like me I lash out, not always at them and not in any kind of physical way but with words or the way I behave, then I feel misunderstood because I am only reacting to how they are to me.  Sometimes I don't lash out at the person who doesn't like me but at someone else who has the misfortune to be around at the time."
1221,"My bpd/narc fling coworker who works at a different location now seems to physically tense up and looks scared when he see’s me. I don’t go to his new location often, maybe 2-3 times in two years. They won’t make eye contact with me either. A former coworker of mine who works with him now said they looked terrified when they mentioned my name and that they knew me. 
When he tried to ghost and told me to leave him alone and I did, he wanted me to forget everything he did and said all of a sudden a few days later and asked me if I would miss him and I told him I didn’t understand why he would ask that. He had another new girl he was seeing too. He soon left after that to the new job. The first time I saw him again he called my name and waved and I just politely waved back and was on the phone and he had a weird smirk. 2nd time acted like he didn’t see me and was hunched over his phone way down in his seat. This most recent time I walked past him from the side/behind and I could see him watching me out of his peripheral and he was super tense and writing slow."
1222,"so i can start again

as it is, the only way to reset everything is death and reincarnate"
1223,"My fiance left me 5 weeks ago and I still cannot believe that this has happened to me after 7.5 years with him.  We were so very much in love until the past few months - it was such a bad year with my suicide attempts, my quitting two jobs, my boredom at home and revolving my life around him.  I would do anything for another chance to be back with him and he has ghosted me and cut off all contact and it feels like i don't exist without him.  I have never felt like this after a break up - i usually turn all my love into hatred and anger towards my exes, but with him i would forgive his leaving and I don't blame him cuz I would leave my own BPD self if i could.  I know he was so worried and anxious about me and he had no idea what to do, but I think no one would know how to handle the depths of my emotions when i am in the pit of despair.

If I had not freaked out at his leaving for 8 days on a trip and harmed myself he would still be here and I would not be alone trying to sort out the mess of my life. I am in a 5 bedroom house and my kids moved out in January so I could focus on getting better and I was getting better, but then I was almost hateful towards him the last few weeks cuz i was tired of not finding a job and being at home alone in my own company so often and bored out of my mind.  He was financially supporting us and I resented it because I preferred being an equal partner paying my share.  I wish I could undo all of the damage I have done this past year. I feel like all my desperation and neediness drove him away and all I can hear is him saying ""you are too sick to be with.""

I feel like i am dying and i would go to the hospital, but then i would come home and still stuck in this life.  I thought that last year my life was not worth living, but at least last year I had  a job, i had my daughters living at home and I had my fiance.  Now it is just me in ""the house of empty rooms and sadness"".  I have gone on 5 job interviews and when I am away from home and focused on those, I can almost be okay, but then i come home to my 5 cats and no people and i wonder how i will get through this horribly long winter.

The weather is already freezing and i so wish my fiance would just call and give us another chance.  I was not sick until the last year - i was living a full life and was a strong woman and independent and now I feel so pathetic and I am in such agony at times - I have a well of emptiness that does not go away.  It feels like the pain will never end and I know I should be moving on from him - that he could not give me what i needed and was awful at comforting me and making me feel safe and secure.  I don't know how to go on without him - it is so painful and I can't believe he just cut and run and has not even called my kids to see how I am doing.  How can our love have just died?"
1224,"I hate feeling like I’ve been forgotten by people I once felt so close to. As soon as I start to feel this way, I just become so empty and sad and it ruins my mood for hours. It’s so hard :’( I’m so sad and I feel like no one cares for me even though I really know there are people who do. The good things are so easy to ignore when I feel this way"
1225,"My FP is a personal trainer and I used to workout a lot but after getting in a relationship with a narcissist who felt threatened by my progress, I lost three years of consistent effort. Now I feel like I’m starting from ground zero and everytime I workout with him it triggers me. I feel like it stems from feeling criticized. It makes me feel belittled like he doesn’t see me as an equal when he tries to organize a program and I get so angry with myself and him for not being able to keep up. So long story short we worked out together, I split on him and now I’m awake  hours later depressed and mad because of the situation and can’t sleep. How do you recover from a BPD episode and get back to feeling “normal”"
1226,"I am mid-20s and yea I have some traumas and am coping poorly at the moment but 70% of the time I'm kinda of an unstoppable force in life. I accomplish goal after goal. Getting my degree starting my career managing my interpersonal relationships.

However I have a bear. He sleeps with me almost every night and he's comforting.  Is it weird to be in my 20s sleeping with a teddy bear? 

PS 
Its not obsessive or anything like I don't need to take him everywhere I go or even travel with him."
1227,"I think I may have BPD although about 7 years ago I was evaluated by a psych and they said I was ""borderline BPD"", actually just below qualifying for actually having it.
Jump forward several years and I'm living the life I'd always hoped for. A good husband, a good job, new homeowners....but I have fallen back into the very bad mood swings, anger, avoidance, low self esteem, completely broken if my husband and I fight or he makes a comment I don't like.
Last night after work (I'm in healthcare and it's been very stressful) my husband and I fought and I got very emotional and actually considered overdosing on pills. I was out of control and it hadn't been this bad for about 5 years. 
I guess my question is, do you guys think it would be useful for me to obtain DBT materials on my own until I can get evaluated again? I have been seeing a therapist but neither of us has talked BPD, it was only last friday that I started thinking I really had it. I have reached out to a doctor that I'm interested in seeing but we keep playing phone tag. 
I'm just very confused and I feel like I'm ruining my life as we speak! Thanks in advance for any advice"
1228,"Being a BPD patient means experimenting a lot of feelings regarding myself, particularly about self-esteem and self-worth. I'm a lawyer, and the COVID 19 pandemic hasn't affected me as much as many others in my country (I'm from Mexico). My work allows me to do a lot of things from home, and that's what I've been doing. And that's precisely the problem. I never wanted to be a lawyer. And even though I learned to enjoy what I do, right now I feel like the most useless person in the world. Most of my cousins and my sister work in healthcare (physicians, nurses and dentists), and they are out there putting their lives at risk to keep us safe. And I am here, doing some boring crap about Local Attorneys General Offices (and, trust me, it is even more boring than it sounds). For some reason that's making me really anxious. Not only because of my family, but also because I need to feel that I am doing something for others.
I wasn't allowed to choose my career path, it was more of a circumstancial matter. And I don't have what it takes to become a physician (I have a huge phobia to needles that almost incapacitates me when I see one). I knew, from the moment I was meant to choose something to make a living, that I couldn't be a medical professional. But I'm also aware that I don't want to be lawyer. I like what I do, but it's not transcendental, it's not of any value. In the grand order of things, I'm just contributing to some really little effort to change things, and this tiny effort is not going to make any kind of impact at all. I'm not doing what I convinced myself I would be doing by this time in my life with my career, and that's making me feel like a failure.
I almost had a huge rage outburst a few days ago, when I tried to volunteer for some public effort and I wasn't allowed because of my professional background. And I wasn't angry at the people who told me that I couldn't volunteer for that specific task (it was for my safety). I was angry at myself for feeling so useless.
I know that my attitude might seem really childish, but I can't help it. And that feeling is really adding up to others that make me question my purpose in life. I am not happy with my relationship, I am not happy with my self-image and I am not happy with my career/job. And that's destroying me.
I've been having a lot of bouts of depression and that's causing me troubles with many other things. My emotions are out of control and I can't control my rage. A few months ago I really hurt myself, and I hurt myself again yesterday. I don't know what to think or what to do...
Sorry for my terrible English and for this post, I just needed to get it out. Everyone be safe and take care of yourself and your loved ones. Sending you all the good vibes I can, wherever you are."
1229,"Hi guys, 
I'm new here. I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago but never fully researched it. Just started the meds I was given.the last few years have been a little rough in my marriage and I see now that it was me, not him. I was always thinking he was being mean or a jerk and I get angry easily. Now doing my research, I see most of this is probably my BPD perceiving him wrong. How do you keep a healthy marriage when I snap all the time and always think he is being mean or is in a bad mood?"
1230,"Greetings,
Hope everyone’s doing great during this difficult time.
I hope this ends well and we can all go back to our normal life.
Lately I’ve been very stressed and been losing control over my actions.
The other day I lost my temper and yelled at a colleague.
The thing is, it’s anxiety driven I believe, because I get stressed easily and when things don’t go well I start yelling and I become a monster basically.
I don’t like this quality of mine at all.
Makes me look vulnerable.
I don’t know how to control myself.
Nothing helped honestly 
I think sometimes that I need med"
1231,"when I am talking to someone I think that what I am saying is stupid or I can't think of what to say so it comes across as rude or stand offish, I cut a chat with someone short today because I did know what else to talk about, there was this awkward moment so I said I better be going and turned away, they said oh ok and we said bye but I could tell they thought I was rude.  

I was kicking myself afterwards because after I had left I started to think about what I could have said to carry on the conversation but it was too late and I know she was expecting us to keep talking. 

I feel such an idiot because I am awkward because I am worrying about what I am saying, am I saying the right things, what do they think of me.  Then I analyse it afterwards and know I came across as rude when I left."
1232,"I’m not full but I don’t want to eat because I don’t want to live.

is anyone else struggling with this lockdown? I can’t go out due to being high risk. I feel like I’m going insane not being able to go out. I asked a friend who is a police officer if I can go for a drive but not get out the car, answer was nope. My bpd, depression and anxiety are sky high, my sleep patterns are all over the place. Don’t know how much longer I will last not going out, it’s only been a week. I don’t even feel like doing the things I enjoy. I’m going to ring my psychiatrist Monday, doubt they can do anything."

I'm BPD and I live alone, as most people I find it hard to be self-quarantine and have no social interaction, and obviously this situation can be even more challenging for people experiencing anxiety, depression and BPD.

1237,"I've had an especially bad day. 

Felt very anxious all day and mood has been negative. I'm very tired and it's late, but I can't sleep.

I've been thinking too much about the past. Traumas are very bad for me to think about, it would be nice to shut them off."
1238,"I had seen my previous psychologist for about 15 sessions before I moved and she went on maternity leave. We had done a mix of CBT and DBT and I really enjoyed my time with her and learned a lot, to the point where I felt comfortable not taking my medications. 

Now, I have a new diagnosis and will be seeing a psychiatrist in January to be put on new medication. The emergency psychiatrist I met suggested finding a psychologist ASAP to get things in motion. I asked for referrals for my new area from both the doctors in the ER and my old therapy center, but was wondering how I could approach this from a BPD perspective. 

What kind of indications are there that you've found a good fit? What signs should I look out for, both in myself and the professional I'm working with? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated."
1239,"It's been going on for weeks. First it was like a ""sexual fantasy"" that I didn't want to have, that I avoided so bad, and then I became used to it, but felt so wrong either way.

It feels so good and feels so wrong. I feel disgusted. But STILL I wish I could have sex with him, this is making me crazy.
Please, I really need to stop this thoughts. I don't know what it means either. My partner doesn't deserve this and I don't either. :confused:"

1243,"Hello to all that take the time to read this..

I'm 26 and I recently found out from my GP that I was diagnosed with a PD when I was much younger during a time when I saw an adolescent/young adult psychiatrist, but neither myself or my parent were told about this at the time.

I have recently finished my third go at CBT and the final evaluation from the therapist was to go back to my GP so they could look at referring me to a specialist that could provide longer psychological care. After going through my symptoms and issues with my GP, he agreed and made the referral. 2 weeks later my GP calls me and tells me that a triage of people who he referred me to have rejected my referral and also that they said I should try going back to CBT in 6 months if I'm still having issues.

I'm in complete disbelief that I've been rejected and cast off like this with no explanation as to why. When 2 out 3 of clinicians agree that I should have long term care but the people that provide that care say no, what the hell do I do? What do you guys think of this and have any of you experienced this?

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
1244,I trust you all so I think you can help me decipher this. My boyfriend of 3 years says he can’t promise me that he will marry me in the future because if for some reason he can’t keep the promise he will be leading me on. I told him yesterday that if he’s scared of leading me on he already has because I already believe In my heart we will get married someday. Because we spend a ton of time together and because of how much he does for me and everything. If he doesn’t want to lead me on I think he should leave me alone. 😢. Is there hope for us in the future still? I still believe there is but why won’t he just admit it?
1245,not going well please help me.
1246,"2013 - 2020 struggled to understand and apply DBT but failed.
2020 just received new CBT book, I FINALLY understood!

i am kind of disappointed that i wasted my time (6 years) trying to apply DBT Because i was medically diagnosed as borderline by a doctor. DBT was introduced to me and i struggled to understand its core principles: distress tolerance, mindfulness, emotion regulation etc. 

just now i am reading a book on CBT and i finally understand! I took mental health assessment about five times and the results came out the same. anixety and depression related. i am reading the book right now and really understood its simple process.

it's ""Retrain your brain: CBT in 7 weeks"" by Seth Gillihan PhD

DBT is an extension branch from CBT."
1247,"Hi, I am 30 years old and only recently was given a BPD diagnosis. To be honest,  I've shown all the symptoms for years when it comes to relationships but I managed to hide it behind a successful career.

However in the last two years following two abusive relationships,  a few suicide attempts,  a sexual assault and another violent incident,  I've really begun to decline. I often feel like a terrible person and will call my boyfriend all these horrible names when I become insecure about girls he follows on social media,  it sounds silly I know. 

It's like I'll go on this huge rampage and then when I calm down i feel like it was a different person.  Does it get worse as you get older? I've had no help from the NHS so I'm hoping to go private for dbt therapy as I'm on the verge of losing everything now."
1248,"I didn't know her, but Caroline Flack's suicide has really impacted me lately. I read an article that she committed suicide because she was terrified of video footage of her in distress and undress being shown in court.

This story has really triggered me because my ex filmed me trying to commit suicide and the footage was shown in court. I was charged with 'breach of the peace' for being suicidal outside his home after years of abuse from him (he was a narcissist).

I'm wondering if it sounds like Caroline had BPD? I know we can't speculate but her case has really reminded me of mine and it's been super triggering. I tried to commit suicide on the night they showed the footage of me in court because I was so humiliated by it. I used to work as a journalist and my work sent reporters along to the case to watch it. Really sickening stuff. Luckily I survived. However I can't stop thinking about this case and it's made me feel so low."
1249,"I read the differences is the timming, the BPD is more fast, daily hours, and bipolar disorder is almost monthly. Any comments?"
1250,"It’s my birthday today. I am struggling to feel anything other than empty. Idk what I need but I’m so sad and desperately want to speak with my ex who I’m still in contact with. I’m so confused I’m not sure whether he wants to get back together or if it’s my jumbled thoughts that are making me believe we are going to be ok in the end. My confusion is almost definitely due to me not being able to take a step back and see how things go. I’m pushy and annoying and I can’t help myself.

i started self harming again after almost 10 years. Everything is so very heavy lately"
1251,"I just felt a need to put the following words out there, in order to see if anyone else can associate with my emotions...

I'm mostly in control of my romantic feelings... I rarely 'fall for' anyone these days, and when it does start to happen I've gotten better at distancing myself from the situation in order to nip it in the bud before it can become a problem.

However...

Recently I've started experiencing feelings in that direction towards someone, and I'm struggling to distance myself from them because I'm already very distanced from the other person! She's someone I haven't had any contact with for just over a year, who I never met in person, and whose voice I've never heard... I only know - knew - her from texts and a photograph.

What makes it even stranger is that I never had 'those' feelings for her when we were in contact! I just don't get how such feelings can flourish without communication, and so long after our last interaction.

Maybe I'm just lonelier than I thought I was?"
1252,"So, recently I have made a new friend. But as if it were not hard enough, he has Asperger's and I have BPD. And as much as I try not to let it get the best of me. How do I deal with it? We are having one of our first disagreements and I do not want to scare him away (or rather push). I am just tired of pushing people away, even though I try not to be so BPD. If that makes any sense. 

But I am just feeling like a psycho because I am trying to explain why I am ""overreacting"", that a part of me knows I am taking this trivial thing out of proportion but I cannot. And he just seems to have a hard time understanding, and I just want to know if I am talking to him correctly. I mean I know he will always have difficult times understanding me, but I feel like I am compromising my mental wellbeing by trying to shake off my emotions. 

I suppose, I just want guidance on how to deal with this. I just wished I had met him when I was not so..... moody, for lack of a better adjective."
1253,"I'm so embarrassing and have no self control. I'm a MESS.  I'm too extra, dramatic, clingy, love my friends too much and come off as too platonically affectionate, regret everything I say/do immediately, I have no idea what to do with my energy and I become annoyingly chatty. I know when a conversation is over but i still can't seem to stOp tALKING because I want so badly to vibe with people but I overdo it and I'm the messiest woman alive. My emotional chaos can be destructive to Vesuvian levels. How can I be poised and graceful but remind my favorite people I exist when I want attention? I am that woman who triple IMs, or even quadruple IMs when I'm excited. I just want friends but I know i'm way too extra, but I can't help it because I feel like if I'm not messaging them or seeking attention I'm going to mystically become invisible and they'll all forget about me.

When I like someone, I'm always afraid of being too ""extra"" or scaring them off and pushing them away with my enthusiasm or not knowing when to stop or when it's creepy. Sometimes I'll send them pictures, memes or songs that remind me of them or our friendship and I'll notice they get short with me, stop responding and ignore me and I'm always asking myself what I did wrong.  And when I LIKE someone, I don't know if I'm being too subconsciously flirty or if I'm throwing myself at them and I suddenly feel embarrassed and think I shouldn't even be allowed to socialize when I'm ovulating. I'm afraid of crossing invisible lines, highly sensitive to when I stop hearing from people and questioning what I did wrong. I think I have some kinds of abandonment issues or something because I'm always trying to maintain contact so they don't forget I exist and instantly regret it, think I'm being too emotional and wish I would have just left them alone. I feel crushed by imaginary rejection and sometimes don't always know when it's real or imagined because I'm so neurotically anxious and I feel like a mess. I feel like I have no self control and I'm craving every bit of attention I can get. It's embarrassing. I wonder if I'm being too dramatic, too much, too excessive trying to connect with people and I can sense when they're not that into me but they're just being ""nice"". I'm always assuming they're naturally going to ghost me or that I'm being avoided. I feel like I get obsessed and sort of romanticize people I really like, then I'm too emotionally expressive and vivid and make myself look like a total freakazoid and repel them. It hurts, it makes me feel isolated and jump to conclusions about how the other people think about me and I STILL want to remind them I exist. Why do I feel like this? I feel like I know when I ""did something wrong"", I feel extremely guilty where it affects my mood for the whole week and it haunts me. I feel like I'm vibing with someone, but really, I'm being a hot mess and I'm trying too hard. It drives me crazy, makes me sad and I was on an emotional high for a good week until I stopped hearing from one of my new friends and I've been sitting here with a broken heart and self esteem lower than the lowest circle of Hell. It's sickening, and it's like an endless cycle. This almost always happens and I'm wondering if I didn't say this, or if I didn't message them that one time, or if I kept my feelings to myself instead of being so expressive I wouldn't have pushed them away. It makes me want to shut down, stare into a void and wait until I get the attention I want. I'm not feeling good about myself at all right now.

And then when I do get attention for five seconds, it's like an extreme high and I spiral into ecstasy where I say the stupidest things and then wish I said something cooler/smoother 5 minutes later because I have a better idea. Or ""WHYYYYYY did I say that?"" It's agonizing, but cannot police, harness or censor myself in any way and it's tragic. I feel like a cosmic fool.

Does anyone else feel this way? Is this a thing?"
1254,"i was given a diagnosis for BPD a while ago. When i was a child i was bullied very badly at school for many years and there was also some abuse at home with parents who were inconsistent in their parenting. They weren't abusive all the time but they certainly were at times and its stayed with me.

As an adult i have not moved on from the abuse and bullying i experienced in my childhood, i don't think people understand how bad it actually was and how much its damaged me. Every day of my life i think about it,its always there and its always holding me back and having an effect on my present life. 

I have experienced bullying and sidelining as an adult, in work and in social groups, i never seem to fit in and i am never happy or comfortable in my own skin. I have had a whole load of issues such as debt, alcoholism, addiction to food, compulsive spending, agoraphobia, anxiety, panic attacks, days when i can barely get out of bed, it just goes on and on.

I can't move on from things, i always remember everything anyone ever did to hurt me or annoy me and i hold on to the anger. I also just don't seem to enjoy life and don't seem to ever really be happy. i can get pleasure out of some things like listening to music but pleasure is not the same as happiness, i don't know what its like to feel truly happy and at peace and even when things start to go well i usually ruin it for myself with self destructive behaviour. But the scariest thing is that sometimes i just don't really feel anything at all, often i just feel empty and sometimes i want to laugh or cry and instead i can't do anything.

It terrifies me to think of many more years of this, i would rather die young if its going to be like this forever. we all have  to die one day and whats the point in living a long time if you're just miserable and suffering the whole time? i know there is no cure for BPD and i also know that the problems i have are so deep rooted they are never going to just go away. But i also know that therapy can help to improve things a little and help to manage it. i'm not sure if the thought of this offers me that much comfort if i'm honest. it scares me that for the rest of my life the best i can do is manage it rather than take it away forever.

But anyway, i am scared to even go into therapy at all. i have had counseling in the past and it only helped temporarily. but i know there are specific therapies like DBT i could have for DBT but i am scared to even face it because i know in therapy you have to face your demons and you have to work hard but i find it difficult to even talk about the past and i always find it difficult to face up to it. i also read you can be in therapy for years its a long and hard road. Sometimes as much as i hate things as they are i am also scared to move on and scared of change and facing my demons.

i don't know what to do? i feel totally trapped and lost and i just don't know. i am haunted by the past, the present is an endless struggle and i am scared of the future and scared to face therapy. i feel like i am just stuck in limbo forever"
1255,"... that's what it feels like.

My heart is breaking.

Five years together. Five years.

She took me so far, helped me so much, was brilliant.

But when I spoke with her today about putting our sessions on a hiatus or doing them over the phone because I'm terrified that I'll contract something and give it to my very frail elderly father (I'm pretty sure I can survive it, but he could not), she was unwilling to budge.

My work has ordered us to work from home going forward. No end date. Just ""from now on.""

Radio reports have the Prime Minister sequestering because his wife was showing symptoms.

Sports teams (hockey, basketball, baseball) are all cancelling their seasons.

Our local school board announced that schools will be closed for the next three weeks.

And she insisted that I could still come to my sessions. When I told her I wasn't willing to risk my father's health, she didn't budge. When I suggested we do it over the phone, she said the CMA has not advised that being permitted yet. And I said, well they'd never know if we did it that way or not -- she felt it was an ethical line she could not cross. I respect her decision, but man, it made me feel like I am just a paycheck to her. I felt devalued.

And hurt.

And I know she is a good person. She has helped me immensely. We were winding down our sessions with a target end date for September. 

And now, just like that, it's over.

And I feel like I've screwed it all up, that it's my fault, that I'm a bad person. 

And I'm so so so very sad.

I know it was a professional relationship, but this feels like losing a very best friend."
1256,"Does anyone take any medication to help with their BPD? I know there’s no medication available specifically for BPD but does anyone take medication to help with certain symptoms, for example, anxiety?"
1257,"Hi. I was prescribed quetiapine & mirtazapine by my GP in October to help stabilise my mood swings & suicidal thoughts.

I have been taking 30mg of mirtazapine every night for about 6 weeks, but I don't really want to take quetiapine long term as I have read that it can have bad side effects.
I am supposed to take 50mg quetiapine a day, but I haven't been taking it.

However, I went to a psychiatrist on Saturday who suspects that my mood swings & other issues are caused by me having BPD. 
He told me to stop taking my mirtazapine and take quetiapine instead, because it would work as a mood stabiliser.
I expressed to him that I had read online that taking it can cause bad side effects but he didn't really listen to me and told me it would be fine.

My mum seemed convinced by this (I'm 20 and live with my parents), and she is urging me to take the medication. I told her I don't want to take it because I'm worried about the side effects.
I don't know if I'm overreacting by saying I don't want to take it.

Has anyone else had bad side effects from taking 50mg a day? How long were you on it for?"
1258,Hey everyone! Hope you are all well during these unprecedented times. :( I was recently diagnosed with BPD.  I have never actually joined a forum before so this is very new for me but my therapist suggested it and i thought it would be a great way to meet and talk to some like-minded people! I would love to know how people are coping during this time and if anyone needs a chat. I am not really feeling anything about it and wondered if anyone else was anxious because they are not anxious? just me? xx
1259,So I decided to take my life.. I don't know when I'll do it.. but I will! Where I'm at in life sucks and I can't fix it I'm lost as well.. broke and talking to someone will not help. I ran out my luck.. I really feel lost. And I hate where I'm at
1260,I was totally chill and feeling like my old self until the past couple days. PMS sucks and it’s sent me right back to semi-BPD territory. Not fun! But today I was brave enough to tell my bf that I needed to go home and chill even though he was being awesome and supportive while I panicked and cried. I’m glad I came back here because I’m actually pretty calm now and I couldn’t get back to baseline with him there. I was freaking out over fear of losing him so every sweet thing he did just made me cry more. I couldn’t stop! I finally have now; I can breathe through my nose again. Mini victories guys.
1261,"Hi

I feel on the edge of giving into urges to give up completely.

I work full-time which is a huge struggle in itself. On Tuesday I had my last appointment with my DBT therapist. We'd worked together for 17 months and from the very start I got on great with her, trusted her and over the time trusted her enough to show emotion and talk about what I was feeling. I feel like its a bereavement and I don't feel ready to be discharged but that's the rules. Also on Tuesday, I saw my GP. She has been a huge support to me over the years and genuinely cares about me. She had been off sick for a few weeks and it was her first day back. She told me she is going off again in 2 weeks - she has cancer. I am so upset for her. Ignoring the fact that I'll miss her and be lost without her, she is such a lovely person and its not fair (but what is). I also have a close family friend who has just gone into a hospice because there is nothing more they can do to treat his cancer.

I'm also moving house 2 weeks today.

AARRGGHH!!!! Too much, too much, too much.

I want to hurt myself - self harm has always been my go-to method of coping and its all I can think about.

I know I'm lucky compared to some but that doesn't mean I can cope any better.

1262,"Hello

I am looking to find someone who perhaps has the same experience as myself.
I was told by my psychiatrist 3 years ago that I fit the criteria for BPD and Dissociative Identity Disorder, as well as CPTSD. He thought i had both DID and CPTSD and borderline traits.
I was diagnosed with CPTSD after some discussion and me not wanting an official diagnosis of DID.
I have since moved to Devon and seen 2 other psychiatrists, one in the hospital and one through the community mental health team. Both have strongly suggested i have BPD instead. My latest has worded it as emerging bpd though.

I really struggle to accept BPD, not because i have issues with the condition itself but because I do not feel i fit most of the criteria. My workers describe me as overly cautious and anxious but they keep telling me i am impulsive. I know i fit other areas of the criteria because i sat with my psychiatrist and she explained it to me. But I do not feel they actually fit me and are more being stretched to tick a box. My sister has BPD and since i told them that they appear even more determined i have it. The only evidence of impulsiveness i have is self harm and even that I do not do chronically. I can see that i have traits but i really cannot relate to any ones stories that i have seen or read. Its making me feel so alone and worsening my identity issues.

I was wondering if other people struggled to identify with the condition? I suffer severely with dissociation and a lack of sense of self (attributed originally to DID) and have considered maybe that is why i cannot recognize myself in the diagnosis? It seems every other professional I have can see it but i cannot.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this."
1263,"Has anyone found it hard to get life insurance because of your BPD? I have tried a load of places but they refuse to insure me. It is getting on my nerves now. It all goes well until they ask about the mental health bit. I have been trying all morning for a quote and everywhere is the same ""they can't insure me"" I guess that I will have to wait until I am 50 as I believe they don't ask as many questions."
1264,"I watched a 30 minute TV documentary and it's really messed with my head. It's brought back so many painful memories from years ago. 

It's crazy how my mood can change so suddenly."
1265,"I am in denial of all the bpd symptoms I noticed in me but sometimes I have the facts, the behaviour just IN FRONT OF me. I call these moments ""sudden realisations"" . 
I am going through one almost every time I write on the forum. So i want to make something before going back to denying because I don't want to be sick.

I you have bpd, can you recommend good therapists online? Because my family puts extreme pressure on me not to see a psychiatrist. My sister has depression so my mother doesn't want an other sick child. My dad is religious and does not trust medical treatment / therapy.

Thank you for reading."
1266,Im findin things so hard atm feeling sick all time a real strange sickness im act at the stage now where im trembling is this all fear i think ive got to stage now where being strong for so long is doin this too me now i dunno im tired of thinking
1267,"This is both a physical and emotional symptom.

The physical location is close to where the heart is. 

Before when I was in emotional agony, there would be a strong pain close to where the heart is,
but now it's just like there's something there constantly dying, or fighting to get out. Almost like there's a small animal inside me that's been shot and is fighting for it's life - sounds crazy but that's the only way to describe it.

 It's like the strong pain that was there before has been numbed but I still somehow feel deadened emotion there. It's a physical sensation.
Overall, it leads to constantly feeling dead, lack of motivation.

I wonder if this is what the medications have done?? Who can relate at all? I am on 112.5mg venlafaxine (effexor).

Anyone getting similar?"
1268,"I'm going to start here and see how this goes. I have many characteristics of, but haven't been formally diagnosed with BPD, although it was recommended during my consultation that I work with a BPD diagnosis with my therapist. I'm 28 and currently going through my second serious bout of depression. 

This bout has been exceptionally tough, and there will be snippets I question throughout my time here, but there is one particular thing I want to focus on now. 

I'm quite a private person and am often perceived as being shy and introverted, but with the right crowd that is definitely not the case! My best friend (""H"") is the absolute light of my life, and we have supported each other through absolutely everything that you can think of and then some. She is the only person who knows absolutely everything about me, and the only person I trust completely with my life.

H has recently gotten into a new relationship, which is amazing and I am so happy for her as she deserves all the best things in life. Obviously, this has come at a really bad time for me because I have been leaning on her alot and I, very selfishly, need my support system. She recently told me that my poor mental health was affecting her too, which I didn't realise but I understand. She said she couldn't take it any more because I was so negative and even though things are great for her right now she just doesn't have the capacity to be that person for me. 

I know I can be a lot, and the BPD definitely plays a key role in how I perceive and respond to relationships, but I understand where she's coming from, especially as she has a new relationship to nurture, young children to prioritise, and worry about the Corona virus... my constant negativity is draining.

We haven't spoken today for the first time in years, but I said I was giving her space so I will wait for her to check in and send a message in time. In the meantime, I want to work on getting better, for myself and for my friendships. I feel like I've been abandoned, but I know it was me that pushed her to breaking point.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated... I have a journal and was thinking about writing about my inner thoughts and feelings at the front, and writing my thoughts and feelings addressing H at the back, but she isn't the problem so I don't really know what to do.

Help!"
1269,"Hi everyone, I'm new here. I've spent my entire morning going through the threads on this forum and for the first time in my life I finally felt that there are people out there who understand how I feel. This was a very powerful realisation for me so thank you so much for being here and sharing your stories for others to see. It will help someone, it helped me.

I want to write something too and I am sorry but it's going to be a long post. I'm doing this so I can kind of anonymously get some things out that I'm often too afraid to say to people in one go (just bits and bobs here and there instead).

I was raised in an abusive and neglectful household with a violent parent who suffered with substance misuse and another parent who was clearly dealing with a lot of stress and trauma. Although I felt loved and nurtured in a lot of ways, many of my emotional and safety needs were just not met due to the chaos. I don't have many childhood memories up until a specific point in my life. Some of my memories don't make sense and I am not even sure if the events took place. Some things I only remember from pictures. It almost feels like I wasn't part of the memory. My mind is full of fragmented trauma which I am too afraid to piece together unfortunately and I am not going to go into detail here. As a result of my upbringing my sibling developed an eating disorder and me...what I thought was severe anxiety and depression but is actually BPD. I am now an adult, won't reveal my age but I live on my own and have gone through years of university (ironically I'm educated to postgraduate level in psychology and no, it doesn't make me an expert or help me in any way to control my BPD). 

I've been aware of me potentially having BPD for years but I have been pushing this out of my mind thinking that everything I do is completely justified, normal and it is everyone else who wronged me, I am always right to be wary of people because they all end up hurting me. I don't trust anyone, including family members and friends, work colleagues, partners and I am always suspicious and scared of getting hurt.
My fear of rejection and abandonment manifests itself in almost every aspect of my life and it leads to me quitting jobs, breaking up and fighting with my partner, accusing my partner of unimaginable things, creating scenarios, pushing friends away as I'm convinced that they are plotting against me or that they will leave so I feel like I must leave them before they do it!

Over the years this has led to me losing many people who either weren't able to deal with my behaviour or people I pushed away myself because I was convinced that they were hurting me (when in fact it was my mind that was hurting me and them). My usual process is as follows: something in someone's behaviour triggers me, I get extremely emotional, cry, scream, accuse, sometimes I turn the anger towards that person and sometimes towards myself. It's very impulsive and no thought goes into it, I just react. I've self-harmed and attempted suicide in the past due to other people's behaviour towards me, or what I thought their behaviour towards me was (I very often misinterpret people's intentions). What follows after that (usually a few hours or a few days after) is total regret for my behaviour. I usually see the facts, the logic and the truth but it is too late. I then apologise, self-loathe and suffocate people with long messages, phonecalls, any type of contact so I don't lose them. This is especially true with my most recent partner. We fought and broke up many times due to my triggers. Sometimes she forgave me, but more recently it was just impossible to fix and although she knows I have this condition, she also has her issues and it would not be fair for her to be responsible for mine at this point or to ask her to understand. She is the final reason why I decided to get help. Not to be with her (although there is nothing I would love more) but so that I don't destroy anyone else in the future like I destroyed her.

In the past I managed to have one very long relationship (almost 10 years), however this person was very understanding towards my BPD and LET ME scream, cry, shout and just ignored it, did not react to it and usually apologised for whatever it was I thought he did. He did end up financially abusing me and that's why ultimately we split up, however emotionally I believe that the only reason the relationship was sustained for so long despite my outbursts is because he was successfully blocking out my words and actions, walking away from me or he would just shout back at me until I realised what I was doing and snapped out of it (not healthy either, I know). My most recent partner did not have such high tolerance to my reactions, although she did try for 2 years.

In my teenage years I had boyfriends who I always thought were cheating (one of them was but I didn't find out until the relationship ended) and my pattern was the same then as it is now, only back then I believed that it was all their fault.

In terms of other impulsive behaviours I drink when I can't cope. It seems to be the only thing that numbs down the pain and my problem so far was that nobody in my life could relate to the pain I'm feeling. Nobody understood that if I feel ignored by someone I love it's like the end of the world to me, it's like I don't have a reason to live and I can't see myself going on. I am constantly scared that any romantic partner I have will cheat or leave or hate me or do things to spite me and hurt me. And the worst thing is - for years I thought that this was normal and that everybody feels this way at all times but I just find inconsiderate partners!!! I was so far off from reality. I don't know what reality even is. I feel like I'm in a film and I'm watching myself do things but I can't control my actions. Does anyone out there feel the same? Is there any hope for people like me to ever be happy?"

1271,"Hi,

I have anxiety and depression, amongst other things, but I find my moods are all over the place. I can go from relatively content to stressed and bad tempered within seconds.

Even the slightest thing can set me off, such as me dropping something on the floor by accident or someone saying something that triggers me in the wrong way.

This isn’t anything new as I’ve experienced this for a number of years, however, I am starting to see how it’s affecting those close to me and was wondering if it was BPD or just part of my depression and low moods.

Thank you."
1272,"I met my friend today and she is the one friend that I am comfortable with to talk about how I feel. I do struggle even with her so when I met her I said that I needed to talk. She had tea cooking for us so I said I would wait until after tea because when I feel pressure I just can't get the words out. So we had tea and afterwards she didn't mention it. We were watching an episode of a series and I usually leave after an episode has finished (we never stop during an episode) so we were about a 1/4 of the way through and she started to yawn loudly so I just said that I will go after its finished (we had watched 2 already).

 I just felt so rejected. I know I could have said something but I didn't want to put her out because she was tired and I felt pathetic for being bothered by it. There has been a few occasions where I've tried to talk to her although it's been by text. But even then it's like i just feel like her head is always elsewhere. I am finding things really difficult. It's like I'm cut off from my emotions and I am struggling not to relapse."
1273,"I've been trying to get answers about the incoherence of my parents' behavior and I was wondering if anyone with bpd recognizes them. 
My parents can be very loving and caring  when I'm healthy but have complete apathy when I am sick, crying or suffering from mental health issues. They also seem to lose their respect for me when I am vulnerable and they become demeaning. Also when they feel rejected or criticized they become spiteful and vindictive. Are any of these traits characteristic of bpd?"

I feel embarrassed and weak. I feel labelled. I feel like she'll never look at me or treat me the same. Can anyone help me with there past experiences and how they have dealt with this, she knows something isn't right and I don't feel it's fair to keep this.

I'm not afraid of it per se but it is causing my routine to get fucked up and I don't do well with that.

My routine is one of the only things that keeps me from spiraling out of control, I know im already spending too much and I got high today- which Im usually really good about not doing.

1284,"I can't explain very well because when it comes out in words or I say it out loud I never fully get my point across. I've always struggled with mental health since young I don't know where it stemmed from, life wasn't always so bad to begin with, at 15 I attempted suicide I was diagnosed with clinical depression whatever that means. I was on meds then came off and fought myself. Years after I found it hard to hold relationships friends family even boyfriends. I met someone at 17 thought they were everything it turned out to be majorly abusive verbally and physically. I got out after 2 years, was diagnosed with generalised anxiety. Within this time at 20 years old I had no friends during my final teen years. I ruined all my friendships purely down to fear of being alone, I ended up ruining it myself (dumb right) so after coming out of that relationship I was alone, suicidal the lot. Anxiety really messed me up sleepless nights trips to hospital. I started taking tablets to slow my heart. Tried therapy I became more depressed and angry because they couldnt help me. I tried making friends but I just couldnt quite fit in it just wasnt me I couldnt hold friendships. It makes me angry right now even thinking about the fact that people left me behind no matter how much I needed them. In the end months down the line I looked for another relationship because I couldnt handle being alone it's not how I function. He was an arse too, controlling, abusive, made me feel bad for the way I was. Above all of this I have realised that some of the issues if not all, lied with me. I was scared of being left so I became nasty, I didnt want to be alone I wanted them all to myself I always wanted to know what they were doing and half of the time I'd sit there and try work out if they're somehow doing something to hurt me whether that's talking to someone or seeing someone else or even planning to leave. Or even if they actually did like me or I was a passing phase, it made me angry so I would use nasty words and create arguments (he would too) but aside from all this I was constantly depressed, suicidal, harming myself, tried to overdose but my ex came in and stopped me. After all of this I left him as he became physical and that was it. Now I just can't work out what's going on in my head, life isnt moving forward I always hoped for a better life but when I sit there and think about it that's all I actually do is sit there and think. I cant get my words out properly because I feel like theres gaps in my mind but if I wasnt typing this right now it would be so clear in my mind. I wish I could just let it out. Out of all of this though I feel like I cant get my thoughts straight my mind takes over, I'm depressed then next minute I'm just angry. I get angry at everyone now even the ones that genuinely want to help, my mum god bless her puts up with a lot, I feel like theres a lot more to say about this whole thing but not enough space. My mind is a never ending whirl pool of stories that all fit in to why I'm here now but I just cant put it out there, I'm hoping to get a request from my GP to see a psych but it's just convincing them that I'm actually insane. I've been planning suicide all night but actually going out the door to do it is effort, I'm stuck in my mind and it's just chaos, could anyone offer any suggestions or even thoughts on any of this? I really just want to understand my mind and I dont know how, I appreciate you all"

NOW sorry for the long post  but here's my question

When I was 15 I seen CAHMS (children and adolescent mental health team) I was told I had attachment disorder I then seen them ask me questions out of a book that read borderline personality disorder I freaked out and she said no u haven't got it then another said I never had it as I was only 15 fast forward to when I was 17 I got told by another psychologist I had borderline personality disorder Traits and if I wasn't treated It would get worse I recently spoke to another psychiatrist that said I had 8bout of 9bsymtoms in my teen years I now don't have as much symptoms maybe cause of the meds and mindfulness although I'm terrified of coming off meds in case I go back the way I was told that bpd is so controversial that it is rarely diagnosed because of stigma and they wouldn't of diagnosed me when I was younger because they aren't alowed to untill ur 18 but she then went on to say that most don't get diagnosed untill mid 20s but msot people have acctually had it during puberty and end of puberty it's just not alowed to be diagnosed and maybe the camhs team knew I had it but were r trying to control symtoms kinda like early intervention but she said I have a susceptibility to have these symtoms again the symtoms I had in the past were paranoia emotional dysregulation self harm drug abuse extreme fear of abandonment  unstable self image ect now alot of those symtoms are gone but I have a feeling my meds are masking them but the symtoms I currently have are unstable self image one minute I'm atheist next I'm christan next I'm Buddhist ect and one minute I'm supporting this political party or the next all that rubbish I still have fear of abandonment but can cope for now I have anxiety constant and constant mind chatter I probably still can get paranoid and stuff but it's more under control its making me think so many people go undiagnosed especially males"

I never thought anything was wrong with me for years and years cause it only seems to effect me prominently when i'm in a relationship. .... I have no problem talking to people usually or have any real self esteem problems, i know i'm a decent looking guy and i don't have a problem getting girls most of the time when im single... but i can't help but feel im going to get cheated on in every single relationship im in. I convince myself of it... I was single for 2 years because of this. But my girlfriend now... weve been seeing each other for over a year now... and of course its all the same shit all over again where i ill spy search her phone and when i find nothing come up for a reason theres nothing. I come up with ridiculous scenarios and i dont even know whats real anymore... I dont trust anyone and always think all my friends are trying to sleep with her, its happened before in past relationships... Ive lost my job cause i didn't trust her and skipped work to show up early to try and catch her. I over text and if she doesn't answer ill call over and over and freak out. I've made her life hell, i made my life hell. We love each other more than anything and have a kid together... we break up but we always still see each other no matter what we hook up and we both know were ment to be together... weve in all honesty never fought about anything other than cheating/assumptions. shes been so patient with me... and my outbursts were getting so bad... I just want help to stop myself from thinking all of this all the time.. meds didnt help, i talked to a therapist that didnt help she told me it was a form of PTSD... The more i learn about it the better it seems to get, but i still have my triggers that i cant control sometimes.. i just want to be happy... and when im single i just end up being an alcoholic and a drug addict... she holds me together... i can't loose her... 

2 nights ago i almost killed myself over this..
that was the 2nd time in a month, before that we hadn't spoken in a month and i attempted it but pussied out...
she started talking to me again a week later... 
I really need some help... Im in constant torture with my own mind... and i just want it to end... i dont know if im being gaslighted or if im making everything up... I just want to die... 

so my questions are :

How do i stop myself from overtexting ? 
How do I control the panic ? 
Is there any hope or should i just be single forever?
Can you actually love anyone without smothering them when you have this?"

It just  annoys me that something can make my mood bad so quick, depending how much it affects me I could  then be mad for ages after and then I am more angry at them for doing this to my mood when I was in a good mood before"
1292,"hi,

i'm doing a uni course and i got my first assignment back and i'm used to getting near-perfect grades, and being smart is one of the few good qualities i can sometimes believe about myself, so it's very important as i feel it often holds up my entire sense of self-worth.
but i got my assignment back and my grade was nowhere near 100%. i went into a full mental breakdown. i was already crying because i was having flashbacks and feeling worthless but since i have a lot of black and white thinking it made me think 'am i completely stupid? i can't believe i would do this to myself - i didn't get 100%! i need to get 100%. i can't believe i would do this to myself.'

does this mean i should just quit the module, quit studying and quit everything?
my thinking is very black and white and something i've tried to fix for many years, but it's extremely hard for me to see things in any other way. if i get 100%, i am good, i am worthy. if i get anything less, i should quit, i am no good, i am stupid, i shouldn't even have tried..
i just feel so sad. does this mean i'm stupid? am i condemned to be stupid for the rest of my life?

my tutor gave me feedback but they did not say where i went wrong or what should i do better in the future.
i will send them an email asking what i could do better in the future, and what advice they have for me so i can get the highest grade possible.
that i am very disappointed, not in their grading, but in myself, and i want to do all i can to receive the highest mark possible on the next assignment."

1294,Does anyone else with bpd have problems with their sex life? Such as getting bored too easily with someone and not being able to settle? I'm the only person in my family with bpd and I seem to be the only one that's very sexual and in the past been deceitful to others. Just would be nice to know that I'm not the only one that struggles with this.
1295,I have near enough constant palpitations and have for over 12 months. They only go when I’m working out. There even there before I get out of bed. These feel like my chest is just pounding but my pulse is ok. Iv had my heart checked e.g two ecgs this year and in the past wearing a holter monitor and all ok. I’m on propanol 80mg slow release in the day and take a 40 mg at 6pm. The doctors and psychiatrists say it’s all down to mental health but I just find it so hard to believe sometimes. Has anybody with BPD had/got this problem?

1298,"I have BPD and it’s distroying my life. My thinking/moods are at rock bottom and apart from my fiancée and family I have no friends but I really want friends. I make an effort with my partners friends and other ppl that cross paths in my life but then there’s nothing. Is it what I’m saying, how did I act, they must think im crazy etc thoughts are running though my head every time I try to socialise. I am on the waiting list for DBT so I’m hopeful that my problem can go or at least manageable. Nevertheless, this post is about friends, how do I make them. I can’t go to pubs etc cause I can’t drink because of my MS so I wouldn’t enjoy myself and it would just make me feel worse mentally Any suggestions?"

1300,"Hey, I’m new here and I’m looking for advice on something that has happened between me and my partner. This is not the first time something like this has happened, I have little trust for him due to gambling and drug issues throughout our relationship especially when he goes out.
He was going out tonight, which makes me feel anxious anyway but he had asked if I wouldn’t mind picking up so we agreed 1.30am. I’d been asking all week if he could let me know the plans but as a lot of guys do, they make plans on the day. I went to the cinema with my friend to take my mind off him being out, and while I was in there he texts to say he doesn’t want an argument but he’s going to stay at his friends and he would let me know when he gets in etc. Straight away panic sets in, plans have changed last minute which I hate anyway and now I’m not going to get to see him until the next day. I’m sending texts back and he’s not replying, I’m so angry that he has changed plans and not even had the decency to call me and I felt like he waited until I was in the cinema so I couldn’t call him. he finally replied says sorry and said he would text throughout the night. After that I didn’t hear anything. I couldn’t concentrate on the film I was too worried about him. He knows some of my triggers are 1)changing plans last minute 2)abandonment and 3)being ignored. All I could think about was getting home and killing myself, but my dog was there so I’ve texted my dad to see if he can look after him for me. I then think maybe I’ll just go to my friends and get off my face on drugs but I realised neither of those things were right. I keep texting and texting him asking why he’s doing this and please stop as it’s making me feel worse etc and he’s meant to love me why is he doing this. I get to the stage where I will literally bombard someone with messages when I get ignored, especially when he’s meant to love me and care about me and know what triggers me.i wish I could stop but I can’t. He finally texts me around 4am saying he’s at his friends and he loves me and hopes I’m ok?? I mean what the hell!! He knows I’m not ok.. I’ve been texting him constantly begging him to contact me telling him I’ve felt suicidal and to please just let me know what is going on.. he’s now turning around on me saying it’s my fault and I shouldn’t bombard him!If he had just said from the start that he was going to stay at his friends in wouldn’t have liked it but he could have done it and at least given me some notice! Like I said things have happened like this before and I just feel like I have no trust for him.. and I don’t feel like he has any respect for me. He knows my triggers and how painful it can be and he’s done it anyway. Do you think by ending things I would be overreacting? I can’t live like this where I’m so scared every time he goes out and wondering what he will do to hurt me next"
1301,"I'm asexual. Which in itself is difficult to deal with and get other people to understand. It's also meant that all of my previous relationships have ended abruptly as I am completely sex-repulsed now and no longer can 'fake it .'

I'm also an official whore. And have been a paid one on and off over the past 5 years. Ironic, I know. And no, I do not enjoy doing it. I do it because I need the money as I'm a single parent. But even now, at the moment, no-one even wants to pay to have me as they say I'm fat and ugly. Yes, I've put on a heck of a lot of weight over the last couple of years as I have fibromyalgia and arthritis and I'm also on ALOT of meds meaning I'm putting on weight. I've got some other health issues too.
I just got too much going on. I'm skint. I'm struggling with my pain. I'm still waiting to see the pain management team so they can review the meds I'm on and my pain relief. I'm still waiting to officially see a psychiatrist and have only been diagnosed by a psychologist so far with PTSD, BPD and emotional dysregulation disorder."
1302,"i've known her for a year now. she has a bf and i've got a dominating amounts of feelings towards her, but i cant say a word. she talks to me constantly about him, the bad things he does and the how badly she wants to leave him but she lacks the strength to do it. i've never told her to leave him of course, or even tried to hint out my feelings for her. i'm going through a lot lately and the idea of wanting to have her by my side 24/7 is excruciatingly painful on both the mental and emotional level that i'm going to leave her rather than having her around but not in the way i need or - supposedly - deserve. being diagnosed with BPD really makes my unfit to have any romantic relationship either with her or any other girl, at least not now...
she's going through a lot too, and i'm feeling to guilty leaving her like that, but i've tried every possible way to silent the pain of needing her but lacking the energy and courage to reach out for her for a long time now. and i guess that's it.

thank you for reading this far. 

i wish you never get to lose your beloved ones, and if you're in pain, i wish we both find a way to end this and have a happy life."
1303,"I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and I am on mood stabilizers and anti-depressants. He is 49 and I am 25, I have a 6 month old baby with him and we have been together over 2 years.

He promised me a dream but all I got was a nightmare. It was instant attraction for him, instant love bombing, saying everything I wanted to hear and hiding everything he didn’t want me to know. Lying about his situation such as living with his wife and kids, which I only found out after moving in with him. I was naïve, I believed every word he said, every lie he told and every bit of love he gave me. 
The emotional abuse started quickly. I would go to work and would be in tears everyday because he would pick something to fight about and try and break up with me. I couldn’t work, I couldn’t concentrate. He didn’t want me talking with my friends at work, and eventually he gave me an ultimatum which was either leave your job you’ve been in for 7 years, or I will break up with you. He made me take out a loan for £7000.00 even when I told him I’d rather use my savings. But he ‘wanted to pay the loan back for me’, seeing as I had already given him and his family about £10,000.00 to prevent them being evicted from their home, and to get rid of the bailiffs knocking at their door threatening to take their belongings. Even though I gave this amount of money, they were still in arrears of almost £3,000.00 with their rent, and they still received letter after letter about debts they were in. Again, I didn’t realise this until a long time after. My money, my hard-working savings I’d spent 3 years building up to £40k, were gone and wasted. And not even on anything remotely useful. 
I found out from his sister almost a year into the relationship that he and his “ex-wife” were still married. Which he insisted they were not. I found out also that the “ex-wife” had never moved out of the house with her boyfriend and just so happened to move back in the day I was coming to stay over. This was the story he told me. God I was so damn naïve. But I wanted to believe in him. I was in love with him and I wanted everything to work out. 
We started looking at our own places to rent after I realised his “ex-wife” wasn’t going anywhere and I did not want to live in that situation. However, after looking at places he told me it would work out cheaper to stay where we were. He had zero intention of leaving his family, he just wanted to have all of us there. 
He changed me as a person. He got me into shoplifting, he got me into prostitution, I was doing things that I would never have dreamt of doing before I met him, because if I didn't he would go into a rage. All of my money was gone, my job was gone, my friends were long gone, I was living over an hour away from my family (in which he would argue with me and break up with me on the rare occasion I went to go and visit them) every time I spent with my family I was depressed because he dragged me down every time. He made me feel bad for spending time with my mum who I have always been very close with. Everything I did seemed to be a problem for him. Everything I did seemed to be only to hurt him. This is what he made me believe. I stopped seeing my family, they were extremely worried about me. When they messaged me, he would accuse me of being too close to my family and that it needed to stop. Even to this day I must delete texts from my mum so that he doesn’t accuse me of ‘being too close’ with her. Obviously, my family weren’t happy with our relationship due to all of the above, but he would blame my family for them not liking them and end up insulting them and using it as a reason to break up. 
We now have a baby together; I am financially dependant on him completely. I do everything for him, I was his clothes, cook him dinner every night, look after the bills, do everything for our baby, but he feels he is superior because he has a job and earns the money that I’m not allowed to spend. He would rather give it to his ex-wife and adult kids who have jobs but spend their money on cosmetics and drugs. But when they “need money for food” he must provide it. I can’t talk to him about this because he shuts the conversation down and says I’m driving a wedge between him and his kids and he doesn’t want to be with me anymore if I'm going to carry on about it. He doesn’t ever take my feelings or opinions into consideration e.g. when I try to talk to him about something that upsets me, he always shuts the conversation down and ends it with this relationship isn’t working I don’t want to be with you anymore all you do is moan about everything I do. 
He cannot save money to save his life. I used to save money every single month when I was working, but any spare money at the end of the month goes to his other family. He puts EVERYTHING and EVERYONE else in his life before me and his son. He does not respect me or any of my wishes. He forgets things that are important to me as he has no interest, but he remembers irrelevant things about his ex and past and tells me about them, and when I ask him about something that we have done in the past, he claims to not remember and then he gets into a rage and storms off accusing me again of just moaning at him all the time., even when I am not moaning. He just gets defensive straight away and if he doesn't want to talk about something he will walk away from me and ignore me.
He doesn’t do anything to help me with the house, cooking, cleaning, looking after baby, washing clothes, putting clothes away, tidying up after himself etc. The massive amount of debt he got me in he won’t even let me pay back meaning all my debts have gone into default and my credit score is ruined. I’d never be able to buy my own house, which is something I always dreamt of being able to do and I was working my way towards it. 
He has a habit and history of lying to me, hiding things from me and deleting things from his phone, this makes it hard to trust him, but he argues with me if I can’t trust him on something and makes me question my sanity and emotions. He constantly makes promises he has no intention of keeping just to shut me up and then when he breaks the promise and I get upset, he gets into a rage again and accuses me of constantly moaning and then this again always results in him trying to end the relationship. 
I absolutely have no idea what to do, or how to carry on. Any advice would be so appreciated. Sorry for the long post."
1304,"When I was being diagnosed, I couldn't help feeling embarrassed by my experiences. I felt like I would be judged. Anyone else feel like this?"
1305,How rare is it to be diagnosed with bpd in your mid thirties had no sign of of until i had a gun pulled on me. I swear ive been miss diagnosed but the psychiatrist say no ive become i crying emotional wreck. Self harming and sucidal i dont understand this
1306,I want to die ive been in and out of the hospital seems like they dont wanna help feel all alone in this world
1307,"Hi hi! I’ve not really written in a forum before, so please bare with me. It would be great if anyone could offer advise on a current situation I’m going through.

In short, im a person who is easily manipulated, and who is easily walked over in relationships/ friendships. And this is causing issues in my current relationship. 

 My partner has tried helping me change this. However, I’m the way I am because of many years of abuse from my father, and from previous relationships. They have always been up and down, which is to be expected with me as the girlfriend, but now my current partner has said that it’s because I enjoy being abused. I’m confused by this. I understand I didn’t stand up for myself, mostly through fear and because I’m scared of confrontation. But to be told it was my fault I was abused because I didn’t stop it. I’m a little hurt by it.

Also he makes me stand up in front of my friends who ask me to do things, and when I say I’m busy and they get sad, he tells me they’re guilt tripping me and that they are a bad friend. If I imply that I can see their side and see why they’re sad, he accuses me of defending them and gets very angry about it. 

Lastly, the other day he asked me all day to send revealing pictures of myself to him, and after saying no everytime, and him using his words to come across as forcing, I went a bit crazy and raged, ended up whacking my keyboard and throwing my headset off because I got worked up about it. I couldn’t handle being pushed and I went off on one. He is now scared of me and I don’t know what to do. On the one hand I can see why he’s scared from me raging, but on the other hand,I shouldn’t have had to say no that many times.
I’m really stuck on what to do In this relationship. I know I’m a difficult person to be around, and I’ve tried changing as a person for him. But nothing seems to be good enough. Is he right in what he’s saying? I really don’t know."

1309,"So my FP is a nursing supervisor at a hospital I was at for 10 months. We grew very close, she kept good boundaries, but all my time was spent obsessing over ""yay, she's working,"" or, ""i have to stay safe so she'll check in with me."" (We had a deal that if I was safe for her shift we'd have a 30 min check in before I went to bed.) Unfortunately, my OCD would make it so I wasn't ""allowed"" to have positive times with her, plus I was so malnourished from anorexia that I'd refuse tube feeds (so she and other staff would force feed me) or I would be pissed that I had accepted the feed, so I'd self harm and they'd restrain me...

I left in September and have had a few phone calls with her, but my life, still almost every second of it, despite the fact that I am in a completely different hospital, revolves around her - and missing her, and wanting to talk to her...it's awful. And I don't know what to do with myself. Any advice on getting over an FP that is NOT a gf/bf or friend - so circumstances are different, like you can't just text them?"
1310,"I used to suffer from really low self esteem and a lack of self-awareness, so I made a lot of mistakes in relationships and I was toxic towards people I loved. Now that I understand it, it's too late to fix things and some people refuse to talk to me. This is making it really hard to forgive myself even though I know that self-compassion and integrating new learning will help me move on and make better choices.

I feel overcome by regret, guilt and shame over the mistakes I have made and I don't know how to feel better about this. I feel like I should punish myself for my behavior in the past but at the same time, I feel like self loathing and punishment will just bring me back to how I was in the past and it will trigger my substance abuse issues.

I feel like self-compassion is what I need in order to move forward but I am struggling with giving it to myself because I feel like I don't deserve compassion."
1311,"Well. Is so hard to me get a girfriend.  I feel so intense, so jealous (invented or not), hypersexuality, breaks are so hard and will come with anger."
1312,"Hello, I have been taking lamotrigine for about 2 years now. Up until about a month ago I was taking a lower dose which was split into 2 doses. I would take the first dose when i woke up and then the second dose late afternoon time. I noticed about a 6 hour gap before it got to the point where I felt my mood was really dropping but once i took the lamotrigine it helped my mood. Just under 4 weeks ago I started a 25mg increase but i started to take it once a day taking it later on. Over the course of about a week I got to the point where I was taking it in the evening. The dr suggested to take it in the evening as 1 dose so that is what I am currently doing. for the past 14 days I have been on a higher dose so the dosage has been increased another 25mg. The past 5 days I have been feeling really ill it's like I am recovering from a sickness bug as I feel really weak. I also get a horrible tingling sensation in my forearms and I feel so exhausted. I took the lamotrigine earlier instead of waiting 24 hours and I still have the awful tingling sensation. I know this post is late (1:30am) but with that being said I have noticed my head slowly going down since about 11pm. My sleeping pattern is very off and has been for quite a while so although 11 is late for quite a few people it isn't late for me. 

I don't know if I feel this way because I am going through something similar to withdrawals. I think that I didn't get these side effects/ withdrawals with the initial increase because i was still adjusting the time and then I think the second increase potentially helped prevent these type of withdrawals but now my body is used to this dose I feel awful and ill everytime it gets to about 5pm. I am dreading tomorrow and feeling like this because it's awful. I am hoping to get an appointment with my gp tomorrow because i get 200mg tablets so I am hoping they can give me 100mg. I know that I can split them but I don't want to do that as usually a bit of it crumbles and I don't feel like I take the full dose."
1313,"Is hard to me make desicions, and get an ideology (politics, religion, moral, sexual, love, life) is so contradictory and hard to handle. I feel empty because I'cant be part of a side, is like I can see the whole of things and that hurts.

1314,"Hey all, 

BPD exists. I keep reading information about my diagnosis online... I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago. BPD sounds like anyone on their way to adulthood or already adults who are struggling with their emotions! Its like, all a person with BPD needs is a controlled environment, some healthy mentors, and some TLC... its frustrating because there has to be a label on these disordered thoughts and distorted realities developed from some kind of trauma. 

I do not want to feel like I am guilty for struggling! I am still human. I have limbs and a brain. I have eyes. I have an eating disorder. I have ADD and depression and anxiety. 

I am going to end up rambling... this has been going on for 10 years. Feels like it will never end. I am not really functioning. Just living with my parents. I am 26 and I only want to live for everyone else's sakes... therefore the motivation to do much of anything is hard, because I have to do it myself, when I do not even like myself. 

Anyone want to share a story? 

I really need a sense of community right now, as I am sure the people on this forum need it too."
1315,the peace would be so lovely
1316,Im 35 years old but just Diagnosed not knowing i had this disorder for years it explains alot but still not sure on it kinda scares me to have a label to how ive been for years i feel now working forward maybe now can get the help i need thought i was just an emotional wreck all these year sorry bout my rant this is all new to me

1320,"Hey, this is the first time in a long time that i have posted here. Im Tonya. Quick about me. I had an experience at 13 that caused me to have BPD. I wasnt diagnosed until 18. Im 30 and still struggle everyday. Some days are fine others are dark. 
2 weeks ago i had a miscarriage and it has brought me that far down i dont want to be here any more. I dont know how to bring myself out of this. My psychs are in a different state and i dont feel comfortable with finding a new one, I cant go through the explanation of my life again. It makes me worst and im scared i will do something about that. 
Ontop of the miscarriage i saw that person that caused my BPD. The one that has ruined my life to date.
I have 2 kids to care for and i have been in a relationship for 9 years. He is not helping. After coming out of hospital I was still expected to do everything. The house is a mess, its making me feel pathetic. I cant cook dinner, I literally been giving them simple things which is i guess better than them starving. They are healthy and will remain that way, i cant hurt my babies. But my partner doesnt help me with anything, and he doesnt work, he plays XBOX all fricken day. 
Not once since having the miscarriage has he even asked me if i was ok. I have drank everyday and instead of realising something is wrong and wanting to help he drinks with me, for the fun, not cause he is grieving, and tells me to snap out of my mood. How do i snap out of my mood. Im at the end, I cant fight anymore. I want to just leave, leave this house, leave this state, and also the worst one, leave this earth. 
I cant fight anymore and i dont know where to turn anymore. My friends have tried helping but its not. They dont understand how it feels. I self harmed for the first time in 9 years the other day. And instead of support i get told just dont do it, its not worth it. How to make them understand that least its better than suicide. Nobody i know understands, and the worst is that my partner doesnt even care that i am hurting, i am angry, i feel so much emotions right now. I tried to explain but he just wanted to get back to his xbox friends.

Sorry for the long post."
1321,"Bf and I had one of our classic dumb arguments last night and he still seems a little off today. I’m super insecure because I’m leaving town and I’ll be gone till next week. I want reassurance before I leave but I will only annoy him if I apologize a bunch or act different. 

I’m upset that he isn’t being normal now, the argument was really stupid and I apologized already."
1322,"Hey

I recently lost my fiance. She needed some space and that translated to not seeing or speaking even by text really for a number of weeks. The abandonment and rejection hurt. Hurts. It ended in a way I'm not proud of and a way which means their would be no chance of the relationship Continuing. 

In the future I'd like to educate someone in on a serious relationship with about behaviours and warning signs I might be getting into trouble. Delusions, erratic spending, mood swings, obsessive messaging etc 

I'm wondering if any of you do this with partners? I'll be honest Im not sure I'll ever find another anyway and I know I should be focusing on me right now but... Need some hope."
1323,I was in a bad way and a bit of a nightmare x
1324,"Hi all!
I’ve never sought medical attention for my symptoms because I can’t do that at the moment.
But today, since I’ve woken up, I’ve been a bit too hyper and then few seconds after I think of something sad and I cry.
I Start talking fast and jump from one topic to another( to myself) then I remember something and I start crying.
I was cleaning my room and went through this the whole entire time I was cleaning.
I’m really exhausted now after this shift from sadness to hyperactivity.
This sounds like bipolar to me depression. I dunno.
I had coffee today, maybe it’s due to that?
I’ve had similar episodes in the past but this one is extreme.
I’m exhausted.
I’m sure I have a mental illness going on, yet I don’t know which is it."
1325,"I went into 2020 with a resiliency and optimism I haven’t seen in nearly 20 years. 

I had buried my abuser, I went through the first year anniversaries and suffered profoundly.

I had some pretty scary health scares and all came out positive.

And what I have learned from it is that sadness begets sadness. We tend to mire ourselves in the gloom, and isolate, and it continually perpetuates that feeling of hopelessness. It’s familiar and stupidly comforting.

Our experiences are real. The pain is real. But there is something to forcing yourself out, to eliminating the isolation, that is curative.

Its flipping hard as hell. It feels counterintuitive.

But forcing myself into positivity has created a resiliency I haven’t had before.

I hate the expression of fake it until you make it, but theres some truth to it. 

Depression is self perpetuating. Conversely so is happiness.

And I think it can happen when you leave room in your heart to be kind to yourself.

So be kind to yourself, see what is possible, instead of so much self doubt.

You are unique. Nobody else on this  planet can be you.

Lift yourself up and be positive. It’s infectious.

1326,"my story is long.
excuse grammar.

trying to make it short

i held hatred towards biological mother since age 13, actually 14 until i was diagnosed BPD at age 38. it nearly destroyed me. i became sick because my hatred was making me tired. i had to find a way to get it out. i decided to use a ""self reflect and spoken word"" method. IT WORKED.  my hatred was gone. do i hate her. nope. I just felt sad for her. here's how to do it.

1. position yourself to the mirror
2. look at your eye
3. say ""i love (/or forgive/or understand) you dear (the name of person you hate)
4. say it again for 3 times driectly to your own face out loud
5. you may be surprised on your sudden reaction as you look directly to your eye as you say IT.

it worked for  me 😀"
1327,"I'm angry, hurt, depressed, and I can't stop crying. The anger and hatred towards people is so strong. Always drinking or doing drugs just to numb it is exhausting. Silently crying because I know my feelings are ridiculous makes my throat ache. I don't even allow myself to have friend because i'm embarrsed from how i'll treat them.I ruin so much. 2 out of the 3 people ive met with BPD are just so reckless, rude, and won't take responsibility for their actions. I know we're in this together, but damn. I just want to be a good person. A healthy person"

I am scared of making new friends, in fact petrified, I don't trust people.
How can I overcome this? Has anyone got advice for how to overcome this? Has anyone succesfully moved out their comfort zone?"

1333,"Hi guys!
I hope my question isn't insensitive, I'm just struggling.
So I'm diagnosed with depression with anxiety and OCD.
I'm also an adult alcoholic child.
I know I'm not supposed to diagnose myself, but I read some articles about BPD and as I can see by my past relationship, I'm considering, if I have BPD myself.
I've always been kinda impulsive, always when and idea poped into my head it had to be done right now. In junior high (about 4/5 years ago) I had some troubles with my friendships, I've been jealous and always reacting in anger, it passed as I grew up, so I don't think about it as a symptome, but as a growing-up-hormonal thing. 
But yeah, I'm always overreacting, I'm really sensitive and well in my relationship I was afraid of him leaving me, but not like without any reason, my ex is in deep depression, our 1 year long relationship was a rollercoaster, about once a month we had talk about how he's not sure if he can be in a relationship, how's he a ""bad boyfriend"", how he makes always people go away from him and stuff like that, he had some huge problems, and it really became toxic to me, cause early in our relationship I was ready to let him go, even though I already loved him really much, but as the time went by, it made me really insecure and I was scared of every mood swing of his. So when he broke up eventually, I had an suicide attempt, which was stupid, but I was in a bad place and it just overwhelmed me. And so, I'm thinking, if my insecurity was caused by this relationship, or by BPD?
My other question is, how does the mood swings work?
I mean, it may be a silly question, but I really would like to see a bigger picture of this, if this is just like you feel happy for some hours and then you feel sad? 
I'm sorry if this is insensitive, I can't put my question in a better way.
Also, fear of abondment, is this caused by something or is it just some impulse?
I'm often scared, that someone is mad at me, even though I didn't do anything, just when I'm texting with friends and they're replying in different way then usual, I'm thinking they could be mad at me. 
I don't have with other people this fear of abondment, but I had this in my past relationship, I was often crying cause of his mood, thinking, that he will end this soon and so and so. 
If any of you could answer, I would be really happy to read your history with BPD. I hope y'all feeling good today."
1334,"The ""Opposite Emotion"" Method
(excuse my grammar)

actions, words, thoughts, feelings, memories, experiences, etc - they share one thing. 
Emotion = Energy in Motion

You or someone else had thrown ""annoying"" on ""You"" and the word ""annoying"" got stuck on you and you dont know how to get rid of it or how to get it off you. I recommend you try the oppositional emotional reversing method. It helps you to identify the emotion/thought and catch them by reversing annoying to peacemaker. 

- angry  ---------------->>>>>> calm
- rude  ---------------->>>>>> mannered
- insensitive  ---------------->>>>>> attentive
- pest  ---------------->>>>>> helpful
- sad  ---------------->>>>>> happy
- selfish  ---------------->>>>>> thoughtful
- distracted  ---------------->>>>>> focused
- afraid  ---------------->>>>>> courage

All of those negatives are your signals to redirect to the opposite.
Signals come in many forms - yourself, others, reputations, on records, etc. 

Here is a real one - this is a real experience as it happened to me.

I was given a job performance record by my bosses and many of them mentioned the word ""distracted"" i  was very offended and denied it. it was like as if i did not believe that word ""distracted"" as my bosses wrote me up. it took me years to realize....the opposite word ""focused"" was the key. I had a strong resistance to the word ""focused"". i fought against the word ""focused"" for so long. finally it came to a certain point i broke down and let the word focused not hurt me. I began to practice ""focused"" therapy. Now....I am PROUD to call myself focused. My job performance record cannot be altered or removed. It (my official job record) is permament. period. So you get some better idea on your situation.

My wisdom for all BPDs
You are NOT what you think you are or what others think of you.
You ARE what you BELIEVE you are THAT.
It takes time to un-do the short-term and long-term damages done to you."
1335,"I am struggling with chronic insecurity about friendships and and relationships. I always end up feeling needy and insecure, which pushes people away and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I know all this and don't know how to stop feeling obsessively insecure and in need of constant attention and validation and reassurance.

I also have a very black and white view of people - either they are angels or devils, and nothing in between. If they do anything that displeases me, suddenly they are devils.

How do I change the way I think and feel about my relationships with people? I am trying to work on my self-esteem and becoming more secure in myself but it's not really working.

Any ideas? or anyone can relate?"

1338,"Hi all!
I was wondering about how you behave when you are mad at someone.
Recently something happened to me that made me angry and hurt.
There was a job opportunity that is for juniors and my colleague knew about it and was supposed to inform all the juniors, but she didn’t inform anyone and went for the trial.
I got to know that she goes to this internship like situation for a long time and she gets paid for it.
I was shocked and hurt by her behaviour because she doesn’t have the right to do this. All the juniors had to know about it and she should have spread the word.
Anyway, today when she saw me she said hi enthusiastically and I just bluntly said hi back.
The thing is , I’m super mad at her to the point where I want to confront her, yet I can’t coz I don’t like confronting.
I dunno what to do.
I tend to avoid people when they hurt me like that and it turns into hate.
I currently despise her because of that behaviour and she’s always trying to copy me.
Anyway, do u tend to confront or do u ignore the person?"
1339,"Just be re asset by psychiatrist after eight years of being treated for bipolar disorder 2 now I’ve actually been told that I have BPD.
As I’ve never went through childhood trauma I got dynoised wrong.
Actually feel better now knowing I can come off eight years worth of medication and get the right treatment.
Anyone else on here that has BPD but doesn’t fit the normal mould if BPD?"
1340,real life is too much
1341,He basically disappears. He’s still there but he isn’t. I really want to support him without having an emotional falling out myself for once. It’s hard for me when he’s shut down and I tend to be scared and angry but this time I just want to distance myself from that and be helpful.
1342,"Basically, I've embarked on recovering from BPD seriously Jan this year. Prior to that, I had some emotional outbursts and said very heinous things to my boyfriend (my FP). 

He didn't know how to manage me at all, and didn't set boundaries, be firm etc. He finally lost it in Jan and started telling his friends and family about me, and told them the things I say when I'm on an ""episode"". 

Nowadays, I manage my emotions so much better, and I have stopped ""splitting"" as much. I know I'm making good recovery and my bf cannot deny that. However, he is still wanting to keep a distance from me, brings up the things I did/said in the past each and every time we have a conversation, and tells me how I have to ""clean the mess"" with his friends/family as if we aren't supposed to work through that as a couple. 

He, on the other hand, has anxiety/depression, which I've accepted and tried to work through over the past year. 

I guess my question is, how do you press on with working out in a relationship and BDP recovery, when your past actions keep being brought up to you despite how you behave now, and you have to keep apologizing at each conversation? And I feel so misunderstood by my bf's friends and family, who still don't know anything about my BDP, and just think I'm a terrible person. I feel stuck in my recovery somehow, as I am given limited opportunities to face up to my ""episodes"" and deal with them, have to keep apologizing for my past actions, and feel remorse/guilt over how people view me despite how I've worked on getting better and aren't doing what I did in the past. 

It almost feels like the best way to recovery is to give up on this relationship and be single for a while, and start on a new one later. But the difference is the man I marry and spend the rest of my life with will be someone else. Any thoughts/advice please?"
1343,"Whoo boy. 

Without going into excessive detail, my partner has a big energy. I mean, BIG. It's a presence that demands attention. We'll be together for two years come this July if my shitty side doesn't choke him out first. 

He knows about the BPD. He was there when I was diagnosed. He handles it fairly well, in fact, extraordinarily compared to what many people who don't have it could. Put simply, he's been good for me in many ways after a long line of detrimental relationships and friendships. He's been helpful and supportive. 

I snapped earlier, and I'm not fully sure why. Put simply, my partner and I are in the entertainment business. I am not the first partner of his to say his energy is almost overbearing. He's a Capricorn, so he's on top of like, everything and does, well, just about everything. He's solid in who he is and his talents.

Me, on the other hand, feels as though her identity has hit a wall (yet again), and this time in the form of her business. It's exhausting, draining, frustrating, and maddening. I have been steadily building myself as a performer, and yet I feel like he always outshines me, even if he's not intending to. 

So I snapped on him earlier and starting texting how I hated being in his shadow and how I'm attempting to develop my own radiance and power next to the goddamn sun. What I wrote to him was awful and painful, and I will own that. 

For those of you who have this condition and it's trappings, how do you handle the identity jealousy? I know that if I were more secure as a person, that little nothing would not have affected me earlier (also under severe financial stress and having a fibro flare at the moment). It's not his fault; I just hate feeling like I'm competing with him all the fucking time.

Tired, Pissed Off, Resentful Hellcat"

He answered me by: are you with us?
When he said that I was dumbfounded!
Literally!
I thought to myself: is he retarded or what!
I answered back after few seconds of shock with yes..........I’m an employee here. Guys! He’s my supervisor! He doesn’t know if I’m a permanent employee or a trainee??????
Then he answered me back with : we only distribute this to people who work with us.
Anyway guys, I was dumbfounded.
Am I invisible? Do I realllllly not matter to them to not notice me. Ever since that incident on my first week of job when a senior humiliated me in front of others I’ve been trying to avoid everyone.
I’ve been going to work and doing my job and that’s it! Not getting involved with anyone.
And that made him not know that I’m an employee?
I dunno if it’s me or him.

1347,Is the love child of hitler and satan :evil:
1348,"Hello everyone. It was recently put to me by someone with professional experience that I may suffer from BPD. I did some reading and it felt like a bullseye to be honest. I am waiting to see a Psychotherapist next month and started thinking about how it's going to go, what I'll talk about, how to describe my experiences. My concern is that I will begin moulding my account to match a BPD diagnosis. I felt somehow relieved that there was a name for how I have always felt, like a key that I could use to unlock some of the mysteries of my own behaviour, and finally confront my past actions with less shame etc. I don't want to be dependent on getting the diagnosis confirmed, but the more I read the more I feel like my life has been defined by this condition. I feel like if the diagnosis is different I'll feel more lost then ever! So my question is, is it safe/OK to keep reading up on this condition? Or should I swerve it until I'm engaged in regular therapy? I can be pretty manipulative, and if I begin the therapy with an agenda (ie, to get a BPD Diagnosis) it will only prolong or delay the real heavy lifting. What do you think?"
1349,"Hi!

Apologies for not making much sense in advance 😅... but I would like some advice on what do to in this situation.

My SO and I play a MMO game together and we have daily stuff to do, and there is always things coming up. Today we were doing our daily dungeons and I got distracted after one of them and after getting approval from my SO that I could spend some time on this other thing, I spent about an hour trying to figure it out. He then asked if we could carry on with our dungeons, to which I replied 'Give me a sec!', so I could finish what I was doing. He then said 'We don't have to do them today if you dont want to do them', which got me slightly confused as I had just wanted a sec to finish up, so I could be ready to carry on. So I immediately stopped what I was doing and told him I was ready and that there's no need to say we don't have to do them as I had asked for a moment because the thing I was doing was very hard to concentrate on (especially as I have IIH, BPD and an array of other problems), and it's hard to do with someone asking questions/ talking at me. He then got very annoyed at me and said 'just carry on, its not like I've been sat here waiting for 2 hours or anything'. I was confused by this and reminded him it had been an hour and that he said I could spend some time doing it, to which he replied with the exact hour, minute and seconds as to how long it was, and also said he didn't expected me to take so long, and called me selfish for focusing on my own thing for a bit. He also mentioned how he asked me for something yesterday, and I totally forgot. And instead of asking again, he reminded me of how rubbish I am at stuff, used a phrase which he has used before 'maybe acting like a good girlfriend would be nice for a change'. He knows this hurts me, but still uses it :/.

He then also brought up a similar situation that happened not so long ago, when we were doing our dailies, and friends in our FC/guild (who we hadn't done stuff with in weeks) asked us to join in with a raid. I asked my SO and he agreed and so we went in Voice chat with them, and had fun together. Or so I thought....! He had a go at me back then after we'd come off chat from our friends, saying that I put them first over him, and that I was selfish for stopping our dailies. 
So after 15 mins of being put down, having old situations brought up, and having the blame put entirely on me, I said I need to go calm down, to which he said 'yeah go ahead, cry all you want, act like a baby, blame it all on me.' I got annoyed and just left. 

I'm totally confused by his behavior... In my opinion if I've asked for time to do something and he agrees, I can't see why that is selfish? Am I being selfish? I know I forgot that he asked me, and I was wrong for forgetting, but it doesn't warrant him saying I'm rubbish. I've explained to him countless times that I have my health issues which cloud over my memory, and that a simple reminder is all that is needed. Yet he refuses to remind me, and instead calls me selfish. I honestly don't know what to do in this situation, because I can't tell if I'm just being overly sensitive, or if I am in fact being selfish."
1350,"I have a dilemma and need advice.

Bit of background – I’ve had a lot of therapy over the years, traditional psychotherapy, CBT and DBT. DBT taught me a lot of skills to use to help me manage my emotions and feelings but I’ve hit a really bad spell and the skills just aren’t working. When the DBT finished I was put on a self-compassion course which did nothing. My key issue is no self-worth. Growing up my parents had huge expectations of me and if I ever failed to meet them I was in a lot of trouble. I’m now an adult but I’m still scared of them disapproving of anything I do. This affects me massively. I also have huge problems with my relationship which is controlling and affects my self-worth.
I’ve decided to access some counselling through work but only 6 sessions and 1 was taken up doing all the initial background stuff. She told me that basically we can’t sort it (the stuff with my parents/self-worth) in 5 sessions and that I need to decide how I want to use the time. Do I want to talk about the now and how to manage the emotions or do I want to try to chunk up the past and work on one? I think talking about the now is a waste of her time. I have the DBT skills and I think if I can address the old stuff then I’ll be able to use those skills better. I want to address the old stuff but struggling to see how I can chunk it up. What I don’t want to do is open up the flood gates to a whole history of crap and then run out of sessions before putting the lid back on.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks"

My largest issue I’m focusing on right now or I should say causing the most issues with my life is my relationship. I’ve been with this man for almost four years and I don’t know how he puts up with me.. my brain begins to focus on specific people and then becomes warped thinking that he is cheating on me, talking to them behind my back, believing they are 10x prettier then me and he wishes he could get rid of me so he can be with them.. it’s exhausting. I have no reason at all to not trust him but i don’t trust him.. does anyone else get that way? I feel crazy!! I automatically believe they are absolutely EVERYTHING he wants that isn’t me.. smarter then me, etc etc. I’m tired of feeling this way please send me some help and/or support !"

1358,"So I'm a 29 year old male, and unfortunately I'm alone; I'm alone because anyone I've ever been friends with, have ever tried to be friends with, or reached out to has ultimately hurt and rejected me - without fail. The only girlfriend I've every had was a unique example of someone that seemed to care, but unfortunately this was just someone leading me on just to cause me harm later on... this is a recurring theme for me, and all these past experiences boil down to me forming a number of very negative beliefs about other people (known as 'schemas' in the psych literature), the worrying thing for me is my attempts to disprove these hypotheses fail after I take into account the ultimate result of peoples actions and words - and not simply their words alone. New people I reach out to regarding my mental health have all started to block or avoid or ignore me, and I'm honestly getting quite worried about how isolated I'm becoming, no-one seems to care at all, no-one is allowed to care and it's really unfortunate how isolated and alone I am. I need to see some concrete evidence there are other decent human beings out there, similar to me and capable of understanding things, but I'm struggling to find any, and it worries me to see how easily people are seduced by nonsense, it's like nothing I do makes any difference and it's all taken for granted. All I manage to find is 'polite' people who just ultimately make my mental health (I know it sounds terrible, but the hope is I'm wrong)... the things people say and the reality just doesn't match up, and my mind just picks everything apart, understands it, and leaves me frustrated when people misunderstand and ultimately just prove me right, again and again, without fail. I would never say what my beliefs are, but they are very negative, and they allow me to predict peoples behaviour before they do it, and quite frankly, people shouldn't be acting like a bunch deterministic machines, and I shouldn't have to treat them that way. 😕

I know I must be wrong - and I want to be more than anything - I just need to see it for myself...

I've kind of give away a lot here, and I know it sounds bad, when I tell people it pushes them away - but that just reifnforces my negative beliefs, unfortunately. I know I must be wrong, I just need to see there are people out there who would genuinely want to help others out for the right reasons."

1362,"Hi everyone! I'm new here and I am looking forward to talking with you all. I really need help, as I am struggling in a major way with something... I'll tell you a little about myself and why I am here.

I really don't know where to begin, but I'll try my best at explaining my situation. To start off, my childhood wasn't good at all, my parents fought all the time and I felt like I had to be the mediator to keep them from killing each other, starting from when I was in kindergarten. Which left me not really having a relationship with either of my parents because I felt like I couldn't talk to them. In middle school, I had bouts of harming myself and purging after I ate. I was raped during the summer before I started high school. I didn't tell anyone about this until my junior year. I always tried to be this ""perfect"" version of myself, and if at anytime I failed at anything, I felt like I was hated by everyone, and I would hate myself. In middle school, I started having these MAJOR ""crushes"" on certain type of women. It was only one woman at a time. It was nothing romantic or anything like that, although it did cause me to question my sexuality because I couldn't figure out why I would think about a woman obsessively. It wasn't until years later, that I realized that I wanted these women to be my mom. I ended up developing a relationship with 2 of these women. One was a teacher at my high school. I felt so close to her, but in reality, we weren't really that close. But I put her on this huge pedestal. And when she wouldn't text me back, I'd feel like she was trying to distance herself from me and that's when I'd begin to lose it. I overdosed one day because she didn't text me back and I felt like she hated me and that if she hated me everyone else hated me too, so I hated myself. I didn't want to live anymore, all because she didn't text me back. I started replaying everything bad that had happened to me in my life over in my head, I started telling myself I was worthless and that I was a burden to everyone, so I wanted out of this world, and I tried to commit suicide. Obviously, I wasn't successful, so fast forward 2 years later and I found my next ""crush"", or as I've learned through research of bpd, its ""favorite person"". I got into a super close relationship with another woman and she really became like a mom to me. I basically lived with her for over a year. Things were great. But then, she started seeming a bit offish to me, and the whole thing happened over again and I ended up overdosing and wound up in the hospital. This cycle is something that happened a few more times.

What led me here, is that recently, I've found a new ""favorite person"" and this time its honestly about to drive me absolutely crazy as I don't know how to deal with it. I've been pretty isolated for several years now, I don't really know anyone where I live, I don't talk to anyone from back home, its just myself and my boyfriend. I am in my 30s now, and am currently diagnosed with major depression and severe anxiety. And I feel like I am head over heels in absolute LOVE with this woman that I barely know, that doesn't live even remotely close to me. We've exchanged a few emails over a year, and I called her up this past November to talk about something that wasn't even personal. But we started talking and I flipped over her. A few days late I called her about something personal, when I was on verge of an anxiety attack (which was strange in itself because there again, I had only spoken to her on the phone ONCE) and she was SO kind, and caring and considerate of me that I absolutely fell flat on my face in love with her. I think the world of this woman that I don't even know. I want to tell her everything about myself, and I want to know everything about her. I want her to be my mom (I'm making myself sound like an absolute nutt right now, right?!) ... I even looked up adult adoption because I was fantasizing that she would adopt me!! Ugh, it's exhausting just thinking about it. Well, I finally realized that this was just not normal, and I started looking it up online, and found that this is something commonly experienced by people with BPD (although, I don't know if it usually happens with someone you don't really know?!). I didn't even know what BPD was, I had never heard of it. I looked it up online, and I've researched it for almost a month now. And I STRONGLY feel like I meet the criteria for BPD, specifically quiet, or discouraged BPD. I didn't really know how to take it at first, but now I almost feel (happy????) to atleast know that this may be the reason for so many things in my life, to how I think/feel about myself and others, and why I am the way I am with so many things. I feel that because I know what it is, that I can at least try to manage myself a little better. I have no hope of getting a proper diagnosis, as I can't see a therapist in person because I don't want my boyfriend to know. I am getting my depression and anxiety treated online, and had medicine delivered to me. There again, it's that fear of rejection if my boyfriend were to find out.

I am hoping to hear from some of you about your thoughts on my current ""favorite person"" and how to handle it. I've emailed her such dumb emails, degrading myself and I feel like I've made a complete idiot of myself to her, but she's still been so kind. This is really, really causing me some serious emotional pain, as I want to call her and I want to be close to her, but my anxiety won't allow it, and I am SOOOO scared that she will shut me out because I am sure that she will think that it's weird that I even want to talk to her like I do when I don't know her. How should I handle this? Do you think that I possible have BPD and this is related to it? I meet a lot of criteria for BPD but this is the most bothersome for me, especially as of right now. I'm looking for advice, plllleasseee share some insight with me!

Thank you for taking the time to read this and respond to me :)"
1363,"Hi yes I know long time no post ect. Things have been good for the most part so not really needed the support and been busy with a new job and life. 

I'm here to ask if I'm over reacting to something that's happened today with my care coordinator. Long story short in off my meds and having a tough time mentally. So not in a good place at all but somewhat managing. I went to a and e over the weekend and my care coordinator called today to see where I'm at. It was a good conversation until he asked me one stupid question and I flipped out. ""Do you not think you may be over exaggerating your symptoms... "" I didn't even let him finish. I lost it and put the phone down, then proceeded to email him and say how he's just like everyone else. How he clearly can't trust me of her can't believe me about how I feel. 

We have a good relationship yes I rely on him way too much but it works for me. I've made nothing but progress with him this past few years. But I feel like he's shown his true colors now, how can he question my own experiences and feelings. Why would I even lie about it? Lieing gets you nowhere especially with mental health. I feel soo let down and alone all over again 😭. 

I'm in the mindset of just go away and leave me alone now. I know it's not healthy to shut everyone out but I keep letting people in like this and they keep letting me down. I just feel so done now, why should I try?"
1364,"I was recently diagnosed and I honestly don't know much about it. I'm 20 and since I've lived with it for such a long time, I see my behavior as my personality instead of blaming the illness. For example, I can't handle any type of criticism, positive or otherwise, I get so annoyed. And now recently, I cut off my best and only friend. I haven't replied to their texts in weeks even though they are worried. I don't know why, I just don't have any will or motivation to talk to them or see them or explain how I feel. I get angry just thinking about trying to explain my feelings because even I don't understand. I've isolated myself and I don't want to do anything but stay in my room."
1365,"I have been taking this for 3-4 months.  It does a great job on the depression and anxiety, because, instead of being expressed in unhealthy ways, I strongly believe, the emotions are being controlled, BUT I also believe the medication is changing my brain, my gut, my sleep, my physical strength, etc in harmful ways.  I am exhausted most of the time, have strong stomach pains (nausea and poor digestion),  back and muscle pain, constant ringing in my ears, headaches, eye pain, don't sleep well, hair loss and lack lustre and bounce, etc. It's almost like the expression of pain has simply shifted from an emotional expression to a physical one. Cognitively, I think my memory is going, my concentration is poor and my stamina is low. Which pain do I choose? Or which pain will I accept?  Which work do I do?  Or what do I let go of (if I end up with no med?)

Anyone else use Trintellix?

I have newly been diagnosed with BPD, and previously, depression, anxiety, PTSD, adhd, others I can't remember.  I think BPD is the proper diagnosis, with PTSD (trauma) as the cause.

Any peer comments, support, or advice is greatly appreciated!  

It's wintery here, but a nice winter."
1366,"Hi everyone. I'll start by saying I have BPD and so does my mum. However, the main differences between us are: 

While my BPD causes some emotional instability and a 'wobbly' sense of self, I rarely manipulate people (and there would be extenuating circumstances) and after 10-years of therapy by BPD is very well managed. 
My mum is all over the place, refuses to have therapy, and is incredibly manipulative/controlling. 

The main issue I have right now is that I also have a disabling chronic illness which means I need help with house management and grocery shopping etc. Since my (covert narcissist) ex left me 2 years ago, she has stepped in to act as my carer in this respect. However, recently her behaviour is growing more toxic and I'm catching her out more often when she lies or manipulates me... but I know I'm not catching more than a small percent.  

Has anyone else here got experience with this and do you have any advice on how to better catch the underhand behaviour so I can call her out on it? Right now I'm scared she's doing other stuff that's hurting me that I'm not even 'seeing'. 

Also, has anyone else here had specific experience as an adult child of someone with a personality disorder who is now their carer? 

Thanks all."
1367,"Can anyone suggest a good way to help my family understand bpd. I have tried to be open and honest about this condition and try and explain how my perceptions or reactions to things may be off sometimes ( Something they have known since I was 14).... I have told them i am seeing a psychologist and commencing treatment but they still dont seem to understand. 

For example my mum said ""I don't think any less of you and no one needs to know about this"". ""I love you anyways"". This angered me so much as my mum is massively the culprit (I believe) for me having such a diagnosis and it makes me resent her for putting this ""Problem"" on me and hiding it like a dirty secret.!

2nd I have tried to be honest with family about my diagnosis and explain what is going on for me and how I got here.... They make the right noises..then when I annoy them, upset them, challenge them or put a point across they dont like they tell me to get back to my ""Head doctor"" or speak to me as if my mental health is the problem. They later apologise but the truth is always said in anger.

I feel resentment towards my family now as their attitude to mental health is so wrong. They tell me everyone walks on eggshells around me, yet I genuinely do everything I can in my family to be liked i barely say no and I spend alot of time and money trying to please them!. I feel so hurt when they say things like ""Tell me how to help you"" as if i am ""crazy"" or worse.... ""That is your mental health talking"". I feel everything I think, say or Express is invalidated and overshadowed by my mental health. 

I fully understand I must be hard work, but my childhood and early adult hood was absolutely destroyed by emotional abuse, neglect, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, bullying, lies and deceit. Yet here I am trying to find ways to help my family understand ""What is wrong with me"".

I could go on.... I wont. Any informative and easy to understand videos on bpd would be welcomed.

I need them to understand 

thank you xxx❤❤❤❤💯👌"
1368,"Hi I'm new here (F) and would like to know if anybody has experienced similar issues to the ones i'm going to mention, or can relate to the thought processes. Would just like to know that I'm not alone.

I experience intense fear of abandonment with my partner of a year, so much so that if I know they are around new people, people who neither of us have met before, if i am not with my partner at the time i because extremely anxious to the point of an anxiety attack and tears that they are going to find someone better than me to replace me, and that if they ever mention the new friends theyve made in a positive light, then i feel extremely jealous but also insignificant, as if theyre going to leave me for these new people who are probably more attractive and more interesting than i am.

These feelings are super intense and can often trigger panic attacks and the like, even though my partner an i have a really healthy relationship and nothing has happened to warrant these suspicions, i struggle to articulate it to them because i know in my head that im not being rational, although just because i am aware of my irrationality doesnt mean that i can banish these thoughts and i just get mad at myself for feeling this way."
1369,"Abilify has effectively cured my BPD. Info why Abilify may be the first proper ""BPD

Disclaimer: These are my opinions and summary of scientific facts only.

Well I have been diagnosed over a dozen times in my life with Borderline Personality Disorder. Certainly I have scars on my arms- a lot- from self harm.

I have been on the drug Abilify for 3 months now. It has been incredible for me.
There is NO OTHER drug available currently on the world market which has such a good profile at potently modifying the response of specific, important Serotonin receptors. Abilify is currently one of a kind in its overall effects.

I have not lost control of my emotions a single time, I am not depressed or anxious, and my tolerance to stress and ""provocation"" is massively higher than before I went on the medication. And there have been all sorts of big dramas to test me! Indeed even if I have barely slept and I am woken up- I still am in emotional control!

Just a week before I went on the medication, I had a huge angry spastic at my housemate, and we were fighting a great deal. They were about to move out. Since I have been on the medication, we have not had a single fight in 3 months.

I have been on many, many different medications in the past, none of them were helpful. Honestly probably about 30 different medications in my lifetime. 

I am not advocating Abilify, but I think there is some information, that people with BPD should be aware of, because I know without a doubt, that for some people with BPD, Abilify can be a massive help. I think this drug is so important, that people with BPD at least deserve it brought to their attention.

Please note I am only on 5mg per day. I would strongly advocate only taking 5-10mg per day to minimize potential side effects. It takes about 10 days to build up fully in your body, but may start working within a few days (if its going to help).

Abilify is classified as an atypical anti-psychotic, but the classification is misleading, because Ability really has a profile more similar to a next generation anti-depressant.

(1) Abilify is the only atypical anti-psychotic that does not blatantly block and reduce dopamine. It is a partial agonist of the dopamine receptors- meaning it tends to INCREASE dopamine. Well the mathematics of how it effects receptors are complex, but the idea is it ""modulates"" dopamine averages. If your dopamine levels are way too high (ie psychosis), it tends to reduce them, but conversely if dopamine in parts of your brain are too low, it can increase them.

No other ""anti-psychotic"" on the market is a partial dopamine agonist (activator).

(2) But the likely mood regulating effects come from its unique serotonin receptor binding profile. It is very potent on 4 main serotonin receptor types, but first a bit of theory.

Various serotonin receptors have been implicated in being abnormal in numbers in the brains of people that have experience prolonged childhood stress and trauma.

For example, the serotonin 1a receptor, can be reduced in number by exposure to childhood trauma, and the 2a receptor can be increased in number.

What needs to be understood, is that many of these serotonin receptors have opposite effects to each other. There is a lot of evidence linking to them to various areas of the Prefrontal Cortex, such as the Medial area. The idea is this, that these areas of the Prefrontal Cortex are involved in regulating, and resisting the influence of stress and emotion on cognition and concentration.

When the Prefrontal Cortex areas that regulate emotion are underactive, emotion and stress is not controlled and filtered out, thus a person is easily ""overpowered"" and ""triggered"" by stress and emotion.  When there is not enough chemical and electrical energy in these brain areas, the end is result is as if the ""volume"" or ""signal strength"" of emotion and stress being processed by the brain is amplified or turned to ""maximum volume"".

The serotonin 1a receptor activates and powers these ""emotional control"" areas of the Prefrontal Cortex.

However the Serotonin 2a receptor has the opposite effect, when activated, it reduces the signaling and ""power"" in these areas.

Likewise the Serotonin 2C, and Serotonin 7 receptors also, when activated they block various neurotransmitters that power the area, such as Dopamine and Noradrenalin.

There is a lot of evidence, as I said, that those ""bad"" Serotonin receptors (2a, 2C and 7) become increased in number as a result of childhood trauma, and the ""good"" Serotonin receptor ""1a"" becomes reduced in number.

Abilify activates the Serotonin 1a receptor in the brain, improving Medial prefrontal cortex area functioning. But Abilify also BLOCKS the Serotonin 2a, 2C, and 7 receptors from activating, preventing them from ""reducing"" the activity in the areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with emotional control. There is also a lot of research showing these actions reduce (or stop entirely) the effects of stress.

The above is my explanation (and interpretation) of the theory, there is thousands of pages to read through.

Unfortunately there is a lack of good research on Abilify for usage in BPD, and PTSD to yet absolutely claim it is an effective treatment, however the research which has been done is very, very interesting.

Not only is Abilify FDA approved for the use in treatment resistant Major Depression, but all trials I have found indicate it is highly effective for BPD and PTSD, and there is a lot of evidence supporting its use in people with anger problems, anxiety and general depression.

I am going to cite some of the Borderline Personality Disorder studies:

Well there are a lot more PTSD studies, all that I read are positive. There are also a lot of studies indicating it useful in people with severe anger problems, such as teenagers with conduct disorder. And of course, there is a lot of evidence of its anti-anxiety and anti-depressant effects.

It has certainly worked for me like a miracle. Not only does it work on 4 major serotonin receptors associated with emotional disturbance and stress, it also blocks Alpha 1 adrenoreceptors as an antagonist, this is also supposed to potentially assist the prefrontal cortex in functioning effectively.

The Prefrontal Cortex has of course been implicated in the pathology of BPD, from Wikipedia:

""Prefrontal cortex (From Wikipedia)

The prefrontal cortex tends to be less active in people with BPD, especially when recalling memories of abandonment.[79] This relative inactivity occurs in the right anterior cingulate (areas 24 and 32).[79] Given its role in regulating emotional arousal, the relative inactivity of the prefrontal cortex might explain the difficulties people with BPD experience in regulating their emotions and responses to stress.""

Also the Amygdala has been associated with BPD, however the Prefrontal Cortex strongly influences and controls reactions from the Amygdala via a complex feedback mechanism, and (don't ask me to find it), I did read that the serotonin networks effected by Abilify are implicated in strengthening handling of signals from the Amygdala. Also the ""Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis"" is also regulated by some of the Serotonin networks moderated by Abilify.

I have hundreds of scientific citations I have saved (too many to post here), which demonstrate how important the Serotonin 1a, 2a, 2c and 7 receptors are to emotional regulation and how they are very implicated in Prefrontal Cortex Functioning in regards to processing emotions and stress.

If anyone actually wants more info, I can post a lot more here.

1370,"So normally I feel intense emotions that are so strong and all consuming. 

But right now I feel nothing

It’s like I’m all emotioned out.

I’m suicidal but accepting. There is no distress there is no trigger there is no reason. So there’s nothing to work with.

I tried to communicate this but got nowhere. I wasn’t taken seriously because I’m not hysterical I just calmly stated I am going to die but that’s ok because it’s time.

Then I talked to the night staff whom I get on with and she said the absence of emotion doesn’t have to be a bad thing.

1371,"Hello everyone! 

I am new to this forum and would like to firstly start by introducing myself. I am 4 months into my psychology sessions that I attend once a fortnight...I initially attended these sessions hoping that my psychologist would teach me how to overcome my negative/abusive/Neglected childhood. I in no way shape or form expected or welcomed a diagnosis. As naive as it sounds I genuinely thought the assessment was to establish treatment....for depression/trauma. Little did I realise that my ""Symptoms"" were in actual fact recognised illness. I had never considered BPD before, probably because the name terrified me and I would never consider myself to have a ""Personality disorder"", but when my psychologist discussed BPD and suggested I meet most of the criteria it felt like a lightbulb moment. She explained she would refer me to psychiatrist for formal diagnosis and meds review. She discussed treatment options and ""Crisis"" teams. As a nurse myself I was shell shocked to hear I would have an assigned mental health nurse... I was so ashamed it took me 3 months to tell anyone. I felt broken! 

So far treatment is ongoing. I am awaiting group therapy by stepps programme...I am determined to reach out to others and also research BPD, but when I try I feel emotionally drained and fall asleep

It sounds crazy but its true. I attempt to educate myself and non matter what time of day I have to close it off quickly. Does anyone else experience this? I literally feel drained any time I hear the word BPD?. Anyone else experienced similar and how did you overcome.  

Thanks x"
1372,so worried about so much cant even list it
1373,"Hi everyone, 
2 days ago my boyfriend (ex bf) of 10 months was up at 4 am messaging an ex. Even after I told him multiple times before that and in the beginning of our relationship that I didn’t want him to talk to her and to please block her on everything. 
I broke up with him because he had broken my trust and done the one thing he promised me he wouldn’t do. And straight after while I’m packing my bags and hurting myself, he is the next room messaging her and calling her gorgeous, and saying it’s a good thing we broke up because now they can meet “guilt free”. I was heartbroken when I saw those messages. He takes Xanax (not prescription) on top of other medications and antidepressants. his friends and I believe that he is in psychosis. 
I just don’t know how to cope because one second we were perfect and talking about getting married and having kids and living in the mountains, and then the next he apparently doesn’t care about me anymore. I know that I’m not in the wrong. I’m just struggling so much because he is lying to everyone around him about everything. And he won’t even tell me the truth about the messages. He denies it even though I have physical proof.

I’m sorry this was so long. I am just really struggling and need guidance"
1374,"I hate job interviews and always interview badly and a lot of it stems back to my BPD.   My current employer even admits that my interview for my current job was terrible but I got the job because they could see I’d be a good fit with the team.

I’m hoping I’ve got an interview coming up for a promotion (I’ve applied before but always make a hash of the interview) but I find the whole interview thing stressful.  It’s just such an artificial/confrontational experience.  The job comes with a lot of responsibility and will involve challenging scenarios but I can deal with these as it’s just an extension of my current role.

Could I ask to see the interview questions in advance?  Surely that could be classed as a reasonable adjustment?"

works going well but i cant stop the idea that i dont deserve for things to go better and have to sabotage it all:sorry:"
1379,"I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I have been thinking recently and wondering what the cause could of been.

When I think back to my childhood, from the age of 9 I experienced violence and aggression from my father and brother. My brother would always be angry and violent towards me. My mother and I regularly had to lock ourselves in her bedroom whilst he was having an episode because he would get physical.

When I was 11 I was playing with my dad with my school tie thinking it was a game but he lost it. When he finally let go I ran and locked myself in the bathroom crying until my mother came home. Another instance around the same age with my father was when he took my laptop from me and when I tried to get it back he became violent.

Aged 12 I witnessed my brother chasing my father and screaming at my dad that he’s going to kill him. I took my dog and locked us in the bathroom. I was crying so hard and was so scared that at that point was the first I’d ever thought about suicide. I held my breath for a long while and made my face go red with hope I’d stop breathing. I just wanted to escape from this all.

My mother and father have been split up since I was 4 Months old so I didn’t grow up in the same house as him.

I was also bullied in school from age 11-13 mainly due to my overly shy and quiet demeanour which again may have stemmed from these issues I have mentioned

10 years later after trying all sorts of anti depressants which failed to work, I went to see a psychotherapist which is when I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

I was wondering if the violent upbringing could possibly be what has caused my BPD? Wondering if this could cause PTSD also? And anything else it could cause? My whole life has been trying to figure out who I am.

I have just started 25mg lamotrigine to take alongside my 120mg duloxetine and been given 4 2mg diazepam for when I feel an episode coming on which brings intense anger and fear of abandonment. I chase my partner round the house when we argue and he walks away, if he locks himself in a room I will break the door to get in. He has twice grabbed and pushed me down because I make him see red when I am having an episode. I lose any ability to think clearly and I become completely inconsolable. This is massively ruining my relationship:

Thank you for taking the time to read my question and I really hope you can help me!"
1380,"I’m bad with words so I’m sorry if this is messy and all over the place but I just need answer. 
Please be kind.

So as someone with BPD, I have a Favorite Person or Number 1.
 In this case, it is my boyfriend. 
I love him very much and he’s great!
I consider him my top priority over literally everything else.
 I love him more than anything and anyone, even my parents.
So here’s the issue, I’m not his Number 1.
I know it’s not shocking but it hurts. 
I found out one night when I was goofing around with him, and told him that he’s my number one and then I asked him if I was and he said no, not over his family.
And then he gave an example using his nephew. 
I then got really, really, really, really in my feelings.
Like, I was hurt hurt. 
And when I get upset, I get quiet and he noticed that I was and was like get out of your attitude. 
And in response I said, “You should watch what you say to me.” 
Apparently that really triggered him because in response he raised his voice at me and said, “this better not be about Joey (nephew), I  damn well meant what I said.”
And that was like the icing on the cake for me. 
He didn’t out right say I wasn’t his number one but basically dismissed as a priority over them so what would make me think I’m above his parents, his friend? I’m not. 
Today, he implied that I wasn’t much to my dismay. 
On top of this, I now have a vendetta against a damn 6 y/o.
That’s just down right terrible and I do feel bad but now it’s in my head and I can’t just change it so easily. 
I’m jealous of a 6 y/o. 
So I just feel like shit.
Am I a bad girlfriend for wanting to be Number 1? 
I just want to be loved more than anything by someone because I’ve never had that from a person who isn’t my parents. 
I always love others more than anything, maybe I’m the weirdo here?
 Am I selfish for this? 
I mean, it’s his family.
 But I thought I was family too? 
Maybe it’s because we haven’t known each other as long?
 But I would assume if you’re dating someone, that doesn’t matter because they’re your SO? 
Can someone please shed some light on my poor soul?
It’s bothering me."
1381,"Our heightened emotions challenge us. But I just wanted to show how little by little, each of us are trying, and others can do the same by starting small. Below is the little something I managed to handle and would like to share.


Today, I found out something that my bf did that got my emotions rising again. 

I was in office when I found out. My heart started racing, I started feeling hot, I got a sick pang in my stomach - anxiety and anger engulfed me. I calmly texted him to ask if we could talk and that it's urgent. I was instantly feeling like my world was crashing and I was so hurt and angry. But when I got on the phone with him, I kept calm and I told myself not to let my hurt translate to fear and my fear translate into anger. I didn't ""act out"", I managed to be an adult today. When I heard his explanation, I told myself not to do ""splitting"", to understand from his pov. The call ended okay, my bf was surprised by how different my reaction was. 

I won't lie, I have not completely changed into a different person - I know my past scars and hurts. But increasingly, I hope to not ""act out"" and to be an adult. This was inspired largely by the book ""Get Me Out of Here"" by Rachel Reiland and I highly recommend it."
1382,"Hey everyone, 

I don’t want this to be a super long message and bore everyone to death so apologies if that happens!
I am a BPD sufferer, along with anxiety PTSD and a dash of depression added in to the mix too! But.. the BPD is what I need some help with or even just someone I can relate to.
Is it even possible to be all of the above emotions but also feel numb at the same time? I have a few things going on in my life at the moment which are stressing me out a lot, too much. This weekend just gone I completely lost my cool and went bat shit crazy at a stranger, the problem is it’s 2 days later and I STILL feel as angry as I did in that moment.. it won’t go away and from experience this will stay for around a week. And after the week I will be high on life and hyper?! I just don’t know what to do, it’s exhausting I want it to stop. Is there anything I can do to make the rage stop sooner?? I have a son and although I am never angry with him when I’m in this frame of mind I can only do the basics, feed, clean, warmth & bedtime. Any extra activities, reading or homework just goes out of the window and I feel so guilty but can’t force myself to do more! 
Im tired, I feel like a shit mum, friend, daughter and this BPD bullcrap makes me feel ill."
1383,"Hi all!
Hope you’re all well!
I’m in some sort of a dilemma these days.
I’m applying for jobs in different establishments, and I want your opinion because I’m clueless.
I’m currently working in a place which used to have a great reputation when it comes to human communication.
The thing is, after that encounter with one of the seniors back when I was still on orientation, I’ve developed some sort of complex towards this place.
I do not want to work here anymore because of that person and he scares me honestly.
I know that for my benefit I should not let such emotions control me and prevent me from getting the best practice I can, however I’m worried that I will be miserable working here just for the sake of becoming good worker who can potentially progress because of the reputable work place.
I can apply to other places however they r not as reputable as this place. But is it really all about the place?
What about my feelings? Can I ever just go past my emotions of hurt for many years just for that good experience in a reputable place? Or should I go to a mediocre place and be potentially and hopefully happy( I hope I don’t meet the same kind of people there)?
To be honest I don’t think he even remembers me, but I’m still hurt and I have developed Hate for this place.

what do you think?
Should I go for the best even if I will not be comfortable or should I start fresh somewhere else and hope things work out?
Thanks"
1384,"Hi everyone I’m going through a lot right now in my head, 
I was cheated on and my ex has been showing up with flowers and trying to tell me he loves me and doing all he can (it’s quite shocking how much he has been doing) however I told him I don’t want him, because this isn’t the first time, but I’m still seeing him, and I can’t help it, I get dependent, he’s literally one of the only people I see or hang around with, I’m at his house and I’ve gone mad and starting flipping out at him and he has me, i now feel so close to an overdose, I am so stressed I just want to pass out and not wake up, all these emotions are way to high right now and I’m getting sensory overload please help"
1385,Bf and I haven’t argued in a while but here we are again. The way he argues is unbearable. He loses all logic. He’s an intelligent guy who starts to ramble like a bad politician when he’s upset. He’ll say anything to defend himself. It’s super uncool and it’s impossible to just work things out with him. I try to not be affected by this but it pisses me off anyway. I also don’t like his pissy attitudes he gets into. He complains and mopes a lot. I want to be with someone positive and stable who can support me and be there for me. Bf is that person at times but then he gets back to this again and it’s just really unattractive. I have very little patience for it right now.
1386,It's taken me some time to accept the fact that I have BPD..through out my child hood I always felt empty like I had a huge hole inside me and nothing or no-one could help fill it..i had a very difficult and confusing relationship with my mother who had post natal depression. I grew up with a fear of my mother but always tried everything to gain her love and acceptance (even writting this) is triggering old feelings and anxiety. From the age of 15 I seeked help through councillors abd physiologist through until my early 20s were I was finaly diagnosed. This diagnosis did not go down well with my mother who thought it was rediculous and basically I was just playing the victim..i believed her!..she was my mum why would I not..even though she hurt me so much I still wanted to believe in her and that she loved me. So I struggled through life with my emotions and self hatred of myself not knowing who I am or having any sense of self worth or respect for myself. I'm here today because I was lucky to be able to reach out to friends who have supported me and my emotions. Im sorry this is long and there is so much more I could write. This is the first time ive actually took action and accepted I have a disorder and I am waìting on a referal for phsychatric help as things are getting worse for me emotionally and I'm struggling. But I do get comfort in knowing j am not alone in this.
1387,"Hello all!
I was hoping to get some advice or insight. I was diagnosed about 16 years ago as bipolar, but to cut a long story short, that diagnosis never sat right with me. I didn't feel like it ""fit"". I started looking into some other things recently and came across borderline personality disorder, and alot of the symptoms seem to fit me. I am feeling very desperate to feel ""better"" and saw a light at the end of the tunnel when I started reading about it. I have an appointment with a doctor on Wednesday and I was planning on bringing it up as a discussion topic then. In the meantime, I was hoping for some insight on if this is something that I could have. In summary:

I feel like my moods have always been unstable (hence the bipolar diagnosis), but they often change so drastically throughout the day. At times, it seems almost hourly. I feel like my reactions to things is so intense and over the top. I can kind of tell that I shouldn't be reacting that way, but it is also so overwhelming that it kind of encompasses all lines of logic. I have always had a person (friend, or boyfriend if I am in a relationship), that I sort of latch on to, and if something is amiss, or I think it is amiss, I feel like my whole world is crumbling and it can take a long time to get out of it. I am currently in a relationship, and bless is heart, he is doing the best he can to be supportive, but at the same time, when he wants to do something without me, I am ashamed to say that I don't take it well. I understand somewhere that it is healthy to have separate times, but I feel always like it is some sleight against me, or that he is trying to ditch me, or doesn't like or want me. Anything like that. Then, if he doesn't do something like call/text me when I expect him to, or say something I expect him to, I get really mad and disappointed. I feel like then I turn around and say to myself that I don't need or want him and it doesn't matter. Then I cry. I love him so so much. He calls and texts me ALL THE TIME, but if it isn't when I expect it or hope for it.....blegh. Then, if something happens where I think he is trying to get rid of me or leave me, and we disagree, I feel like my world stops. I can't function normally. This has been a pattern with my relationships my whole life. My current partner has stayed with me the longest. We've been together a year. I can see that something isn't right, but it's....hard. I do similar things to my mom, but it isn't as intense. I also spend alot of time worrying about my interactions with people and how I am being perceived. There is also an issue with becoming too latched and too personal too fast. My current partner even warns me against doing this when i meet new people. I struggle to make new friends, but I desperately want them. Then, at the same time I feel like I don't need them. I feel like my wants/desires/needs change all the time, and quite frankly, its exhausting to keep up with. It makes me tired. I feel like I am at the mercy of my emotions, and I don't know what I feel at any given time, and I am always left to react to it.

Which is another thing...I feel everything so intensely and some of the times I dont even know why. I cry alot. And there are many times, when I just end up sitting and staring at the wall. I can't think, and I just feel....empty. This is not to mention the overwhelming anxiety and at times completely hopeless depression. There are several more things I can add, but for now, these are the most prevalent issues. I feel ashamed of my emotions and my inability to control them or be normal. I just want to feel better. And I'm tired."
1388,"Hello, 

I have an international commitment to attend to and due to matters out of my control, I have had to delay my departure a few days. 

If any changes needed to be made to my arrival, they simply request I notify them as soon as possible, so proper arrangements can be made. Very flexible, friendly group of volunteers.

I am aggravated with myself. This seems like such a menial task yet the thought of inconveniencing others in the slightest has me avoiding communication at all costs. I have allowed a crucial 24 hours to pass, and I could use some encouragement to get this email drafted and sent. 

I greatly appreciate any reassurance or positivity you could spare. 

Thank you, kindly. I am profoundly grateful for this forum, and each one of you beautiful creations.

Yours in health,
Liz"
1389,"Hi, just looking for advice on whether I have BPD? It seems to come up more maybe when my life is more difficult with depression and anxiety and lots of stress etc. I watched a video on it, but I feel I’m very empathetic and this seems to be one of the traits that people with BPD don’t have?

Also there are aspects that fit very much so. I know someone will tell me that the forum can’t diagnose it, but I suppose I’m wanting to speak to those who know what it’s like for themselves,  I was diagnosed or it was suggested years ago that I have it.

It may explain what I’ve been going through in not holding jobs down, but I’ve managed to stay in a long term marriage.  My childhood was very unsettled and I don’t know who I really am.  I know we aren’t defined by a diagnosis and as individuals we are not all the same and we don’t fit to one box."
1390,"I need to reach out. I hope that's ok.

I suddenly felt sad after yesterday's Assertiveness Recovery College course session. I wondered if it was from being in a room full of people trying so hard to be assertive when I felt so quiet and withdrawn. I wondered if it was because of all the years of pain attached to the whole assertiveness/non assertiveness thing for me.

I suddenly felt sad in the middle of my GP appointment this afternoon. I wonder if it was from feeling cared about and listened to. 

I hope sleep tonight shifts the feelings for me, but for now I really need some virtual tlc and protection please."
1391,"I guess I've had this all my life but was diagnosed about a year ago. I don't think I know what it's like to be normal which I guess is fine. Since I heard suspicions that there's no cure. It doesn't really bother me too much since I'm so used to it. So maybe it's a good thing? Like trying to look on the bright side? 

Similarly, I never knew that my reactions were more extreme than other people. I still don't know how other people feel but it seems like they don't want to die anytime someone says no. Idk 😂"
1392,"His too good for me
in terms of looks ,personality and intelligence he is far superior to me

it is making me feel really low
I think if I was good and kind I would let him go to be with someone better
but I love him and don't want him to go

if I only I could become someone new and worthy of him
and I know this probably sounds pathetic but it is getting me down feeling so inferior x"
1393,"I was just wondering if anyone has experienced a more significant impact of negative emotions, splitting and devaluation towards their partner since using the pill. I came off mine and my attitude has completely shifted and o feel more attracted and reassured about my partner."
1394,"I mean, it's not really a surprise, but, still.  I'm a bit grossed out because I'm starting to get a belly, despite being rail thin my entire life (I'm turning 52).

I'm thin enough I always get accused of eating disorders, and yet... I want to lose this belly, fast.  Like, tempted to reduce my medication.

If it wasn't winter, I'd just go walk outside more, but it's cold out.

I know, it's a minor concern, but it's kinda bothering me."
1395,"I finally got a job with health insurance, and I went to the psychological last month no problem. But I wasnt really feeling the doctor. But instead I looking for a new doctor before I ran out of my Seroquel I just put it in that part of my brain that I worry but tend to forget about a lot of medication and still hesitant on finding another doctor what is wrong with me"
1396,I can feel it coming on again. I started off great this year and am going on holiday in a week. I feel bad and I don't think I will enjoy it. I need to sort myself out.
1397,"Hi everyone, 

Can I ask anyone who has had a assessment for EUPD. What kind of questions will psychiatrist ask during the assessment?"
1398,"I think I have had a truly profound moment in my battle with BPD. 
Having been diagnosed less than a year ago, I finally understood why I had been so irresponsible, impulsive, reckless and hurtful to those closest to me. I had many self destructive traits and coping mechanisms. Whilst it’s easy to justify them and use BPD as an excuse, the shame, the embarrassment, the humiliation and guilt would always be there. It was a never ending cycle of perpetual suffering. So I decided to do something about it. I embarked on a journey of self help and therapy (although I did nowhere enough of the latter). Six months on from being diagnosed my suffering had eased and I felt better. I felt I’d recovered. I was well. 
I started to feel bored at this point with little stimulus in my life. I’ll invest in high risk shares I thought, I’ll go back onto Social Media to follow people invested in my companies. I am well now I said to myself, there is no threat to me, no danger, this isn’t self destructive. I began to struggle, stress returned, I coped my finding a FP from my followers and smoking myself to death. I began a really negative cycle. To compound things my sister died. I became depressed. Late last Friday night I broke down, grief stricken. In my moment of deep despair I suddenly realised I wasn’t better at all. I never had been. I can’t continue like this I said to myself, I am going to lose everything I love and end up dead. 
For whatever reason, I turned to my self help, I searched the Internet on things like Splitting (Black and White thinking), Interpersonal Relationships and most importantly a word called Disassociating. A light bulb went off in my head. I thought I suppressed my trauma and emotion, I thought I detached from situations, I thought I buried them and could cope with life. I was wrong. I hadn’t just detached from situations I had totally disassociated from living in the real world. I had and have always been simply too afraid to live in the real world and here I was disassociated with increasing episodes of paranoia. 
I finally understand my condition. I switched into being mindful, probably for the first time in my life I was living in the real world. I finally saw things around me. Truly see them, my wife, my son, my material possessions, nature everything. This wasn’t actually frightening at all I thought to myself. Although losing my coping mechanisms is painful I like me as I am. I have I think finally accepted myself, my situation and who I am. Although a little fragile I’m no longer afraid to live in the here and now. The real world. It’s a little daunting but I don’t ever intend to go back to those dark places. 
I think, although with our mood swings I must be mindful and take things one day at a time, that I may have finally recovered. I think I can live with my BPD and manage it so I can live a normal and happy life. I no longer expect this but I truly hope for it. I’m pretty confident however I have got to a place that I thought was totally unobtainable, calm and peaceful. It’s just such a shame it’s taken a fucking lifetime to get there lol. As they say though, better late than never!!"
1399,"I have been given a diagnosis for BPD. There are so many things i could post about what i am experiencing/suffering with this. Now i know why my previous diagnosis didn't feel right because there was something else and it seems that it was BPD

But anyway most people who know me seem to hate me, including people who are/were friends and family members. All the time if i see people i used to know when i am out they ignore me or even try to hide from me, no one even wants to say even just hello to me.

Online i get blocked, silent treatment etc from people all the time, sometimes we have had a falling out but when i try to sort things out with them they ignore me and when i get upset and tell them how upsetting it is for me to be ignored they still ignore me, they do not care about the distress i am in.

I've given people money and been treated like shit later on or when they ask for more and i say no they disappear quickly because they realise they can no longer use me.

I've been bullied or sidelined in groups of people, i've been picked on at work by bosses and colleagues. I've been left out of things by members of my family and they often make comments and turn a bit nasty with me and not respecting my boundaries,i feel like the black sheep, the one they merely tolerate because i am family.

i've been sitting on a bus or walking down the street and people give me dirty looks. i'm not paranoid, i don't imagine it,it happens and it happens all the time

i don't want to pretend i am a saint and i have never done anything wrong because of course i have. But i don't know what i ever did that was  so awful that i deserve to be treated as badly as i have been by so many people, people who i have sometimes done huge favours for and got treated very badly in return. it seems like people hate me and do not think i deserve to be treated decently

i was also bullied very badly at school too. Does anyone else with BPD experience this? like it seems like people hate us or they don't seem to care how they treat us or when it causes us suffering and we make them aware of it they still don't care? as though it seems we are not worthy of being treated like a human being with feelings but like a toy people can play with for their own amusement and then dump when they no longer have a use for it"
1400,"Hello!
I have an issue with shame and being criticised in front of others.
I had a recent event where I was severely criticised about a decision I made at work and it was all done in front of other colleagues I’m not familiar with.
I felt instant shame and inferiority even tho I believe my decision was partially wrong and it wasn’t a very bad decision.
I know we are not perfect, however the idea of being scolded and criticised in front of people makes me really hurt and now I don’t want to face anyone.
I wish I had thick skin.
I’m just too sensitive and can’t get over things easily.
I hate how cheerful I’m at work and then regret it because I take it to the extreme and I come back home and think back to how I was too cheerful.
I really wish I was a quiet person who didn’t care."
1401,I just got triggered and and i'm trying to calm my anger down but I just want to scream and fight and yell and thrown things and set my fucking house on fire fuck off fucking fuck I hate my life nothing ever fucking works out for me I just want to go to school and the government is keeping me from it and I hate everyone
1402,"Hi all!
I’m really curious about something.
I can’t get a feedback from anyone else because I can’t afford to see a specialist about this repetitive ritual I have.
I have noticed that for the longest time in my life, I get too excited and hyperactive and I start imagining and talking fast to myself about whatever.
It just seems like maybe a mild form of hypomania or something.
I do it in secret obviously and it doesn’t get out in public, yet it’s something that I can’t control when I’m alone.
It becomes exhausting honestly because my body becomes drained and I end up not doing anything productive at all, just drained my mind and body thinking and moving fast.
I don’t know if I delivered the message but does anyone know what I’m talking about? And if so, what do u think this is?"
1403,Have you done self guided DBT? Any good books or online resources you'd recommend? Centers where I live are super expensive.
1404,"With my partner called our relationship off AGAIN. He KNOWS I have really bad depression, he KNOWS that by pushing me like this I will eventually either self harm (badly) or worse. HE has depression you would think he wouldn't push me like this when I'm already down, doesn't seem to bother HIM though.
He's in the living room playing Xbox while I'm in the bedroom listening to my depression music and debating self harming or just to end it all. And this all started because he was the idiot who bought an Xbox without a freaking hard drive and because we have bills to pay he can't buy a hard drive THIS WEEK. LIKE WTF, SOOOO because you can't save your precious video games your gonna call off our relationship and push me to my mental limits?? Maybe if his lazy ass got a job a month ago rather then a WEEK ago he wouldn't have this problem and who fing buys an Xbox WITH NO HARD DRIVE? But as usual its MY fault. Guess I need to give up on everything, this relationship, this fucking life ...."
1405,"I want to know how to:

determine which negative thoughts are real
How to get rid of them"
1406,"After 40 years of struggling with my mental health I have finally sought help and now have a diagnosis of BPD from a psychiatrist, meeting 8 (possibly 9) of the 9 criteria. ""Funny"" how you can go through a diagnosis and in hindsight it looks so obvious.  I think we can get better at masking or internalizing our symptoms with practice. It was a crisis that forced me to get help...having an affair with a coworker and engaging in intimate acts in numerous ""public"" places (we were never seen or caught in the act). 

This relationship was tumultuous,  I ended it at least 10 times in a 3 month period, with intense highs followed by self loathing, ending the relationship and then starting again.  It almost cost me my marriage,  I'm in marriage counseling and am having sessions with a psychologist and a psychiatrist and am on a waiting list for DBT. I don't know who I am or who I love, it changes constantly. When I was younger I was self destructive,  would drink to excess, self harmed and was hospitalized and was arrested for driving on the wrong side of the road (amongstmzny incidents).  

I have engaged in numerous impulsive and costly purchases (land, houses, cars).  I have changed jobs numerous times.  In spite of this I have managed to stay employed, am financially secure and am working on my 5th university level qualification. I think I am still trying to work out what my life is about. Only recently,  after turning 50, have I stopped saying to myself ""when I grow up I..."" I have realized that I was simply trying to regulate my emotions for short term relief but with long term painful consequences.  So the path to recovery begins. I wonder if anyone else has followed a similar path?"
1407,"Hello,

I don’t know where to start. I often feel so confused. There are days I wake up and I am ready for the world. And then there are days where I lose my sense of self and just want to sleep to escape the day. My world is very fragile. I live in fear that when tomorrow comes I won’t know who I am. I’m paper thin. I tried to contact the NHS for an appointment, but I am afraid of being judged. I am afraid that opening up to someone would mean that I lose my privacy and that I will be labelled as ‘mentally unfit’. After intensive research of why I am an unfit human being, I find that I am close to being diagnosed with a Borderline Personality Disorder. I am an all or nothing person. I can love people so much and then I am ready to give them up. When I suffer from my negative, moody episodes, I lose sense of myself, my focus, and my relationships. I forget how people think of me and I start to believe that they must hate me. I hold my breath until the next time I see them to understand that they like me. I feel like a waste of space. I am constantly praying for a day where I am useful. Sometimes, I can’t breathe at night. I wake up, heart bursting, beating so fast. I tell myself to calm down and I read some prayers. I tell myself it’s ok. I walk around with this dark cloud over me. This cloud that takes up so much energy. I try to talk to people and they tell me I’m ok. And I get even more frustrated because my mind feels like it is about to explode. The emotion is so intense that I just want somebody to help me. I cry so bad during my episodes and I talk to God. It calms me knowing that God is listening when nobody is listening to me. They keep telling me that I am a nice person or I have so much to be grateful for. I am grateful honestly. I just can’t break away from the voices in my head. I feel so isolated. I feel so abandoned. I am having physical symptoms such as headaches and this morning, I had a sharp chest pain. I am afraid to get a job, to interact with people, to contribute to life and I find myself wasting away in imaginary lands. I just don’t feel good enough. On my good days, I feel I can do it. On my worst days, like now, I just feel utterly useless and I want to disappear.

Sorry, I just need someone to talk to about all of this. I feel so alone. And yes, I have been told that I am very very sensitive and that I need to toughen up. My question is how can I change who I am? My perspective? There all sorts of things I do not like about myself. Growing up, people picked on me and my appearance. That is all I see and I need help. I cancelled my appointment with the mental health clinic and I am afraid to go back there again in fear that they will not accept me.

. I feel unclean inside my head. I dont want to be in a relationship. I can’t trusg people. 

Please help me. I don’t know what it is. I look online and they tell me I have a combination of things. 
Sorry for rambling. I’m going crazy here."
1408,"Hey peeps so I was wondering if you can have BPD as well as other mental health illnesses at the same time? 

Like for example BPD and bipolar etc"
1409,"I've been reading so.many articles and books about BPD, and it's extremely depressing. Everything out there makes it seem hopeless. Will I ever be able to enjoy being in a romantic relationship without all of the drama and treating my partner like crap?"
1410,"My fiance left 6.5 weeks ago and going through each day all alone and looking for work is killing me.  I have to fight the urge to take all of my pills and just go to sleep.  I am tired of suffering and worrying and ruminating.  I have been looking for work for the past 5 months and have gone on about 27 job interviews and no one will hire me.  I wonder if my instability is showing and that is why i cannot find a job.  

I have an appointment on Wednesday to apply for disability here, but it can take 6 months to a year to get it and they still can refuse. I am trying to stay well, find a job, get my life back again, but it seems all i do is wake up every morning scared and worried about how i am going to get through all of this - i am used to him being gone, but it is the fact that i am living on my savings in a big expensive house and watching my savings dwindle.  If he had left and i was in an apartment i could actually afford, it would feel different. 

I can't even make plans to move cuz i have no cosigner and no job and no income.  I feel so trapped in my life and I am hoping if i keep on going, then hopefully something will pan out."
1411,My bpd right now is  very out of control. I keep sabotaging my relationship with my husband. I am very impulsive and i keep testing the boundaries of our relationship. I don't know why or what to do. We fight everyday. He thinks i hate him but i really don't. I feel so sad and depressed and alone. He is fed up of my nonsense.
1412,"I live by a couple of consistent rules to keep my overwhelming BPD feelings in check one of them is that I keep a certain amount of distance between me and people so they can't abandon me and set off my self-destruction cycle. 

I've been single a long time but recently I started slowly seeing a guy at snail pace and were probably at close to 6 months and he recently was about to say he loved me I know it but I freaked out and cut him off like a freak and when he dropped me off I canceled our next date. 

I'm more afraid of having my BPD get set off and ruin my life than anything in the whole world. I'm so close to finally completing my degree and moving on with my life. But I also really like this guy but I can't tell him I love him and I know he's trying to say it and I can't not obsess about it and if he does say it and I can't say it is he gunna break up with me? I don't want him to break up with me I like him. 
 
Does anyone have any ideas about what to do other than ""tell him"" because I am not ready yet to tell him about my BPD or about my interpersonal problems and I can't tell him that I don't love him if he puts pressure on me I think I'll cave and just say it back which is so shitty cuz its a lie and I can't lie about it cuz then he'll think im somewhere that i'm not emotionally. 

I'm sorry I'm rambling. I think I'm best off just ending things"
1413,"Like it’d be chill if they weren’t playing love songs in the dentist office haha. I kinda need to not be emotionally stimulated for the next couple days please and thanks lol. 

I had this weird idea yesterday about schools for emotionally sensitive kids where they don’t use overly emotional reading materials, etc. does that exist? I know my child self would have appreciated that lol. I was always scared something was going to be too emotional for me. 

I’ve also heard some grocery stores do no music, dimmed lights hours for people with ASD. I would totally be about that just to avoid sappy songs. Sometimes I’m like great cool let me just cry in the produce aisle. Lol."
1414,"i don’t want to go too in depth about this because i don’t want to be the one person who comes off as trying to diagnose themselves.
i’ve considered i might have BPD for the longest time but always pushed it to the back of my mind.
i’m under 18, though, so while i don’t think i can get diagnosed i do have a question

do you have to have very extreme black and white thoughts to have BPD/be diagnosed?  because honestly i don’t think i do... everything fits except that. black and white quite often but not with absolutely EVERYTHING. atleast i don’t think ? i’ve never really understood it...
i don’t know maybe i’m overthinking it. i’m too scared of focusing too much on it because i know that’ll only make it worse. but idk if it can get much worse"
1415,"Although I’ve always had BPD I’ve never had a Favourite Person, until recently that is. From what I’ve read it would appear normal that you share your emotions, your past traumas and inner fears with them. Unfortunately I found that jealousy (which I don’t normally suffer from), that is jealousy in her giving her time to others, came to the fore. Although I knew she spoke to lots of other men, it was only one person that affected me, most probably because  he was the one individual that I could see them exchanging posts. My emotions were so intense it was as though I was grief stricken every time I saw his name. I was honest and told her of my feelings but the next thing I knew was for three consecutive days when we were chatting she would send me poems or nice things that he had sent to her. As if she was goading me to react, or that’s how it felt. I once again explained my pain and suffering to her and she agreed not to be friendly with him anymore. However the next thing I know I look on a forum and there they are super friendly together. I said I’d seen your posts and her response was if it upsets you don’t look. 
My question is does every FP do this, I thought they were meant to care for you and have your wellbeing at heart but although she knew she was my FP exhibited such insensitivity towards my emotions and feelings, as though she was laughing at me and enjoying me suffer. Is this just my emotions being shattered?  
Anyway after lying to me saying she hadn’t said she wouldn’t be friendly with this individual, I just said bye and haven’t communicated with her since. It been two maybe three days now. So another question, how quickly can you get over a FP and eradicate them from your thoughts because it’s bloody painful to feel so belittled, humiliated and be taken for such a fool when you realise they had absolutely no feelings about you when you were convinced they had. 
Sorry been rambling really whilst I try and get my thoughts together. Any advice would be appreciated. 😞"
1416,Hi. I’ve been with my partner for over 6 months. He is the love of my life and there is no one I’d rather be with. But I’m scared I’m having doubts about the relationship that I don’t believe? I want to be with him but I’m scared that I’m feeling this way. Is this real? The thought of losing him makes me sick to my stomach. Is my mind trying to push him away to avoid getting hurt? Please help I don’t want to ruin this relationship because I’m having doubts that don’t even feel real.
1417,"I just want to prove to everyone here you can be anything you set your mind to. That your diagnosis doesn’t define you.

I was a journalist for 15 years. I worked all over the world. I was part of a team nominated for a Pulitzer.

The angry voice in my head made me work harder. I made it to the top of my profession 5 years out of school.

I now write speeches and reports for politicians.  It’s high stress, super demanding, but I can still navigate.

My disorder hasn’t changed my ability to contribute.

I know we have scientists and graduate students here. Share what you do (be careful not to include anything identifying though)."
1418,As the title says I believe I'm in crisis.  Feel so alone....and scared.
1419,"This evening I raised a subject of anxiety with my partner. He is planning to go to the USA for 10 days with friends in summer, he told me this very casually a few days ago. I have subsequently felt irrationally but intensely anxious, it has terrified me. 
I tried to explain, over the phone that I was feeling anxious, but I’m aware it’s not ‘real’ but that I still feel awful, despite trying to manage my abandonment fears. He didn’t get it, called it stupid, said I just needed to trust him... at this point I got very angry and said that it actually wasn’t even about him before hanging up the phone.
He subsequently hasn’t contacted me 2.5 hours ago and I’m going mad, I’ve taken a few tablets but have contemplated self harm as I am hyper stressed. I don’t know who else to talk too, my disordered thoughts are getting worse and I feel terribly alone, now I believe I’ve destroyed the relationship.
I don’t know what to do :( I can’t sleep."
1420,Does anyone else get really impulsive? Like there are things I really want and even feel like I need to go right now that would be very bad for me but they are all I can think about. I know they are wrong but it’s like there is no room for rational thought I just must do it
1421,Kinda want to talk about it but don't know where to begin..
1422,"So I’ve been in residential care for over 4 years now. I agreed to come in for 12 weeks respite back in 2015 but I’m still here. I had a placement review yesterday and thought I was leaving but have been told once again that isn’t possible as I just wouldn’t cope in the community.

I feel more than ready to leave. I find endings hard as I have attachment issues and issues with change so mevwanting to move on is a huge thing. The thing is I’m getting frustrated with the placement and staff which is making the decision to leave easier but care coordinator says I’m making an emotional decision that isn’t thought through. The reason why I’m getting frustrated is I no longer require this level of care and am finding the routine and restrictions difficult to deal with. I want to enter education get a volunteer job go out with friends not attend groups be in at set times for medication/ meetings/curfew/therapy.

Yes there are issues. My bmi has dropped low again because of food stuff and my hygiene isn’t great bc of trauma associations and although my last self harm was December it did require 3 operations and a 10 day physical hospital stay so those are the arguments for keeping me here.

I will always be high risk. So are they just going to keep me going between residential and hospital forever? I have to take positive risks at some point."
1423,I've noticed that the symptoms of BPD only flair up when a man enters my life. Just wondering if anyone can relate to that?
1424,"I don’t even know what words can express the feelings I have. I just hate myself, so much pity, so much bitterness. Nobody understands me, even the nicest people can’t help but enjoy a cruel laugh at how utterly pathetic I am. Everyday I am tormented by how much others have overcame and how weak I truly am. Everytime I think I may have found someone who I think might be at my level of pathetic I find out that they are really better and can live with themselves at the end of the day and can only bear to fake being as worthless as me."
1425,"I wish that it could be treated as if I had allergies. Oh you have a nut allergy? I won't throw peanuts at you. 

But it's such a taboo topic and I can't tell anyone what triggers me so I just have to deal with the reactions."
1426,"Hi, I’m new here and whilst waiting to get further help for BPD thought I’d join this forum. I’ve currently gone through a relapse or episode or whatever want to call it. Occasionally in the past I’ve purged as a form of punishment i guess. This time around I’m now stuck in this cycle where I struggle to eat or make food. But i do as i know if i don’t it’s not going to be beneficial to me to starve myself. What i’m struggling most with is as soon as i’ve eaten i am purging. I have battled with myself to not, eaten out with friends and stayed with them after in the hope the need to wears off but when they are gone i still do it. Has anyone on here done this and have any advice on how they stopped or reduced doing it after everything they ate? I spoke to my doctor today but she didnt seem phased but i know this is going to be damaging if i continue. I’ve googled online but not had much luck. Thanks for reading."
1427,"Hello all! I'm new here, but I am a veteran when it comes to knowing my borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder comorbid diagnoses. I have had quite the journey, which has been painful, beautiful, ugly, resentful... words are not enough. Yet they are. I began my journey two years ago, shortly after I began seeing my now-fiancee, then-boyfriend. I had displayed all of the signs of BPD for as long as I could remember--I was a little boy when I first noticed the signs. I had the hallmarks: sexual promiscuity, emotional disregulation, impulsivity, and the worst (in my honest opinion): fear of abandonment. My journey began when I was sexually abused when I was three and compounded when my father would abuse me in my adolescent years. My mother was always working and was never around--my father has all of the signs of BPD but chooses to live in ignorant bliss. I would fight like hell for safety and security, assured by healthy individuals who thought I was resilient... they were wrong to a fault. I was resilient to physically hurting others, but I would engage in some of the same tactics that my father would use against my mother. I did this for 26 years and did not know why others were not overwhelmed by their emotions. I was curious as to how others could be the ""cool customers"" and process difficult circumstances. I was jealous, but I felt what I was experiencing was normalcy. I knew I had issues. Anorexia, Bulimia-Nervosa, anxious/RACING thoughts, feelings which were unstable, and paranoia constitutive of inpatient mental health treatment. Quite simply put: I was living in ignorant bliss similar to my father's ignorance. 
When I was 25, I met a guy. He was my dream guy. Tall, red-headed, successful, well-connected. He wanted me. It was the most lucrative drug I have ever taken. I loved it. I hated it. I would question his every move and then demand more movement and meaning for our relationship. I never asked myself why, I only asked him why. 
I would unlock his phone without his consent, ask questions that I had no business asking... I take full accountability for my shortcomings. Sure, he too played his part. BUT, this is about me and not him.
During my two and a half year relationship with him, I would go from questioning my sanity and my emotions one day, to questioning him and his sanity the next. I was inconsistent. I would expect of him, and expect change. I would impulsively have sex with others, lie, and cause more chaos and discord. It wasn't until I lost my job that I realized I was truly unstable. However, I was led to advocacy. The universe was sending me a sign: ""Deal with your stuff!"" I took the hint, applied, and was hired. BPD still raging, the employment I received gave me accountability and a chance to grow. My childhood never provided this structure.
I was still with my dream guy. I conformed to his ways. I practiced the Catholic faith with him (this was a jump, I never identified as Catholic in my life... practicing Catholicism for me was like a Buddhist committing murder). So, I stayed. I trimmed up my body when he remarked at my weight. I tried to change myself. I still wasn't done trying to change him. After many arguments, and after many months of finger-pointing, I reveled in an ah-ha moment and realized: I have to change my outlook on relationships, on life. This enlightenment came a little too late. Eventually, my promiscuity (and his) came to our attentions and he said he wanted space. He asked for a week. Then three. And eventually he broke up with me through text message. 
Dagger to my bleeding heart. I grieved. I begged for him back. And then I would be entitled. I felt like I had caused it (which is existentially true), but I wasn't ready for that part of the grief process. Eventually, I gave up. I would have random flings. Drink heavily. Work out until my palms bled from holding weights. Shortly before I met my fiancee, I found out that he not only had left me for another man, but this other man was someone I call my ""archenemy"". It is so difficult to admit that I have a true enemy, but I do. And yes, I played a part in that, too.
Fast-forward half a year, it was 2018 and I was sitting in my psychologist's office. She pulled out the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) V (5). I was familiar with this manual, yet no one had properly pin-pointed what was wrong. She was no fool, and saw through the layers. We discussed this at great length. BPD meant I was Glen Close from ""Fatal Attractions"". BPD meant I was out for blood, vengeance, and that I was a narcissistic abuser. Not completely wrong.
My experience with BPD is a love-hate relationship. I feel strongly, and this is a double-edged sword. I connect with others emotionally, and this is vulnerability for others but my norm. I am able to empathize deeply. When I feel, it's as if the world stops, my breathing is restricted, my heart is racing, and focus is a long-distant memory. When I'm angered, I rage. When I'm sad, I am distraught and melancholy. When I'm happy, I'm jubilant and I celebrate larger than life. When I've lost all hope, I slump for months (this is my comorbidity with bipolar depression/mania speaking in tandem). I'm Benjamin Button and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde all-in-one package. 
My psychologist gave me insight into my issue. I was not emotionally distraught, yet I was. ""No medications for BPD."" ""I'm so overwhelmed I need help with my emotions! THEY DON'T STOP!"" Madness. She gave me escitalopram (Lexapro) 10 milligrams. I'm still on the medication. I've stopped going to my therapy appointments, not because I think I'm better than therapy: my role in advocacy is currently healthy relationships and building emotional regulation in children. I learn while I teach. I advocate for those who are hurt the way I hurt others. I take accountability for the pain I've caused and no longer rage when I think of the pain that was done unto me. I'm not in the people-changing mindset anymore. I've given up my unhealthy habits, and though the medication has been unkind to my waistline: my mental health flourishes. My prison sentence is over. My life is 180 degrees from where it began. 

I am enough. I am not my disorder. I have a personality. I am healing."
1428,"I read on another site that one of the criteria the professionals use for disagnosing BPD is whether someone has a ""comfort object"" and name comfort object

I'm thinking about it now ......... I remember telling the professionals about my girl Ebony (died in my arms nearly 2 years ago), was it likely the professionals was counting Ebony as my ""comfort object"" if theres any truth to that comfort object thing, even though she was my cat, my precious girlie?

idk ............ was it likelier that the professionals secretly hated me and wanted to punish me?

cause i deserve punishments"
1429,"Can anyone relate, or does anyone have any advice? I've recently become friends with the sweetest girl, and while I love her very much, and I've cut off contact with my ""favorite person,"" it feels like they're the only real person in the universe and that by cutting them out of my life, I'm living in a simulation without them. I'm not even interested in them anymore, they're like a leech attached to my subconscious mind. I'm not sure if this makes sense, it is difficult to put into words. I don't know how to become truly interested in things anymore. My ""fp"" has raised the obsession bar so high, and now it feels like if I'm not unhealthily obsessing over someone or something beyond the point of mental anguish, that I'm not truly connected to it. Thank you for taking the time to read this. This is my first post on the forums, I will write an introduction post later today. :)"
1430,"Hi, I have been suffering from poor mental health for quite some time. I have been diagnosed with depression with BPD traits and recently contacted an old friend and classmate to catch up on how she was doing now. We both went to different universities, went our separate ways and lost contact. I kind of felt bad because she was a nice person and we appeared to get along. As I am sure you guys know really well, some days are easier than others and on one of my very low days I contacted my old friend and asked her how she was doing, what she was up to now etc. I also expressed my regret for not maintaining contact but explained that I had been struggling with my mental health and have kind of withdrawn from and been avoiding friendships. I told her I was sorry for disconnecting and if I ever appeared rude or cold it was never my intention and that she was a nice person. 

Anyway, she replied back and told me that she too had been struggling with her mental health and had been suffering from depression and BPD. I told her how sorry I was that she suffered this alone. We asked each other about our symptoms, she told me that she struggles with over-attachment in friendships and I told her about my chronic low mood, suicidal thoughts etc. I then told her that I feel her pain and that if she ever needs to talk about anything I am always here for her and she said the same. However the conversation kind of terminated abruptly, when I asked her if she was currently in a relationship earlier in the day, she didn't reply until the end of the day and then said to me that it was lovely hearing from me, keep reaching out and getting support. 

I can be an overthinker but I thought maybe she thought I wanted to form a relationship with her or something. I just wanted to know if she was going through overattachment troubles in a current situation and offer advice. I tried to clear up any potential misunderstandings via text but have had no response. I have reiterated the fact that I care about her and will not abandon her and that if she needs to talk I am here for her, but she is continuing to ghost me. 

Sorry for the rambling, I would just like advice really on how to process this situation and what I should do next. I don't know if I have scared her off or hurt her or if she is splitting, or if the friendship is over now. I don't want to abandon a suffering person, however if a person doesn't want to connect at all, I don't want bother them. Any advice would be appreciated."
1431,"Hi, I am new to this site and this is the first time I have posted.  I am 35, mum to 2 children, work full time and I am doing a degree.  To everyone else, it appears that I cope fine.  I keep my suffering hidden from everyone else, even my husband, despite the fact that we have been married for 3 years.  

When I was in my late teens and 20’s, I went from one toxic relationship to another. I was also promiscuous and my spending habits got me into debt. I always felt lost and had no sense of purpose. I suffered from crippling anxiety. I went to my dr, who referred me to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with BPD.

Fast forward 8 years, I am now happily married with 2 children. I am 100% faithful to my husband and paying off my debts. I take citalopram for my anxiety which takes the edge off my anxiety enough for me to be able to go to work and function as normal. I have also done a course of CBT which somewhat helped with my anxiety.

However, the anxiety is still there to a certain extent and I still have feelings of depression which I keep hidden well.  As far as my husband knows, I have anxiety and I take citalopram to take the edge off.  The most crippling symptom for me is the constant self-doubt, I especially struggle with this in work.  My husband is completely oblivious to the fact that some days are a really struggle for me.  I often lie to him and tell him that I’ve had a good day when he comes home from work.  Sometimes, I wonder if I’m being deceptive by keeping my diagnosis from him.  I’m worried that if he does know of my diagnosis, he will change the way he acts towards me.  Is there any point in telling him or anyone else close to me?  Anyone else kept their diagnosis hidden from those close of them?"
1432,"Hi

I'm not coping. I have far too much on, mainly relationship related which I always really struggle with. 

I have no professional support, I'm in-between care co-ordinators and have no therapist. I know the majority of my issues relate to my relationship with my Dad which on the surface looks great but I'm so scared of him disapproving (which since being a teenager (I'm 47 now), he hasn't really) that I'm consciously anxious about dealing with him. I have a long term partner who is critical and I spend all my time walking on eggshells. I can't cope with it anymore and I don't know what to do.
I want to self harm and I want to take too many meds to give my head a break. I've had DBT so I know the skills to use but I can't find the energy or focus to do them.
Everything is overwhelming - I don't want to go to work as that makes my anxiety goes mad but being at home with my partner is also really stressful. I have no safe place.

I'm scared that I'm going to get to my breaking point which doesn't feel very far away right now.

No idea what I want or need from anyone on here but I needed to vent

x"
1433,"It's really long and boring.

Most of my childhood I was reclused in home as I was homeschooled by my mom who's a retired teacher. I had no friends or contact with other child's as you may imagine. I have two older brothers, my relationship with them was the same of any brothers, except that they were way older than me and lived their own independent life so it was quite distant (and it still is).


My only contact with other folks of my age was in church, and I hated them so I never had any further connection than a few child games. My father was absent as he cheated repeatedly on my mom. She often lashed out at me saying that I should go and live with my father rather to stay with her. Then she avoided me and didn't talked to me for the rest of the day. (I was like 7)


I entered to a regular school for 2 years where I managed to build some friendships, and then we move out of city so my friends where left out of my life once again.


At that age I was left completely alone in our new home, reclused once again. Most of my days I was playing ps1, cleaning, making food and watching horror movies. We had no money for internet, so I didn't have any contact with online people.


My mom was always busy doing papers and arguing with my (far absent at this point) father, because he didn't wanted to pay my school, and he didn't, so I couldn't get to go, and my mom decided to return homeschooling me again.

At this point I was 12.


A year later, my grandma went to live with us. I never had a real connection with her more than a respectful trait.

I remember when I was very little and she said things like ""You don't like me, right?"", A question I couldn't respond because she never was affectionate to me and I didn't know her very well. She always stated explicitly that she preferred and praised her male grandchildren rather the females ones. So the lack of communication made her a complete stranger to me and suddenly we had to live with someone that doesn't like me.


In a matter of days, grandma took a radical posture against me and started to talk nasty stuff of me to my mom and other family members. Like I was merely a ""stupid brat"", ""useless"" and that I should've been kicked out of the house. It was like she hated me  with guts. I never responded to her attacks, and in exchange, I stayed silent, even if I was hurting and feeling humiliated. Soon, this became quite regular.


I shut myself in the room more and more often. The relationship with my mom was not great, but with the arrival of grandma it became even more distant.


I felt so, so alone, so desesperante. Unloved, despised.. less of a person. With no social skills, I developed agoraphobia and panic attacks. I couldn't go out of the house without blacking out. The fear of being rejected and ridiculed consumed me. So I had no chance to run away.


We managed to get internet and I have found kind of a shelter in some fandoms. Specially in the role-playing platform. Writing things and imagining the life through another character's eyes was the best thing it could happen to me. It was like doing things I couldn't never do in real life.. simple things like having a cute relationship or going out with friends.

Living that fake life helped me to tone down the monster that told me I was unlovable and alone. But at the same time, I was too naive to really tell if I could trust in someone I just met online.


Years passed... My grandma's behavior got worse and one of my aunts decided to took her with them, so me and my mom were finally free from her toxicity.


This is where my depression suddenly exploded.


I was trying to finish my highschool online, but I have already failed my last exam. I was studying by my own because mom was not qualified to teach upper years of school.

I had to wait another year to take the exam again.

The relationship with my mom worsened and I was once again antagonized and left alone.

I got into self harm to ease all the pain that was consuming me. I harm myself regularly and I was planning to commit suicide until my mom saw the large wounds crossing my skin. That was when she finally decided to take to a psychologist.


Short long story. I got diagnosed with depression and bpd.

Now I'm an adult, I've got my job and I even build an outgoing personality in order to be a high-functioning person. I have my peaceful moments, but I've never followed a constant treatment, and I think my bpd is getting worse through the years.

I only live to work and maintain my mom and myself. The fear of abandonment has destroyed all my potential relationships and even the fictional friendships/relationships I had role-playing. I'm right now, right here completely out of hope. I can't control my mood swings and the paranoia of being left behind have taken over my life. I know I'm seeing black and white. I crave so bad for someone to hold me and never let go. I'm not looking for advice, I don't think it will do much in my state. I wanted to let this all out and then cry until I run dry."
1434,"Hey I'm 36 and they just diagnose me with Borderline personality disorder. I have been to many therapist, psychiatric doctors , since I was 20 . first diagnose was severe anxiety. Then depression , GAD , panic disorder and so forth that has all its ever been but to now at 36 be diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder . I find it hard to even believe or take in. 
I am so tired of bot knowing why I am this way and I have like said been to many doctor. I always thought it could be adhd as a young child I was hyper , never made good grades and could not focus.  My grandparents raised me and they only took me to church to heal it. I need help.  What do I do or where do I start now. ???"
1435,"I am so low
I have had loads happen the last few months now all I want is to sleep

plus something else is bothering me"
1436,"I am without a partner for 10 years now and without close friends for the last 4 years! I used to have two close friends that meant the world to me and we were like sisters to each other. But then they left because of a huge misunderstanding or maybe because they grew to be tired of my bpd and depression relapses.
Since then, i learnt to live by myself and cover my emotional needs by myself and therapy and of course by reminiscing on what we had. True love never ends and they will always hold a special place in my heart.

I avoided making close friends since then and this was fairly easy due to my social anxiety. There were some acquaintances but nothing deep. I explicitly told myself and my therapist that i will never trust anyone again and that this is for the best because i get too clingy and then there is always heartbreak.

But then...after 2 years of talking to a man about common interests and common activities, i finally confided in him about my story back in September. This was very huge for me. He showed compassion, he shared some of his struggles and he tried to be supportive. He really showed that he cared. We kept talking about other stuff as well but since my last depressive episode began in late November, this has been the centre of my attention and for days i withdrew from my other activities. He kept being supportive and he said he wished there was something more he could do. Of course, this was mutual and i supported him too in his everyday struggles.

But i feel like we grew apart in the last 3 weeks and i told him so in the weekend. That i catch myself pushing him away and not knowing how to talk to him because i am afraid i have become a burden and because he doesn't respond as he did. I even asked him what have i done wrong and he doesn't answer. And i reminded him that when i first confided in him, i had asked him to explicitily tell me so if he gets tired and he said he would. And he didn't answer. At all 😭.

I feel heartbroken. I feel like i fell in the trap of trusting someone again but i forgot that my patterns in relationships would lead in the same outcome. And i am stuck here wishing there was a way for him to take back his care and for me to take back my discolure to him. 

To make matters worse, i have to interact with him because we are part of the same group and we need one another. The other choice is for me to withdraw from this group once and for all but then i will lose a purpose in my life that lies in this group's activities.

I do not know what to do. I guess my question is how do i stop feeling the way i feel. Should i avoid him altogether? How do i play cool after what i told him and him not replying? How do i stop my feelings?

P.s. he is a very busy person and there is a small chance he didn't reply because he didn't have the time. But even if this abandonment is a perceived and not a real one, it ought to be a lesson for me that i should never have trusted anyone because it is not worth the pain and emotional turmoil. Even if he is really not gone, i feel like i have to put an end to this friendship.

Sorry for the long post. I feel really lost."
1437,"Yesterday I was diagnosed with BDP. After years of being told I’m bad tempered or nuts or anxious or depressed how I feel and act finally has a name and I don’t know how I feel about it. Part of me is so relieved but part of me is scared to death and another part just feels ashamed. I’ve been told so many times to be normal but I don’t even know what normal is. Why do I appear to embrace conflict or go from lovely to psycho is ten seconds flat. Why do I push people away and then beg them not to leave. Why do I feel such intense feelings yet feel empty inside. I want to overcome this but at the moment I don’t see how, the way I am has been me for so long how can I ever get better or feel like other people do. Have relationships where I don’t feel paranoid 24/7, have a life where I’m not worried about everything. Until yesterday I barely knew what BPD stood for now it’s what defines me and my life and I feel so alone. I know people are judging me for not getting it sorted sooner but mental health has always been something to be ashamed of in my life being diagnosed with depression and anxiety was hard enough but this is a whole new world a world I don’t understand or want to be part of."
1438,"Does anyone here have any thoughts to share about your relationship with sex/sexual intimacy? Whether it’s healthy or unhealthy. I know there’s a lot of research on this matter and I can definitely relate to most of it. I use sex in a very unhealthy way and as a control mechanism or to feel not numb. There was a period in my early twenties that I was obsessed with being an object of desire and male fantasy to the point that I put myself in very  emotionally harmful and dangerous situations. In my late twenties now I feel I am almost disenchanted with sex. I just want a healthy relationship with sex so badly.
Anyway, I would be so grateful if you guys could share your experiences and relationships with sex as people who have the disorder. Whether it’s healthy or unhealthy or just is. Thank you"
1439,Anyone just got to a point of wishing you could leave everything or just be totally numb. Nobody actually cares. People don’t listen and even with a diagnosis I am irrelevant and a horrible person. Why do I put so much effort in trying to justify myself or explain myself to people anymore or try at all when there is no one who really cares. So fed up of being alone.
1440,to feel so happy and so sad all at the same time
1441,I could stop thinking when bad things happen I am being targeted and singled out for badness x
1442,"I have BPD and I've struggled with relationships, self harm, anxiety, weight issues, depression, and wicked mood swings. I often feel unlovable, worthless, and like i will never live a normal life. I take a cocktail of medications for it. I'm constantly in my head and driving myself INSANE. I'd say about 95% of the time i feel like i'd be better off dead and at least 5-7 times a day i think of ways to kill myself. I go to therapy regularly, i exercise, do yoga, and lots of active things. I cant seem to get out of my head and stop feeling insane. I can feel it throughout my entire body not just my head. I often have out of body experiences as well.
Does anyone else feel like this or have had similar feelings, if so how are some ways you've dealt with this?"
1443,"ermm so i have ptsd with attachment disorders from very early childhood. i have memories as far as 1 year old (belive it or not). some try to deny it at all costs because that would bother them too much. but ever since i was abused i have been having huge problems with socialization and all types of human interaction. in the first few following years to my abuse i was still able enough to reach out abit for that interaction but arround 7/8 it started becomeing worse and around 10/11 it was a goodbye and ever since then its been detereorating in huge proportions. right now its not even me anymore. its something else inside of me. something very sick.
i have always been very picky about the people i wanted to relate with because i soon realized that not everyone could love and accept me. ihave always felt very diferent from the standard. but not in a bad way at all. i felt like i was so much higher and had to endure so much more than everyone else of my age. these people i chose to try and conect with however always seemed to hurt me even more. in completly diferent ways from the others. more subtle and contained. like they were there but not really there. maybe just my imagination. was always drawn to these people. always repelled by others and still am. i am repelled by the vast majority of people i cant stand whats ordinary or petty. i dont mind this but its not usualy socially aceptable because it looks like im discriminating(being elitistic) .i guess i am elitistic but not originaly on purpose. anyway i have met quite a few people over the years i could have formed a friendship with, ideally. question is would it have ever worked if i didnt have bpd? why do i always want more from these people until i drive them to exhaustion and they have to remove me from their life.. is it me or them. in the last decade of my life.. my adult life it has always been the same. i start talking to a new person who really quickly becomes awfully fond of me and procedes to make promises about being there for me always, that it wont be like the others etc. yet usualy 2 weeks after they start getting busy and slowly withdrawl until they dont talk to me at all anymore.
could really use some help with this
i try really hard to analize myself to know if its anything specificly i say to make this happen but the timings really get me.. its always that period of time ..always in the same way..am i going crazy"
1444,"Lol I did not feel happy after leaving his office earlier but I feel better again now. Bf’s being super sweet and I’m excited but my therapist is like this is like an emotional game because he was talking breakups a couple weeks ago. And he told me to rip the bandaid off. Well maybe I will eventually but not today. 

I AM generally way more calm though. My assessment for anxiety was almost zero today and that’s not because bf is sweet but because I’m finally feeling like myself again. Yay for that. 

Part of my new treatment plan is eating better and getting to work on time. Earlier, I don’t have a formal start time but just 9 seems like what reasonable humans do lol. 

And going to get some exercise now. So idk I guess the bandaid part will happen later!"
1445,"I miss my best friend. For anonymity purposes, we will call her Amy. Any and I have been friends for years, but in the past year and a half have become very close. She was my other half (besides my spouse). Complete opposite of me but we respected and cared for each other a great deal. We have taken care of each other’s kids and we a have shared so much. In July of this year she allowed her abusive father back into her life. For years she had told me about the things he used to do to her and her siblings. Her mother also abandoned the family when she was a pre teen. And she was left to live with this man and protect her you g siblings. She said that her father had terminated al cancer and that she was the only one who could care for him. As time went on, she started to change. For awhile she was isolating herself and she wouldn’t return calls or texts or when I would see her she would look right through me as if I didn’t exist. And then things started to get better and then all of a sudden it was like a light switch flipped and she would attack me out of no where. Vicious verbal attacks. In the years that I have known her, I have never seen her like this. She apologized once. Telling me that she was “broken”, “all of a sudden very lost”, and that she needed help. She also admitted to me that she had been secretly drinking heavily and believed she had a drinking problem. I helped her find a therapist and some outpatient rehab locations and I think she was going for sometime. By the time October came around, I would reach out and sometimes it would be the old her and then one night she became so out of line with me. Telling me she wished she never knew me, that I was controlling her and she wouldn’t allow it, that I ruined her life and a ton of other very hurtful statements. I was beyond shocked, hurt and betrayed. I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder and depression and it sent me in a tail spin. I told her I needed break from our friendship because for 3 months all she had done was attack me and I couldn’t handle it anymore. After that she fell apart. When i would see her, she would ignore me most of the time. Then one day out of the blue she started talking to me again and we started to reconnect, but I was still guarded. And then an attack happened again recently. She accused me of talking about her and sharing all her secrets and that I am secretly setting up to destroy her. All because I was talking to the “wrong or bad” people. The same people she had been talking to only days before. I asked her if she wanted to talk in person and she refused and instead sent me a very long, untrue and insulting email. Accusing me of things that called into question my integrity and character. This time I responded by simply telling her what she was saying was not true. She asked me to leave her alone, so I did. But then she sent me a text in the middle of the night. I responded simply and she disappeared again.  In this time I found out what BPD is. And my beautiful friend is borderline. It’s not her fault. Her trauma is deep and I recognize that.  I want to support her the best I can but I don’t want to be in her crosshairs. What do I do? I feel like she is pushing me away but at the same time doesn’t want me to leave. I’m so confused. I miss my best friend so much. But I don’t know who this woman is. Is she even still there?"
1446,Hello. I was hoping for relationship advice from someone familiar with BPD. I have complaints regarding my boyfriend but I can't tell whether it's my BPD or not. I am in love with him but if he feels the same he hides it. I never know what to think and I am very worried that I will run him off with insecure needy behaviour.
1447,"I have worked out I DON'T want to die

1448,"Because I don't, and really need one.
Originally I wasn't 'allowed' one because I was in private therapy.
Now I'm no longer in private therapy, and haven't been for 2 years, they still don't bother."
1449,"I'm so fusterated.   I actively try to improve my bpd l and have been searching for advice on how to handle relationship problems when u have bpd and all the info I get is relationship problems when w someone w bpd. 
I really need to find some Healthy ways to understand if I'm seeing thing correctly w what I see and my boyfriends moody meanness. I need advice on how to handle it as well as making sure I can trust my feelings as accurate and not overdramatic bpd symptoms."
1450,"Hi guys,

 I am totally new to this kind of thing. I am very private when it comes to my mental health and I would like to communicate with those who suffer with the same disorder. 
 
 I am a 28 year old female and have been struggle with anxiety, depression, eating disorders, mood swings and self harm for years now. I go to therapy every week but still have a hard time understanding my own thoughts and desperately just want to feel at peace with myself.

 I'm in a relationship and have a very hard time feeling content in it as I feel like I'm completely messed up. 

 My intentions are to hear from others on how they deal with these issues on a daily basis and how they feel and cope with everyday life.

Thanks guys!"
1451,"I waited 1.5 years for that initial appointment, 3 months for the next, only to be told I wouldn't be getting DBT because I admit to using drugs.

Drugs, like self harming, are a way of me coping with my symptoms.

How am I supposed to stop if I'm not even allowed therapy to give me other tools to deal with it?

Is this really fair?

What the hell do I do now, keep using until I OD?

There are good therapists on a crisis line you pay for I talk to sometimes. They're good. But I need face to face DBT to properly battle this illness. I feel so stuck."
1452,Can anyone talk to me please?
1453,Right now
1454,"And not in the kinda cool Whitesnake way.

Stumbled across an unread message from two years ago, from a former friend.

Backstory - She's somebody in my building, who I went from a casual friendly relationship to joined at the hip close after my dog died.   Close enough I decided to deal with some serious issues because she seemed to want more than friendship.   I had serious misgivings, based on her own issues and the way she talked about/treated her family and ex, but...

She love bombed me for most of a year.  Presents and dinners and movies and long walks and beach days, and how much she loved me and needed me in her life, and how she valued my loyalty.  But she also believed relationships worked like rom-coms, ""you have to fight for the girl"".   I don't play those games.  BPD means I can't, because of how I will react when manipulated.

Then it turned, overnight, into me always being stupid and weak and clingy and a horrible person. Lots of gaslighting. And, being me, knowing her past and issues, taking the abuse (like I always do...)until I had enough. Returned some things and her keys. Despite ""I never want to talk to you again"", that made her lose it. And then months later I found and returned more of her stuff (she was storing at my place). that had the police at my door for ""harassing and stalking"". The police heard my side, and went back to her to let her know you can't use the police for petty spite gestures, and that she was to leave me alone, as well.

And so, despite living in the same building, we never acknowledge each other.  But we both watch each other.  She stares at me when she drives past, I always check for her car before I go into the rest of the building, to decrease the odd of being face to face.  We so pointedly ignore each other, we might as well be staring at each other 24/7.

The experience wrecked me for months.   Badly enough nieghbours were concerned for me.  Therapy and new meds.
And I'm pretty past it, by my standards.

Until this morning I stumble across a hateful hurtful message from 2 years ago, and boom.  My head is filled with all of it again.  I'm angry and sad, I'm angry that I'm still sad about how it ended, and that there is no way to ever mend fences.  But I'm also angry that I can't get even.  Or even reply to some of her crap.  It bothers me when I hear through the grapevine (and everybody thinks I need to know) about her, and her not being happy, and I can't decide if I feel bad for her, or glad life is hard for her, too.

And now I'm mad at myself, and her, and life in general.  I want to blame somebody , and there's no body to blame, just history.  And I'm frustrated because the urge to self harm as a distraction is there, and I know I can't do that.

Mostly, I'm angry because we had a good friendship, or I thought we did, and now, both of us are alone and, evidently, unhappy, and I'm mad she wrecked it. I feel like I'll never get rid that resentment. I hate my issues won't just let me move on and forget. Fuck abandonment issues."
1455,"The person I love who is also an addict is back in town for Xmas. We had plans to meet 2 days ago but he has ghosted me for 4 days. I can’t cope wirh this and my automatic thoughts flood in that I’m worthless, ugly and worth leaving. I don’t understand how someone can do this. He won’t respond to anything. I feel the suicidal thoughts creeping in. I love him more than I’ve loved anything. Please please tell me how I can cope with this. I am not doing well. I haven’t eaten a meal since Sunday. I don’t know how to deal with this."
1456,"My other post got me thinking. Is the only person who can meet the emotional needs of someone with bpd... just another person with bpd? Believe me I understand right off the bat that putting two such chaotic disorders together could create disaster. But what if one of them was better off, or more stable? It certainly seems alluring to someone who craves and gives affection to be with someone else who also gives and craves affections. I’d love to know if there’s anyone who has tried yet. It seems like if they could both get a handle of their disorders, then theoretically they would have the most loving and compassionate relationship."
1457,"Struggling......again.

Really can't face another year.

Had enough."
1458,"I have been going back and forth with a new hobby that I've wanted to do. Liking it and feeling as though it's somehow going to make things better, change my life and then thinking that it's stupid and wondering what I'm doing. And tonight when I was about to start something I had to light a candle and the lighter wouldn't work and I lost it. Suddenly I feel like a complete joke. What an idiot. Whats the point in doing anything? Why am I alive? I hate myself and I want to hurt myself but I'm not allowed to. I have no-one to talk to. I feel so alone. And it's so destabilising when you don't know who you are. What do I like? Why don't I know that? I'm just a nobody."
1459,Does anyone REALLY care?
1460,"not going to let their behaviour bother me any more

they can sod off"
1461,I finally found the resolution I needed to end my relationship. It even ended up being an amicable break up on both sides. So much fear and anxiety finally put to rest. Phew! Now I can keep moving forward with my progress with no regrets.
1462,"Hello,
Hope everyone’s doing great.
I’m curious to know what you all think about having a relationship or wanting to start a relationship with a romantic partner even tho your relationship with your friends and family is bad.
I used to hear as a teenager that if you don’t love your parents or don’t have a good relationship with them, you will never be able to be loved or love someone in the future( romantic relationship)
I know it’s a wrong statement, however, it’s in my subconscious mind and every time I want to start a relationship I retreat and think to myself” if my relationship with my parents isn’t good how will this man love me “
Also, I love my friends but I love to distance myself from them all the time.
I feel like I’m a lone wolf or something, but I know relationships are crucial.
Anyway, do you think that anyone can maintain a good romantic relationship if he or she has horrible relationship with friends and family?"
1463,"In the few short days I have been on here, I have found that reading other people’s struggles and stepping outside my own problems to offer what little help I can to someone else, is really helping to keep my problems from getting too hard for me. Maybe it’s the perspective I’m gaining, or perhaps there’s something therapeutic about trying to help someone. I can’t say for sure it would work like that for everyone, but am sure at least some of you feel the same way. I don’t have any grand thoughts of changing someone’s life with just a few simple words, but if I can help in any way, it helps me as well, so I guess my logic is selfish."
1464,"I’m at a point in my life where I have it all figure out so to speak, but still not at the execution phase. I finally figured out after so long, what career I want to go into. Now I am set up to go to college and pursue my career. My problem is that I’m terribly easy to influence and manipulate in real life interactions. I hate it about myself and I recognize it, but it’s been very hard to control. I’m so quick to just mirror whoever I’m talking to, or “please” them. I am tired of this, it can often lead to me being walked all over or put into situation that compromise my beliefs or morals. Anyone else struggle with keeping other people’s influence from affecting you? It’s not that I have no identity of my own, at least now I do anyways, but some part of me is so compliant and compassionate that it’s borderline detrimental to my own health. I worry this bad.. “habit” or whatever, will lead to being unable to focus in school, when it is by and far my most important goal."
1465,"While everyone has different definitions for what defines a romantic relationship, my particular ideal is the one on one kind where two people come together and develop a life together. I don’t care about preference in gender. Diversity, to me, is something to be treasured. Ones genuine love for another should never be limited by gender. But I digress. Many people come to that point when they are ready to seek out their ideal partner. But sometimes they are too willing to accept anyone, even someone who will hurt them repeatedly. This is a tragedy in my opinion, for the one’s who seek out love must have a desire to give love as well, which isn’t always an easy thing. Some of them, especially those who have already had a challenging life, end up latching onto the first person that shows them affection, hoping desperately that they are the right one. They immediately invest so much more into the relationship than the person they found, sometimes making that person further attached to them despite possible incompatibilities. I’m not sure what you call these people, over eager? Naive? Definitely it is the nature of the inexperienced to hope for the best in situations, even if warned beforehand. In my experience as one of these people, I learned that you can only convince yourself to love someone so much before the truth becomes obvious. You can’t force yourself to conform your life to someone else’s when it is completely opposite to your wants and dream and goals. It just doesn’t work. You either end up a shell of a human with no spark anymore, or you thrash and spread the miserable feelings you have to the ones you want to love. Sometimes even after figuring this out, some people still find themselves stuck, unable to sever that bridge because of forcing themselves to love someone, even if there was never a spark. Further complications can make it worse. But ultimately this path leads to an unhappy life of ever compromising for your partner at the expense of your sanity. Every human is equally entitled to fight for a life they can be happy with. I hope one day soon I can find the strength to give my all to the right person after severing this painful, yet durable bridge."
1466,"I work daily on myself n retraining my frontal brain... My S.O.  does not.. He can he mean and emotionally controlling to the point of abuse.  
Its frustersting that all the info out there on BPD makes us the abuser.. Like no one cld possobly manipulate or use our disorder to gaslight and control us.  
BPD people shld be able to find info to help understand healthy ways to act...as well as healthy was they shld be treated. And how they can healthily handle leaving abuse relationships."
1467,"You know when you're breaking out of the illness, it seems super strange that you're trying suddenly not to sabotage yourself, you're trying to help yourself. The illness has you sabotaging yourself for a long time.
Suddenly you start wanting good things for yourself.
How do you push yourself to do this? It's a big change.
Starting to believe that you can make good things happen for you is a very big change of mindset. It has to be grasped both hands.
Anyone been through this?
Not just accepting life as it is, but pushing yourself further, to be the best you can be.
I still feel tired of life inside, as if I'm going to die any moment... which is kind of crazy, but I need to think logically. There's no reason I'm going to die. Why should I live half a life?"
1468,Happy Holidays to all and Merry Christmas to those who celebrate. What a wonderful time of the year for those who aren’t separated from their loved ones.
1469,"I already tried to explain this once and the previous post just disappeared so this is going to be summarized. I have bpd, I am at a point where I’m trying to do the right thing and take responsibility for myself and my actions and stop blaming stuff on my illness. 3 years ago however, I got involved with a mother of 3 for petty selfish reasons, got attached to her, but more importantly got attached to the children, to the point that I loved and treated them as if they were my own. I went to live with her in her state. Flash forward 2 years, there been good and bad, up and down, but ultimately she couldn’t handle me and I don’t blame her one bit, us bpd can be some right selfish bastards without even realizing it. She sent me to my home state under the false pretense that I was just visiting my family, then broke things off with me. Flash forward to modern day and we been tryin on and off to make things work long distance. Most of the on and off has been my fault because of using this past year to self reflect and improve myself and I wasn’t sure if I should get involved with her and the children again. Ultimately I am a slave to my feelings though and I love her, even if she is not capable of loving me the same amount, but even more than her, I love the children and feel responsible for them. They may not be my blood, but I cared for them for 2 years as the stay at home father. I grew to adore them each for their own special traits and personalities. But their mother and I just don’t match up well. I am extremely affectionate and caring, excessively so for some people, and I know it’s largely because of my bpd. I don’t expect her to be able to return the same level of affection I show her. But having my affection completely deflected or having a such a bland “ilu2” tossed at me is painful. I’m stuck between my feelings of wanting to take responsibility for the children and be the father they need, and my feelings of dread at being involved with someone that I love who has lost much of the love she once had for me. I’m not even 30 yet, should I just resign myself to a dead end marriage where I will likely end up cheating emotionally even if I never cheat physically? The children certainly don’t deserve the biological fathers they got stuck with and I adore them, but I worry that being bpd and trying to maintain a relationship just for them will be too hard for me. I may be more self-conscious of my actions and the affect my influence has on others, but I’m still a weak human being with a very controlling disorder. It doesn’t help that I am only now getting medication and therapy to help me since coming back to my home state. It took a long time to get medical set back up, so I am handicapped in that I still have another month before I can get the medication and therapy to help me maintain a sense of balance for my emotions. I hope those of you who took the time out of your day to help me can give me some advice or wisdom from your collective experiences. I appreciate you taking the time."
1470,"I already know the answer to this situation but my mind’s racing so I’m just gonna organize my thoughts 

like a few weeks ago bf said he wanted to take a break and I reluctantly agreed. He couldn’t be bothered to actually explain to me what that meant or even what I needed to change from our normal routine to constitute a break. He acted all sad about it and acted like he didn’t want to but had to.

I ended up feeling good about it! Viewing our relationship as more casual and less pressure was awesome. I was like hey this break is working. He was still inviting me over sometimes, I thought we were getting along a bit better, I was feeling at peace with whatever happened. But I felt like he was feeling better about me too. He acted like it.

well before I came home for Christmas, I told him I’d be seeing some old friends who are guys for brunch. He shut down pretty much immediately. And my stress came back. but he still came to my parents place with me a couple days ago. Now I’m home at parents alone. And before I left I wanted to go see him. I also wanted to be intimate (idk if I can talk sex outside of the sex forum?) because that was the one rule I made during the break but I felt like the break was over and we were going to just have a less intense/ less permanent relationship. And I felt like I shouldnt be “holding out” on him forever. I’d just adjusted how I saw the relationship and it was different but still comfortable.

that night was so weird. We got in a dumb argument in which he said I yelled/raised my voice (I absolutely did not) and that my behavior was at times extreme. It has been in the past but was so far from it this time. I didn’t want to be mad and wasn’t mad. I just wanted to say a sweet goodbye before I left! Then we go home and he’s like telling me how we don’t work and he’s all teary and I’m like dude I know you’ve told me eighty times.

I told him I thought the break had helped and he was like “what break? We never took one”. I’m like well yeah you kept wanting to see me and texting me and crap. I was trying to respect the break. It became obvious he wanted to break up. I told him I was okay with being a more casual relationship with less expectations. I told him we could be more like friends or whatever. Prior to this I had been like honestly I came over here to sleep with you before we left. But of course I thought that was way out of the question now and I apologized and offered to just hang out and watch tv or something more friend like.

THEN he initiated intimacy and it seemed super loving but right after he seemed super depressed again. I had to leave. Now we’ve only shared short, minimal texts.

I’m annoyed and I kinda want to break this off for good right now, over the phone. I’m super angry. he seems to like confusing me."
1471,"I am still so sad that my ex of 7.5 years left me two months ago.  I was so sure I knew him well and that he would miss me and come home by now.  He had his birthday yesterday and we have Christmas next week and it is just so hard to keep on going.  

It is freezing outside and I have to drag myself to the bus to get to work and then i feel mostly good at work because I can chat with customers throughout my shift and be distracted from my own thoughts. But when I am home, I just wish so much that my ex would call or drop by or anything.  

Holding onto this hope of his returning has not been good for me - it feels like he left me again because I was so sure after time apart he would realize that we were a great couple for the first 7 years and yes I have been sick and unemployed, but I have been fighting so hard to get better.  Why won't he see this?"
1472,"Im sorry but sometimes it feels nice to laugh at my situation and use humor to ease the pain. I just wanted to share this meme I think we can all relate to when we feel we are watching our lives destruct right in front of us.

I love baby Yoda LOL"
1473,midnight must always defer to authority :respect:
1474,"Growing up in childhood I was always a happy kid with many friends and a supporting caring family. My parents always did there best for me, and these where my best years of my life.. I was care free and loved wrestling and fighting movies. I always dreamed one day I'd be a wrestler or kung fu expert. Fast forward to now, I'm 38 years old and living a life of isolation struggling to even leave the house most days.

Around age of 10-12 my dad had been taken into a mental hospital after suicide attempts. Being so young I never understood what was happening, as the problem was masked and hidden by my family. One example I remember clearly was one day out playing in the street with my friends I came in to get a drink, and my dad was standing there in the kitchen. Upon seeing me standing there he dropped a handful of tablets on the floor, grabbed me in a tight hug and started crying.. He was about to overdose, and with me coming in at that moment made him hesitate and break down. Other times my mum would get a phone call saying my dad was lying on the road wiped out on tablets. Many times the ambulance was called because he overdosed at our home. He also used to self harm. He was in hospital once for 9 months not allowed to leave. This kept up until his death in 2008 by silent heart attack in his sleep. I'm not sure how much impact this had on me, but I do remember it was a very tough time.

By high school around age 15 I started to become more withdrawn, skipping school and preferring to hang out in a wooded area as facing people was making me feel very anxious and paranoid. By early 20s a psychiatrist I had been seeing diagnosed me with social phobia. As the years went by my friends became less until eventually none. My life consisted of taking my medication, sitting in my flat with the curtains closed feeling desperate for company, yet could not maintain any sort of relationship or friendship to make it possible. Any effort to put myself out there ended in panic attacks and days of frustration and shame followed. My mum done a lot to help me by taking me places, making sure I had food and clean home. After my mums health started going bad my brother took over and helped out, but he never understood and would say to me things like - wise up, you need to get a grip, you're starting to do my head in, till eventually the help became less and less. I feel totally abandoned and misunderstood, feel like I don't exist anymore.

Tried CBT and therapies, been on a ton of different meds. The meds can take the edge off and make me feel a bit empty in my mind and feelings, but this isn't gonna give me a social life or my happiness back! I'm on off suicidal in my thoughts and have already tried to take my life, but that was a few times years ago.. I don't want to die, yet I feel sometimes death is my only cure. I feel abandoned by my love ones and that no one gives a toss about me. My phone can sometimes go months without even a text message. This diagnosis of social phobia I feel is wrong.. everything I read online points to BPD. I don't just have trouble being social, I have extreme highs and lows, feelings of people always thinking bad about me, paranoid, crying one minute and laughing the next.. it's become manic. The doctors don't listen and just keep swapping meds and saying see how you get on over the next 3 months! 3 months feels like 3 years in my condition. The help out there in my area is terrible..

So to sum it up - I'm 38 living in isolation with no friends and some pretty bad mental problems. I feel abandoned by my family and feel like no one understands what I'm going through.. I do get benefits to help me, but I'd rather have my life back and be out working and being social. 20 odd years now has passed and I can't see me becoming better. It's a very sad existence. This Christmas will be like the past, just another day spent alone like any other day. I'm beginning to understand my dad more when thinking back,because if I have what he had going on, It's understandable that he didn't want to be here anymore."
1475,"of being left alone
I would do anything to avoid it

would hurt myself but not in a manipulative way ,in a I beg you please please don't leave me alone or I will die

1476,"So there’s this girl, wouldn’t really know how to describe the relationship (sort of perpetually on the edge of becoming romantic) either way she’s prob my closest friend and a wonderful person. She suffers from bpd. The other night we were texting I was dealing with some painful issues in my life and I called her to hear a friendly voice. Rejected after two rings, I was mystified, texted her a ?  Ten mins later and after an hour (I regret this) I was like “if you don’t care fine good night” and two secs later got a flood of angry cruel vicious messages, had a text fight for few mins then it stopped. I sent one the next morning saying I didn’t deserve that, especially not when she knew I was hurting, that I was sorry if something I said hurt her but if she wanted to know me I needed to know this wasn’t who she was. Her response was blocking me; this was 2 days ago.
     What do I do? I know this outburst isn’t her or I would’ve cut off ties long ago (I know about the splitting thing) and I want to preserve our friendship. I could message her thru a friend but i want her to come to me and not be a punching bag, plus she had a stalker ex bf ways back and I don’t want to trigger anything. I don’t even know why she blocked me she knows I’m not gonna harass her or anything. Is this temporary or does she hate me now? I’m confused any advice could help thanks"

1478,"Hi haven't posted for ages but been hit by depression now I'm off work and don't have distraction.

Actually I get really depressed on my days off...
I think I have high functioning depression as as long as at work, I am distracted by others or having to complete a task, and I just ignore the feeling inside. I push it down. But when I get days off it all comes out.
I am having a pretty shit day. I can't even find energy to shower or brush teeth. I have been thinking about showering all day, yet done nothing. I come back to the idea of how nice it would be to slip away gently (suicide) then I wouldn't have to face the rest of life ahead of me. I really feel like it is my time to end now, if it wasn't for my brother I would do it. But unfortunately I know that would be very damaging for him, and he already has had a lot to deal with, so I feel I am not able to do that to him. It would be way too selfish of me. Instead I paint a picture to him and to the rest of the world like I am managing just fine.
I can't stop thinking about death. About how pointless life and love are.
I feel hopeless about relationships, the mere idea of intimacy disgusts me, even though I do want love and affection, in my heart it could never feel real again. I feel hopeless about career progression as it always seems no matter how hard I work, it's never good enough for the people 'above'. Experience has taught me people judge me and I don't know how to be the person that 'fits' in society.
I can't find the energy to strive to go out there and find better opportunities, and fight for myself, because I am tired. I am tired and energy-less.
I can't find the energy or motivation to do anything for myself. I think about how I don't know who I am. Or about how if I showed my real self to any one else they would reject and abandon me.
I can't stop thinking about how in maybe 70 years time, if not earlier, I will die anyway, and all of this stretch of life before it feels pointless. Sure, I go to work, I manage, I survive, I have my own place, but none of it means anything. I have no idea how to go from wanting to die to wanting to live. I have always pretty much wanted to die so I don't know how to think otherwise. The easiest thing for me is to be distracted by being around others, such as when at work, sometimes even watching tv to escape, but then when I am alone, with myself, I have to face my real self.
I'm also worried about my weight as I desperately want to be skinnier but even then I would still hate myself. Plus if I don't eat I feel the cold more and maybe would not feel well. I try not to eat but if I do eat I usually eat crap because I hate healthy food and have no idea how to cook it.
I feel alone and I'm tired of failing friendships from unreliable people. Today for example I heard from an old 'friend' who finally remembered me (must be desperate) and said sorry she has been terrible about keeping in touch and she has had a lot on her plate. Yet I know for a fact she makes an effort to see and talk to others, hang out with them and even go on holiday with them. Yet with me, it takes her more than half a year to even send me a message. My other 'friends' also ignore me. I have no one to hang out with and quite frankly I don't really want to anymore. I am tired of these flakey unreliable people, to whom I give too much, and from whom I receive nothing.
Happiness is a very distant feeling, I can't remember it much, everything feels dead inside. I feel pain in my heart and have lost hope in pretty much everything. No enjoyment no pleasure. My life has become my work and that's the only way I survive. Deep down the real me is suffering. I don't even have a good job, just a minimum wage job that is way below what was expected from me at school, in that sense I'm a disappointment... but I can't even be bothered to strive for more, because the depression is just destroying me.

I'm basically a non- person, kept alive by my obligation to someone else. I'd love to not have to go through all this pain I feel every day and ignore."
1479,"Today I had an appointment with my GP doctor to follow up on my anti-depressant prescription. I was left waiting over 10 minutes after my appointment was scheduled so she was late and at first I was worried but then I became paranoid that she just didn't want to see me or something was wrong. A few days ago my CBT therapist was also late to start the session by 15 minutes and I'm starting to feel like they're in talks with each other and testing me by both agreeing to be late to see how I react. It feels as though they're trying to stop seeing me because I'm a drain and they're sick of me and don't want to see me anymore. I thought the CBT was going ok and we were kinda going in one direction, she gave me worksheets on emotional dysregulation and anger which I've been reading but clearly there's no point when she doesn't actually care. Sorry for the rant, I just had to vent because I kept it all in and I've been overthinking all afternoon."

1482,"Help!

I've had a really traumatic appointment with the doctor at my local metal health team. I've been self harming and am suicidal. She said I have BPD traits but I know I have full BPD and need this diagnosing as this is why I'm not getting better. She was just going to discharge me saying she didn't need to see me again and to contact a free service that runs courses on depression. To carry on with my sertraline and see my GP in a couple of weeks. I was totally honest with her and said I'm getting weak and don't think I'll make it two weeks. I told her I wanted to end my life. She offered me tissues and then sent me on my way. I was mortified. I rung my Mum who came up immediately and had a go at the doctor for letting me leave when I had harmed myself and told her I wanted to end my life and she did nothing, just discharged me. 

Two mental health nurses pulled me and my mum to a room to talk to us and they managed to get the doctor to prescribe diazepam for when I'm having a severe episode. They are having a meeting to discuss me on Tuesday. I know I can ring them in crisis, have all the numbers etc and a crisis plan. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to get a diagnosis. Even if it's private. It's a mind field and I can't carry on much longer.

I booke to see my GP today and I told her what happened and that I needed urgent help she said the following statements which killed me: ""the system doesn't work like that"" so what am I supposed to do? Kill myself?! ""Can you not see it from.the doctors point of view"" no! I am incredibly unstable and have severe mental health issues. To ask me to see other people's views when I'm in a state like that is absolutely ridiculous, I'm sick. And then yet again I said okay well I guess it's over, again, told her I was suicidal and she let me get up and leave my appointment in tears. 

I feel completely failed by so many professionals and it's making me worse. 

I'm hoping the nurses stand up for me in the meeting and something gets done but if not then I don't know where to turn!

The mental health nurses were really lovely and went above and beyond and one said to me she definitely thought I had BPD and told me to self diagnose for now so that I can find resources directly for BPD to help myself. 

I'm furious that 2 medical professionals let me leave when I told them I was going to end my life and said that there's nothing they can do for me. 

Help, please 😭"
1483,"After a long and tumultuous journey with the Canadian mental health care system, I was satisfied with the diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features and anxiety. I had it handled, was seeing a psychologist and was gonna follow up with a psychiatrist on my medication. But then we moved, the psychologist went on maternity leave, and I cancelled the appointment with the psychiatrist (was on vacation with my boyfriend) and decided to stop taking my meds as I didnt like the side effects and my psychologist said I could try fighting it without them. 

It was going pretty well. Then, cue the car accident two days ago. It was 110% an accident, not a suicide attempt or anything, I fucked up thinking there was a left turn signal when there wasn't. Thankfully nobody was hurt except me. I was in the hospital today to check up on my bruised sternum and figured I'd go see a psychiatrist about my guilt and suicidal ideation. 

This guy was great, we talked about everything I had been through, he did some DBT on me, and then proposed that my diagnosis was wrong. I was in disbelief. Then he pulls out the book and says ""now its not a tattoo and you might not meet all the criteria, but why dont you read this."" Sure enough it was DBT. 

I'm a 20 year old female, I've been in a stable loving relationship with my boyfriend since I was 16 (we have our ups and downs but I wouldn't call it unstable by any means)  I have a small group of close friends that I've known ranging from 4 to 11 years. I don't and have never self-harmed. I'm going back to school in September to finish my university degree, I don't abuse drugs or alcohol (ive never drank more than 3 shots at a time as I'm a lightweight, when I sensed a codependency brewing i cut it all off completely). 

Here's why I could have it: I do spend quite  a lot of my money (on presents for other people) and have poor budgeting skills. Additionally, I would keep pushing myself to procrastinate further and further, convinced the university would find out I wasnt actually smart (even though I got straight-As) Although I'm a pretty outgoing person, I get irritated by small inconveniences, road rage, and certain types of people get on my nerves a lot. I have poor self-image, have been self conscious my whole life and constantly care what other people think of me. I never want to disappoint anyone and hold myself to ridiculously high standards. I don't react well to change or instability (we just moved from a house we've lived at since I was 7, I also moved away for uni and neither went over very well). I also do have short-lived psychotic beliefs. 

I know the psychiatrist is a mental health professional and that everyone experiences things differently, but I'm struggling with coming to terms with the idea that I have BPD. Maybe its the stigma I have attached to it?"

1485,"Hi,

I was diagnosed two weeks ago and have never posted on a support forum but here goes....

Thank you for being here. I never realized there are so many others with the same problems I have. I have been on and off with a guy I met 6 years ago. The kindest man I know, but also quite busy and spreads himself thin among his friends. 

Long story short, I have done (broken up with) and said (don't ever text me again) extremely hurtful things, when really I was just really hurt and felt abandoned when he needed space. Now, he finally tells me he can't handle it anymore. And I am devastated. Was admitted to crisis unit this morning and really just wanted to die. And now he says, he'll be here as my friend but we can't be anything more. I feel like I can't go on. I've always needed that Favorite Person and him leaving makes me feel like I can't go on. 

Any advice for me? Or similar experiences? I just really need any kind of support or connection right now. Thank you."
1486,"A few things have happened over the last week that have made me feel on edge, suspicious of everyone and everything and most of all, empty. Constant emptiness. When I was I teenager I did self harm  but since then I haven't (I'm currently 26). Now, I normally binge eat or engage in a form of self harm to feel something physical and distract me from everything else, but the feeling of nothingness and emptiness has been so heavy the last few days that I did something I've never done before.  At first it stung and hurt but I felt adrenaline instantly so I kept doing it. Not out of pain, repulsion or shock but out of excitement. I'm sick of feeling emotionally empty, I feel like I'm not even a person. Now it's like I'm down the rabbit hole and I don't know what's going happen which excites me."
1487,Are there any medications out there that really help BPD without weight gain?
1488,I was prescribed Mirtazapine by my GP. We talked at length about BPD and he thinks it will help me until at least I see the psych. I am wondering what any of your general experiences are with it but I am mostly worried about weight gain. I have a history of anorexia and bulimia and general obsession about weight. My Dr. says this may cause weight gain which is OK because my BMI is currently underweight. This is not because of eating disorders but because of my general anxiety and depression. I do not mind gaining 5 pounds but if I gain over that I am so worried I will spiral back into my eating disorder coping mechanisms... ANY insight would be so appreciated thanks guys xoxoxoxo

1490,"Hello everyone, this is my first post so bare with me :)

I have BPD, PTSD, depression and anxiety. 

Me and my partner of 3 years split up 8 weeks ago, we lived and worked together and had a cat and a dog. Things had started going bad a few weeks earlier and he kept saying he didn't want to split up and that he loved me so we didn't split up and I was desperately trying to keep it going, I was trying everything whilst feeling like I was walking on egg shells not knowing what to do or say and constantly apologising. 
Things came to a head on the 7th October, we got back from work and hadn't spoken all day, we were supposed to be going to a concert the day after. He said he couldn't do it anymore, took some stuff and our dog and left. I was in utter shock and was hysterical, wailing and screaming. I begged and begged him to come home. The next few days are hazy, but I wanted to die, I wasn't eating, drinking or sleeping. I ended up being admitted into a crisis house for a week where I managed to calm myself down and start eating. 
I relied on him for everything, including all my emotional and physical support, I never went anywhere without him. 
In the days I was there, my ex took his things from our house and my parents packed up my things and moved me back to their home. Its a hell of a lot of change in one go and I really struggle with change, my ex, house, pets and life as I knew it have gone. We still work together which im struggling with.  
I always asked him if he'd ever leave me and he promised he never would; now he has and its my worst nightmare. 

Fast forward to 4 weeks ago and I decided to get onto some dating apps. In hindsight this was a big mistake and was more because im feeling so alone and missing a relationship that I craved someone. I spoke to a few people and went on a date with 2 of them. The second one I met had told me he'd split from his ex 8 weeks ago, our stories were eerily similar and we got on so well. We went on our first date last Sunday and this weekend just gone I travelled down to his to stay and spend some time with him. It went so well, he told me he loved me, we discussed me moving in with him in the future and the possibility of kids and marriage. I knew this wasn't right, having only met twice, but I get so attached to people that I truly believed he was the one. 
I left his Monday morning to go to work, by Monday evening he told me he couldn't stop thinking about his ex and couldn't see me again. I felt the familiar sense of grief and sickness. He blocked me on everything so I cant even talk to him. 
I know its crazy because we only met twice and I obviously didn't really know him but I saw my future with this person, I believed all the stuff he said to me and truly believed he wanted me. I feel used and broken, I haven't slept or eaten since Sunday and im so depressed and embarrassed that ive believed this yet again. My parents are disappointed in me that ive done this again, and they are telling me I am effecting them and my sister with my mood, they gave me advice and I didn't listen and now I feel like im having to pretend im okay and im really not. 
I feel so trapped and alone and im so suicidal. I just want my old life back with my old support. I feel so alone and I don't know what to do with myself. 

I really would love to hear from anyone who's been through something similar so I don't feel so alone and know im not going crazy. Im running out of energy and drive to keep going."

1493,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder in addition to other mental health issues. Oftentimes I can see the other personality. She looks like a dark person with really crazy looking eyes. Kind of like she'll hurt you. She is extremely busy, rebellious and threatens me and others quite often. She takes over my body at any given time making people say I'm crazy or possessed. It's often times where I try to understand who what when and where something happened because there will be blank spots in my memory for certain times of the day. Does anybody have any suggestions on how I can bring harmony to this situation?"
1494,"After 5 months and 28 interviews, i finally got a job, but unfortunately it is only less than 20 hours a week.  I love the job working as a grocery cashier because i am paid to chat with people all day.  I just wish I could support myself on the job, but luckily i have savings for now to live on too. 

I was going to get two roommates in the new year to help out with the bills living in my house after my ex left me two months ago, but my landlord told me last week that i have to move out by March because he is knocking the house down, so that kind of sucks. 

I am hoping i can get into this building nearby where the apartments are not too expensive and still be in the neighbourhood i know and love.  I need it nearby to be near the buses for work too because i only have a 20 minute bus ride to work. 

I feel so freaked out at times - losing my fiance after 7.5 years of being together where he ghosted me after leaving for a family trip while i was in the emergency room.  He just packed up a couple garbage bags of belongings and disappeared into the night. 

Then I have a new job, but it is not enough to support myself, so i will have to continue with my disability application which is complicated because I used to fully support myself so they want me to apply for a pension disability first which can take 6 months and then another 6 months for the darn regularly disability which i want. 

So having had the worst year ever with two suicide attempts and 3 hospitalizations, I am having a hard time adjusting to everything.  My kids moved out in January so i have an empty nest, my ex left after we were supposed to get married last May so that was a shock, I lost two jobs i could not do because I was just too sick with anxiety and depression at the time and now I am losing my home. 

I am so hoping that the new year will bring some good changes and I can finally feel okay again.  I really thought my ex would not be able to live without me and really thought he would be home by now because his birthday is tomorrow and Christmas is almost here and he has no furniture or dishes or anything.  I thought he would at least call to get some possessions because I won't need all of the furniture and other stuff we have in this house. 

I really need some encouraging words because I have to fight feelings every single day to just take something and end things.  I am scared of all of the changes and just wish my ex would come home now that i am working and hoped to have a chance to try things again.  

I guess by the new year it will finally sink in that he has left for good and I have to be single while i get my life back."
1495,"Hi everyone, i'm new here and 3 months ago my new GP told me she suspects I have BPD.

After lots of research and reflection i’m inclined to agree. I’ve had MH issues for as long as I can remember, but I've never felt like the general diagnosis of anxiety/depression ever really fit. I hadn't considered BPD as I didn't really understand the criteria. By some stroke of pure dumb luck this new GP actually has 15 years of experience treating BPD, and suggested I straight switch from citalopram (taken for 8 years) to mirtazapine. 

Unfortunately I had a really bad reaction, which i'm now concerned was citalopram withdrawal and could have been avoided. I had a crisis like nothing i've experienced in years and became suicidal, so had an emergency appointment (which took 3 days) and switched to venlafaxine. This has helped amazingly with my mood, but the physical side effects are pretty horrendous. 

Now this new GP seems to backtracked, referring to my problem as 'depression' at my last appointment, and hasn't followed up her request for info on local services for BPD yet. She said the side effects would wear off in 4 or so weeks, but it's been 8 and they're actually getting worse. She cancelled on me today, but I managed to see a different doctor for more medication at least. Now i've just found out she probably won't be opening appointments very often in the future, maybe 1 day a month, and those appointments are ring on the day only and probably while i'm at work.

Honestly, I don't expect miracles. I've never experienced a decent level of care for MH (or physical health tbh) in 15 years of trying, but I really have no idea where to go from here. I stupidly got my hopes up that things might be different this time around, but now I can't even seem to get a repeat prescription without an appointment every month. I've researched local services myself and there is basically nothing except inpatient care for very severe cases. I've bought workbooks and been trying to learn DBT on my own but it's brought up a lot of stuff i'm struggling to deal with.

I guess I’m feeling a little lost, so I hope someone can share some advice about what I could do next? What's the normal procedure for things like this? I haven’t exactly been given a formal diagnosis, and I feel like i've just been thrown in at the deep end in the hopes i'll learn to tread water on my own.

Thank you for taking the time to read this."
1496,"I’m too scared to come home and face the empty feeling
I hate the empty feeling with all my shell

It digs a hole every time I am left with it
I don’t know how to continue life without a distraction 
The terrible feeling won’t go no matter how hard I push and shove it away
It’s like I’m drowning again
I wish I could breathe
I wish I could pull myself away from me
You have that choice
I’m not equipped with that ability
I’ll kick and scream to my grave
Until I rest, I can’t feel peace.

1497,"Hi all!

I am new to the group but was diagnosed with BPD in 2014 and I was hoping I could get some advice/tips as I can’t talk to my friends about this. My last relationship when I was first diagnosed ended badly due to my extremely jealous and controlling behaviour and I have currently been with my (on/off) partner for three years.
I was diagnosed with breast cancer June this year and he has been incredible. All through my insecurity of losing my hair, weight gain he’s supported me throughout. However, as I have been going through treatment and had to stop working, I have noticed myself becoming that incredibly erratic, nasty person I used to be. 
My partner and I don’t live together and we live about 2 hours apart. I’m not well enough to keep commuting to see him and he can’t drive so we see each other about once a month. Because of this, I HATE it when he sees his friends (and he doesn’t have many so it’s only once a month he sees them) and whenever he’s out, I’m really difficult and nasty. He’s also recently joined Instagram and my paranoia has just hit the roof where I keep obsessively checking if he’s online, who he follows, what his activity is like on there.  I know it sounds horrible but he’s currently out of work (not to choice, he’s a freelancer) and part of me is secretly pleased that he isn’t working so he doesn’t meet new people. He’s also currently learning to drive and has his driving test next week and it terrifies me that he’ll pass as I’m worried he’ll gain some sort of independence and leave me. I know all of this behaviour is extremely unhealthy and toxic, I really wish I wasn’t like this/think this way. Is anyone else like this? How do you manage your emotions? He tells me he feels like he has to walk on egg shells around me in case I start an argument and I’d really like to get it right this time and work on myself before he  has enough and leaves me. I used to see a therapist and do DBT but I had to stop as it was getting too expensive. 

Thanks"
1498,When I am in a therapy appointment it takes me so long to eventually open up. It's like it gets to the last 15-20 minutes and then I finally get to the stuff I should have been talking about at the very start. Does anyone else struggle with this? I really get annoyed at myself when I leave an appointment knowing i wasted a lot of time.
1499,"I can't get out of this cloud of depression, I have no motivation, I have things I could be doing but I cant be bothered. I don't want to be alone but I dont want company. I have a constant pit in my stomach. There are so many unanswered questions. So much going on that I'm even starting to doubt myself .... I'm so confused and hurt. I miss my children so badly. I can't leave the house for seeing people with their children and the jealousy kills me. I have no purpose or meaning to my life. Everything is pointless. I don't know how to get over this. I want to hurt myself so bad, just to know I'm still here, to feel SOMETHING. I hate myself. I don't want to be here. I have no reason to be here. My baby doesn't even know I'm his mam anymore. My oldest son is suffering so much and I canr help him.... I'm useless. Loveless. I can't enjoy anything anymore. I cant even be bothered to hoover my house. I have a lovely little puppy and he is sad too and it's my fault. I don't deserve him either. I'm in court in Feb to fight for my children. If it is ordered they can't come home what next? I've waited all this time for nothing? I've actively sought therapy and support to get better and understand myself but what's the point if it doesn't help? My life is nothing without my boys. I want to run away. I want to stay. I want someone with me but I want to be alone.... really all I want is my boys and my life can be normal again. I've been punished enough. I need it to end"
1500,"Hello, I am wondering if I have borderline personality disorder. I have taken numerous screening tests online but I need peace of mind by getting an answer from a real professional. I am a 19 year old female with a history of anorexia, self-injurious behavior (harming myself when upset), major depression, PTSD, and rage. I have very unstable relationships and fear abandonment, this usually caused me to isolate those in my life first before they can hurt me. I fear getting close to people and I get overwhelmed when people want to get close to me and push them away. I as well feel a bottomless emptiness in my heart and I have bouts of crying and rage. Thank you."

1502,It’s like pretty sure not going to last. We’re “on a break”. We love each other but we always argue about dumb things and I don’t know why. It’s easier to just accept that we’re not a good fit and it’s a relief to stop fighting myself over it. But I can’t tell my parents. My mom was just asking about bf and I got super anxious. I felt like I was lying to her or something. I just want to rip off the bandaid for them but for myself I don’t want to break it off that way. I’m okay letting it fizzle out so we can still chat sometimes. It’s just weird to me that I feel worse for them than me in this situation.
1503,"I am in a serious relationship right now with a girl I love very much. She's extremely supportive and sweet. Despite the constant reassurance, I'm always insecure about myself and her love for me. I feel as if I'm annoying her with the need for reassurance and that she will quickly grow tired of me. What are ways I can raise my confidence to feel more secure in her love for me and to be independent?"
1504,"People often do things that hurt me. I don't think I'm allowed to say anything because it all comes back to it being my fault for getting upset. Either upset in the first place or upset to the extend that I do. Small things often ""trigger"" suicidal thoughts. I don't become suicidal because of what some one did. It's more that I'm always feeling like that and it's just harder to shove in the closet when someone does something that hurts me. But no one would believe me if I tried to explain that. So I'm just not allowed to tell people that they hurt me."
1505,"PM conversation reminded me of this:

Back when I had a skype account, i had a random guy friending me on there and he kept asking me all sorts of creepy pervy questions

i could not get rid of him until i closed my skype account completely

I'm 38. I was just recently diagnosed with BPD. Of course my behaviors have been with me all my life, but to finally have the diagnosis brought hope.

My marriage of 13 years has, in the best of times, been very volatile. I love my wife dearly. I love my daughter dearly. But I never thought my wife loved me. I kept doing things seeking affirmation of her love, and eventually, it has broke us.

I get angry very easily, and my wife gets the brunt of it. I get angry and I shut down, usually for days. I turn off the wifi, the TV, and other stupid things to try to catch her attention. She doesn't respond and I get more upset and feel more alone, more unloved.

This past year has been really bad. If I don't do something stupid for a week its considered a success. My brave wife stood by me, as best as she could, all the while her own identity being crushed by my needs, and I couldn't, or maybe didn't want, to see that.

She threatened divorce before. It blew over. I told her I'm going to get re-serious about getting help, and I was sincere.

I changed up medication and started going to counseling twice a week. It didn't work quick enough. Things were good for about 5 weeks, and then the bottom dropped out. I'm back to my same behaviors.

She threatened separation/divorce again and I panicked. I harmed myself. I tossed a glass in a sink to gain her attention. I tried to commit suicide. I wanted the pain to go away and at the very least be replaced by physical discomfort.

She placed a restraining order on me because she was fearful that I could hurt her or our child. While I've never done this, my world is ending and I was out of control. I deserved to be kicked out.

I think about ending everything multiple times a day. I know she's done. I'm willing to do anything, and have started to try to take care of myself, but do I truly feel like I need to place myself #1? No. I just want my wife to hold me again.

The moral of the story? If you have BPD and you do not want to lose your loved ones, do not wait until its too late. Go to counseling now. See if a medication may help. Do not take anything for granted and engage. Counseling works, but only as much as you put into it. I've finally started to believe. But now its too late.

If you love someone who has BPD. Stop catering to them. We are our own people who make our own decisions. There's nothing wrong with being supportive, especially if he/she is actively trying to help themselves, but you need to take care of yourself. Do not wait until you're so miserable that the only solution is getting out.

Most importantly, you two TALK TO EACH OTHER. To the BPD: stop feeling ashamed and start communicating. To the Non-BPD: Tell your partner how you're feeling.

If I can make it through, I know I will get better. I just don't know if I can make it that far, but one day at a time. Minute by minute when I have to."
1507,"and now I feel so awful
im such a nasty person
I got all confused and freaked out
my emotions have been haywire all day because of maddie
now I feel like I need to hurt myself to make up for being a bitch"
1508,"when I get stressed part of me goes somewhere else for protection ,my mind I mean
its been that way since mummy and dad when I was little

people don't notice because most of me stays

I hurt myself because I don't know how to explain how I feel"
1509,"So mad, so sad. Can’t even explain just livid. For some reason still trying to give a certain someone 85 extra chances to stop being completely oblivious to my needs. He still tries to make it like I’m the difficult one. I’m just so close to permanently closing the door on him."
1510,"I have been self harming since I was 17, that was 17 years ago so... I have tried at least 20 different medications with my psychiatrist, and a lot of therapy but recently I have found that the one I need (Dialectic or Conductual), have never been offered to me. I am normally ok, when I have a couple, or when enough time has gone by to ""erase"" their memory of that pain from my head.

So someone recently broke up with me and obviously I went to a deep deep dark hole. She broke up with me and I remember walking like a robot to my car (to get home) praying (I am an atheist, but still praying... haha) that there was something in my car to harm myself, I got to my car and there was nothing, so I drove as a zombie, and then like 5 mins out I remember that I always carry an implement in my name badge from where I work along with keys (not to hurt my self but because of where I work they come in handy cutting things) so I grabbed it and I (while driving) screamed at the top of my lungs and harmed myself, and I was in full panic mode so I called my dad (I live alone) and told him as best I could super crying in tears to please come over to my house (I was probably 3 min away from my house when I called him) cause I was feeling super suicidal. He came over, then my dad came upstairs and said stop it. I took my pills and I went to sleep.

Point being is that Im still harming, I reached out to a psychologist and have an apt on Monday but, it didn't give me a good sense of her (she acknowledges that she knows Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) because she ... while I told her that I am an atheist appoint meeting her said ""I know you don't believe but, please repeat after me, ""Jesus, I know you are the true and one savior.... etc etc"" but I asked he in the end if I were to go in Monday can we not do any god stuff and if she would be ok to treat me and she said yes.

Right know Im surviving by taking meds to sleep most of the time, not eating and trying to search ways to maybe be ok, I even reasearched Neurotics Anonimous and they have a session tomorrow at 7.30 pm... so maybe go to that? Meds don't work, therapy doesn't work, I am super suicidal, well the thoughts are there, I probably wouldn't do it because of my mom but they are there... all the time. My sister suggested this forum so this is what I am trying, Im trying everything not to lose my life.

Thanks for reading me out."
1511,I should be dead
1512,"The past two days I just feel numb and empty. I'm not giving as much of myself to others as I normally would. On the one hand I feel guilty for that, on the other I think tough luck I've nothing left to give. It's like I'm running on automatic pilot and just doing what folks expect of me but with no feeling.

I hate feeling like this. I'd rather feel angry, sad, anything.

Any advice please? 

Love and Hugs to all."
1513,"my therapist believes I have BPD, although never formally diagnosed. my main issue is instability in relationships and splitting. Any advice on how to stay out of the red zone? lately i've been isolating and avoiding any new relationships and friendships to control my temper. obviously this isn't super effective anymore. thank you in advance"
1514,"Hi I suffer from high anxiety, severe mood swings, anger, depression, insomnia and sadness constantly. I am 63 and getting worse as I get older. I freeze my husband out, have lost friends and generally hate living. I am a hairdresser by trade and worn out. I'm just a bundle of fun. Haha If you met me you would think I was a happy, confident woman leading a fabulous life but inside I am ugly.I come from a family with multiple suicides, addictions and mental illnesses. I am just going the motions so looking for support. My GP just tells me to exercise etc but I can barely get out of bed to go to work. I have nothing in me. My husband is totally bewildered and doesn't understand my condition. I have never been officially diagnosed with anything but I know enough about all the mental health conditions to have an idea where I am. I don't really know why I am posting just, to vent I think. I have recently been diagnosed with a brain aneurysm as well. Woe is me lol. I find reading others stories helpful as I know I'm not alone."
1515,"and I will die just die
it wont be much longer until he realises he can do much better thab me
I cant sleep :low:"
1516,"sick and headachey and warm and tired
please hug me if you have time x"
1517,"Hey all! I posted this on the mental health experience forum and somebody commented saying they relate a lot to what I listed and they were diagnosed with bpd and ptsd. I'm 26 and I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I'm back in CBT for a second time this year and wanted to note my symptoms and behaviour for you all to see if you guys think there could be a potential diagnosis.

- Depression
- Feeling empty
- Feeling like I'm not even a person. I feel like a wall and I'll listen to other peoples thoughts and opinions and try to wallpaper them on to myself and make them my own to use them and seem normal, but because they're not my own feelings and opinions the wallpaper eventually falls off and I'm left trying to pick up the pieces and make myself seem like a person all over again 
- Paranoia, specially with people I'm around a lot like work colleagues. I'll be convinced they're talking about me and conspiring against me to embarrass or hurt me
- Isolating myself when the paranoia kicks in and taking time away from everything and everyone
- Feeling like I'm on autopilot. Almost as though I'm there but I'm not. Like my body is but my head isn't
- Binge eating
- Compulsive skin picking
- I'll test people I'm close to, to see if they really care about me. I'll say or do something and if they say or react in a way I want them to it puts me at ease and shows they care.
- I also push people away when I know they've done something wrong or they've done something that I wouldn't do to them. It makes me relationships, whether it be a friend, family member or romatic really up and down and temperamental.
- I do have a history with self harm in different forms at different ages.
- I purposefully took too many pills with alcohol on two different occasions when I had an arguments with people I was very close to because they made me feel rejected in one situation and paranoid in the other and because those feelings were so strong, in that moment I didn't want to feel anything.

That about sums up most of it. If you guys could share your thoughts on this and if any of you have experienced things like this it'd be a relief to know."
1518,"I posted in the people forum too so sorry to be redundant but I just need some advice I guess. My bf and I are (I think?) taking a break for a little while. I keep telling myself this is good because we argue too much. But I don’t want to take a break. He wants to. He’s gone for the weekend for work also. I feel really sad and also scared because it definitely hasn’t hit me yet. Last night we were still cuddling and kissing. I feel like we will still see each other and be affectionate. The only “rules” I made were no sex and no sleeping over. Also said he couldn’t come home to my parents place with me but then I took that one back. See, I’m nice right? lol. I don’t know how to feel about this. Part of me is very excited to just leave this and meet someone new who will want what I want and not make me guess whether they’re trying to be rude or not. The other part ADORES bf and is desperate to fight for him. Which part is right? What do I do?"
1519,"hello, so this is my first post on here and it feels quite odd (sorry for the weird title by the way, I had no other way to put it). I was diagnosed with borderline almost 3 years ago now, although at the time I was deemed too young to be showing these symptoms at all. I was in therapy for a little over a year for depression, ednos, and severe anxiety but that was a while ago and my family believe I'm better. I just, feel really confused about it all? this past year has been one of the worst even though I've supposedly 'recovered', my emotions are intense and daunting, my self image changes so often it feels like my own thoughts are lies, and I can't trust myself or anyone else which affects every single relationship in my life, whether it be familial or otherwise. I've spoken about it too my sister (basically had a very embarrassing breakdown about it while I was at it) I explained the blinding anger, and unexplained mood swings, my frequent relapses in self harm, unstable friendships and the way I perceive emotions and the exhausting feeling of emptiness as well. I'm not sure if my borderline diagnosis is even still valid, and I keep feeling like a complete fraud, like I'm a liar to not only myself but everyone around me. my sister said this is normal, and I shouldn't seek treatment again because that's just how girls are in their late teens, which makes me even more confused. honestly, I just want a second opinion just to know whether I'm being dramatic or should let it g? if that makes sense? anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this."
1520,:cry:
1521,Has anyone got any tips of how to deal with stress of havin bpd/depression and anxiety it's all very overwhelming at times especially when still got responsibilities with children and family
1522,"One of the lessons from dbt is that you need to stop time and do something random and kind for yourself. Every day.

its not self indulgent, but it’s an important ritual to healing  your bpd.

it can be something as simple as taking 15 minutes to fully appreciate a cup of tea, and nothing else.

so let’s work on doing at least one kind thing for ourselves each day.

what did you do today?"
1523,he could leave me and i would die x
1524,"I’m just starting the process of moving home again and every time I do it I end up becoming quite unwell, I’ve sussed out what might be part of the reason but that’s not going to help me in this moment.

Is there any reason for me to contact my psych team?  I don’t think I’ll have proper access to them at this short notice but is there anything that could be prescribed that might be helpful?"
1525,I'm feeling very sad and lonely. Maybe just the time of year? I have a contact knot in my stomach. I've done nothing but sleep on and off all day. Really wish I had some company. Sinking into a deep depression :(
1526,I always push people away with my stupid impulsive behaviour. I hate myself right now. Again!  My doctor hasn't suggested anything but meds which I wont take. Does anything else help please?
1527,"Can someone talk to me about their experience with BPD and weight gain or loss?

I am underweight when I was always normal. I have lost all my curves. I feel so depressed no matter what I do I cannot gain. I am sick of hearing people comment on my weight. It’s so hard to feel normal and ok when I look like this. If anyone can speak about their experiences of weight gain or loss I would so appreciate it."
1528,"When I go to bed I often hear music playing or the phone ringing, but when I listen, there's nothing.  I even got up to check the house phone before convinced it was ringing, but it wasn't, and hadn't.  Then the music started as well.  Is this auditory hallucination even though I don't hear voices??  It's a pain and quite unsettling when I want to sleep."
1529,"Hey guys just a quick one what medication would you recommend I'm currently on mirtzapine 30mg
but it isnt doing much for me anybody got any recommendations?"
1530,how do you know?
1531,It has been almost 24 hours. This is the longest I’ve ever felt this way continuously
1532,"Hi everyone, I'm new here. I am curious if my self sabotaging of relationships is part of my BPD or something else? I finally found someone who I thought was ""the one"" and was ready to go ""all in"" and then out of no where I feel like I'm pulling away and uninterested. I don't remember anything triggering it. I would say I don't care if things end at this point except I vaguely remember how excited and different it felt in the beginning and wondering what changed. Is this normal? Is this something therapy can fix? I'm lost and don't have an appointment for another few weeks. Thanks!"
1533,"Hi this is my first post here having just joined. I struggle with Borderline personality disorder and self harm. I recently read online that a need to see the damage that is done when self harming has links to BPD and I wondered if this was important to anyone else? For me the act of harming myself does not seem to calm my emotions, until I see the damage I've done, I get great relief from this and it is the reason I began self harming in the first place. My plan is and has been for a while to stop self harming, but after many failed attempts I feel if I can gain a greater understanding of why I self harm, and in the way that I do, it might help me to cut it out at the source. So my question is, for anyone who self harms; is seeing the damage an important part of the process?"
1534,"Hi everyone,
So I am just feeling so low about things right now. I was madly in love for 1.5 years with a man who had a history of addiction. He got sober and we dated and it was wonderful. He relapsed a few months later and got into drugs he had never been into before...really hard drugs. I dont even recognize this person anymore though I still love him. I broke up with him because I couldn't take the drug use anymore.  He was so fucking angry. He blamed everything on me. His relapse, the state he is in now. He says I ""do this to men"" and I destroy their lives. I am just struggling so hard with this guilt. I still am in love with him and I know I am hard to deal with but could I really be the reason for a persons addiction? Every man I have been with says I am too flirty and too provocative. He knows I had a history of cheating but I never cheated on him. He wont even speak to me now and all he feels for me is absolute anger. It is so devastating for me. Do I do this to people? Is my BPD the reason that I destroy relationships? And despite how much he has put me down and called the worst names ... whore slut everything on a regular basis I still have feelings for him. He blames me for everything. I just feel that I am starting to believe it. 

I know having him out of my life is necessary. Especially with my job at the university coming in the new year I just can't deal with this type of volatile relationship anymore. I know this post is all over the place but I guess I just want an honest answer. Could it be my fault he relapsed? Do I really ruin mens lives? He is not the first person who has said this to me before. I am struggling so much with this guilt and I just feel like I will never be able to have a relationship without hurting the person or making them hate me. I just feel like a horrible person right now. I dont know what is real or not. I just need some objective views that aren't my own because I am in such a cycle of self loathing and hatred right now and all I hear in my head are his words."
1535,"I’m done trying. If he wants to date me he can stop making sarcastic, stupid little comments then being pissed when I call him out for not being as respectful as I WILL have my partner be. I am so TIRED and DONE. he knows where I am. I’m not saying a word to him until he properly apologizes. I wasn’t the one in the wrong. I was being so nice. He’s impossible and the stress isn’t worth the relationship anymore."
1536,"I’m dealing with a breakup that is, of course, my fault. I don’t have many friends and the friends I do have just don’t understand how I’m feeling. This person was everything I wanted and I ruined the relationship by getting help much too late. I had plenty of chances and I didn’t take them until it was too late. Now I’m struggling with regret. I know I lost the love of my life. Everyone says I’m just grieving and eventually I’ll meet someone new and better. But I know myself better than anyone. I know that I will live with this regret forever. And each day that goes by, it seems to be getting harder, not easier, to move on. 

There’s so much I want to say but I don’t even know where to begin. (This is my first post on this forum.) I’m essentially looking to talk with people who feel the same ways I do, who go through the same intense emotions I do, and who think the same way I do.

Thank you to anyone who reads."

im sure they will figure out within 30 seconds what everyone already knows-he is too good for me x"

1544,"I have struggled with mental health problems for as long as I can remember. My mom had her own set of illnesses mentally and physically to the point of where it became very toxic. She didn't mean it at all. She would never mean to hurt anybody. But she struggled with herself to a point of where she was very neglectful, and borderline emotionally abusive.

I remember several times walking in on her trying to hurt herself as a child in third grade. She also has BPD and has had it for a long time and I know this now. I feel for her. I really do. But part of me still resents her.

I am 25 years old and I have been feeling like my mental health has been spiraling out of control. I was very concerned that I was having a mental breakdown or that maybe I was developing schizophrenia. I have pretty bad anxiety/panic disorder and the two don't mix well together. I have been committed four times in the last 5 years for suicidal ideation... I was basically terrified of myself. I remember being so scared from a really extreme round of panic attacks where I was too afraid to watch Finding Dory... because I was thinking about how the movie is underwater and it made me gruesomely imagine drowning. The paranoia is a daily part of my life and I have nobody in my life who seems to understand what is happening and they approach it in a way I personally don't find helpful..

I feel like I have read a lot of the symptoms of BPD and it just seems to explain so much. I have been struggling with not knowing who I am for a long time now, and I feel like I am not me... I will look in the mirror and be shocked... not by my appearance, but that I see myself in general... my identity.. the same face I have seen for a long time now. I started thinking maybe I had multiple personalities and that maybe the other one was coming out.. I was terrified and still am almost on a daily basis. I just received the diagnosis of BPD today and it has opened my eyes. I feel like I have actual hope for once when I was very seriously running out. I can actually figure out who I am and live a semi-normal life.

Is there anybody who relates? I feel out of control of myself sometimes and it terrifies me to my core."
1545,"Hi guys,
I’m in for DBT in January 14. It’s good news but what would you say I can do in the meantime for my BPD? Since accepting my diagnosis it’s been a bit better but I still struggle so much daily. I am also reading “I hate you don’t leave me” everyday and finding a bit comfort in that.

appreciate you guys more than you know"
1546,"It seems every medical professional I speak to I immediately has a negative opinion of BPD as soon as i bring it up. I feel like they don’t believe it is a real condition, and given how many people suffer with it this needs to change. I don’t want to be labelled as aggressive or attention seeking purely for having this condition. Has anybody else suffered with this? Can anyone help with feelings towards this?"
1547,"Currently diagnosed as a schizophreniac. Previously as a Borderline. I'll always be BPD at heart.

Wednesday I went to see the ex girlfriend who is the only girl who could make me cry on and off for four and a half hours so far as I have today. She got with my friend after dating me the first time. She got with a friend when we were unofficial but ""talking"" the second time. Both times hurt me badly. This time felt different. It was a more mature time than we had ever shared. No reckless sex. She had a beer and smoked some weed but I abstained. 

We watched a movie and she left for a bit. Came back after caring for a family member. Then we sat around the fire pit with a friend. Just talking. Listening to music. It was nice.

When I had to leave for work I shook my friend's hand, but her, before I even got close enough to decide how to say goodbye she said ""I'll see you off."" I knew what was coming.

We talked for a minute. Hugged her for a long time. Prayed for her after. Hugged her more after that. Then after a moments pause I said ""Oh fuck it"" out loud and kissed her. She kissed back. We parted for a moment. Then she came at me with a kiss and when I attempted to retract after a moment she continued coming at me. We talked a few seconds more before I had to leave to get ready for work. 

On the way home I prayed for her. Got home. Then got back in the car and prayed for her all the way to work. Prayed for her under my breath at work a few times. Prayed for her on the way home. Woke up the next afternoon (I work nights) and prayed constantly for her. Woke up the next day constantly prayed for her. Woke up today. No replies to my message I left as she slept. I'm a grown ass man and I cried like a hungry baby for almost five hours. 

She was gone from my life for five years and came back with two of her own kids, and she takes care of her ex fiancee's two kids also. I am so scared for her and of losing her. Even if she doesn't choose to get back together with me I just want her to be happy and safe, and want the same for her kids. 

I understand why she wouldn't want me raising her kids with her. I'm a weakling. I'm useless. No skills. No passions. No money. Incapable of physically defending her. Nothing to give her but the problems of a Schizo and a Borderline. 

I need help. I'm broken and don't know how to fix myself. My heart has revolved around my thoughts of this girl for SEVEN YEARS. Even the women I dated in her absence could not fill the void she left in me. What the hell is my problem?"

Right now he is in prison and our contact is extremely limited but the idealization and dissociation symptoms are still huge things in our relationship. My question is: as someone with BPD would you ever come to a point during a dissociation cycle where you would fully disconnect yourself from your favorite person and just never contact them again?  Sometimes we go several days without talking after he has told me he hates me and never wants to speak to me again and I never know if it's because he is serious that time or because he can't call me because the prison is on lockdown or because another inmate killed him. It's horrible not knowing but I want to rule out the first one because i love him very much and i will always be there for him no matter what and it kills me a little inside if I'm constantly thinking he is just gonna get fed up with his ""percieved"" ideas of me and I never hear from him again....he ""breaks up"" with me often but he always calls/writes back, but sometimes when days go by I don't really know what's going on. If he really was serious that time or he will call me and expect everything to be back to normal..."

1553,"Been struggling recently and had an operation for self harm this week. MH services are terrible with me, they see the label and they automatically hate me and think anything I do is for ‘attention’. Tomorrow a crisis worker from a charity is taking me to A&E to see to my SH, nervous for the procedure because it will be traumatic but I know it needs to be done. Worried the A&E staff will be bad with me like they usually are and don’t know how I’ll cope. Glad I have someone coming with me, hopefully that will help. Don’t know if she’ll come in for the procedure but hopefully she will cause I need someone to hold my hand. It’s not even the pain that scares me it’s just the trauma of the whole procedure and the embarrassment I know that I’ll have."

And then my dog comes to see me which scares me as I'm so angry I could hit him as well by accident but this rage is horrid 
Felt like smashing something to pieces. I didn't but I was so close lol"

1556,"Hello everyone,
I am literally in disbelief right now. I am reading on dissociation and BPD...I have experienced this countless times, moments where i am talking to someone I know or in an environment I know and I will all of a sudden get a feeling of panic like who is this person? Where am I? Is this really actually happening to me? I always thought this was something that maybe happened to everyone. I never spoke to anyone about it. I just know it’s so scary, and it makes it hard to seem normal from the outside. Is this common for you guys? Can anyone tell me stories about dissociation for you? Is there any way to deal with it? And I’m still not sure how this connects to BPD. Why does it happen?
Sorry for all these questions I feel like Im in a sea of information, symptoms and diagnoses  that I can relate  to but I need to talk to people who experience these things too to feel human :(. I just don’t feel human right now.

I hope any of this made sense."
1557,"New on this. Don’t know anyone and I’m terrified. Diagnosed with bpd and currently at treatment. Don’t really know what to say, just because want to speak to some people maybe ??"
1558,"Get along super well. But I think my parents think we’re gonna get married and all that. I thought that too but now bf says he’s not sure and he wants to be together now but he can’t promise future. He doesn’t always wanna do like super couply stuff/ doesn’t like the expectation that he will at least. But then I wind up embarrassed when he’s not like as future hubby material as my parents thought.

like he’s invited to thanksgiving with us and he usually joins. His family lives far away. He says he’ll come if he’s free. That annoyed me but I’m betting he will come he just never gives definitive for sure answers. (Which I need but oh well).

i accept this thinking like I can’t be too demanding. But then my parents ask and I tell them and it hits me that it’s kinda sad that I don’t know and we’ll have to wait and see if he shows up. It IS sad. I love bf and am totally crazy about him but I do see the disconnect of trying to be okay with a “casual” type thing when I’m obviously not so much okay with it.

dad says he needs to either sh*t or get off the pot 😂😂"
1559,"Hello, I am unsure where to ask this as I do have ADHD but I feel it may be a mix of both BPD and ADHD. I am hoping someone may be able to help. So sometimes when I am angry I drive and my impulsivity gets worse. I have noticed if a song comes on that is a happy one that I enjoy I can literally be angry and then giving it some dance moves- well an arm dance move of sorts since I always hold the steering wheel with one hand. 

This is totally a different scenario and I think it is a mix of adhd and bpd but I was talking about some stuff that has been upseting me and there was the odd time that I would get distracted by something and sort of laugh. I know I don't do it all the time but it's made me worried and paranoid that I may come across like I am faking my mood. Even more so as there are times when I am upset and the person who I am talking to will maybe say something as a joke to lighten the mood and I find it hard just to fake a smile. My mood seems to change rapidly and I have no idea what to make of it."
1560,"Hey guys,

I was diagnosed with BPD a week ago. Only just got meds for it and haven’t started my intense psychotherapy yet (I could be be waiting months). It took 6 months to see anyone and get diagnosed so don’t know how much longer it’ll be for treatment.. any ideas on how to cope will be great in the meantime and any personal experiences around psychotherapy treatments would be great as I’m dreading it!
Thankyou everyone xx"
1561,"hi all.  im really struggling to find a way to cope with bpd.  mainly letting people in and loving them with all you have knowing they are not long term.  I generally don't have any friends or romantic relationships because the pain when it ends isn't something I can cope with and trusting anyone isn't easy.  I have a care worker and I know the time with her is nearing an end.  I trust her and care for her so much not in a romantic way but its like she is keeping me breathing.  I know this will come to an end soon and im dreading it, its all I can think about, the loss and pain is hitting me and it hasn't happened yet.  its a shit way to be I hate bpd"
1562,"if hermit leaves me I would die just die
I couldn't bare if he fell out of love with me or worst hated me

im scared
IDK what to do"
1563,"The depression is looming. I can feel it. Only I'm kind of stuck and dont really know what to do. 

Anti depressants have never really worked for me. Many send my hypomanic. I'm no longer under any one other than my GP, and my psychiatrist stopped the mood stabilizers due to me not taking them properly and me saying they didnt work. 

I dont think my GP can re-prescribe(is that a word?) The mood stabilizers, and I dont think I'm unwell enough to be referred back to the mental health team. 

But...if I dont do something I'm afraid I will dip too much. I just dont know what to do. I do have an appointment next week, but I dont know what he could do. 

What can I do?"
1564,"Hi I have been having psychosis lately and was referred to the urgent care and assessment team at my local mental health services.
I have assessment write up and have been prescribed amilsupride without even seeing the psychiatrist yet.
I am being placed on a new psychiatrists books and my diagnosis from 10 yes ago shows BPD. PPD and OCD.
Would the new tablets be prescribed for BPD or could my hallucinations be turning into bipolar or schizophrenia? I see mutilated faces on random people. Hopefully new shrink diagnoses me properly. I have a cpn again aswell."
1565,"My ex just text me and told me Alice ...his new girlfriend are getting on great.... Then he sends me a picture of her.
Asks me how I am, I dont reply for three days. He texts me apparently concerned?? Like what? Anyway silly me texts back. Then he tells me she's off work for 4 days so they are spending that time together.
Umm..the other weekend he tells me shes great in bed??
And silly me still replys to his texts.
And now i m drinking.
Told my pdoc and support worker I dont have anything to do with him ...and no I'm not interested in drinking,
Lies and lies course I was happy to be discharged feels great now not too sure"
1566,"I'm feeling very sad & hopeless right now so I feel I should share my thoughts with you guys.

I moved to a new city 5 months ago to heal & start a new life. I took a huge risk & sold my condo in order to buy a house in the new city, which turned out to be a major financial mistake.

When I first arrived, I started to look for a real estate agent & found one who is also gay as well as vegan, same as me. Jenn was everything I look for in a partner that I haven't found & it was obvious the sexual attraction was mutual. She was flirty with me & invited me to local events, although due to my BPD issues I held back & didn't want to fully show my emotions. She ended up getting me involved in a bad real estate deal that resulted in me losing $1500, and she didn't even seem regretful about it. I backed out of the deal pissed but I decided to keep working with her & to give her another chance as she had other good realtor traits that I found useful. 

She went out of town & her gay friend Cindy filled in for her by showing me a few homes. We became fast friends & Cindy told me that Jenn asked her if she wanted to take over & be my client, but Cindy said no. Basically, Jenn was trying to pawn me off on Cindy, even though she was showing feelings for me. I was hurt but decided to let it go. During this time we all 3 hung out twice & I could see they both had mutual attraction for each other just by the way they looked at each other, and the energy they exchanged which made me feel like a 3rd wheel. I confessed to Cindy that I was attracted to Jenn & she looked visibly sad, at that point I knew. Cindy is recently separated from her ex so that was probably the reason they didn't partner up in the past, and it seemed like she was also on the fence about pursuing Jenn. 

Fast forward a few months of working with Jenn & our feelings intensified, although she gave me mixed messages. One day she invited me to her house & it seemed like we were finally going in the direction I was hoping for, but the next day I again terminated a house deal. House hunting gave me anxiety & I cancelled two properties I had accepted offers on as I just couldn't handle the stress & to this day something is pulling me back from buying. Due to my cancellations & unstable buying behaviors she told me she can't work with me anymore but that we're still friends. I was hurt & angry so I backed off, although we were still facebook friends. I also understood why she couldn't work with me so I let it go.

Suddenly Cindy had a change of heart & offered to be my real estate agent, then said Jenn will be involved too but not directly, more of a silent agent. After I heard this I assumed she offered to be my agent for the commission & to be able to work with Jenn, who she has feelings for. I reluctantly agreed then only after 2 weeks of working with her she gets mad at me for no valid reason & tells me to find another agent to work with. I didn't cancel any offers but apparently she liked a house that I didn't & was upset that I didn't listen to her, seemed her ego was involved. I backed off & we didn't talk for a few weeks then she reached out to me. 

Shortly after this Cindy goes vegan all of a sudden & starts rsvp to events that Jenn was going too (on FB), and it was obvious to me her motivation for going vegan was she wanted to be with Jenn, as she knows Jenn prefers to date only vegans. As soon as Cindy announced her veganism on FB Jenn started liking all her posts & commenting as well, which she didn't do before. It seemed like Jenn had a sudden strong urge & desire for Cindy, which was mutual. I asked them both if they like each other & both said they're just friends, but their actions show a different story. I only care b/c I have strong feelings for Jenn.

I haven't seen nor heard from Jenn in weeks then she sends me an invite to a music event at her office, which I went to. I assumed she invited me after Cindy couldn't go & I was basically 2nd choice. When I arrived I asked her if Cindy was coming & she said no in a sad tone. I felt like sloppy seconds basically. During the music event she kept staring at me & smiling, and it appeared she still had attraction towards me but it really didn't matter as I feel she would chose Cindy over me.

After the event they both started up again rsvp to the same events & I heard they are hanging out. I don't hang out with Cindy anymore as she always cancels on me & it seems her priority is just hanging out w/ Jenn. I wouldn't consider either of them genuine friends & it's obvious they don't really care about our friendship.

I feel used & tossed to the side, again, which makes me want to cut ties with both of them. Neither of them has shown me loyalty & both had shown some shoddy behaviors when it came to being my realtor. I also feel like they are going to be in a relationship soon in which case I won't be hanging out with either of them. 

Should I permanently walk away from both of them, unfriend them both on facebook & call it a day?"
1567,"Hello ME AGAIN
So I went out last night and drank too much and used clothing and makeup and my general mask of looking attractive to make myself feel better...but I didn’t drink and drive and I didn’t resort to sex which I know sounds so basic for anyone to do but it’s such a huge deal for me...

I have really thrown myself into trying to understand BPD and the treatments. I am so fortunate that my aunt is a psychiatrist and she’s really helping me. But talking to her has kind of left me confused. This is what she said about the treatment I have been waitlisted for: 
“It is DBT based, the actual DBT is longer duration and two sessions a week one group and one individual and it is former more severe form of BPD”
So are there two types of BPD? One more severe? Or two types of treatment?? Can anyone who has done DBT tell me anything about it? Is it comparable to CBT? I know I  could google but it often makes things worse for me. Would love to hear your actual stories. Thank you so much xoxo"
1568,"he will leave me
I will die if he does"
1569,"so i got some unsuspected news last night that's changed everything for me. so long story short around 4 maybe 5 years ago (when my mental health started declining) i had an argument with a close friend. it went something like ""your self centred you need to think of other people and their feelings""ect. then the next day i get a message off her.... it read ""this is _ mum. my daughter committed suicide last night because of you, you had an argument with her and it pushed her over the edge."" it said more but yeh. 
i never message back because what do you say to that right? 
anyway yesterday i logged onto my pc to find an old streamer we all used to watch was live. i popped in to say hi and well my friend who was ""dead"" was talking in chat. i pulled her up on it and all i got back was ""oh you believed that? id say im sorry but im not""
i ended up overdosing last night, im just so confused and worked up and i dont know what to do anymore. when i was told about her killing herself my whole life fell apart, its how i got ill i couldnt manage with the idea that id killed someone it broke me massively. now its like this past 5 years was a complete lie, its like i should have never be going through all this id still have my old life. still have my old job and be happy. i feel like ive been robbed of my life :( i am so lost.

then im questioning my self. how bad of a person was i for her to literally fake killing herself just never talk to me again ?i dont know im just really worked up ect"
1570,"It's now been 8 months since my diagnosis, but I still feel like I have hit a brick wall. Every time I try to find out something, like coping mechanisms I get bombarded with posts saying how awful and cruel and evil ""BPD's"" are. I feel like my future has a cap, I've started self-harming again, I am constantly either crying or empty, I feel like I'm just a bunch of open nerves. I've had a baby 18 weeks ago and my biggest fear is that I'm never going to be able to be a good mother for her. I just want to be anybody but me. Please tell me, does it get better cos right now it feels like a death sentence?"
1571,"Hi does anybody know if it's possible to join the police force with a history and diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder and psychosis?
I have a completely clean CRB and never been in bother with the police!
Any information greatly appreciated. Thanks"
1572,"Hi everyone. I just want to say reading your posts the past few days has been the only relief I have had in what feels like months. I am a 28 year old woman who was first diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago. The first thing my ignorant self did was reel into denial. There is no way I can have BPD. I am a masters student. I am well put together, I am in a relationship, I am all of these things. How I wish I listened. Two years later and still not done my masters, my relationship turning volatile because of me and horrific cheating, anorexia and bulimia coming in and out of my life, using sex and men and my appearance to get validation, two car wrecks, one hospitalization due to failed overdose...I am so fucking ashamed of my self. I KNOW I have this disorder I knew the minute he told me but I chose denial and along the way I have hurt so many people...I have already reached out for help and have signed up for group therapy bu t I just need to talk to people who understand me...my biggest fear is that I will ruin a job I somehow got in January to teach at an amazing university. I don't want to die this way. I don't want to be like this. I am so tired of this and I am so tired of disappointing everyone who loves me. I have caused so much pain and the shame I feel is crippling. 
If you have any words, anything at all even a few things to say would be so appreciated. Thank you."
1573,"Hey peeps anyone else always feeling on edge? 

Like proper restless and feeling paranoid that something bad is about to happen"
1574,"I don’t know. We got drunk. We made love. I feel happy now but it won’t last because sober me will start fretting again. He’s my bf and I love him and he loves me. I would like to just be free to feel happy like this.

I don’t know. I try my best. I am hopelessly obsessed with him and I find that “wrong”. It’d be great to find a happy médium.

I am like a small child seeking acceptance at heart. I don’t think I’ll ever grow up. I’m okay with that. I just want to be a good person. I’d like to be a mom someday too but at this point I feel like I’ll defer that decision to bf. That’s all I want. Maybe a pet. That’s about it! I can’t comprehend how people can have a bunch of dreams and ambitions. I just want to be alive and not panicking.

I want to help people too. I’d love to help people like us.

sorry for the ramble/ thanks for reading."
1575,"Any one with BPD also cheated on their partner before?

Just curious if you've found your BPD was part of the cause of it. I'll be completely honest, I'm kind of cheating on my partner right now. When we weren't together last year for a few months, I fell madly in love with someone else and have never been able to let the relationship with him go, even though I've tried cutting contact. Tried being just friends. I always end up breaking and failing. I feel horrible and guilty all the time. But I love them both and I don't know if I am capable of choosing.

My partner and I had discussed being poly at one point. He knows about my feelings for Jason (although I don't know if he knows I've never gotten over those feelings). He obviously doesnt know how much I flirt with him, or that I've sent NSFW pictures to him quite a bit - although I put a stop to that about 3 months ago and for now haven't broken that promise to myself.

I'm kind of lost and I don't know why I get so happy talking to Jason. I feel like if I didn't have BPD maybe I'd be able to let the relationship I have with him die. But I don't know."
1576,"Had a bit of a whopper 2day, hate the feelin that the ones around me suffer too because they carefeel guilty but can't hide my emotions anymore"
1577,"Is that what it is when you just feel nothing? Even when you know you should feel something. It's as if my brain knows how I should feel and react but it's not computing enough for those actions and emotions to follow through. 

I think I've been like this for quite some time now and it hasnt bothered me really, it's been more helpful than anything. But I really should be having a reaction of some sort at the minute and I'm just not. Not at all. I do care, I care a lot but it doesnt look like I do. That is the part that is bothering me right now. 

I think I've spent the best part of my life in and out of this. Emotionally numb has been brought up to me by professionals a number of times. I never quite understood what they meant until one point i noticed my lack of reactions/emotions and thought maybe this is what they meant. 

I'm not always without feeling. I feel extremely deeply to the point I wish I was switched off again. 

I guess you cant win really. Either feel too much or just not at all. Both equally as disturbing as each other."
1578,Feel like loneliness is my oldest friend help
1579,"I have been really been well for the past 5 months looking for work, going on fun activities with him and eating well, taking my meds which were really helping and doing yoga and reading.  I finally felt like I was getting back to myself after the stresses of attempting suicide and quitting two jobs in the last year. 

Then just when life feels livable again - I am being ghosted by someone i have known for so long and he won't take my calls, never came home after he came back from his family trip and I am sitting here in a house I cannot afford unemployed and just reeling from the shock of where I am right now."
1580,"I have that constant pit in my stomach, where you always think something is about to happen? 
I'm making good steps in my recovery, but feel like I'm 'lost', I don't understand what's going on or whats expected of me half the time. I finally sorted through my house and got 'rid' of all my step daughters belongings. 
I'm sick of being the scapegoat. I'm an easy target for that. I put other peoples feeling and needs before my own. I know this is learned behaviour, a survival mechanism from my childhood, but I fond it hard to figure out who's taking advantage of me and who isn't. 
I've lost my purpose and sense of who I am with everything that's went on and I try to get it back but its hard to get into a routine. I feel at a loose end. I have different appointments and meetings every week which makes it even harder. 
I've stopped 'looking after' myself. I desperately want to start again and put myself first but I don't know how, and I am using helping other people to keep me ticking over (still) 
My CPN is calling me today. I try and explain how I feel but she just says 'yeah' and has no helpful tips really.
I feel like I have nothing to look forward to but more disorder and confusion."
1581,"Hi there.

I’m 33 from London & have just been (tentatively) diagnosed with BPD after over 20 years of various mental health problems. I say tentatively because it was suggested to me by my GP recently, and I’ve been referred to a psychiatrist for a couple of week’s time for a proper assessment. Even so, I’ve done a lot of research on the condition, and I’m like a walking textbook.

I hate to be another person making their first post a cry for help; I want to be able to support other people too, but right now I’m struggling so badly.

I need some help in talking myself down from some serious anguish, which doesn’t make any sense to me. I’m not in treatment yet so I don’t know what tools people use when they feel like this. It’s bad.

There are dozens of really serious things going on right now. In November my partner of 9 years left me suddenly, overnight, a week before we were due to move into the home I’d bought for the both of us (my mother died a few years back, which enabled me to buy. I can’t sell it because of conditions in the will). I guess he got sick of me, though he never explained. He’d been supporting me as I hadn’t been able to work for a while (a combo of lack of opportunities, ptsd and anxiety symptoms). I’ve been living here alone since, though can’t afford to run it myself & have enormous debts and no income. I have no other family apart from my father and sister, who I see maybe once a year (I dread it) and who recently threatened to disown me if I didn't fix my mental health issues.

My long term ex came back into my life pretty soon after leaving, saying he’s made a mistake, but I can’t trust him. I want to love him but (as devastated as I was for months) I don’t feel much of anything anymore; just anxiety for the money I owe, guilt for having to take handouts from him while I look for work (my bills are huge and I’ve gone days without eating since I maxed out my credit cards ) etc. He keeps trying to comfort me but I feel worse and worse. I hate that I have to rely on him for everything and see him if I want to eat etc. He's a lovely guy and he's trying, but I feel dead inside lately. I'm screwed up enough that it could all change in a day, of course.

I started casually dating a very sweet younger guy around Christmas; he's on a working holiday visa from Canada. My ex knows about him but also that it isn’t/wasn't too serious (it wasn’t). He’s younger, idealistic (annoyingly so) and very sweet. I felt a lot of affection for him but knew it would never really work between us (for all sorts of reasons). We had a lot of fun, though, which I needed at the time. I didn’t see him for a while when I went through a serious depressive patch.  We reconnected recently & had a great time. 

Almost immediately afterwards, he started becoming cold and distant in our messages, and when I suggested meeting again, said he didn’t want to date anyone at the moment, so would rather see me as a friend... But was too busy to name a time.

Initially I responded in an understanding, compassionate way. I said that self care is important blah blah blah & asked if he wanted to do something as friends soon, but he was standoffish and cold. After a little social media sleuthing it was obvious that he’s been dating someone else... someone more like him... idealistic, a little vapid, my age but with money to spend on him (he never paid for anything while we were together). He's like a walking self help book the way he spews out motivational, inspirational quotes about love & living in the moment etc... He's said some lovely things to me but I suddenly realise that it's all bullshit and he didn't mean any of it.

I felt like I’d been run over by a truck, and I don’t know why. Immediately, I had a hot coal burning a hole in my stomach, I couldn’t eat, sleep or even move much at all. All I could do was think about him & alternately how much I craved his affection and how angry I was... it didn’t go away AT ALL, even after a sensible amount of time, and made no sense... I was kind to him when we were together (with the exception of cutting him out during my depression month- I’m not excusing that but I explained and apologised profusely) but I knew he wasn’t right for me, and was quite dismissive in the way I thought about him. Suddenly he feels like the most important thing in the world to me. He said so many lovely things to me when I wasn’t well, even if I wasn’t able to read the messages until later.

What made it worse was that I realised from his social accounts, this relationship had started before he came back & we slept together, and has continued since. Was he just checking that he really didn’t want everything I was before he committed to this new guy? What did I do wrong? I'm 33 but I feel 13.

After 2 weeks of full on suicidal anguish, dealing with very violent thoughts of self harm and self hatred (which made NO sense to me- I KNOW I shouldn’t care about this guy!!) I had one day (today) where I started to feel nearly OK; or at least I was only worried about my real problems & the obsessive thoughts and hot coal had dissipated. We’re due to have a coffee to discuss things on Tuesday & I was feeling OK about saying goodbye (perhaps letting him know his behaviour wasn’t OK) and letting go.

Then I looked at one of his accounts, and saw that he’s out with that guy right at that moment,having a wonderful time in a fancy, expensive bar. I maxed out my last card taking him to that sort of place when I could, but now it's all gone he's moved on to someone else.

Immediately it all flooded back. It’s a real, physical pain, and I can hardly move. I feel paralysed. The thoughts are back and I don’t know why or why I care. I want to hold him & have him tell me I matter, even though 2 months ago I could only handle him in small doses as I felt HE was too clingy. I want to stalk him, to make him guilty, to have any contact at all with him (I haven't done anything too weird though, before you worry).

I’ve read that this kind of response is not uncommon with BPD sufferers but what no one has explained yet is what to do about it- to ease these feelings.

I have only a small amount of Valium (I’m a suicide risk after all) and I’m so volatile that I’ll likely need it for something more than this before I can get more.

Does anyone have any advice?

I KNOW that this is a stupid, honest to god PETTY problem to have- I know that. I'm so ashamed to feel this way. I have real problems too, but this is consuming me & I don’t know why. The pain is real and I want to cut it out of me as I’m sure it doesn’t belong there... I’m an intelligent person; I shouldn’t feel like this.

I’m sorry.

Thank you for reading, if you got this far. If not, I don’t blame you."
1582,"So today has been an emotional roller coaster. I’m feeling so much POSITIVE stuff for bf which means I’m not being snippy with him but I do keep like full out crying thinking I’ll lose him. I mean this is why I choose anger over tiny things. I can’t just constantly be sobbing.

anyway he was trying to tell me how he felt and I think I lost the message. I understood it as the most negative extreme it could have meant. He didn’t mean it that way at all. Now that I’ve cried my eyeballs out again after just telling him I’m better (lol smooth) I feel bad that he feels misunderstood by me. I tried to apologize just now but he’s like half sleeping. I want to be able to listen to him talk about serious feelings without thinking every other sentence is a lead in to him breaking up and then me losing my marbles again.

Ironically I’m feeling confident about us. At least I think I am. What the heck is going on?"
1583,I'm just wondering if there is any correlation between obsessing over your physical appearance and borderline personality disorder.
1584,"Hi. Ive been on anti depressants on and off for years until i stopped drinking 2 years ago. ( im a recovering alcoholic).

The mental health team took me off them and said i needed to be on quitiepine 50 mg. They dont seem to have done much apart from making me sleep like hell and make me feel a little disasociated. 

My question for all out there is what does work for bpd ?"
1585,".. 
How does it feel? Well, it feels like my insides are burning, white hot, my every compulsive thoughts is focussed upon this situation. Anyone who tries to reason or challenge this compulsion is faced with hostility, an abrupt tone that mimics the destructive rumination of this mind. A complete separation from reason, as if you were being persecuted and hounded into submission by your own rhetoric. When you do submit, allow the feeling to engulf and overwhelm, it leaves you with emptiness, no solution and no greater confusion can come from feeling so much but so little concurrently. It takes hours to pass, for those hours it sits in your chest, when you feel it is dormant, a simple misinterpretation can act as a cue for complete malfunction. This burden takes sleep from you, logic, pleasure, all made to bow before it’s overwhelming magnitude.
You forget who you are, in turn it forgets you, leaving each episode to drift fragmented in a vacuous mind, consumed with protecting the essence of a crumbling self from its cruel creator."
1586,"Hi all, I am new on the forum.

I could really do with some professional help, as I seem to tick all the boxes to be here. But by doing so I would receive a formal diagnosis, which would mean having to carry that as well around. 
I am worried about the impact it would have on the costs for car insurance for example. Because then you have to declare it.
Has anyone had experiences about this, please? 
And also, how did you tell your family about your diagnosis?

Wish you all a good night xxx"
1587,"hermit is working so so hard to get the house nice and I got overwhelmed and started crying because my routine was changed(which is basically stay in bed all day and do nothing when I get up)
I feel terrible because he is working so hard I feel so ungrateful x"
1588,So me and my husband both have undiagnosed BPD. It has taken me years to put the pieces together. The situation is absolutely unbearable. I don’t know what to think/feel anymore. I am trying to get help. None of the DBT clinics are getting back to me (in Tampa Florida). I’m trying to do things on my own in the meantime but my BPD husband is constantly triggering me by violating me and completely unaware that he has the same thing going on. When I try to work on things he blows me off and throws a fit. I feel like exploding. I’m pissed. Resentful. He’s driving me crazy. I want us to get help. I want to get better. I can’t do this alone. Need help.
1589,"So I had a pretty hard battle with my head last night and came out the other side this morning thank god. Nothings happened and was feeling pretty proud of myself, until I was cleaning up today and found something. 

I found my old journal back from when I was I'm hospital. I stopped myself at first from reading it told myself it wasn't  a good idea and just put it to one side. But something in me was itching to read it. 


So I did, worst mistake I could have made. 

It contains a lot of my suicide notes and letters to my cpn (I wrote about how I felt a lot of the time because I couldn't talk about it) 

I got really upset reading it to the point where I've had to stop myself reading... I only got though about 5 or 6 pages. I'm just not sure what I should do... Do I throw it away and forget about it or do I use it to reflect on ?? Like do I bring it my next appointment with my cpn and we look back on it reflect on how far I've come?? 🤔"
1590,"Hey,
I have BPD, and it's getting tough lately. I decided to be more social and had a couple of dates over past few weeks.
There is a guy I really like, we met 3 times but I cannot stop thinking about him and getting obsessed. He was super sweet and nice these weeks, saying he liked me, but lately I feel Im getting annoying. I would love to see him more often, but he is busy. Of course, thougts like he doesn't want to meet, why work is more important than me, etc. We are chatting almost every day, but sometimes my messages are unansweted and I take it personally of course. Last days I might put too much pressure and feel the person looses interest that makes me crazy. He is a super intetesting person that I have met after a year of isolation.

During the week, Im super busy so can control my emotions better, but duting weekends Im going crazy. I started drinking till I hardly walk again, don't remember part of yrsterday's night. I badly want to harm myself and it takes all my energy and hours of self-convincing not to. Im living alone in another country with no really close friends or anyone knowing I have BPD, and now I feel Im drowning in my emotions. I dont know how to take control over them"
1591,I have  been struggling with dealing with community mental health team. I have had to chase them up on every thing. So yesterday I was meant to see a dr review my meds. Went there waited an hour to be told there is no doctor there. I felt so low came home toke an overdose. Spent the afternoon at hospital and saw there mental health nurse. She was offering me help by going back to that team. I said no I can't deal with them anymore they just trigger me. So now I feel who can help even the mental health team cant get it right.
1592,I feel like I wasted my 20's. The sadness and depression took over my life and now I'm 28 and I'm trying to figure out where my life went. I've done well for myself. I moved from people that didn't help me become better. I started over in a new state with my partner. I have a dog. I've done cool stuff I guess but i missed out on being happy. I let worry and sadness get the best of me and I forgot smiling and laughing. I didn't have fun. I was to busy being in hospitals and on anti depressants/ anti anxiety meds to realize my life was slipping away. Now I'm almost 30. I'm afraid I still won't be happy. I feel like I messed you my life. I also can't hold down a job. I can get one. I just can't hold it down. Keep it for more then a few months. I'm scared
1593,"Hi everyone,
Really hoping that I can get some advice or anything at all to be honest.
I am very overwhelmed by everything that has been happening in my life and I don’t know how to deal with it. I’m feeling numb, sad, hopeless and no one around me seems to understand.
My boyfriend has bipolar disorder and he has been going through a depressive episode for the past month. I’ve tried my best to remain stable but he has been constantly pulling and pushing me away. He will go from saying that he doesn’t love me anymore to acting the complete opposite and I don’t know how to handle it anymore. I feel unloved and rejected but the thought of him leaving is so much scarier than feeling like this.
I’ve let him have his space and pretty much gave in to anything he said as long as he wouldn’t leave.
We are in a medium distance relationship (2 hours away) and I went to visit him on Monday. The first two days were great but on Wednesday we had a massive argument.
He said he didn’t love me anymore and that he wanted to break up. I had a full meltdown and cried for hours. I tried to self harm but couldn’t find anything to do so with. I kept asking him not to leave me, saying that he was lying. Then after 7 hours he broke down saying that he had “almost managed to go through with it” but that he couldn’t at the end. That I was so close to having someone as disgusting as him out of my life but that he couldn’t do it. He kept sobbing and hugging me not letting me go but then asked me to leave and stay over at a friend’s.
He is very unstable right now and seems to think that pushing me away is the best thing for me. He tries to hurt me on purpose to make me leave but doesn’t realise that him doing that is causing me to have meltdowns.
I’m terrified of him leaving and I am so confused. I can never trust what he says so I’m always wondering whether he wants me or not which triggers my episodes.
The people around me do not understand how I’m feeling. I don’t know what to do about all this"
1594,"everyone said that she was not the hot one

i fell apart I loved her more than the other assholes could

and she never expected me

she was gay the whole time I went to myself to try to find another way  to stop loving her

any way

any way we try?

life is love

fuck off!... it's unavoidable"
1595,"Hi. Im new on this forum. To any forum for that matter. I am just looking to connect with people and not have to fake being happy or ""normal"" or whatever people call it. I'm just here trying to be an open book without fear or guilt of feeling like there is something wrong with me. I just want to talk to people trying, just like me, to manage BPD. No fake smiles and small talk. No looking like you interested in things that don't even matter to you. Just convos like ""I'm sad, but I learned this today and it may help"" and ""yeah I go though that, it sucks"". I just want some understanding and support. No b.s."
1596,"Heyyy, 
So I'm sorta asking advice and also updating u guys. 

Last post I made was about my diagnosis and questioning it ect. I had some news from my care team, my consultant has basically said that I'm suffering from eupd and not a mood disorder. So I'm ok with that but he's said we can discuss it next time I see him. 

I've since been making huge huge progress with my mental health.
 I'm currently 2 months free from self harm. Me and my gp have agreed that I continue with this the next time I see him (2 weeks ish left) he will refer me to dermatology to help me recover from the scars. 
I have also made massive progress with my medication. As of today I now manage my own prescription ,something over never done ever with my mental health due to risk of overdosing. 
Mood wise I've been on and off but I have noticed a massive improvement this past two months. I'm having a lot more good days and the bad days are no where near as bad and are a lot more manageable. I've been doing a lot of self coaching, so been printing off resources to do a lot more reflection and working a lot on my feelings. I must say it's helped a lot, I used to think it was all pointless and just brushed it to one side, but it's amazing how much it actually helps putting things down on paper and just realising how small that particular issue is. 

I'm looking to the future a lot more now too. Recently been passed on to a service to help with getting me back into employment and things like that. It's only early days but I think I'm finally working out where I wanna go with my life. The big thing right now is I was to use my experience with mental health and hopefully one day work I'm community services in some way shape or form. 

Now advise wise..... 

I'm not quite sure how to word this but I'll try. Tonight I've found myself getting really emotional over all my progress. Almost like I'm scared of it but also really excited about it  ... Like all my emotions and feelings I'm feeling right now are all contradicting. I'm really really confused by it all. What should I do ?? Just let it happen and not think into it or block it out.... I've never really felt like this ever but for some reason it really worries me. 

I also feel quit invincible right now. Like I could get away with anything if I tried.... I don't know if that's the manipulative side in me talking, but I genuinely feel like I could do anything and no one could stay or do anything about it. Again weird feeling I've never felt. Yeh I dont know"
1597,I’m aware that my worried thoughts are totally snowballing today but it’s hard to make them stop. I saw a video on Reddit that made me sad/upset. And then got myself all worked up just imagining that bf might have found the video funny. And remembered he’s shown me similar ones before just like light heartedly. And then we argue sometimes because I’m like demanding to know why he finds them funny and I’m a million steps ahead thinking the worst. I know he’s a good person. I know he does not in his heart of hearts approve of bad things. I know this for certain. But my OCD brain is just on a roll. Just thought I’d share here before I wound up acting weird to him. Cause that really wouldn’t be fair.
1598,How do you cope with Suffacating feeling of emptiness and abandonment and desperation when people let you down and are'nt there for you?
1599,"I’ve certainly had better days. Having already lost one sister it won’t be long before my other sister dies as well. She’s critically ill and her weight has dropped to under six stone. Poor woman can hardly breathe. 
Anyway if that wasn’t bad enough, I didn’t quite recover fast enough, or probably caused too much damage when I was ill, to save my marriage. After 32 years together we’ve decided to part. 
At least having made a semblance of a recovery I can look at these events as very sad, but I’m not suffering or suicidal, I don’t have any sense of abandonment, I’m just left thinking what’s the fucking point of anything. 
Sorry to ramble."
1600,"So, I’m 26, I’ve struggled with relationships all of my life. I got told I displayed most of the problematic traits of BPD whilst undergoing ED treatment over this last year, it seems odd to say, but unfortunately I was deemed ‘too low risk’ for BPD specific treatment due to lack of attempts on my life (apparently the waiting lists are huge :\).
I broke up with a long term partner this time last year and it caused my behaviour to spiral, i was unable to be alone but incapable of finding a partner due to coming across as ‘insane’, jumping the gun and needing constant validation to soothe my terrible fears of being left alone with myself, my mind.
I have been in a subsequent relationship since June, he is great but terrifies me, he is an impulsive adventurer. The fear that continues to build in me that he will up and leave, no concern for me has driven me to despair. He assured me he won’t, but I’m so afraid this feeling hasn’t passed, I hoped it would but my complete terror of being left may just kill my relationship, I don’t know what I would do as a result.
Has anyone found any way at all to rationalise these fears, I’ve spoken to him, tried to explain it feels like I’m being burnt alive when my dear is triggered, but I don’t know what else I can do"
1601,"I am going down the path of diagnosis so far it has been noted I have borderline personality traits on the past. Left untreated. I have ever since starting my relationship with my partner 5 years ago been absolutely terrified he is going to leave me. I became obsessive over all of his social media and his life. I was convinced he didn’t love me. I adore him, he is my world. After the birth of our 2nd child, a year later I just felt like we weren’t connected, i felt like he just didn’t want me. He blocked me from accessing any of his things and I felt compelled to speak to my ex boyfriend...... i don’t feel anything towards this guy but we began to talk and I have emotionally online cheated with him. My partner is so angry, I don’t know if he will stay with me. I’m trying to get help..... is this a common trait to have after constant rejection or life stress...even if I wasn’t rejected and it was all in my head. What can I do to help fix it and myself ? I love him and I don’t want to loose him."
1602,"Hello !

I wondered if anyone else has a similar experience as me with self harm and rejection in a relationship ?

My partner/fiance  ends our relationship nearly every time we fall out. He says he can't deal with me anymore and then physically walks away and refuses to speak to me, or he leaves the house and doesn't come back for a day or more.

Up till this point, when we aren't agreeing about something, I'm generally quite softly spoken and subdued even. Because he's quick to upset and anger, which I want to avoid.

But when he rejects me by walking out and / or ending the relationship,  I loose all control - I beg and plead for him not to leave (or to come back via text if he's already gone). 

When he ignores me still, which is usual -  I get crazy / suicidal (extremely) and then I self harm. Mainly to stop myself from acting on the suicidal impulses because the urge to die is very strong and, it frightens me and I feel unsafe.

The trigger for the suicidal urges and self injury is always my partners rejection of me. Either through his ending the relationship / walking out, or by his talking over me and not letting me speak / telling me to shut up etc.

Is anyone else dealing with this ? I'm  a middle aged adult female, I have a responsible job, but this situation makes me feel crazy - I'm not sure what to do and I feel scared and alone

1603,"I get really insecure about my boyfriend's ex. We've been together for about a year now, but I still can't shake the extreme jealousy I feel every time I see an old photo of them together or hear her name. They were together for 5 years. 

I know she still messages him quite a bit and every time she does, she guilts him about not giving her enough attention and not being a good friend to her. It seems like she's being emotionally manipulative because he gets really upset whenever she messages, but because he was the one who ended the relationship, he feels the need to keep making sure that she's okay because he still cares deeply about her. 

I don't want the jealousy to ruin our relationship because I love him a lot. But I need help getting it under control. :("
1604,"I have had a quick search through recent posts, so sorry if this question comes up a lot. I asked for years, literally, but didnt get a reply until i was sectioned, and accidently given acces to my medical notes by a nurse. My doctor had restricted my access to my notes on the basis that they may distress me, and to be fair she was probably right to do so. But the curious thing was, i was relieved."

1607,"I took a workshop on the ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" and one of the habits is to have a win-win mindset. But to achieve this, you need to have courage which is something that I have a hard time with because of my PD.

The program says you are high in courage when you share your ideas and opinion with confidence and when you are not threatened by feedback.you are low in courage when you rarely voice your ideas, you back away when interrupted, you concede quickly.

I am debilitated by my fear of abandonment, even when it is the forms of rejection or disapproval as it spirals out of control in my mind and I have not developed the tools to remain in a good headspace. 

What do you do to be couragous in the face of situations that are difficult with BPD?"
1608,"I used to date a girl who, sometimes when she gets upset, would cut herself off completely from the world by staying at home and not going anywhere.

To be clear, this is definitely part of the intense rage that she experiences as a result of being upset.

When she cut herself off, it can last for days (the longest being 4 days, which might have been longer had I not accidentally tried to phone her and she returned my missed call), and I see that she feels intense remorse when the rage episode subsides. She even has a tattoo on her arm saying 'stay...never run away'. 

My question is: is avoidance and isolation for such extended periods part of BPD? She spends a lot of time on her own by default."
1609,"So I have been reeling from the fact that my fiance ghosted me three weeks ago and I have been trying to come to terms with the fact he left me and then i find out from my mother's former financial adviser that my mother died because someone has made a claim on her estate.  I cannot believe my stepbrother never even informed me.  My mom and I have not spoken for the past 5 years as we had a very complicated relationship, but this is all very overwhelming

So I am unemployed, my fiance left me and then I never even got to say good bye to my mom,  as I had hoped I would at least see her on her death bed."
1610,"So a few months ago, my partner got diagnosed with BPD and complex PTSD by a psychiatrist. Before that diagnosis I've always been supportive by staying by her side the entire way through and still now to this day. However, at times i feel like im unappreciated with how much i do things for her to make sure she's happy and not falling. Ive told her this and she's felt bad ever since. 

I also suffer from anxiety but i feel like im a burden on her if express anything that's reacting with my anxiety cause i dont want her to worry. Im also the type of person where im just everyone's rock so ive been used to hiding my emotions for everyone but is it really bad that i do that? I know she's expressed that at times it doesnt help with certain situations with how i have no expressions. Idk.

At yimes i feel like im too pushy to get her to do things like getting out of toxic situations, or by inflicting promises to her (ive had trust issues with peoplr breaking promises) of stopping self harming herself. Ive also pushed hard for her to start eating and putting on weight again but i just feel like im being too pushy and im worried that im making matters worse.

Im just wondering what else can i do to make it easier on her and what things i should stop doing or what can i do to stop feeling like im gonna snap out of frustration cause she's not listening when i know she is. 

Im sorry this is a long first post."
1611,"Hi fellow forum members.

I just googled BPD forum because quite frankly I am tired of everyone telling me to just deal with being alone or just not understanding the pain that people with BPD go through.

Today I am really just looking for some support. The last week or so I have had some excessive dissociation and I am trying to come up with activities or things that I can do to make it better (at least for a little bit) that doesn't include self harm/bad behaviors(clean for two years btw on that).

I also am trying to battle the feeling of loneliness which has also spiked in the last few weeks due to a betrayal by a friend (sounds dramatic but idc I just need to get over it and don't know how sometimes!)

So if anyone just wants to shoot me a few tips on these specific symptoms I would be greatly appreciative. I just am watching a movie right now and I know I normally come out of my dissociation at some point for days or weeks sometimes months at a time so I just want some help.

Love to all of you out there and I think its really nice this exists because I can't explain how BPD feels truly without explaining to someone who has it as well.

1612,"Last night I attempted suicide and was taken to 136 only to be released about 45mins ago back home 
I am non verbal at the moment and I cannot express how I feel and the doctors gave me a notepad to write how I feel I explained the best I could. But they are just saying I am not meeting any threshold for hospital admission as for my diagnosis requires complex needs however I do not feel comfortable engaging with complex needs has anybody else been in a similar situation with their BPD

They also said the police found me in a distressed state of confusion 
I have bruises all over my body from where I'd assume the police man handled me"

1617,"i sometimes feel like i was never meant to be put on this earth. the more around people i am, the more alone i feel. the moment i knew i was invisible was when my preschool left me outside for an hour and when i walked back into the school they said they didn’t know i was missing. i don’t remember the rest of my childhood but i have constant dreams of a man touching my younger self and feeling disgusted with myself. when i was 10 i tried killing myself. at 12 i started self harming to feel numb and had suicidal ideation everyday. at 18 i tried killing myself again, then again at 20, and again at 21. i can’t even successfully kill myself. the most recent attempt they strapped me down for 8 hours so i couldn’t move and i had nurses laughing at me. it threw me into a state that i couldn’t stop laughing then crying then laughing, i was so overwhelmed. the whole time my body was seizing. i have never been able to hold a job down because i give up when times get hard. memories of being raped and beaten haunt me. i once was thrown out of where i lived by my roommates throwing all my stuff in trash bags and throwing my stuff at me. i slept in a prickle bush till i could somewhere to sleep indoors. i was abducted and raped before my last suicide attempt (why i had to be restrained, i was so emotionally upset). my 2 best friends since elementary school left me/blocked me/ erased me from their lives because of my suicide attempts and mental health. i just want to be loved...
currently i am in school and have a boyfriend but i’m scared everyday to lose him. i’m finally doing well but i’m scared to fail as an adult/have a job because i get emotionally upset so easily. i’m scared i won’t live past 30. a part of me doesn’t want to. a part of me wants to give up. another part of me wants to harm myself but won’t because people will notice. another part of me wants to live a normal life for once. i really just want to be happy.
ok, that’s all. i just wanted to get that off my chest. i hide behind a “strong girl persona” but i am so weak and on the verge of a breakdown all the time."

My baby ended up in hospital with unexplained bruising last week. The doctor ruled it was likely to be non accidental. Therefore my baby was removed from the care of his abusive  aggressive father, finally! I dread to think what he has been through in his care. I hope that social services can now see I'm not just a crazy liar. 
My oldest son has gained 10kg in weight and lost his independence. He is constantly exposed to his dads family slating me. 
Social services have ripped my family apart based on the lies of an abusive man. I have been punished for telling the truth and he has been rewarded for lying. Luckily his true colours are beginning to show....
I was at my brothers wedding on Wednesday. It was very hard to be with my family and my boys to be there for only 3 hours. I felt judged and anxious the entire day. My family were great and supportive, reminding me I'm not alone. I have cut myself off out of shame. I need their support and love more than ever but I cant get that voice out of my head that's telling me they are just words, that's what they are 'supposed' to say.... at the moment I'm at a cross roads. Everyone is telling me I've done so well and I'm an amazing mum, they can't believe this is what had happened to me, that my ex has stripped away all that I am and I need to get it back. How do I start to do that without my boys? I know I'm more than thier mum but without them I have no reason. I'm just faking it. 
I have my care review today at 1pm. We are in court for a case management hearing on the 6th. This needs to be the start of a new attitude. This past week has been so demanding. I need to figure out a new routine and recovery plan.

1620,"So background, I love cats and I want to adopt one but not until I’m super sure. Bf doesn’t really like them and is allergic. So I’m kinda conflicted. We don’t live together but I used to be afraid to get a cat bc then bf might not want to get a place together. I’m kinda not holding my breath for that anyway now but anyway. Last night he sent me a picture of a really cute kitten, no explanation. I was like omg whose cat is that. He said its name was simba. I was like oh cute. He asked if I wanted the kitten for free. I said no bc I want to adopt an older cat. And also because I was a little confused! I told him I’d foster it. I thought maybe he knew someone who found it and it needed a temporary home. He said he’d just found it online and then started expressing how he didn’t like cats.

like. What. Was he just teasing me? Or am I overthinking this? I laughed it off last night but rereading it this morning I got a little angry. I was like what if I had said yes I will take him. He said he would have got him for me. I asked for more info, which website, where is he, etc. he says he lost the page and doesn’t remember. I said I’m getting really nervous now Bc I feel like I’m being tricked. He gets frustrated and says he’s way too busy for this right now. I just feel upset. I almost cried. I’m feeling a bit better like it isn’t really a big deal. He knows I love cats but probably also knew I’d say no to adopting it. Maybe just happened across the pic and thought of me.  But like.. why wouldn’t he just say that? This weirdness of his is going to make my brain explode. He’s offended that I feel tricked. Well...then tell me it wasn’t a trick. Geesh!"

1622,"The final piece in the BPD puzzle for me was learning how to control my emotions when I’m Hyper Mode. My personal approach to fear has been to face it, again and again until it is conquered. My solution was to trade in shares, although I was the only one who thought this was a good idea. To say I have struggled the last two months is an understatement. At one point I felt as bad as I did before therapy. Anyway, today everything lifted, all worries are gone. I don’t know what the future holds for me and I’m not really bothered.

I think at the time I ticked a lot of boxes for bipolar as I was mainly down and occasionally went crazy happy then back down again. 
I recently read up on bpd by chance and my god I can relate, the self sabotage is crazy and worry about abandonment is daily. I never feel like me because I don't know who I am in a normal state. 
I feel empty mostly and anxious often, as well as angry and suicidal.

I am just wondering does anyone know how to prevent the weight they gain or how they maintain weight loss whilst being on anti-psychotics?"
1630,"Hey, 
So I've been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder for around two maybe three years. When I first got diagnosed I didn't really understand why I'd gotten that diagnosis but I got on with it and the more I looked into it the more I understood why. Yeh I meet a lot of the diagnosis criteria for it but there's always been a part of me that didn't agree with it. So for a while I looked into other diagnosis but nothing ever really stuck so I gave up and got on with ""getting well""... 

That was all fine for about a year or two, made some slow progress with getting well but I was making progress so that's all that mattered. Since moving into my own place, supported accommodation, I made more progress. My meds got changed and it was looking good. Up until last week when I had a pretty honest conversation with one of the staff about my emotions and how they fluctuate and about how I've been changing throughout the day. One second I'm in the best mood possible and the next I'm depressed crying my eyes out in the shower for hours at a time. 

Now she said something I wasn't expecting. ""To be honest the whole time I've known you (7 months almost) I've noticed this everyday. It's gotten me questioning your diagnosis"".... 
So me being me I started searching for answers again, only this time I found something that may fit. 

Cyclothymia. 

From what I've read it fits perfectly, and a few websites have even stated that it's commonly miss diagnosed as borderline/emotionally unstable personality disorder. I asked a couple of staff members their opinions and all of them agree with me. Ive not really asked my mother because well I don't want her thinking I'm losing my marbles over this diagnosis again. 

I'm just wondering what I do at this point because last time I tried to have the diagnosis talk with my cpn he told me to stop being silly. And to just get on with it. 

Do I look for a private psychiatrist and ask them or what??"

I’m typing this as I’m crying. I genuinely feel so tired psychologically speaking.
Nothing helps, I tried many coping mechanisms and non worked. I know I need to see a doctor but I currently can’t due to many reasons but I will ultimately.
I’ve been feeling like garbage because I have noticed that I have changed and turned into someone I’m not.
In the work place I don’t act as moral and ethical as I used to. I was criticised about that yesterday by one of the colleagues I can’t stand and I felt so inadequate and so disappointed in myself that he had the audacity to look at me that way.
I feel selfish for thinking like that and I always try to remind myself that I’m blessed and have food and education and that others don’t. However it makes me feel so guilty."

1638,"My husband has been talking badly about me on and off for a few months to his boss/friend. But to my face he says how great I'm doing and all the opposites to what he tells this friend. I know because I read his messages. I shouldn't be doing that, I know. I have horrible paranoia that I give into sometimes. I'm at fault for that. Either way, he's not on my side and it really hurts. So much lying and hurtful things, and I don't understand why.

Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to approach this problem? How do I ask him to support and understand me better, and explain himself without me switching into a BPD fit and making everything worse? I'm having thoughts of leaving and making a big mess of this, for now I'm holding it back. I don't think he understands how uncontrollable mental illness can be, but even with that, I think I'm doing very well. So I don't get it..."
1639,"This is probably one of the worst parts of having BPD. Feeling so low and suicidal when you've messaged someone on several occasions and they just ignore you. This is the case of an old friend of mine, whose wedding I was invited to at the weekend. I stupidly drank and was talking about being suicidal to everyone, I apologised a few times today and yesterday and none of my friends are responding. I feel so depressed and loathe myself so much that I want to die. I always overshare and people are sick of me now."

1641,"Hello,

I'm looking for input and advice from those of you who have and/or currently struggle with having a favorite person.

A few weeks ago, I started talking to this guy I met on Facebook. We interact every day (via text, Snapchat, etc.) and I've even hung out with him a few times and had a great time. Most mornings, I'm greeted by him with either a text or a snap (from Snapchat), as he's usually up before I am for work, and we'll communicate from there, on throughout the day.

Here's where I'm struggling, though...

On mornings where I don't received any form of communication from him, I'm taken aback and will usually look to see if he's been on social media at all. If I see that he has, it feels like a slap to the face to see that he's been on and hasn't bothered to message me. I'll then start to question if I've made him mad or have said something that has put him off in some way or another. What I'll do next is I'll wait, for however long as necessary, for him to send me something, as receiving contact from him first indicates that he isn't mad at me or hasn't forgotten about me. The wait can be hard, though, as the anxiety and tension mounts before receiving contact. Once contact is received, the anxiety and tension will dissipate.

Last weekend, I spent the night at his place. We just cuddled, watched television and talked about various things before eventually falling asleep. All throughout the night, his phone was buzzing and lighting up with Snapchats from various other people. I don't try to be nosy but it's hard not to notice. He doesn't really acknowledge them when I'm around, which I appreciate, however, I can't help but feel an urge to know who these people are that he' corresponding with. Last Monday night, he went somewhere but I'm not sure where. I didn't ask, as I don't want to pry, but he made no mention of his outing while communicating with me the following day. Earlier this evening, I noticed that he uploaded to his Snapchat story - clearly he was out for the night - but I also noticed that he has disabled his location on the app, as he doesn't want people (or me) to see where he is. Personally, I find this to be a bit odd. When we first started talking, he indicated that he really didn't have many friends. He also hasn't really talked about the ones that he does have or shared any stories about them. With having notated all of this, I can't help but feel like he's hiding something from me. I know that we're not a couple and that he doesn't have to report to me on where he's going, who he'll be with, etc.  I don't expect that. I do, however, find it strange that he goes silent when he goes out for the night and makes no mention of it later on in casual conversation. I would think maybe he'd say ""Oh, yeah, I was out with a friend last night and we went and saw a movie!"" or something of that nature but he doesn't do that. I never ask him any questions, though, as it's none of my business...but I do wonder and a part of me takes this all very personally. I get the sense that he doesn't want me to know that he hangs out with others or that he talks to other people. If that's that case, is this a person to continue to invest time in? I've really enjoyed him so far but perhaps I don't know him well enough yet? Perhaps it's too soon to tell?

Not only would I say this guy is may favorite person, but I think it's safe to say that I have feelings for him, as well and perhaps that is why this is all so hard for me. He expressed interest in me but due to a rough break-up I had back in May, I explained to him that I couldn't be in a relationship at this time.
So...basically, I want my favorite person as a lover but I don't feel like I'm ready for a relationship at this time...and it's hard to consider the possibility that he could be out looking for someone or talking to others that could potentially take the place that I want but don't feel I'm ready for. I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted at this point. I don't have a history of self harming but I have contemplated whether or not I would feel any sense of relief in doing so.

If you've taken the time to read all of this, I'm very grateful. Input, advise, encouragement and kind words are all appreciated.

Love you all."

1643,"Hi, my brother has always struggled with depression and anxiety and has just told me he has borderline personality disorder. He lives alone and about 3-4 hours away and neither of us drive. All our family live here and where he is he has nobody as he recently split with his partner of nearly 10 years. He dosnt go out or have any friends. A while ago i couldnt get hold of him for an entire weekend after we had just come off the phone when he was 'down'.  I mentioned moving over here a while ago and he said no. But i think he needs to be closer to family and friends here. Is there away i can put it to him without him getting put out."
1644,"I posted earlier a long story about my fiance and I - to make a long story short - I freaked out last Thursday before my fiance was leaving for a trip to see his family out of town on Saturday.  I was really scared of being alone, as in 46 years I have never been alone for 8 days in my life.  There was always my kids, my job, my friends etc. 

I ended up going full bpd meltdown with his brother here after my fiance changed his plans from coming home to eat supper with his brother and ditched me for 6 hours to go hiking and eat out without me.  I acted fine about his doing so because I had just woken up when he called to tell me and not really processed what was happening.  He was supposed to return between 7:30 and 8:00 pm, but when he had not returned by that time, i totally lost it and ended up hurting myself and being taken away by this special tactical paramedic team to the hospital or they said I was going to be arrested, like I was this crazy violent person.

My fiance acted all shocked and kept saying i thought you were okay - but he knew i was having an incredibly hard time at his leaving and I had spent the day before crying, so he could not really believe that I was all okay the next day. 

So here I am in the hospital and I have all of my meds on me and refills i had just picked up and no one was watching me and I was tempted to just take all of them and go to sleep on the hospital bed, but no i persevered, did not want to add more craziness to the situation and asked to borrow a hospital phone. I called my daughter to come to the hospital and my fiance to tell him she was coming and my dad to let him know how bpd had just taken my fiance away from me. 

When I spoke to my fiance, he sounded angry and distant and all he would say over and over was that he would not be home tonight, that he really needed a break and that he was going to try to enjoy his trip.  I wanted to know if he was packing for the trip already and whatnot, but he just kept saying the same scripted words in a voice i have never heard from him 

So a couple hours later I come home to find he has packed most of his belongings, except for furniture - even decorations,.  He packed like he was running away from me for good. 

I tried callling him the next day, had my daughter call him and no response.  I even called his father, that is how desperate I was wanting to know what is going on - was he leaving me for good?  All i got told was that it was between me and my fiance and that he felt sorry for me when I said I had not meant to do what I did - but was panicky at his son leaving me. 

So I have managed to make it 8 days with no calls or messages from him  - I have no idea what his plan is when he arrives by plane tomorrow evening.  I don't know if he plans on coming home or waiting until his brother takes a plan the next morning.  I don't know if his family has spent the week telling him to get away from me.  I don't know anything and it is driving me crazy.

I have spoken to my kids and my dad and brother a lot and everyone thinks this may just be a breather and we will work things out when he gets back.  But the days have been so long just sitting and waiting at home - eating, chores, hygiene are all so hard to do when i feel like my life is on hold. 

I hope he will at least call and I can tell him that i realize how sick I am and that I will finally get the help I need for my BPD - i really thought if I took my meds, found a new job, read and did yoga, i could keep the beast at bay.  I also want to let him know that I will use some of my savings that I had planned on us using for a downpayment on a house, so that he does not feel like he has to support me fully financially, as he has been for the past 5 months except for a few bills that i helped pay. 

I just want the chance to talk to him and figure out our future together and I am petrified that he will come home angry and just wanted to get the hell away from me for good. 

We have been together for 7,5 years and have always been very good for each other - he was my emotional support while i raised my teen daughters and I was his support for helping him quit drinking, getting his debts consolidated, quitting smoking and he even said I gave him a life. 

I know that fears are not facts - but i have been so panicky that tomorrow he will still not come home to me.  I have no idea what he has been doing and thinking the past week and it is killing me."
1645,"To be honest I never even considered having BPD as a possibility. I thought I was always just very emotional. But after being in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend 3 (possibly going on 4) times and breaking it off over and over again, I’ve really been thrown for a loop. I really do believe I love this man and that he’s my soulmate, but after roughly 3 months into any of our relationships I suddenly lose feelings. He’s my best friend and I literally can’t live without him. This loss of feelings is uncontrollable. It makes me upset. Because the love that I feel in those times with him is real. And it’s like all of that leaves me.

But that’s not the primary issue I’ve been having with my BPD. I have had serious outbreaks of anger and have been dealing with bouts of depression for going on 6 years now. Most people consider me “emotionally intense” or “deep”. I make crazy impulsive decisions and I can’t seem to get it under control. Can someone give me advice on how to cope with this?"
1646,"All my life I've felt different from other people. Like I don't belong here and like I never fit in with any type of group of people, except perhaps those who are a bit chaotic or crazy like me!

1647,"Hi everyone.

Very serious post. I told everyone yesterday I no longer had BPD and that is very true. But the truth is deeper. Now believe it or not I know what it is from the inside out and I am going to reveal it all cause id like to help you all get out. The truth is BPD is not what people think it is in any way. They can only see it from the outside and what it projects. As borderlines we feel our way around the world and confuse thought with feeling as such my main concern is that you guys will hear some truth and run from it feeling thats the right thing to do but confusing that with thinking thats the right thing to do. 

The reason I say that is this you naturally run from where you should be heading and this is why you can't get where you need to be nor your validation. So if we're gonna do this youre gonna need to trust me and your gonna need to challenge your natural instincts.

I'm starting up a FB page tomorrow I'll be back with the link. 

Cheers"
1648,"Ever since I was told I may have BPD I feel all the symptoms have worsened. Instead of having clarity, I feel my life has completely unravelled and everything is going downhill. I want it to stop. I've became angrier, more volatile, chaotic and just on a complete emotional rollercoaster.

1651,"Hi everyone,
It’s my first time on any forum so I’m a little anxious and don’t know what to say  🙄 I was diagnosed with BPD two years ago and it’s been a tough journey since. A lot has been self criticism and giving out to myself for being over emotional or being what I feel to be, a horrible person. I put everything down to my BPD now and sometimes I feel like I’m losing track of reality I didn’t don’t know what’s normal to feel or think and what’s not. I hate the fact I can’t control it and fear it will effect me for the rest of my life.  I was wondering if anyone else uses any techniques to assess the reality of a situation? Even though I have lots of great friends family and a bf, I don’t feel like any of them or any one else in my life understands me."

1653,"Hey everyone. 

I am being re-assesed by my MH team very soon after a suicide relapse. I have always been under the impression I am an anxiety sufferer with low moods and depression and this is where all of my actions come from. However my therapist has now began discussing BPD with me, something I had never heard of before. Some of it I feel rings true but I am nervous I'm barking up the wrong tree, and I think if any of you have an suggestions on this, I would appreciate it. In short, this is me
5/6 years ago I went through a horrific bullying ordeal in secondary school whereby I was bullied by my best friends (a concept very hard to explain). This lead to me being alone for my final years of education, secluded from the rest of my peers sitting with teachers at lunch/break times. This induced severe social anxiety. As a result of this trauma I developed severe insecurities in myself and trust issues in friendships. Over time this grew worse and worse and I became encapsulated with anxiety. Intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, crippling insecurities and severe mood swings. I also began to self harm and became suicidal. My relationships with boyfriend's over the last few years have been extremely toxic as I have become overly obsessive, jealous and relied far too much on my partner. I can't deal with them being out on nights out, not texting me when they're with their friends, not sticking to plans. And if I felt as though I was at risk of being abandoned I would be hysterical, doing completely irrational things, harming myself, letting myself be used sexually, basically ""loosing it"". My first suicide attempt was 2 years ago and I relapsed 4 days ago after almost 2 years sober of suicide thoughts and attempts. I have only ever managed 3 months or so sober from self harm. I am highly sensitive to emotions and I feel as though I experience every emotion 110% more exaggerated than what is ""normal"". Once I have a melt down, begin self harming, suicidal thoughts, hysterical crying and exgaertated everything, I find it impossible to bring myself down.

I'm really unsure where I stand on the whole thing and I just want to be on my healing journey again.

and it is going to be hard for me emotionally and also because I hate my body/looks
but I really want to be with him as I love him
I wondered how those of you with BPD coped when you lost your virginity ,how did you cope emotionally?
if this is too personal please ignore

1656,"Usually if bf hurts my feelings I try to pretend he hasn’t. Lately I’ve been expressing myself. He STILL thinks it’s always my fault because I’m too sensitive. Now we’ve arrived at an interesting question. He thinks that relationships involve constructive criticism. In my opinion, too much. He’s always trying to improve me. Or get me to arrive at conclusions or whatever. I don’t want a life coach. I want a person to walk through life WITH. if my clothes don’t match, just don’t tell me. If I’m doing a weird habit in public and I don’t even notice I’m doing it? Don’t tell me like EVERY time. Yes, I have my quirks and flaws. I’m AWARE of them. Id like to not be. I think In a relationship if you can’t tell the other person something good you just don’t say anything unless it’s a huge deal or personally bugging you. I totally want him to be candid. But I like who I am. I like that I don’t always match. I like the way I am in social situations. I don’t need to be taught how to be better. I don’t care if it is for my own good. My mom always used to pick at the tiniest things too and it’s infuriating. She finally stopped. Thank GOODNESS. now bf has taken over. It makes me feel like crap! And so uncomfortable. Who wants their every move being assessed? I get that I wind up sounding nuts because he says something about a trivial detail and I’m like UGH JUST ACCEPT ME. but when all those little things add up it’s annoying! especially if it’s not a big deal, why mention it at all? I’m tired of trying to fit the mold. It isn’t fun and I don’t fit."

So as a lot of you guys know I self harm a lot. The past two or three days I've found myself doing and fantasizing about other things.

This is completely new to me and I don't understand where this desire has come from. Do I need to tell my care team or do I just keep it quiet. I mean I've told my carers at my flat but all I have said is I did it because I was angry, so they don't fully know. I'm just really confused"
1659,all I can say is to trust me
1660,"Hi, has anyone ever experienced this? I am considering going public with what happened to me.
On World Mental Health Day (ironic I know) I was admonished (which means no punishment but I have a conviction) for  a section 38, aka breach of the peace, for threatening to self harm almost two years ago.

The only reason it went to court was because my sociopathic ex partner filmed the episode of my complete mental health breakdown on his mobile phone, kept the footage for months and tried to claim he suffered 'fear and alarm' as a result of my suicide attempt. While filming me he did not call for help, goaded me and stood there smirking (not the type of behavious someone who suffered fear and alarm had exhibited.

I had to go to court a total of 26 times before this came to an end and I was forced to sit and watch the distressing footage, which was extremely triggering, over and over again while my sadistic ex smirked at me. He basically did this as another way of degrading and humiliating me and I had to resign from my job as a result of this as they sent an employee to the court to watch the trial and it was so embarassing that I couldn't face going back.

Obviously the court are aware that I have emotionall unstable personality disorder and complex PTSD. There was also a live stalking case against my ex and a letter from Women's Aid which urged the fiscal not to show the footage, something they refused to take into consideration.

I was wondering if this is something any of you had gone through as I really feel I want to get my story out there and get some help from what happened. It makes me sick that in today's day and age people are still being penalised for having a mental breakdown."
1661,"So I just had a baby a month and a half ago with my boyfriend. Two nights ago I discovered he has been texting his ex girlfriend for over 3 months. Some of the messages were sexual and they even met up two times casually. He was even texting her right after I had my son while we were still in the hospital. He swears he never had sex with her but I don’t think I believe it. Even if they never had sex I’m still incredibly hurt that he would even text her. 

Of course when I first read the messages I was furious and yelled at him, threw his phone, pushed him. I told him I didn’t want to be his girlfriend anymore and that he made me sick. All of those emotions were real and true when I spoke them but now... even though I am still hurt on the inside I want to be close to him again. We even had sex last night! I found out he cheated on me not even 3 days ago and I already let him have sex with me again! I’m scared to not be with him. I feel like I’ve already forgiven him for what he’s done even though I know I shouldn’t. I shouldn’t want him anywhere near me but he’s coming over after work tonight... 

It’s like I’m subconsciously pretending nothing has happened so I don’t push him away which would leave me all alone. He is my only comfort. I’m going to HIM to comfort me about something that HE did to ME. Does anyone else relate to this..."

I'm fighting that so hard. I don't think I've ever fought the thought so much.

I feel like I'm about to break because I know there's always residual signs, in my body language, that normal people can pick up when they're like 'are you alright?' as if there's something wrong with me.

I've got to keep up the act of being 'normal' of being 'stable', even though I feel like something is going to break. I'm not going to let it break though. I can be stable. I can live my life.

my first partner used to beat me. He was smart enough to do it in places that would be covered by clothing. Then came the night that he wanted more, he raped me. Weeks past and he wanted nothing to do with me. He used me.
my father called again when I was trying to be legally adopted by my step-father. Told me that he knew where we lived and would come and harm us.

I hope everyone’s doing wonderful.
I have started a new job almost 3 months ago and I had a horrible experience in many ways, from the wrong job description to the bad treatment that I’m being given (verbal bad treatment).
Now everyday I go to work I literally try my best to be as nice as possible.
These days I’ve noticed that I have become super rude and just basically not in the mood. When a colleague says something to me I just reply in short and with no expressions. I try my best to keep a distance from everyone.
I know it’s a bad thing to do because I might have a better experience if I act otherwise, however I was nice when I first came in and I was smiling and trying my best to be associated with them, but it tired me so much, there’s no satisfaction, I feel worthless so I stopped and basically now I’m just trying my best to show to them that I don’t care about them and I’m not gonna engage in convos with them aside from work.
This has also tired me, both ways tired me so much.
I’m just worried that I will explode one day and not be able to keep on working.
I have tried certain things that might relax me such as going to massage therapy and working out but to no avail.
I don’t know what to do anymore.
Tomorrow morning I have work as well and I’m already dreading it.
I’m just worried that I might be depressed and not know it."
1674,"Fact find hearing started yesterday. Today I the first day I have to attend. The local authority's barrister and my exs solicitor have already tried to rsised issues with representation that will cause delay.... I am not feeling hopeful this will be resolved this week. I hope I am wrong....

1675,How do I get thoughts of suicide to disappear. I feel I can’t take this anymore. I feel lost and empty. Like no one cares. I feel alone.
1676,"I am in a LDR and have not heard from my boyfriend today so far. I do trust him but am also realistic about human nature and so my trust in people can be elastic. I have also not always been so trustworthy myself so for me there's a lot of projection.

Then I went to the park and saw lots of attractive people (on closer inspection, many were not that attractive, I just project again that I am less attractive and they are more.)

Suddenly now I feel insecure, worthless, pointless, insignificant - this big void inside of me. I am just one of many people, how can I be special to anyone? How can any of us?

Can someone please remind me I have worth.

I haven't shared this with anyone else, so I haven't hurt my relationships, but this feels like a safe space to be whilst it fades."
1677,"I've finally got somewhere to live and have been dealing with a really nasty neighbor ever since I moved in, a year ago.

Right now I am sitting here listening to her slagging me off to her male relative (we share a fence and if she stands right up beside it, I hear every word, even when inside, like now).

I'm also waiting for my Support Worker to call and tell me if the Housing Officer is coming today.

I'm petrified this old bitch will get her way and get me evicted.

Either way just hearing her voice and knowing she's actively trying to antagonize me (again) is driving me insane.

Its a trigger.  

I haven't eaten, had a shower, taken my meds, nothing...

just sitting here listening to her voice"
1678,Would that be okay to do? Like. Fully? Lol. I used to i think but as I started to feel connections with people on here I didn’t want to bog anyone down with my weird thoughts and feelings. I also thought doing only positive posts would make me more positive. Which it did. But I still have the same underlying insecurities as before since I never addressed them.
1679,"Hey everybody, I'm looking for some advice on how to handle a situation. As someone with BPD, I'm trying to find a way to effectively handle an ongoing situation without spiraling out of control. So here goes.
 
I was in a psychiatric hospital for 3 months last year. In that time I made friends or rather acquaintances with some of my fellow patients. I made a connection with another patient and they become very attached to me in 2 weeks. They asked me to be their caregiver, I wasn't the only patient asked or encouraged to do it.  However, I was the only one that they persisted with to become their caregiver. After I had been out of the hospital for a bit, they called and messaged me on Facebook quite an amount. They expressed that they love me. That they want me to be their caregiver and lover. I'm someone that has never had sexual or romantic feelings for anyone in the entirety of my 22 years of life. I told them in the nicest way possible that I didn't share those feelings and that I couldn't be friends with someone who wrote to me that they would rather kill themself than live without me. I ended all communication and blocked them following that incident and the short history that we shared. Just last night that person used someone else's phone to call me and leave a message. They asked me to call and let them know that I got their message and asked if we could be friends again. They are a good person and has lived longer than anyone thought they would being that they have a severe physical disability. I'm partly afraid that if i choose to resume communication with this person, that they may reach the end of their lifespan (especially noting that they are 25 years older than me) and that it will push me beyond the boundary again. I want to have friends, especially since I no longer have any, but I know it will be complicated and so frustrating to be friends with someone you know will most likely die in the next few years. I want to help but I need to actually consider my well being for once in my life. I don't have sexual or romantic feelings for others, but I do care about people as human beings and see an obligation to help others despite knowing what it will do to me. I don't want to end up back in the hospital because my pitiful life was once again torn apart. Any advice or recommendations you all have would be so awesome, thanks everyone."
1680,"Hi everyone, I don't think this is strictly a BPD issue, but I'm sure his anxiety/paranoia/etc are adding fuel to the fire. Whenever my hubby is home I can't really do anything without him, for more than a short period of time, or he gets offended (& offended can quickly go from being a little hurt to full blown angry) If I'm cleaning the house after 15-20 I hear ""pay attention to me!"" Which I would think is cute if I could at some point go back 2 cleaning, but he gets upset if I try, like im cleaning so I can ignore him. I'm trying to find a job, something he's frequently upset that I don't have. If I'm going to fill out applications i'll warn him:""hey I'm going to do some job hunting, so I won't be able to hang out for a bit, & will want to put somthing on hulu that we've already watched so I'm not distracted"". He'll acknowledge what I've said & then will eigther spend the entire time trying to show me funny meme's & interesting articles on his phone every few minutes (the only place for our computer is in the living room where he's going to be sitting), or he'll ask if I want to watch : list of movies & TV shows we haven't seen b4, but want to. I'll repeatedly remind him of what i'm doing, sometimes he'll catch himself mid-meme, but it won't stop him from showing me more a few minutes later. If I'm then stern, or upset with him he seems to feel rejected. When i was trying to take online classes last year, I had to just let him feel rejected, which turned into him yelling at me about ""me ignoring him"" while I was in the middle of classwork. We're both very affectionate people, if i'm not busy i'm always happy to pay attention to him; but this has gotten out of control. If he's home I basically can't get anything done (After 10 min of typing this post I hear ""pay attention to me!"" & spend 20 min snuggling with him, & I'd spent the hour b4 this snuggling with him. I love him, it's never a chore to snuggle, or spend time with him, but I need to be able to get things done.) i've tried to talk to him about it when he's in a good mood. He see's where it's a problem but has no idea what to do about it. Any thoughts? Sorry this got so long."
1681,"Just wanted to introduce myself.  I'm kind of new to this world of BPD. I guess getting a diagnosis at 39 made me kind of late to the party - but also made sense of so much of my life.

I'm just hoping to meet other people who share some experience :)"
1682,"I am trying to understand my sibling’s behavior. 
We used to share a room, in my parents’ house. Every single night, she let a tv set on, till late night. In most cases, she wasn’t even watching. If I turned it off, she would wake up, naming calling, and turned it on again. 
Very frequently, when I was already in bed, trying to sleep, she kept saying something offensive, like “You’re a bad person, one day everyone will see you for what you really are” etc.
Sometimes, also late at night, she turned the lights on, waking me up, saying that she needed to get something.

I’ve read that sleep deprivation is a trait of boderline personality disorder, but I struggle to see the motivation for doing that.

I thought (before reading that sleeping deprivation was a trait) that she was just scared of dark.
However, for what I have read, BPD individuals have the habit of interrupting or disturbing someone else’s sleep.

Why doing that? Is there any rational for that kind of behavior? She is a very intelligent and capable person. She doesn’t seem to be disconnected from reality.
Was she just trying to punish me? I know anger is a constant issue, I was wandering now that maybe she was directing all her anger towards me.  

I’d like to understand her behavior. Could you offer some explanation, please?"
1683,"Lately I have wanted change so badly but I don’t know what I want or what could be the best for me.
I have never felt this lost before. I feel like there is nothing me to do and no person is right in my life or care about me.
I feel like I can’t do this if I don’t leave my boyfriend even he is good for me and understands me but same time he knows too much about my disorder and says that my threatens of leaving is just because of this.
So he doesn’t take me seriously and tells me to strict with the same plan as always but i’ve started to doubt that so much."
1684,Post-splitting embarrassment and awkwardness. I hope it goes well.
1685,do i have to be nice to myself or do i deserve to be mean to me?
1686,"Hi everyone, as the title says i'm new here & wanted to say ""hi""/introduce myself. I guess I also want to make sure it's cool for me to post here, I have generalized depression, social anxiety, PTSD, & ADHD; & my Husband has BPD & ADHD. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable if this a board strictly for people with BPD or somthing? I am hoping that I can learn a lot here, interacting with everyone. I'don't like to better understand, & help my husband. I love him, & we have a good marriage that we fight hard for. He knows i do a lot of research on BPD, & that i've been looking for a BPD board; if he ever wants i'll show him everything I write. So I i'm not here to complain, or talk behind his back. We practice rigorous honesty, it makes life easier for both of us (what with us both being a little crazy cakes.). Sorry this got so long, social anxiety makes me want to overexplaine everything."
1687,"Happy update for once..
So as a lot of you guys know I've been having a rough patch this past month and I'm just about over it. I took some time out and took a small break with friends, no phones unless for emergencies you know that sort of thing. It was the best thing I could have done to help my mental health. I've come back feeling refreshed and ready to tackle all my issues.

but the biggest thing I did was talking myself out my comfort zone and tackle my confidence in my body. I started self harming a long time ago and along with that I stopped going swimming... I got trapped in my own head and covered up as much as possible for years.

(added a photo because yeh.took my face off just coz) but today just before we all left to go home we decided to go to the water park. I almost said no and let them go ahead, but I didn't. I bought a costume and joined in... It wasn't easy but I did it. I was so worried everyone would stare or something but they didn't they just left to it......
And I can't be any more proud of myself. I got back home an hour ago and all ive done is cried because I'm that happy with myself. I finally feel like I'm getting my life back from this illness and it feels amazing.

I have one thing to say to anyone scared or worried about how they look.... Don't worry about everyone else if you want to do something or be somewhere or anything just do it. Don't think about anyone else they are all too consumed in their own lives to worry about yours. ❤😁"
1688,Can someone tell me some symptoms for bipolar disorder or BPD or both. I'm mainly trying to figure out if I may need to go get checked out to see if I have one. I anger easily and my emotions are all over the place. There are times when I know the anger is misplaced and I have no reason for it. There are times when every little noise bothers me. Then other days those same exact noises have no effect on me at all. Maybe I'm burning myself out on trying to do everything but idk. I'd just like some symptoms.
1689,"I'm feeling really down about the lack of help available for those with BPD where I live. So far after an overdose I was told off a CPN that I was being 'childish,' been discharged from the NHS three times without ever having a proper assessment, there are no support groups locally and I just can't seem to get help."
1690,"I say the most vile things when im drunk or angry and I turn people against me.  I hate myself and feel like i just want to die.
I always blackout and when I'm told later what I've said / done I just feel so awful that I want to die. I'm normally a good person with lots of compassion and empathy so why do I turn so vile when I've had too much alcohol or when I'm in a rage? Really struggling with this."
1691,"So lately I’ve been in a good mood, social, etc. But I’ve been pushing my bf away like no other. I’m remembering things he said in the past that really hurt. I’m in that “I don’t care, I don’t need you” mood. But I don’t want to be! Because I KNOW I’ll super regret it. I want to feel close and loved and loving and secure. But I don’t feel it right now. Our connection feels empty like I’m just tolerating him. I know this hurts him and I hate that. I feel like I could use a good cry lol. Whatever it is I think it’s rooted in “he doesn’t like me enough” and so in my head I’m like “I don’t like him that much”. But I know I love him very much. Advice please before I mess up. He’s my true love ❤️ Even though he’s eclectic and confusing and so stubborn I could scream lol."
1692,for no real reason I was wondering if anybody else experienced this x
1693,"As I haven’t been around for a while I thought I’d give you a quick update on what’s been happening. 
Well those who have followed my updates, with a LOT of self help I managed to fast track my way through DBT therapy and she was happy to discharge me after twelve maybe thirteen sessions. I’m thrilled as it was a big gamble going private as it’s super expensive. 
I’m basically doing fine, not bad or good just fine. I had reached a position where my relationship was good, I was in control of my emotions and life seemed good. However, there is one area of my emotions I have never been able to control, Hyper Mode. Mainly because I was rarely there so don’t know how to cope, or didn’t. Me being me, I decided to face it and I know from experience the best thing is for it to be repetitive. So, I decided to set myself up as a trader on the high risk AIM market hahaha. Fking hell, it’s brutal lol. My first sell I shook so much I lost £500 before I could type lol. Anyway I’ve been doing it for a month now and have finally got control of my hyper mode. 
That’s the good news. The bad news is the month it took me, my relationship suffered greatly so I’m back to square one on that. 
Anyway, won’t bore you anymore lol. Take care all and I’ll be back when I’ve made my fortune 🤗"
1694,"I was driving home yesterday after dropping my husband off at work and I got lost. However, I know how t get home. There were plenty of streets but when I thought of turning it was as if I couldn't make the necessary turns and when I would think about turning it was as if it was very faint. I haven't been to see a specialist because I can't afford it or afford insurance."
1695,"Hi, I'm new to this website. I joined because my mental health is really getting worse and each day is becoming more and more difficult. I joined this group because I believe that I have BPD.

I wondered if anyone could please give me some advice regarding getting a diagnosis. 

Tiny bit of background: amongst other things, I have suffered with anxiety since I was a child (I'm now 30). A big part of that is anxiety about my health. I tend to go to the doctor a lot (not as much as I used to, but still quite a bit). I do have genuine health problems, but I think I also go for things that other people wouldn't bother seeing a doctor for (e.g. had a sore throat for months, so became worried it was cancer). So now I worry that if I tell a doctor that I believe I have BPD, they will think I am wrong again. And I wouldn't totally blame them. The thing is though, this is completely different. 

I am not worried about having BPD. It just explains most of the issues I've had for years. And I have thought it for years. Others (2 different boyfriends and a family member) have thought it. I just never thought I needed a diagnosis and I also just didn't want one. But now I'm at a stage where I feel that I'm struggling to cope and I really, really need some help - the right help.

Does anyone have an idea of how I approach this in a way in which the GP will take me seriously?

Another question - I have a 12 year old son. He is in absolutely no danger whatsoever (honestly never even shouted at him... except one time when he nearly walked out in front of a car). He's amazing. But does a BPD diagnosis mean that social services will get involved? He's such a happy and stable child (completely the opposite to me). I don't want anything to confuse or upset him. That's another reason I have held off speaking to a doctor about this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks for reading"
1696,why do i keep sabotaging myself :cry:
1697,"I discovered my old Dr believed I have BPD. She didn’t intend on telling me this part of my diagnosis. While having an allergic reaction to one of my psych meds, my Dr handed me some paperwork for the ER doctors. It was an urgent situation, due to the rash which was spreading rapidly. Fortunately, I did not have Stephen Johnson’s Syndrome. This is how I found out I could have BPD; I read it in the hallway at the hospital, while waiting to see a doctor about a rash. 

What I’ve read about BPD has been deeply upsetting to me (though scarily accurate). I been dealing with Bipolar Disorder, PTSD & ADHD my entire life. I wonder if I was misdiagnosed with some of those. However, I’m used to dealing with those. I’m familiar with the treatments and medications, none have worked for me throughout 30 years trying. When I found out my Psych Dr was leaving, I did not want BPD in my chart for anyone else to see! I somehow convinced her to take it out."
1698,"So my care coordinator has been off for two weeks and I've had someone in place of him over this time. They had arranged for me to have the team leader see me as I knew her and thought I'd cope a bit better than with someone I didn't know. 
We arranged two appointments a week, just before my care for went on holiday, as I was struggling a lot. My visits to a and  e had increased a lot and I just all round wasn't coping very well. I won't lie this past two weeks have been horrible, been missing, been self harming a lot and just very very unwell. 
But this week's been especially hard and I've found myself hiding away in my flat not talking to staff or anyone (im in a supported accommodation). 

Yesterday I did something I'm not proud of. My medication is monitored by staff due to risk of overdosing. I took it upon myself to lie to staff and request a few days leave medication... I made up this story of how I was going to stay at my brothers for a few days maybe a week(knowing full well they couldn't check that out because they don't have his contact on my file). They believed me and gave me a weeks worth of my medication, they questioned me a lot though and to be honest I think they knew something was wrong. Long story short I ended up taking them all in one sitting and ended up in a and e last night. I'm medically fine got discharged in the early hours... Refused to talk to mental health and was allowed to go home without talking to them. 

Fast forward to today. I've had my temporary care co trying to contact me, she showed up at my flat this morning and I ignored her... I don't know what it is right now I just don't want to talk to them anymore, I just want to be alone, almost like I'm just letting myself get worse because in a weird way I want to be like this. 

I don't know what is wrong with me right now. 😔 do I just keep letting this beat me or what? I'm just feeling so lost in all this."
1699,My psychiatrist said he thinks i have traits of BPD but not sure if i fully have it. When you are in a low mood do you physically feel it as well as emotionally and mentally? Like the best way i can describe my low mood is it feels like the worst hangover ever and it can last for several weeks.
1700,"It's hard to make steps towards recovery, because the idea you could get better is fucking terrifying, because you are so used to being like this.
The idea of being happy is terrifying. 
It feels like something which could never happen for you or should never happen."
1701,"Hi I have bpd. I was discharged from community mental health team in 2018 without any meeting just got letter in the post. Although I had agreed with them I would return to therapy when my baby was older so I would have time to attend. I've completed dbt and it was helpful. I am still taking quetiapine sodium valproate and fluoxetine. I've been managing with meds and support of my eldest daughter. The past 2 years I'm having flashbacks and difficulties dealing with this. I feel my traumatic childhood is taking over me now and I hate people and don't trust anyone. I am totally isolated. I want to get help for this and trust people again. Went to gp he referred me back to mental health team. Got a phone call from a different department. Firstly she said she does not know my psychiatrist. I would have to contact local services for standard counselling. I need something more to do with trauma. I thought I could carry on from where I left off with further psychology help. I now have to go back to gp again. Is this normal. How can.i discuss change my meds?? 

Any advice much appreciated 🙋‍♀️"
1702,"I am beginning to realise I haven't grieved properly for my nana and my friend. Their anniversary is on the same day which is the 30th September but they died in different years. I've always struggled to let out emotion and with both of their deaths I felt I couldn't let out my emotions as other people had it worse. I have been struggling for over a month with the anniversary coming up and when I talk about either of them to my therapist I just feel myself needing to cry and I stop it. I see a couple of other people from a mental health charity that I see for 1-1 support this isn't counseling it's more a place where I can talk to someone but it does hold the same boundaries that I have with my therapist. I have spoke about my friend and nana with them too. But I do find it hard, sometimes impossible. 

One of the people I  see for support suggested that I go with someone like a friend/ family member when I next go to the crematorium. I feel vulnerable doing this and I hate crying infront of people. I have an awful feeling that I am going to crumble when I next go. Crumble in a way that I am going to be overwhelmed with emotion and try to hold it in but not know how to or how to let it out. I don't really know how to cope/ manage.

I don't know whether I need to accept that I need support and to ask someone that I trust? I just don't know what to do."
1703,"To everyone who has been hospitalised, voluntarily, when did you know it was time?"
1704,"So I went to see the GP today. Ironically I felt stable, and had been for a while, so I said so. So why the heck do I know feel like I'm on a downwards slope? 90% of the time my brain decides to do this it's later on a Friday evening and over 2 days before I can even contact anyone. 

I don't even have anyone around me who will take anything seriously. Or if they do, they want to hide it. I can take an overdose and they want me to just sleep it off so it doesn't cause a fuss. Don't get me wrong, I don't feel like this or do these things with an intention of 'reaching out', but it would be nice if when I did do the 'right thing' and tell someone that I actually got some kind of help. 

Honestly, they bleat on about 'asking for help' but I text my care coordinator 2 months ago (yes I typed that correctly) telling her I was feeling unwell, proceeded to take an overdose (which they somehow found out about), and she still has yet to respond. 

So in theory I shouldn't be bothered about it being the weekend because I can't get any help during the week either. 

I'm literally at a loss as to what to do. There's nothing I can do. The only other option is the classic 'go to A+E' which I am absolutely not doing because nothing will be achieved from it, which makes it a massive waste of resources that could be used on the people A+E can offer a solution to."
1705,"I Find it hard to know what is a realistic or unrealistic expectation.

As I tend to be there for people, I assume they should be too.

What are some expectations you have of others that you find hard to fulfill?"
1706,"How important is honesty to Bdp sufferers?
My ex gf of 3 years was diagnosed with bdp. She got diagnosed summer 2018. Needless to say our relationship was a rollercoaster up & down but after her diagnosis a lot of things made sense. We split up back in January but right now we are on the verge of potentially getting back together. But I dont know how to be honest with her on a specific issue because im scared off her reaction & how she won't see the actual logical behind the situation. But I also dont want to start a relationship with her on dishonesty so im unsure.  Advice be appreciated, particular from any female bdp people or guys who got partners who have bdp"
1707,"So this past month has been hard... I thought I got over it because the past 2 days was really good.

I was wrong and I've come full circle yet again, today has been impossible yet again and I've ended up self harming again. Only now my thoughts are spiraling again. I'm not sleeping (my god refused to continue my sleeping tablets) , not eating and just not functioning at all again. 
My community team had me on daily visits toward the end of last week and offered me visits over the weekend but I refused because I thought I could cope. My cpn is off (comes back in a week) so I'm under the manager for the time being, but I know when he comes back they won't be able to keep up the daily visits. So now I feel like I gotta get my head sorted before he comes back, but it's just not happening. I know I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself but if I don't put that pressure on myself it will never happen.
I'm in a supported accommodation... And right now they are not doing anything to support me. It's 11pm and I've not seen anyone or spoken to them since 5 this morning when I couldn't sleep. My care plan allocates 2 hours a day core support for me and the past three ish weeks I've been lucky to get 1 hour. All I feel I'm getting right now is someone to give me my medication (when I come down to get it) and maybe one shopping trip with staff a week. I'm logging every minute of support and the second my cpn comes back I'll be bringing the issues up.

There's just soo much going on in my life right now and I'm drowning in it all. 😔"
1708,"Hi everyone!
Hope everyone’s doing amazing!
I was wondering if people with BPD suffer from random thoughts all the time, including talking, meaning when u talk to jump from one topic to another.
I have noticed that I’m awkward like that I jump from one sentences to another and realise I’m not making any sense and if I were the other person who’s listening to me I wouldn’t understand a thing.
The issue is, I’m always in a hurry and try to talk fast unconsciously.

Wondering if anyone’s like that.
Thanks a bunch"
1709,For the last 12 months I’ve known about BPD and it’s been the closest thing to understanding why I am how I am. Last time I attempted to medically find out what was wrong I was handed antidepressants. What steps do I take to fix myself without my doctor assuming I just have depression?
1710,"I haven't noticed any posts dealing with Obsessive Love Disorder. It can happen to anyone at anytime but Borderlines experience it more often. The actual science of what happens in the brain is interesting and I discovered that researching OLD was therapeutic in providing closure for old love wounds. Researching OLD could also help Borderlines recognize the symptoms before things spiral out of control. Reading about how other people, men and women, have gone off the deep end into the realm of stalking can be sobering too."
1711,"I dont know what to do. I dont know what's going on anymore. I struggle to cry and let it out.. Anytime i do get upset i stop the tears. Its all linked to my childhood and how i was treated. My tears were never seen as genuine even though they always were. Anytime my eyes water i cant let go. Its like i feel the whole world is watching me especially those that were awful about it in my childhood. 

Below the surface im panicking because i know there is stuff that is there to come out but its not moving. Im scared my emotions are going to bubble out as anger and i cant control it. Im just trying to keep a lid on it. I'm at the stage where im leaning against the wall with my forehead leaning/pushing against it and my hands placed firmly against it and i just cant hold it in but i cant let it out safely. 

I feel helpless"
1712,"I am so sick of being the side effect of a whim of a psychiatrist.

Saw one in June and I was so desperate to be given a medication that would help my intense anxiety. I sat and sobbed in front of him. He was very good. Said he wanted to try a medication to just target the anxiety. He said once we had the dose right, he would refer it for my GP to prescribe. I was so pleased – I really thought that this would make the difference I so needed.

Fast forward to now. I’m on the max dose and it helps. But now the psych is saying that it was only ever going to be for a short time and he won’t continue with it. No tapering, just off it.

My new care co-ordinator is trying to help me but is stuck between me and the psych. I know that my notes even say he would hand it over to the GP so what’s changed??

It doesn’t make sense. I’m finally on a medication that helps. My anxiety has been around for 6 years and increases regularly so it’s never been a short-term condition. I’m confused and so very upset.

I really hate being at the whim of someone who doesn’t know me and hasn’t even taken the time to find out what is going on with me. No chance of a med review as the waiting time is too long.

Shoot me now, please, someone…."
1713,"So this past few weeks I've been unwell myself, but I consumer demand myself with it all and failed to notice what was going on around me. Until last night when a friend came to me to have a chat about one of our other friends. Turns out he's not been in a good place for a few weeks now and he ended up in a and e the other night wanting to talk to mental health. Only he didn't wait for mental health and left, now I'm stuck trying to get him to talk to me and all he keeps saying is I'm fine. 
We was all out last night, as usual for Tuesday nights, and all night he never spoke a word to me and pretty much ignored us all all night. So on the drive back I questioned him, all I'd asked was are you ok? do u need to have a chat. He became instantly angry got out the car and has pretty much ignored all my texts today. I've texted him twice and he's read both texts and just now messaged me telling me to leave him alone and that I can't help everyone so just stop trying. 

He doesn't know that I know about the a and e thing and other things that people have mentioned to me. So I know he's got stuff going on and he's just trying to hide it from me. He's even sent snap chats to friends saying how he's lieing to me because he's knows I have a lot on. 

I'm just not sure how I can help right now because he's not letting me help at all. I really don't want to lose anymore people in my life. I've only just lost a friend a few weeks ago I can't go through it all again."
1714,"I am functioning. Just. My personal hygiene isn't excellent.... my house is a mess. I'm becoming disengaged in what's going on around me. I'm becoming frustrated which makes me snappy and difficult to socialise with. I'm trying to avoid the legal situation. I am grieving for my children and how they are suffering. 
I am having physical symptoms aswell. Feels like withdrawl but dont know if it's just anxiety? Palpitations, shooting sensations in my nerves. Tense, stiff muscles. I also spent 2.5 hours getting tattooed yesterday. Now I have a HUGE area over my right hip which is sore, which to be fair I'm quite enjoying....
My care team can clearly see what's going on. They obviously aren't too concerned though because I am attending appointments as usual. 
The legal situation is intensifying. I am at more risk now. I feel like I am in constant fight or flight mode. Right now I feel like the adrenaline of the day is wearing off and I am freezing cold. I have trauma councelling starting tomorrow too.... 
I am trying my best to be well and look after myself but I'm sick of feeling like no matter what I do it's never good enough, I'm constantly picked at. Anything positive I do is disregarded, totally overlooked.... how am I going to make it through the next 3 weeks?"

1716,Thinking too deeply about feelings for bf again and analyzing them. I have to stop that. I just wanna live my life and be brave enough to just let what needs to happen happen. It’s hard for me to do. I want to make us fit. But we’re so different. My love for him is still real right? I’m not just like forcing it? I don’t think I am. I need more confidence. I need to know ME. I’m traveling with friends this weekend and “with friends Rose” is not “with bf Rose”. Different girl. What if friend Rose is better or more real? Scary thought.
1717,"Did Richey Edwards of the Manic Street Preachers fit a diagnosis of BPD?

I'm not qualified, and you can't really diagnose dead people after the fact (assuming he is dead), but I do think Richey displayed pretty much all the traits, in spades.

I haven't got time to go into detail about why I think it, but if you search for info. on Richey (his problems, beliefs and lyrics, etc.) and compare it with an overview of BPD (such as on Wikipedia) you might come to the same conclusion as me."
1718,"Hi,

I strongly feel my wife has BPD. After doing research online going through all the mental illnesses I stumbled upon BPD & instantly it summed my wife up to a tee. I did further research & everything ties in. 

She see's everything in black & white with no middle ground. Her recollection of events just aren't how they happened yet she will swear blind she is right & there is no getting through to her. If I say something to her in an argument half the time she will respond with something so bizarre which has nothing to do with what we're talking about or how I feel an average person would respond.  I have had numerous blazing rows with her simply as she won't calm down. I keep telling her I don't want to argue it will get us nowhere but she just keeps on getting more & more wound up & nasty. It ends up with me walking out or she tells me to leave.

When I have left for the night I will stay round a friends or family member & she will be texting me saying we need to sort out bills when we split up & to let her know when I will be round to pick up my belongings. I don't respond then 30 minutes later she texts again. Then the other night she text me at 3am telling me when she is dead I will not have to worry about her & I can forget her & she can forget me. I've also had texts come through telling me not to message her as her date has arrived, I don't respond as I'm certain she is making it up then 30 minutes later I have a long message about sorting the gas bill out with her (when she's on her 'date'!). Is this a cry for help? Or does she want to play games & see how I will react? I need advice please...….

She had a bad relationship with her parents when younger which ties in with BPD from what I have read. I 100% believe that is the root of her issues. I would put all my money on it but when I tell her I feel she has BPD & advise her to read up on it she declines. Whether she actually does research it once all has settled down is another thing, she may well do. I have asked her to consider visiting the doctor either with me or on her own but she refuses. She out rightly claims there is nothing wrong with her past & it's her current life with me. My response to her is then you must have an extremely bad temper then because some of the stuff she gets mad about the average person simply wouldn't. We argue over nothing, it's not like someone is cheating or anything major it's just over stupid things that escalate because she makes it escalate.

I guess I'm just on here as I need some first hand experience what it's like to be in her head. If anyone suffers from BPD on here or has in the past please can you just explain to me a little how she could be viewing life. If it carries on like this our marriage will be over. I have family & friends and she doesn't so she will be on her own. I do want to help her but she just won't contemplate my thoughts on the situation at all at the moment. 

Please help me :("

1726,"Hi all!
It is well known I'm not having the best of times. I am being triggered on an almost daily basis, my abuser lives in my area, people who have presented as caring about me have suddenly changed their minds.... I HATE liars! 
I'm spite of this I am cracking on great. I am enjoying my life (to the best of my ability) the way it is atm.
I'm SICK of people being 'concerned with my presentation' and being judged for every action I take. I am doing nothing wrong. I am being me, and keeping myself sane until my life improves. 
This leads from some of my friends becoming 'concerned' that I had casual sex over the weekend. This is clearly an indication that I'm unwell yeah? Fcuks sake! I hadn't had sex for 6 months and I wanted to. So I did. I was in complete control and not at risk at the hands of my partner in any way. I'm sick of people treating me like I'm fcuking stupid all of a sudden. So before I had my diagnosis these people wouldn't have batted an eyelid, now I have BPD it's a 'risk'. Its a risk for everyone to have causal sex. Jesus christ! 
Can anyone even follow this or get my point? Lmao 
Thanks for trying :)"
1727,"Final hearing is in October. My case has been stagnant for 6 whole months now. This is simply down to the fact I don't present they way services want me to. I'm nor about to change after 31 years. Treat me with respect and you'll get the same. Works both ways. I am in court for a direction's hearing on Monday. The guardian has FINALLY raised issue with the way social services (haven't) been handling the case and my abusive ex partners behaviour. It finally feels like I'm not alone in this. Me against my 2 exes, their parents, social services..... and everyone bashing me. I also took advice from you lovely guys and am now supported by my local domestic abuse charity, who have been GREAT. 
I'm on the last leg of weaning off these meds. I feel unwell today but I've probably had about 10 days total in 6 months where I have felt physically unwell through withdrawals. I am down to half a tablet every 3 days.
I'm nearly there. My perseverance has paid off. So many people told me to do this, say that don't do this and say that, you aren't helping yourself by saying and doing this, over the last 6 months I'm so fucking fed up of it. 
Theres nothing 'wrong' with me the way I am. I've done nothing 'wrong'. I have presented me as me, yes it hasn't helped me, but I'm not about to allow people to treat my children like second class citizens and say nothing! If I have an issue with my childrens care and wellbeing you better bloody believe I will tell you and I'll make a fuss if you do nothing about it. These people who have so much control over my life are no better than me. This is MY life. My children were happy and safe in my care. If they looked at me as a parent from the start, instead of assigning labels to me based on my mental health condition, this would have bee over by now. Instead theres a big mess.
This situation has been the most traumatic and frustrating of my life. But everything happens for a reason. I'm now free of that horrible t#&! and him and the rest of them, including services have been proved 'wrong'. Everything was fine til you took Luci out the mix. Now my exes and their parents can be officially seen for the horrible pieces of work they are, and when my boys do come home I doubt very much I'll have much problem with social services anymore, I think they've all got my point at this stage. 
So yeah. I'm very proud of myself for managing to stay stable and focussed after loosing my entire world. For remaining true to myself and proving that no matter if people agree with the way I parent, it works for me and my children and theres nothing 'wrong' with it, or me. You can be a fantastic parent with a personality disorder. I am :D"
1728,"Has anyone dealt with abandonment issues by someone they were not in a relationship with, and had no romantic feelings for at all at the time?"
1729,"I am really struggling to get over having a third child that was unplanned and in my head i was done with having children and didnt want anymore. I was getting to a good place when I found out i was pregnant. I was the fittest id ever been, lost loads of weight and felt settled. I was planning on trying to go back to work around now since both daughters are now full time in school and was excited to have some sort of life back where im not just mum. 
My baby is now nearly 4 months old and im still hating the fact ive had another child. Im back to being obese and as big as i was 4 years ago, i can barely exercise because of the extra weight is causing issues with my knee. Every time i try and diet im binge eating after a few days. I get puked all over all day, he’s struggling with reflux and milk allergies, and my anxiety is so high i don’t want to go anywhere out of the house with him alone. 

I have no family or friends. No help other than hubby who has to work and im really struggling to get through each day looking after the baby i still feel i don’t want. I tried telling my cpn but after she got social services involved a couple months ago i now don’t trust telling her anything so I pretend everything is ok. 

How do i stop feeling this way and learn to accept my life is now awful again for the next 4 years? I feel like i want to disappear."
1730,"Hi there
So.... For about a year, I have put a lot of thought into moving about 170 miles away from home. I have tried so hard to sort my life out here and the issues I have, but it seems impossible. 
I have absolutely nothing keeping me here any more, and I also would be better if financially. I guess for the first few months I would find it difficult but for all the right reasons I would wait that out. 
I guess my questions are... Does anyone know any way of moving that far. Ie... His to find somewhere. Would I book.a trip there and find somewhere that way or is there other ways I would do it. Are there any charities that help with that kind of thing. I would be able to afford rent and deposit or what ever it is simply a case of finding somewhere. 
I'm just so tired of being to fix something that is unable to change here."
1731,"Whether it's my BPD or me, I'm finding it hard to believe I am lovable today. I feel ugly, bloated, tired, low and not exciting or fun enough to be worthy of love. I just want a hug and to know I am worthy of love."

1733,"I’ve always wondered how on earth I wound up so anxious. I always have been. Even as a little kid! But nothing ever happened to cause it. As I get older, I have learned that mental health issues are abundant in both parents families. Both grandmothers were raised by abusive parents and subsequently managed to effectively parent their own kids despite that. (Im the product of two lines of strong women 🥰). Anyway, I’m sure that trauma-induced MH issues pass from parent to child by genetics and subtle behavioral abnormalities when raising the kid. Both parents turned out great, I’m doing well, but my sister and I both have this weird anxiety for “no reason”. Anyone have any info on this topic? I’m mostly just curious. Can we really “feel” effects of ancestors    Hardships? How far back?"
1734,My brain feels free to wander to the weirdest corners and it’s actually feeling great. Self acceptance I guess? It’s been a while since I felt like this. Just enjoying it while it lasts ❤️
1735,"I have recently realised that I have BPD. I am 30 years old, and I have sabotaged my romantic relationships at every turn.

I am currently in a relationship for just over a year with a man who is wonderful and kind. There are elements to the relationship that trigger my BPD, we are currently long-distance, I lost my mother this year and life generally feels a bit wobbly/unstable. This has given my BPD a playground to thrive.

My thought process is, 'well if everything is going to s***, my relationship might as well too.' I get such a feeling of sick satisfaction when I push my partner away.

I am very easily triggered and become explosive, cruel and angry. I tend to withdraw and disconnect completely, and then re-emerge volatile and crying with emotion. My partner has said it can feel like walking on eggshells as he doesn't know what will set me off.

Things that set me off include seeing attractive people (triggers sense of abandonment or that I am not good enough), nudity on television, raunchy music (triggers I am not enough), my partner wanting to do things without me (fear they don't want to be around me - I become withholding when they return which ironically pushes them further away), if they take too long to reply to a message, cut a conversation short or generally don't communicate the way I would 'like' for them too. Basically if they can't always be intense, passionate and crazy about me, I hate them.

I really don't want to destroy my relationship. Does anyone have any advice or can give me any help? Being loved makes me feel afraid, but I crave love so deeply.

I had a very coddling mother and aloof father so not sure if I am how I am partly because of those two extremes."

I saw the mental health team at a and e who promised me a call today.... I ignored the call. I don't want to accept that this has happened, but I know it has and it's eating me up. I don't know if I should call my care team back or just ignore it till I see my cpn on Thursday. I know I'm not right at the moment because all I can think about is overdosing again and or self harming. 

I don't know anymore. I've been out of hospital for 4 weeks and I'm terrified I'll end up back there again, it was 2 years before my last one and I was doing really well but now it's just falling apart 😔"

Im beginning to wonder if bpd is even a thing for me as everyone just seems to think im a complete bitch because i want to be. I feel so worthless, lonely and in pain from it all."
1742,"So I’m a bit new to all this and somewhat nervous about it all haha. But how many people are medicated for their BPD, how long did it take you to find the right medication for you and what is that you take please? 

I feel the older I’m getting, the more likely it is that I can’t be medicated and this illness can’t be managed with medication and I’m not quite sure what else to do really. In my thirties now and been a sufferer since childhood so surely I’d have found something by now?! Thanks in advance!"
1743,"I posted not too long ago about my medication and stuff. That's gotten sorted on Wednesday, I saw my consultant and am now on trazadone once a day and promazine three times a day. 

The past week or so I've had trouble with voices again, only this time its different than the last time. Last time it was one voice and I managed with it till it went. Now it's multiple and they are all having arguments over me and what I need to do, I had enough last night and ended up self harming. I was 10 days without so I now hate myself massively, now they keep telling me to overdose or they would do something. I feel really helpless in this situation right now, I've told my care team about it all including my carers where I live but there's nothing they can do to help because it's in my head. 
The promazine is supposed to help with this stuff but it's not and that worries me. The trazadone doesn't even knock me put at night so I'm still struggling with sleep. I don't know I'm stuck yet again 😔"
1744,"Morning. I think I just need to vent if nothing else. I saw a counsellor a few weeks ago as I had an episode of depression. This has been a reoccurring occurrence most of my life. Anyway he doesn't like to label but he did mention I have borderline personality traits so that is why I've come to this part of the forum.
Anyway I am really struggling at the moment. I became single a few months ago and since then I have been going from one man to another. Engaging in reckless sexual acts (unprotected/extreme bdsm) and I cant seem to stop myself. Everyone tells me I seem like a nice person etc etc but nobody sticks around. 
I have no friends at all. My family all away. The only reason I havent done anything to myself is because I have my children to think about but it's getting harder and harder.
I dont like talking to people as I'm worried they will take my  children off me and they're literally the only things I have to live for.
I'm just crying all the time or I walk around like a zombie. I hate  being this way but cant see any light at the end of the tunnel. I am so exhausted by it all. 
I just feel like I have nobody at all. I push people away and everyone leaves."
1745,"Does anyone know how I can stop being so hard on myself and actually like/love myself and accept that im doing my best? 

I grew up being told I wasn't good enough, always put down, never praised for the things I did do well etc etc. Im now 35 and still don’t feel good enough and literally hate even looking at myself in the mirror. 

Ive just been for a run and this time last year I could run 13 miles. I had my third baby 13 weeks ago and cant even run a 5km continuously without having to walk. I know in my rational brain that just going out and running and even managing 5km even with some walking intervals is good at the moment and everyone says “well done” and “good job” and usually “don’t over do it” but all I feel is disappointment and hate towards myself for all the weight ive put on as im now obese again, how unfit I am and how slow I am compared to where I was last year. 

I do mindfulness every day and am working a lot on anger management, but how do I learn to give myself a break and not feel so much self hatred, especially over things like my running?"

I'm newly diagnosed and have yet to begin therapy, so I'm inquiring about others' experiences with development in this department, and what others have been taught in therapy that was an effective countermeasure against the identity disturbance in BPD."

Feel free to use as often as you need.

I am dissapointed because in my head you would always act as I want you too and everything would be perfect. Unfortunately you are driving and had to stop our conversation and even that agitates me as I feel I can't connect to you. The dark part of my brain wants to say why can't you stop having such a chaotic schedule? Why can't things be perfect the way they 'should be?'

If I calm down I can see this isn't your fault. You have to do the drive for work. And I can tolerate the discomfort and take this for what it is. I am sure you are feeling stressed and uncomfortable anyway and I can try to be supportive for you. It is an imperfect moment, but not an imperfect relationship. All is okay and I am enough."

1750,"As the title says, what do mood stabilisers feel like?  My PDoc has talked about starting me on them.

During our last session I said that my moods had been up and down with some great ups but horrible downs but that I realised that’s life, ups and downs.  She wrote in the latest report that I enjoy this.

I’m just coming out of a 5 month horrible down period and really don’t want to go through that again, but at the same time I don’t want to lose the happy happy times.  I’m feeling really good at the moment and even though I know it’s going to be short lived I don’t want to take a medication that’ll stop me feeling happy as well as stopping the sad times.  Life is peaks and troughs."
1751,"I've questioned it. And questioned it, but yesterday made me think it was factual that my dad deliberately tries to trigger me.

I'm instantly impacted by peoples moods, if someone is off, my mood drops and I become quite withdrawn.

So yesterday we were out shopping. My dad and two of my children. He gets a kick out of affecting my older sons mood, knowing he is easy to wind up. 
This bothered me, I told him to stop. Then I get ""all was fine until he started and then your mood has just dropped""
He stopped. I was calm again and we head to mcdonalds.  I ask what people want, and instantly my dad shut my son down. Suggesting I order something different for him. This is normal for him to shut him down, so I ignore and continue listening to what my son actually wants. 

We get to mcdonalds, I order, go to toilet and when I come back my son is in a huff. I ask my dad what happened and he said he just read the receipt out to my son to tell him what I bought him. ""I told him he got a small drink"". This stresses me at the thought that they got my order wrong and I'd have to go and change it, because I KNEW I had got both kids medium drinks. I ask to see the receipt and plain as day it says MEDIUM for both drinks! I ask why he said that to my son and he said he thought it said small. I let it go, but he clearly lied. 

He didnt want me to get him a medium drink. For no other reason than to control and wind him up I think. 

He then later on accused my mood dips on being my own fault for giving in to my son all of the time. I told him I dont give in and he said, you were going to get him a small drink but because he moaned you got him medium. 
That was never the case AT ALL. I've always thought the smalls are nothing more than a mouthful so would never choose to buy them over the medium.
It was HIM who wanted me to buy him a small, it was HIM I didnt listen to. 
My son was moaning because my dad kept trying to get me to get him what he didnt want."
1752,"I know splitting is a ?substancial part of BPD and I’m sure what I’m about to describe is a classic example but I’m trying to figure out a way of stopping myself, especially at work.

Whenever a situation looks like it is not going to go the way I think it should I get angry about it, especially if it’s going to affect me in a way I’m not happy with.  This can can result in me either confronting it head on (never pretty but I only argue if I know I’m right or moaning a bit and then manipulating other people to fight because they’re a bit annoyed as well.

For example, I recently had some changes brought in at work that I didn’t like.  I knew the way it should have been done but nobody above me would listen to me so I got annoyed and all sorts of people got involved including HR.  HR turned up and basically said I was right and I had already apologised for the way I spoke to my boss (not aggressively but politely and strongly enough for them to know I was annoyed) all was forgiven and I got my way.

Now a week later I’m still finding evidence for other people to challenge the whole situation.  Writing all this down has actually helped me see what I’m doing but I’d like to see and stop the problem before it gets to this stage again.  I’ve been here many times, I’ve been to anger management and that’s how I’m able to be annoyed but polite but I can seeth for weeks until I get proven right/wrong."
1753,"I recently moved to a new city & started house hunting w/ a real estate agent, looking for my dream home and my dream girl. 

My agent & I really hit it off since day one, she is also gay, single & we share many core values. There was instant mutual attraction & intense chemistry but I tried to play it cool. On my list of desirable traits in a partner she hits every one & this is very rare. 

She started texting me casually & invited me to a local event where we had a wonderful time chatting. Then we got into a property deal that was a bad investment so I backed out, which caused some temporary distance between us but we regained the connection. She invited me to her home & literally fed me all the stuff she had in her fridge (lol), and it was the beginning of something beautiful. At this point my feelings for her were intensely growing.

The next day I went into contract w/ my dream home, the one I was searching for but I backed out & not sure why. I think it was a combo of factors, fears, big investment & mainly self sabotage. To this day I have serious regrets about walking away from my dream home & I realized how unstable I am. I also realized how severe my BPD is & how it now negatively flows into all areas of my life.

Then I found a condo that I put an offer on, but had to back out as the HOA was in financial trouble.
At this point my agent tells me our working relationship isn't healthy nor productive & she feels I'm not ready to buy a home yet. She feels there is something in the way of me committing to a home & basically walked away.

I messaged her asking if we can give it another run & she said no but that she will write an offer for a property we already looked at, but not engage in any new home searches.

I can understand her point of view but I feel like she gave up too soon & giving it another try to me sounds reasonable. I also feel if she really cared she would have committed herself to helping me find a property. A big part of my disappointment is besides some mistakes made she's a superstar of an agent & I haven't found anyone even close yet as a quality replacement. I feel I would be at a disadvantage going back out there with a less experienced agent, which I've expressed to her. I also have feelings for her so it's hard letting go.

Thoughts? Do you think her actions were reasonable?"

Like I've been given the answer. CPN says that I've been medicated for depression and anxiety all these years but it hasn't been needed necessarily. All I've ever wanted is to just not be on meds.... I'm being reduced to 37.5 daily :) the beginning of the end?"
1761,"Refused a delivery of baby wipes for my son on Monday, enrolled him in a nursery without me knowing, has asked them to refer to him as a different name, accused me of writing a song name on a piece of paper and sending it to him (the song is absolutely vile, had a nasty message) pulled over as I walked along the street with my sister, nieces and nephews today then pretended he hadn't noticed I was there before shouting swear words loudly and driving off dangerously, with my baby in the car, refused to allow me to attend a doctors appointment.....
And this is just recently. How do I deal with this until my baby comes home? Help!"
1762,"We strayed from BPD and tackled my addictions today. I was praised for recognising my limitations in being able to stop, and for the intention to do so when I’m in a more relaxed frame of mind. 
I will say that the more mindful I have become, the more  I have realised two important things. One is just how important it is to accept your limitations. To do so eases your suffering by reducing your tendency to ruminate. The second thing is there is another layer to Mindfulness, and that’s Awareness. To me, when you are truly aware, it is impossible to ruminate. When you stop ruminating your suffering reduces and enables you to be mindful. 
Onwards 😊"
1763,"Hi, my FP had a health scare a couple of weeks ago, she's had the results back and there just cysts so all is good. 
But my brain is telling me that she's lying to me as she knows how fragile I am and doesn't want me to spiral. I know she's healthy as she wouldn't lie to me, but my mind is working over time telling me differently."
1764,"I recently moved to Oregon from Cali to immerse myself in nature, start DBT & heal from untreated BPD & severe low self esteem.

I'm trying to get involved in the vegan community, grow friendships & eventually start a business. However I have already ruined my reputation with one person who's known in the community as I backed out of a lease before arriving, but paid everything regardless.

And now after being new in town for only a few months my real estate agent stopped working with me as I couldn't commit to a house & was too hesitant to make any firm decisions, a lot of unstable behaviors. Yes my real estate agent literally fired me! 
She's also in the vegan community & my rep isn't good with her either.

Should I go back to Cali or stay in Oregon for awhile to get therapy?

I want to stay but my rep so far is corrupted & not sure it's worth it."
1765,"I have decided I’m being too hard on myself trying to give up smoking cigarettes and joints. It’s not that I don’t want to, it’s just after such intensive self help and therapy I’m too exhausted. So rather than punish myself for failure I’m not going to try at the moment. 
I’ve progressed so much this year in both mindset and health and reduced my self destructive behaviour enormously. BUT as it’s been so tiring I’m taking a month off (I’m just going to focus on my Interpersonal relationships). This will set me up for a relaxing holiday in the sun for a couple of weeks and when I get back I’m going to be intense in my Mindfulness, Meditation and Yoga practice and finish what I’ve started..to conquer my last addictions. 
That’s the plan anyway. 😊"
1766,"Ok, I am going to post the text of two long posts I made (one in a private twitter chat and one in a public Facebook post) that sum up my situation.

Background: 36, severely obese (400-450 pounds or heavier), depressed, bipolar, borderline personality disorder (cluster B, maybe, I think, histrionic possibly), manic depressive, constant anxiety, food addict, living at my dad's for free for a number of years but I know that can't last.

Here is the texts of the posts:

From private twitter chat:

""Maybe...i realized yesterday that it's not a my ability to take care of it thing...I know my dad and his gf want me OUT of this house...at some point...I know he won't rush me...I've been living here for  a loooong time for free just being a lazy immature shit...I know at some point they want me out so they can sell this house and my dad can move in with his gf...but at the same time...I don't know if my dad deep down actually WANTS that to happen...cuz he is waaaay smarter than his gf and they have stupid fights a lot and she annoys the Crap out of him sometimes...even though they've been together for 10ish years...i know he really likes being able to come back here and watch all the smart tv and movies and documentaries and science fiction stuff we watch that he can't watch with her very often...BUT...if I was gone I'm sure he would suck that up and move in with her...and no parent wants their child to stay with them forever...I know he wants me to get out and be independent..,the scary part is I don't know if I myself want that...listen ok I may have told you guys I've only been living here for a few years cuz school but the shameful truth is ive been here since early 2009 after getting kicked out of the last place I lived at on my own (well, sharing a house with 3 other people) for stealing booze / food from them and letting the room I was renting get filthy...and kicked out of every other place I've lived at before then for similar reasons...I've never been able to hold a job cuz I suck at everything or I stop showing up cuz hungover or i stoke cuz of my kleptomania...what if I can't function independently? What if I'm essentially s special needs person cuz of my mental issues and hereditary weight problems? I think about that a lot.""

From public Facebook post:

""I've decided that it's not fair to blame myself for not having fixed two decades worth of bad life choices and depression / addiction based decisions in the 4 months since I've finally begun trying in earnest to turn my life / health around.

Never before would I have thought that I would walk 2-5 times a day for 4 months straight, no missed days (and continuing!) or that I would / could do the amount of deep, long-overdue house cleaning (also still continuing) that I've done in a relatively short amount of time either.

I know I do still need to start making more hard changes, start attending regular counselling, see a variety of doctors / specialists, etc, to get fully back to complete mental / physical health (well, fully back is probably impossible, but at least significantly back), but, the progress I've made these past 4 months has been tremendous and I need to congratulate myself rather than berating myself!

I DO want to be a normal, functioning member of society one day!

I know I have a LOT of intelligence, creativity, skill, passion, potential in me...I just need to start focusing it on positive pursuits!

Thank you all for supporting me these last few months since I've become active on Facebook again, it truly means so much to me!""

Help, please!

Thanks in advance for any replies."
1767,"It's 6am and yet again I'm sat on my bathroom floor crying. I've not posted here in a while because things are looking up for me for once. I got lucky about 5 months ago and got the opportunity to move out of my parents into a supported accommodation, I must say it was the best choice I could have ever made for myself. That was supposed until recent. 

A few weeks ago I hit rock bottom again and long story short ended up back in hospital, it had been two years since my last admission, it was only a three day stay but it was still an huge nock for me. 

Since coming out of hospital I took myself off my medication, I know the risks I've had enough people tell me, I just didn't want to keep taking something that wasn't helping me anymore. It's been almost 3 weeks without them and I have to say I'm not feeling any different, other than the sleeping issues, I still feel as low as when I was on them and still having really bad days and good ones too. 

I've requested to see my consultant to discuss a different medication ect and have had a lot of chats with my care coordinator about my meds ect. Being told that there is 8 people who are waiting on appointments before me so it could be a while before things get sorted. Won't lie it's a horrible place to be knowing I need this appointment and having to wait day to day hoping I get a call, I know I need meds because I'm seriously depressed at the moment and I'm not sleeping at all. It's just the waiting yet again and I know I'm not the only one. So that's one issue that's bothering me. 

Then there's the chat I had with my cpn on Friday, he's got a lady ringing me this week regarding some group therapy, A coping with emotions group more specifically. I can't help but feel like I'm running before I can walk right now, if you get what I mean. As much as I want to be well and ""normal"" It scares me massively, it's like I don't know who or what I am without being like this. I don't know anything but this, the self harm, the sadness ect... My cpn has been trying to do some DBT work with me recently and every time I see him it's like I find an excuse to not do it, I seem to find something else to do and talk about so I don't have to do it. I don't get why I'm so scared of being well and it really really bothers me. I hope I'm not the only one who feels like this. 

Thanks for reading ❤💕"
1768,"Hey!

Just wondering if anyone has had any successful relationships with someone else who has BPD too? Is it possible? I am 9 months into a relationship with someone with BPD too. All is going great so far, we are very supportive to one another and are very accepting of each others darkness. But I am worried that this won't last. Is it possible I may have got lucky and have found someone compatibly fucked up for me!? If that makes sense! Orrrr is this going to bite me in the arse and we will turn toxic and hurt each other? Please tell me it IS possible!?"
1769,"I'm curious to hear the thoughts of others on this... Do you think therapy is always going to help someone? I was sent to a psychiatrist for the first time when I was 15. I'm now twenty-two and I've bounced around through dozens and dozens of psychiatrists and therapists since that point. I mostly hated all of them and the psychiatrists were useless. They kept me on four antidepressants at a time and I was a zombie. I finally found a therapist I really liked a couple years back and she really helped me. She was also the only one who ever told me what I was diagnosed with when I asked. Bipolar disorder, BPD, major depressive disorder, adhd, and generalized anxiety. As of January, I quit all of my medicines related to my mental health cold-turkey and saw her one last time before I stopped going to therapy. (I'm aware I should have weaned myself off instead, but I'm impulsive and choose dumb routes sometimes). She agreed with me, during the last visit, that she didn't think any of the medications were helping to ease my symptoms. My reasoning behind not going back is I generally felt okay and I didn't think she had much she could help me with. I talk about what I'm feeling all the time now and I just don't see how she could help any further.

At this moment, I feel dread a lot. I don't feel like I did when I was depressed before and I no longer feel the need to hurt myself consistently. However, I'm not necessarily happy and I'm very easy to get worked up and make angry. In fact, some reason issues have led to me just feeling angry 24/7, which makes for some really heated conversations with me. I lack motivation because I feel like everything I do is for nothing, since I will die and nothing will matter. I'm aware this is a problem and I'm considering seeking a new doctor for some kind of resolution, seeing as my therapist can't give me medications. I don't want to rely on medicine if I don't have to, but I'm not sure therapy can be useful anymore. I don't know how much more I can talk about my thoughts and feelings at this point. Should I try it regardless or should I just try finding a new doctor and trying some medications? I know with my BPD I will feel bouts of depression symptoms and pretty much life will suck, but this has lasted a long while now and doesn't seem to be easing up. I'm really at a loss and everyone close to me is pretty useless with this stuff because they don't understand my thoughts on it. Maybe no one here will either, but it was worth a shot."
1770,"I am making leaps and bounds with my mental health and am coping with my current situation incredibly well. My CPN, my 'anger management' therapist and my friends have all commented that I am communicating better seem happier and calmer and I have been socialising more. 
However when I have to attend meetings I am 'triggered' and present the 'wrong' way (aggressive, unable to control my emotions) my CPN has asked me to try and make a list of my triggers. I am finding this difficult. What set me off was the social worker telling me staff noticed my ex had a bag of empty cans when they went to his home. She told me he was 'checked on' and not under the influence at that time but had drank when the children were elsewhere. That's what set me off. I think its because the children not being in my care is my worst nightmare, and I know what my exs lifestyle is like. He has also made further false allegations about me. I then spiralled off into all the horrible things he has done and said etc and cried LOTS. 
Is my trigger the abuse I suffered (and continue to) my concern for my childrens wellbeing, the fact the truth hasn't been established yet (I can't bear lying, we are due a 'fact find' in court in September which should help me with this).... or all? Am I missing something? 
In my 'normal life' I am managing my mood and responses a million times better. Maybe it's just the setting of the meeting? Maybe I should ask that I don't attend? That someone briefs me after?
My CPN is coming to see me on Wednesday :)"
1771,"I went through a traumatic experience on Sunday which made me relapse and take an overdose, albeit a 'mild' one. At first I thought I was fine but then effects kicked in and I went to hospital where they did a full check-up, found nothing wrong and said it would just take some time to get out of my system. Although I am feeling a lot better I am still experiencing dizziness/feeling slightly out of it. Has anyone else experienced this? Can it take a few days to feel 100% back to normal? Thank you for your help!! P.S. Anyone worried - doing okay emotionally, seeing my therapist tomorrow."
1772,I could potentially have BPD and i am wondering what medication is used to treat it? I get alot of physical symptoms from my mental health issues. I have anxiety so i think thats what causes the physical symptoms but it could also be something to do with my mood either.
1773,"Because I’m tired of struggling.

And I’m tired of creating drama. 

And I’m tired of working my ass off for no apparent reason.

What is the point of struggling to be stable?

Wouldn’t it just be easier to give up?"
1774,"I dont understand how it will as the help doesnt seem to be there. 

Help is there, in a way. Only it seems to be more on the side of keeping the issue at bay, rather than trying to fix it if that makes sense. 

They're happy to discharge me due to me being able to manage my symptoms well. I manage my symptoms well through a lot of self analysing and self help, along with their help too. 
But...I also know there are things that can cause me to be unable to manage my symptoms. I dont know how to deal with that and there is no help around that. 

Right now I am quite content to be stuck here. Because the fear of stepping forward and facing being unable to manage myself is scary.
I believe if we got to the root of the issues, I'd be able to take that step a lot easier. I am willing, but I know I need help. Only they dont agree and dont want to open old wounds when I'm doing well right now. 

But that means I remain stuck until next time I have a breakdown? Because if I'm managing myself well, why would they pick up my future referral? 

Medication doesnt help. Self sabotage is a big issue and not only do they not work, I can not for the life of me stick to take medication daily. PNR meds I can deal with. 

So I dont see how this will ever go away, unless I'm just happy to remain here. No job, no relationships, no friendships. I cant see that being a realistic happy outcome."

1776,"Hi everyone im hoping i can get some help/advice/anything. 
I have 3 children, the youngest of which is 10 weeks old. 
Ive always had issues with anger and struggle when my husband leaves for work some days. I have no idea why or what it is about that but it triggers me into a rage where I literally start throwing things, ripping pictures and destroying most things i know will upset him. 

Yesterday it came to the point where he came home from work with his parents and took my children away. Id like to point out that they were not, and never ever have been, on the receiving end of my anger and i was upstairs while they were down. 

I feel i have nowhere to turn. I am frightened to talk to my cpn because she has a duty of care and if i tell her im doing this stuff they will report back to social services (whom are already involved after i got classed as a missing person a few weeks ago, i wasnt missing and it was a ridiculous misunderstanding)

I have no idea why this triggers me or what it is I'm even angry about. Not sure if i feel abandoned looking after kids on own or what. Either way it has to stop. 

What can i do to help myself? Im on meds, i do mindfulness but when i go into a rage (which sometimes i cant see coming and is 0-60) i cant snap out until ive exhausted myself. 

Please can anyone help. I don’t want to loose my family and i feel broken x"
1777,"So, I had a bit of a meltdown over the last week or so, as usual turned to smoking cannabis. Luckily I realised I hadn’t fully accepted the situation with my sister, so a quick Radical Acceptance exercise and my suffering lifted. 
That was on Friday night. Since then, on two occasions I have noticed I deferred a decision ‘until I have checked with my wife’, this is totally unheard of lol, and they were automatic thoughts. I also spoke at length to a very depressed friend and was pleased he left in a far better frame of mind. I then noticed something remarkable. I had no emotion. None. On all previous occasions when he has been depressed I’ve suffered too, I I took on his pain, I took emotional responsibility for him. This time, I didn’t. I was mindful..automatically. 
This was a HUGE weekend for me. I really think I have learned to regulate my emotions. It certainly would appear so. I’m so excited (don’t worry not that excited lol). 😊"
1778,"Im with someone who wants marriage and kids just as much as I do and who is chill with my extreme emotions and my BPD traits have thus gone away. 

Like seriously would I just be totally fine then? 

But go Rose because I expressed a calm desire to live alone rather than with bf while “not acting like a married couple or expecting to permanently live together”

I kinda think alternate reality guy is waiting in the wings somewhere and sometimes that is comforting although not a great thought for me to be having."
1779,"First and foremost, thank you to everyone on here for being kind, supportive and understanding. 
As we are so very hard on ourselves, I suggest we all do one thing today that makes us happy, to be kind to ourselves for once, be it a nice walk, a long bath whatever. Personally, I’ve invited my son and daughter in law to join my wife and I so I can take them all out for a meal.

1781,"Hey, each time my fiance is with meci have euphoria and I even give looks at my wall thinking there are mental health people behind it watching me and when I'm alone I still feel like if I am getting spied but I don't pay attention to it and I am depressive...

1782,"I'm down to the last 37.5mg, other than withdrawl symptoms I am feeling good, well mentally at least. I feel sick, lethargic and am struggling to sleep at the moment. Psych says in two weeks to stop altogether :D

1783,"So my therapy ended on Tuesday. I had my last DBT skills group in the morning and my last 1-2-1 in the afternoon.

The group was so emotional – they got me a gift and everyone was so lovely. I know I can keep in touch with them individually but its not the same as sitting with them all in a supported group environment, being able to say anything I want knowing that they get it, that my thoughts and emotions make sense to them (cos they don’t to many others).

I have so much going on right now and the therapy was helping me manage things a bit better. Now I feel so lost and alone.

I know I would never think I was ready to stop therapy and I know I need some space from it to help me use the skills on my own but that doesn’t take away from the sense of loss, even bereavement, that I’m currently feeling.

I want to self-harm, something I stopped doing whilst in therapy but started again more recently. Ideally, I want to run away from everything but I wouldn’t be able to escape my head if I did that so what’s the point.

Part of the battle is trying to believe that I’m worth the battle, worth this struggle. I can’t see a life worth living which was the whole point of DBT.

I have no idea what to do to make this feel bearable."
1784,"I have reduced my medication dosage, over time with guidance of doc.
The really strong emotions are back because there-s no more meds to numb them all.
The chemicals in my head are making me feel really really really bad. 

Should I be grateful i can feel again????? . What's better feeling shit or not feeling at all?? How can I find the other option... feeling good??


Side notes:
I made a dumb post on social media writing about all this emotional stuff and seriously, the stuff i wrote, i made myself look like a freaaaak. Haha no changes there ive always been considred a social freak and naturally i attract hate towards me.

I was on the brink of self harm today playing around with... objects.
I fucking hate the world and I hate myself too because of this fucking depression, and because of my family and what they put me through. I wonder what it would be like to have a normal supportive family. I wish I was just another normal person.

I wish i was born into a stable family.

Also had that realisation im never going to be loved, in the sense of be in a good relationship because im doing something wrong every time. so i may as well get used to it.
when i look in the mirror im repulsed.
it-s sad to feel admiration for someone when you know youre worthless"
1785,"Why won’t these scary and sad thoughts and feelings just GO AWAY. 

I’m so tired of working through them, nothing is wrong. I am fine, my life is good. My family and bf and friends are wonderful. Why do I always feel like crap. I mean I know there are ways to cope and things to do but that’s not how I want my life to be. 

I even take meds and I STILL don’t feel normal. What is it that’s bothering me SO much and why can’t I pinpoint what it is? I’m just so done with myself at this point 😂. It’s like okay I don’t care if I’m panicking or upset. I just don’t care anymore."

1788,"Is there a link between tiredness and having less emotional control with BPD more so than in the general population?

I had a bit of a showdown with my boss last week, probably the first major butting of heads we’ve had in all the years we’ve been working together.  I’ve let glimpses of my angry side slip out before now but they have been just that - glimpses, the odd snide comment etc.  This was bordering on a ten minute argument and I haven’t let that side of me out of its box in the workplace for over a decade.

The problem is though the more I’m getting annoyed the more tired I’m getting and the more tired I am the more often I’m getting annoyed.  Is there any way to get out of the cycle, I don’t want to end up the permanently angry person I was twenty years ago."

Having detached from reality for much of my life the situation has dredged up all the pain and grief from the early death of my mother and the suicide of my other sister, as I had suppressed all these emotions when they happened. So, I’m endeavouring to be mindful, to live in this present moment and to accept all of the pain and sadness of my current thoughts. My plan is to raise the courage needed to go and say goodbye to my sister over the next few days and take things from there. Needless to say, it’s a very difficult time for me. 😔"
1791,"Is there something fundamentally wrong with the partners of bpd sufferers, that attracts them to them, or is it that it’s pure empathy. I have tried on many levels to understand, but realise it’s more about managing than answers. What I really look at is where the illness separates from the basic personality and becomes cognitive, and where accountability  and behaviour becomes normal. That’s why I think everyone with bpd is different. It can be a constant struggle, but my relationship has amazing moments of beauty, and it borders on the spiritual. I bring my own issues of a  detatchment dissorder to this from childhood traumas. Things seem to be getting worse but I keep on trying"

I haven’t smoked joints or cigarettes for thirteen days and instead have cooked cannabis into a fudge. So am I happy with my progress? No, not at all. The reason..I have noticed I still have NO control over my urges. Having just one self destructive trait just means I binge on it. It’s not a good situation at all and what I have realised is that I am going to have to abstain from everything as I simply can’t do anything in moderation. So, over the next two weeks I am going to have to give up cannabis completely along with the cigarettes, and be mindful whilst doing so that I don’t resort to binge eating as a substitute. 
It’s exhausting having one challenge after the other. I just have to find a way to succeed but changing your whole lifestyle is not easy. I don’t really know who I am anymore lol. 🤷‍♂️"
1802,"Ok I took the day off today to lounge around and rejuvenate. So I thought I would make use of my time to go over the content I'm learning in DBT, in case it's of any use to anyone else.

I want to start by saying that the DBT group was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be all of us sitting around discussing our trauma and various ill-fitting coping strategies. The fact is, at least in my class, you are not allowed to speak about past trauma or destructive coping strategies. Instead it feels more like a university lecture, with homework, than any type of psycotherapy session.

Mindfulness

The first week, we discussed mindfulness. When the doctor asked the class what it was, I said ""it's emptying your mind"" ... to which she said ""no, that's what most people think, but it's not.""

Here are the three basic premises of mindfulness:

1. Intentionally living in the present -- resisting the urge to look back at what happened, and instead look at what is in the day ahead.
2. The hard one: No judging or rejecting any moment that occurs. It's ok to notice the consequences and determining what was helpful and what was not from any action or interaction, but you have to let go of things like evaluation, avoidance, suppressing (ack!) or blocking present moments.
3. Detaching from the moment. Work on what is in front of you, instead of thinking how it's always been.

Mindfulness and mindfulness skills can be practiced at any time, anywhere, while doing anything. Intentionally paying attention to the moment, without judging it or holding on to it, is all that is needed.

The Wise Mind

Our thinking tends to be either the Reasonable Mind or the Emotional Mind. The Reasonable Mind is doing things analytically, including suppression, pragmatic without emotional response. The Emotional Mind is ruled by whatever emotion is surfacing at that moment, completely illogical, based on urges. 

The Wise Mind is using both the Reasonable and Emotional Minds to find a balance. You can be analytical about something, but still have compassion. It ties the left brain and right brain together.

To practice Wise Mind, try the following:

Close your eyes and start breathing in and out. Deep, steady breaths.

On each breath in, ask yourself a question, as you breath out, listen for the answer. It's important to listen for the answer and not let your mind search for it. Just breath in and out until it surfaces.


Taking Hold of your Mind

Some of the skills we can practice to help us towards Wise Mind is isolating our sense and focusing intently on one sense at a time.

The first lesson is observation. You can do any number of things, like sit quietly and listen to all the different sounds around you. Let your mind identify each sound and then move on to the next one.

For Observation they recommend:

1. Notice your body sensations
2. Pay attention on purpose to everything.
3. Control your attention by focusing on one thing in your five senses specifically.
4. Practice wordless watching -- watch your thoughts come and go in your mind and identify what type of thoughts they are -- thinking or feeling. 
5. Observe both inside and outside of yourself. The Observations can come from external sources like sight, sound, touch; but you can also observe internally by using Step 4 and breathing in and out.


For Describe they recommend:

1. Put words on an experience. Understand what is ""just the facts"" and what is biased. (I hate that person, vs, that person makes me feel bad). Recognize when you are making interpretations and not actually dealing with the facts. You cannot, for example, identify someone else's emotions -- they feel sad. How do you know?
2. Label what you observe. Put a name on your feelings, label a thought as a thought, a feeling as a feeling, an action as an action.
3. Unglue your interpretations and opinions. Describe Who, What, Where, When that you observe. Never why.

These tools above will help you particularly during crisis mode by distracting your brain and empowering you to identify what is really wrong.

For Participate they recommend:

1. Throw yourself completely into any activity in front of you. Remove emotions from the actual work needed to be done.
2. Become one with whatever you are doing: give all of your attention to the task.
3. Go with the flow. If you focus on the task only, you will be better able to adjust to changes."
1803,Had a little spat with bf. Wasn’t as bad as usual/ i reeled myself in a bit. Still sad that it happened cause I love him. I didn’t mean to do it 😕
1804,"Its too hot. I been having meltdowns today :cry:

I dont like this :cry:

:panic::cry:"
1805,"Hello everyone, I’m new to this. I am feeling so alone and that no one in my family understands me. I have no friends outside my family, as I find relationships too painful to cope with. I feel like I’m a hopeless case and I’ll never be free of BPD. I can’t cope with my change in emotions and my moods are so erratic. If anyone is there, please reach out."
1806,I use a lot of quotes to centre myself and help me order my thoughts. I know this is not helpful for everyone but I have added some I found useful in this thread. I hope they help you as much as they did me ♡
1807,"I named this one ""punish them""

If someone, anyone, doesnt respond to a text, a call, or a message when I would like them too or how I would like them too, I punish them.

I quietly punish those I love all the time. Examples:
1. My husband used to do violin concerts. When he would have to be away from me, I would start a fight, make a scene and ruin the event for him as punishment for not spending time with me when I wanted him too.

2. My boyfriend and girlfriend (I am poly, and its long distance for now) didn't get around to calling me before bed so I Ignored them all the next day.

3. My kids wanted me to get in the pool with them, but my husband tried to throw me in, and it upset me, so I punished him and myself and my kids by not letting myself get in the pool and have fun.

I get it in my head that I'm not worth making time for and then I get so angry because I put so much time into them, why aren't they giving me that time? They must hate me. So I'll hate them first. It never ends. Back and Forth! I love them, they hate me, i hate them, but they love me........

etc.....etc.....etc.....

It helps to name it, identify it, and write it out. i'd love to hear some of your behaviors you are fighting today!"
1808,"It's kind of like agony. I'm obsessing right now. I'm feeling irrationally hurt, worthless, and alone. I am flooded with images and feelings of being left behind. Of those I love growing beyond me. That I'll never learn to properly feel or control my emotions and I'll either hurt everyone I love, or I'll just off myself before I can and still end up hurting people.

I don't know how to release the darkness. I feel like I have such little control of my actions.

I feel like I'm gonna do something dumb and hurtful. This is what happens when I'm hurting. I'm hurting and its gonna send me searching for things I don't need again, and when I do I always come back empty handed and alone. 

There's a pit in ym stomach and a hole in my chest. I feel crushed yet tugged on by these clouds. They are as heavy as the mountains yet lighter than air. They both fill my lungs and suffocate me at the same time. My whole life is an ambiguous mess. A duality of torment and suffering and electric bliss. Or nothing. I can't forget the nothing. The numbness. The robotic entity I have become in order to keep my chldren and my partners safe. I am worried how I might damage them. 


Anyways, I've written down all that comes to mind. I know I will read this hours later and it will feel completely foreign to me. Anybody feel that? Anybody else feel like the feelings you felt 20 minutes ago are hardly recognizable?"
1809,I can't even feel what its like to be a person with thoughts. Im so disconected from my body and my mind. I don't know who I am and I don't even know if i exist. I
1810,"If someone pushes my emotional buttons, it feels like a fire behind a door is welling up and is gonna explode but before it does, I feel ice cold darkness and I hear my mind's resolution to even the smallest emotional trigger, ""I'm never going to talk to them again. I can forget them. They're already out of my mind""

you can imagine what internal battle this stirs within my mind, especially when its someone I love deeply. I have to fight my own body and mind to not walk away. To not disappear. I've disappeared from many peoples' lives. It's what I do. I get a sort of rush from cutting myself out of a life. It feels good that maybe, just maybe, me walking away will hurt them. And then maybe they'll understand how much I'm hurting all the time. But then I realize I probably am doing them a favor by walking away, and I couldn't stand to see someone walk away from me and be happier. So I hold on. Or I let go. 

I feel nothing. Or I feel everything. And what I do feel never feels like its mine. It feels like I was programmed with the wrong emotional code. too bad i cant factory reset my personality :p:p"
1811,People expect me to be perfect and do everything but i cant do everything i'm not perfect like they all want me to be :cry:
1812,"Woke up and I felt like pacing. I woke up convinced that everyone hates me and that I'm not worth time and effort. 

Also fighting some negative behaviors. 
What do you do when you can't sleep?"
1813,"Hi all!
I genuinely feel like I made a bad decision by completely shifting my life to another place and I feel very unwelcomed.
I feel like I would have gained so much if I have gone for the other path that my parents wanted for me which is now clear to me is the best path.
I’m in a new environment and I’m actually feeling detached and frustrated everyday and just knowing that I didn’t take advantage of my opportunities to be in a better place makes me even more regretful.
It’s true that it might be my destiny and might be the best thing for me,however, at the moment it’s definitely disturbing.
I dunno what to do.
I actually feel helpless and occasionally think it’s better if I just give up on life."
1814,"Day 10 of not smoking. Defying the stats. 😁

Who are the smokers that haven't quit?"
1815,"This may not make any coherent sense but if you can relate to any of this?

Not feeling happy, or feeling sad, just feeling like life is passing. Like you're waiting for time to pass.
You don't feel any motivation towards anything, and nothing really matters of what's going on. You realise it is all insignificant. Nothing really matters, you don't even really matter that much. You can just be another person in the world, without worrying too much.

Feeling like life could be a good thing, for the first time. It's not all that important. Maybe you blew things out of proportion in your own head. Maybe people can be alright. Maybe you can learn to get on with them. Maybe you could go outside and do things. Maybe you could, somehow, one day, even learn to like and value yourself.

But that feels totally strange to you.
You don't even know how to reach out for those good feelings, because you've never really had them.

That there can be good. That you don't have to be in pain, or freaking out, or dissociated, all the time.
You don't have to be anything you're not, you don't have to achieve anything. It's enough for you to just be.
You don't have to measure up to anyone's expectations. You're allowed to feel what you feel, and respond how you respond. Feeling like you're allowed to exist and you're allowed to be happy.

You can't really get involved with much, or throw yourself into doing anything because you don't want to get your hopes up. You don't want to make a decision that could be good for you, because you don't want to be disappointed. And what's more, you are apprehensive about losing your mind again.

You're so used to just years and years of confusion and pain. Pain and confusion is all you've ever felt, so how can you be moving out of that mindset? You're almost scared to move out of it, in a way, but you can't even feel the fear. Instead you're just blocked from emotion."
1816,"I must just hit a certain phase in mood or something where I will get an idea and then my mind is off... 

It is currently on a swivel rocking chair. In my head it will be a great addition to my bedroom. I'm trying to fight the thought at the minute because realistically I do lack the space. I would have to remove the wardrobe etc. And it will likely be a waste of money. Thankfully I didnt see one I liked before realising this as I'd of probably impulsively bought one.

It's just made me think of many other times these phases have hit me. Lots of things I have I can look back at thinking ""what were you thinking?"" 

I've started painting in the past and stopped before the job has finished because the mood has passed and I no longer have the energy to complete it, or the motivation since the view of the idea I had has now gone out of my head. 

I think I could accomplish a lot if I stayed in that mindset, but it is very fleeting and that really sucks."
1817,"I really hate having BPD, I wouldn't wish it upon my enemies

Am just so fed up of it :("
1818,"I really recommend everyone to check out this channel:
Dr. Daniel Fox

He does a lot of videos on BPD, it's the only source so far by a professional that I've found has fully grasped every aspect of the disorder without coming across judgemental or making us out to be a lost cause

I've learned a lot of things that I relate too yet never knew the name of or didn't even realise it was a part of having BPD, so I'm hoping this will be helpful to some of you as well

He also has a workbook that I'm planning on buying myself:
https://www.amazon.com/Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Workbook-Integrative-dp-1684032733/dp/1684032733"
1819,Is there like a twelve step program or a workbook for that? I love the people around me so much but I fail because I don’t know myself well enough to create a reasonable separation between self and other. I either see us as one person or I want you to go away.
1820,And they don’t care that they don’t. They think I’M rude. Fine then. I guess I’m just rude. They can all go be not rude together without me.
1821,"My cpn has been trying to speak with my pdoc all day about me because I've been feeling bad but he's been busy anyways my cpn calls me and says the pdoc said next week they going to have a MDT meeting about me, so I was wondering what's a MDT meeting?

I feel anxious and worried about it

P.a sorry if this is in the wrong section"
1822,"I'm finding things really difficult right now. I'm having self harm urges and some suicidal thoughts. I'm not unsafe with my suicidal thoughts but it's horrible. My relationship with my parents is rocky and unstable and I'm at the stage now where I admitted to myself I need to tell a friend that I can trust. 

I messaged her asking how her shopping trip went. We spoke about that and for the first time in atleast a month I sent a message saying ""I am finding things a bit difficult lately 😞"". She didn't reply until over an hour later and when she did, she totally ignored what I said and started talking about how this guy she dated a while ago is now in a relationship. I understand she is upset but she didn't even mention anything about my text. The 2 texts she sent afterwards were short so they wouldn't have been enough to have pushed my text too far up to realise. 

She has sent another text saying she is really struggling and I can't bring myself to message her back. I know I didn't say i was struggling to the extent I am but I wrote enough for her to know I'm not  in a good place. 

I feel angry although I feel this has calmed down since this morning. I feel guilty for not replying but I feel so rejected by it all. She knows I am sensitive as well."
1823,"Day Four - Cigarettes smoked none

Anyone thinking of quitting here’s the plan I compiled to stop.

When I get Hypo or Hyper Aroused

Feelings/fears/unconscious thoughts.

Activation of negative core beliefs- worthless, rejection, abandonment, I don’t like myself, I don’t matter.

Emotional/physiological dysregulation

Anxiety/emotional aggression/chaotic responses/being overwhelmed

Urge to smoke - no fear of consequence

OBSERVE- JUST NOTICE THE FEELINGS

Action choice

COPING BOX

AFTER RECOGNISING NEGATIVE CORE BELIEFS COUNTER WITH POSITIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT SELF

I like myself
I can do this
I am worthy
I’m proud of myself
I am loveable
Look after your health
I matter in the world

POINTS OF NOTE 

Having a strong urge doesn’t mean I have to do anything at all.

No matter how strong the feeling
of an urge it will pass.

Feeling I can’t do it is not the same as not being able to do it.

Take long slow deep breaths
Ground yourself using all of the senses
Focus on an object
Mindful breathing
Awareness
Be mindful. In the moment
Meditation- body scan
Self soothing - Bath, music, cat
Regulate your emotions
Stay active- garden, clean, paint

It seems to be working so far. 🤞"
1824,"I don't know if I am posting this in the right section, but here goes.  I don't think I can honestly say that I love anyone.  I don't think I feel any real compassion for anyone anymore either.  I used to.  There used to be people I loved, but not anymore.  And I'm not talking romantic love, just in general.  I don't think I even love my family.  I don't mean that to be harsh, rather to state a reality.  I feel like I've been through so much shit that I don't want to feel anything anymore, and shut down my feelings as much as possible.  And I resist getting close to people now too.  I never used to do that."
1825,"I went to see my baby today as usual. There is a couple who see their baby at the same time that day. Theirs is much younger. Today I didnt see them come in but I was running 5 mins late as I had a meeting at my older sons school. On the way out they were in the car park. I noticed 2 members of staff with them. They were crying. As the car left with the baby in the mum dropped to the ground. It was their last contact. Their baby is being adopted. I felt sick instantly. I say hello to them and their baby every week. My baby is older and very sociable, they always comment how pleasant and beautiful he is. I've been busy since and sat down after seeing my older son tonight and I can't stop thinking about it. I don't 'know' them, or the circumstances, but I know of the dad, and know he has a difficult childhood and has been homeless for periods of time in the past. I feel like crying for them. It's just so unfair...... I've been irritable and anxious all afternoon and I think its maybe because I havent had the chance to process it? Now I'm sat down I feel exhausted and tearful."

1830,"Hi I'm new here! 
I struggle with BPD and was just wondering if anyone else finds that they are particularly drawn to/create relationships with other people who have narcissistic PD or who are sociopaths? If so was wondering what you think the reasons might be? Furthermore do you find that there are some people who make your BPD far more intense than usual? I am usually quite high functioning and can hold a relationship together despite borderline behaviour on my part but there's a girl I'm seeing who despite it being quite casual with just makes me feel insane. I'm constantly stressing about needing to be closer to her, and the fear of abandonment and splitting around her is much worse. Does anyone else experience this?"
1831,"Hi everyone!
I’m practically lonely and I want to vent about what has happened today at work.
I literally want to cry and I know once I look back in few months I’ll laugh at myself for being over sensitive.
I went to work today and a new senior saw me and I introduced myself and he said “and they put you in this high level even tho your level go to another section?, do you have connections?” ( he’s basically saying I got this job coz of my connections which I don’t have any of, I left my family in another country and moved here alone and I know no one, I’m  lonely)

I was dumbfounded !!! And I said “I saw the ad online and I applied for the job.”

He said this in front of my colleagues and some laughed.
I’m genuinely shocked that someone can say something outrageous like this.
I would never get something god hasn’t written for me and I won’t take the position of someone who deserves it. So why would someone be so mean this way.
It’s funny coz he didn’t even try to understand, I mean I’m on orientation in that department and eventually will go to another department that is considered low, so he can rest assure, however he didn’t listen.
These types of comments do really make me question myself and it breaks me and makes me genuinely hate the person who said it.
He is unfortunately someone who is important for my career if I want to stay in this country.
I genuinely feel sad and miss my family however I can’t bother them with such thoughts.
I know you all are welcoming and nice here and always give good feedbacks and that’s why I’m typing it here."

I'm having a scary head day.
I have BPD, depression and anxiety. Usually I'm quite balanced after years of therapy and meds. 
Recently I spiralled, the worst since I was in hospital 5 years ago (for the best part of a year).

Mother has been living here for 5 weeks, taking care of my kids. I've been getting better. 

Today I can't get a grip and it feels wrong. Like, not how it's normally wrong. Does that make sense to anyone?

It happens, but it usually happens in a blast and then goes. But this is just scary and I don't understand...."
1834,"Hi.  I'm new to the forum.

I was diagnosed with BPD a few months ago after over a year of therapy. 

I'm struggling with it... its hard to say more.  I thought my childhood was ""normal"". Now I'm having some trouble changing thinking that was baked in when I was young.  Survival instincts. Workbooks/flashcards... I'm doing it all.  But lately I've had this recurring thought of what if I can't do it... what if I can't change myself?  I have this strong feeling that I'm broken.  I'm married with kids, but that's all in danger.  

I'm sure we've all had this thought- if I can't fix myself, is my family better off without me?  And I don't necessarily mean that from a suicidal perspective, but none of the therapy prepares us for an eventuality where we don't succeed and have to be totally alone. Nothing I've read is telling me what to do if I can't change myself.  Why are no therapists/psychologists coming up with programs that both attempt to fix you, but also prepare you for failure? I need to come up with a plan B where I'm not able to get past my wounds, and am faced with losing the rest of my family (I lost my grandparents, parents, siblings, and aunts and uncles already...and I'm not very old- its triggered my current condition, or revealed it). 

I'm trying but I feel so broken..."
1835,"My bf and I are back in his hometown. I’m here for work and he’s staying with family and I get to go see them as I’m able also. 

It’s been great. 

A couple nights ago I was at an event with work and the next morning he said he’d been with friends. 

Good!

But I’m all paranoid bc one friend brings his gf around and she and my bf are both very outgoing and they get chummy when they talk. Honestly I think that’s great my bf is always just with me at home he needs friends too. I’m sure this girl is cool. 

But guys I get so easily jealous lol. Now I’m like tempted to ask where he is each night or to try to see him because that night I didn’t he went out with people and told me after. 

My brain is trying to dredge up all the times I’ve felt jealous with him and it will send me into a paranoid panic if I let it. 

So I’m not letting it, just sharing here so I don’t wind up telling bf bc I know he did nothing wrong."

1837,"After my meltdown last weekend, I inquired about group dbt.

I have my intake interview today, and i should be in a group session in about two months.

The courage each and every one of you have demonstrated here on a daily basis has given me the courage to pursue this.

Thank you for your kindness and support. Your are proof there are good people in this world and that we truly are stronger, together."
1838,"I always feel so bad after conversations with him, even though I'm attached and idolise him

I've said and done things in the past that I regret and have apologised for many times, but still years later I'm made to feel guilty about it all, like things that I did as young as 16 because he brings it up on an almost weekly basis and it brings me back to a dark place 

Even when I don't lash out at him for weeks/ months at a time, I'm still always made to feel like I've done something wrong or that any progress is never good enough

I only sent one message to him this week proudly saying that I've managed to not lash out at him for two weeks even though it was hard to, he responds saying that it's a crazy statement to make because there was no reason for me to lash out in the first place anyway, so I feel stupid and ashamed for ever sending it in the first place 

And just before that he sent a long one reciting about how I'm to blame for his suffering the past 3-4 years when there were no messages sent by me recently to initiate that sort of response

The past few months, the only issue has been my BPD episodes, I try to explain that when they get too intense that I can't control them, but he believes I lash out purposely to hurt him when it's more that I can't handle all the emotions / thoughts that wallow inside me much longer

Even though he's the only person I open up too and he worked in mental health and said he studied BPD, I still feel so misunderstood and that I don't deserve to get better

The past year or so I've just allowed the beating of his blaming me over and over because I know I deserve it, but it's gotten to the point I really can't take it any longer

I don't know how I'm supposed to act or be around him, at the moment I'm having to bottle everything up for his well being which I know eventually will be just as damaging in the long run so I don't know what to do, maybe I should just let it destroy me as I don't deserve to be happy"
1839,"I truly hope I have just smoked my last joint and cigarette. I’ve tried to quit many times and couldn’t cope with the pain of giving up.  
However, this time is different! I now have the knowledge of how to regulate my emotions and I have a coping plan in place as an alternative for my urges.

It’s like I can’t be happy till I’ve forced myself to go over all the bad stuff AGAIN to make sure it’s okay to be excited. 

I need someone to tell me it’s okay to love bf, it’s okay to trust him, it’s okay to be happy, it’s okay to be nice and have my guard down. 

Everyone (jealous friends) in my life kept telling me the opposite when I met him and it made me SO sad. It really rained on my parade. 😢

There is a senior at work whom I’m afraid of because once he didn’t like the way I did the job even tho I’m new to the environment and he kind of embarrassed me in front of my colleagues.
Now I avoid him as much as possible.
I know I shouldn’t! He is important and his input is valuable.
However, I’m fearful of him.
How do you deal with fear? Of people and situations"
1843,"Over a decade ago I was diagnosed with Social Phobia. It was so painful I just wanted to die. It got to a stage I was hiding in my own house, too afraid to answer the door or the telephone. However, I faced my fears and over a period of four years I recovered to the degree that I no longer fear any social engagement. 
Earlier this year I got so depressed I just wanted to die again, and after various appointments I was diagnosed with BPD. Whilst gutted I had to face another battle , I was also relieved to get an explanation of my erratic self destructive behaviour. Four months on, I no longer have inappropriate internet relationships, I no longer gamble, I no longer drive recklessly, I don’t drink alcohol to excess and I don’t smoke cigarettes or joints. In short, I no longer have any self destructive coping mechanisms to give me temporary relief from my emotional pain, for the simple reason I am no longer suffering emotional pain. 
I faced my fears of what has happened to me in the past and what in turn I had done to others. In doing so I have completely changed my life from being mindless to mindful. My evening routine now consists of Mindful Breathing, Meditation, Exercise, Yoga and Self Help books. I still have a long way to go but I am so proud of myself. The tenacity and courage I have shown has surprised and delighted me. I feel calm and happy. 
All the above demonstrates one thing, the only thing to fear in life is fear itself."
1844,"Greetings everyone!
How do you manage stress that you receive from not getting what you want or basically being frustrated that everything is chaotic?
My job is quite stressful to say the least. In fact I’m mentally and physically drained almost everyday, I do relax a bit during the weekend, however, I don’t even partially rejuvenate.
I think a part of why I feel that way is because I as someone once told me that I have an idealistic way of thinking and I expect the world to follow instructions and be organised.
I swear I have tried to loosen up and understand that however I failed.
And it’s taking a toll on me every single day. I’m genuinely frustrated and people don’t seem to understand this at all!
My coping mechanisms are garbage."

1847,"So through my entire life I have convinced myself that my mum abandoning me as an infant was for the best...that she did it to be able to work etc. 
My childhood with my grandparents was confusing, lonely, riddled with sadness and I vividly remember not seeing my mum for months at a time.
I would lay in bed at night having left my window open slightly....hoping that my mum would fly in and save me. 
Here I am a grownup with two children, having been with my husband 17yrs....and still my mum affects me.
Coming out of a severe crisis and having had intense help this week I cant help but feel so angry....so very violently angry at her complete disregard to the damage she has caused.
It was my daughters birthday and my mum didnt bother to call her or send a card...instead she posted on my daughters Facebook (dont get me started) and managed to get her age and name incorrect.😥😥

So now I realise I have much work ahead. The diagnosis, so far is BPD, dd and severe depression although I feel more akin to bp symptoms.

Having avoided her and the stuff which happened I now have to tackle this head on. 
God help us all"
1848,"Hi all, new to the forum. I do have a diagnosis of BPD for the last 11 years. Although I'm inclined to agree with the diagnosis but that's another story.

Did once have support, but discharged from CMHT 4 years back because I was well.

I stayed well for some years until mental health declined in 2017 and I tried to end my life. Woke up in ICU. Got very little support afterwards and still dealing with that. Suicide attempt happened after about 9 weeks of hypomania and I was exhausted and experiencing some psychotic symptoms.

Moving on 2018 another period of Depression for two months went onto antidepressants and mood went high this lasted for several weeks until I took a small overdose just to sleep. Had some interaction with mental health team but again it was all about BPD. Saw a psychiatrist who decided I should not have antidepressants again because of how they made me feel - like being on speed and most definitely unable to sleep.

That brings me to now. Depressed for the last 4 months and reached a point where I'm struggling to stay safe. I have tried to get an appointment to see my GP since January but there are never any appointments.

I know I'm going to self harm in order to try and get some support from the mental health team as I feel at a total loss of how to get help. Asking for help seems to get me nowhere."
1849,"So I've always had a turbulent relationship with them. My dad has improved over the past year and home life is better as there aren't many arguments anymore. I've been having psychotherapy for about 8 months now and the past 6 weeks a few things came up from my childhood with my dad. It's putting a strain on things and I've struggled to keep a hold of it. The past week has been difficult and I've been snappy with him. We went to town (me, dad, mam and sister) and my mam opened my car door and it hit the side causing some damage. I was furious with this as my mam is disabled and I always help her out by opening the door. When it happened I said ffs and slammed my door shut and went round to see what happened. We then went for coffee and Itold her that it's frustrating because if I damaged it then it would be my fault but with it being someone else's fault the damage is still to my car. I didn't realise but I had been snappy all day and in an argument with my dad I told him to address it with me at the time but do it respectively so I can try and stop. He said he and mam are scared to say anything to me. I am upset because I am trying not to but it's bringing up past memories of when my dad would tell me I spoiled the day. Anytime we have a disagreement I always feel I spoil things. I know I don't deserve sympathy but i just need to post it somewhere."
1850,"How do I deal with abandonment fear? I struggle with this the most, does anyone have any strategies they use?"
1851,"And of course it’s “all your fault Rosie”. 

Could have gotten way uglier so improvement I guess. I didn’t even do anything. I got pissed for a good enough reason cause I’m tired of being corrected ALL. THE. TIME. It was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

“What do you wanna do?”
“Well I was talking to Jake and he said-“
“Screw Jake! I said what do YOU want to do?”

Umm okay. Apparently it’s my bad for getting angry that I was interrupted and raising my voice. 

I guess it was a very stupid start to an argument. I just don’t like when I’m not listened to. Makes me very angry.

I’ve gone through basically every extreme on the emotional spectrum over the past few hours so I’m going to bed."
1852,"I’m intending to give up smoking joints and cigarettes on Monday. It’s a huge deal for me as these are my last two coping mechanisms. 
I can already feel my mind going into a tailspin so to ensure I don’t post anything inappropriate I’m going to take a break from the forum until I’ve stabilised. 😰"
1853,"So far I’ve managed to stop seven of my nine self destructive coping mechanisms. Today is the day I cut them further, down from two to one. Cigarettes are the next to stop, so armed with patches and a spray I’m going to give it a go.  
Without doubt this is going to be my hardest challenge to date and also the most important. 😱"
1854,"Maybe this is why it’s so difficult getting diagnosed?
Are mental health diagnoses 'scientifically meaningless'?"
1855,"all week I thought Maddie was dying and I have/aunt has appointments I don't want to face
just want to be alone in my room
x"
1856,"Okay so you all probably are used to my anxiety being centered around my bf which is awful cause he’s actually a great person but like I have to vent somewhere lol.

Anyway lately I’ve been keeping calm and kind a LOT better with him and it’s great!

Except I find myself worrying that I’m being too nice. Or that I’m not being myself or I’m letting him change me. I’m pretty sure these core fears were driving my snappiness before. 

Ugh plus sometimes I feel like he makes little jabs at me which honestly aren’t a big deal unless they are right? Like he’s joking, I know that, I’m just like oh no what if my self esteem gets damaged or I start apologizing for stuff I shouldn’t?

So basically I guess I’ve been scared that letting myself love someone a bunch and caring what they think might lead to my downfall. But I’m pretty sure it was ironically my anxiety over it that got me in the weird place I was last fall. 

I don’t know. Is it okay to love him even if he’s opinionated and vocal about his opinions and I just let him be? Hahah. I love who he is. I just find myself thinking I might be too vulnerable and I might lose myself. Because I’m a people pleaser. And he’s sensitive. So I don’t wanna just agree or go along with everything. 

To which he would reply that i on the contrary disagree at every chance I get hahah

Yikes. Thanks for reading if you got this far."
1857,Is trying to drive again. The sad part is I’m getting used to it. It isn’t good. I’m back to being scared although at the same time I’m super sappy and my mood keeps bouncing around. I would take my as needed anxiety meds but I want to save them for the flight tomorrow. I hope I can feel better soon and see that everything is really okay. I hope that it IS all okay. My brain can’t tell in this mode.
1858,"I’m done. I have 3 more weeks of DBT then nothing. The best they can offer is sporadic appointments with a stand-in care co-ordinator as mine is on long term sick. So I’ll be going from 2.5 hours a week group therapy and 1 hour 1-2-1 to next to nothing.

I know they can’t take away from what I have learnt but its not enough. My self-esteem is at rock bottom, I’m constantly on the verge of a panic attack, my long term partner offers little support and I have no close friends.


What is the point of keeping trying. I really thought that DBT was going to be the answer, that I’d learnt the skills and they would give me the life worth living that DBT aims for. I use the skills constantly, I use mindfulness all the time. None of that has helped me see myself as a worthwhile human being. Yes I can identify emotions and work out what to do with it but underneath I still feel like a complete waste of time and space.

Why would I choose to keep going when this, along with fear and overwhelming sadness are ever present?


I’ve failed. I should have known better when I was offered DBT. I should have known I wouldn’t be able to make it work and that I’d get attached to the group and my therapist. I took a risk and I failed.

1859,"I have BPD and I was wondering what medications people take for a personality disorder.

I take at lunch 50mg Quetiapine, 150mg trazodone.

At night I take 300mg Quetiapine, 150mg trazodone, 5mg Nitrazepam and 7.5mg of Zopiclone. 

I also have when needed Lorazepam 1-2mg, Clonazepam 0.5-1mg and promethazine 25-50mg."
1860,"Today we talked about the self destructive coping mechanisms I have in place to gain temporary relief from my emotions, even more now I’m starting to recover, as I have moved from a suffering hypo mode to an elated hyper mode, so in effect I’m bouncing off the ceiling. This excitement has triggered me into a self destructive mode, a sort of self sabotage as I’m trying to self regulate but don’t really know how to. I’m over compensating and trying to love too much. 
My next exercises are to do a daily progress chart on a conscious level, a gratitude journal (15 mins a day) reflecting on what went well, how in touch I am and the connectivity I feel for people in my life. In parallel my most difficult task to date. To stop self destructive behaviour. To document my emotions from thoughts to body sensations, to posture and gestures through to urges. I then have to observe, describe and choose an action choice. Either to follow my urge, and describe the outcome OR to follow the exit strategy I’ve yet to compile. I’m going to start with cigarettes and joints on Monday. If it works I’ll be f*cking amazed. Saying that everything else I’ve followed has so who knows. 

The battle continues.."
1861,"Since being diagnosed with BPD earlier this year I committed, with intent, to recover. Recovery will mean different things to different people but to me it’s having the ability to regulate your emotions such that you no longer feel that aching pain of perpetual suffering. 
I am delighted to say I have reached my goal, I am no longer suffering. Sure I have days where I’m down and in pain, but I know whether it’s for an hour or a couple of days, my sad thoughts will pass and I’ll feel better again. Therefore when I feel the urge to detach, I don’t. Instead I label my emotions, I ride the wave knowing they will subside. 
If I was to name three things that are critical to recovery I’d say they were being mindful (living in the present moment), radical acceptance (accepting what has happened, without judgement) and exercise. 
I still need to work on self compassion, distress tolerance and interpersonal skills, but even if I were to stop my self help and therapy now I feel I could lead a happy peaceful life. So there is hope! Believe in yourself because thoughts CAN change. 😊"
1862,"There are parts of the past I have definitely blocked out, like not even thought about for years, and all the feelings I had during those phases of my life.
Recently I had the unfortunate experience of having to visit the place I had been where I was extremely fragile and depressed, the school I went to. I saw someone outside the school, who was also in my year, but it is now a teacher there. This trigger happened around a week ago.
I wish this incident had not happened and I annoyingly bump into this person a lot. But it does just bring back a very difficult part of my life.
I have tried continuing and going back to normal, and discussed this with my therapist in as much detail as possible in the time we had. However, I could do with some extra advice, I notice that now after shutting out that period of my life , all these terrible feelings, anxiety, paranoia, are flooding back to me.
In a way it is a good thing because to be honest, I had completely shut it out so maybe it became an unconscious source of my depression and at least now I can address it.
But now I am just constantly ruminating over this period of the past. Thinking about it. It doesn't go away. It's crazy"
1863,can it be banned its really bad tonight :cry:
1864,"Bf needs to borrow my car and I don’t mind but it was irking me that he didn’t specify why. 

We tend to argue over such things as I will anxiously demand answers and he will be offended wondering what on earth I THINK he’s doing. Which is nothing bad lol. I just can’t handle his vagueness. 

But that’s just how he talks. I know whatever he needs the car for is legit and that the car (I call her Heidi Hahahaha) will be safe in his hands. 

Laughing off his ambiguous communication and it feels really nice to be loving rather than suspicious."
1865,"Hi, I’m new. I’ve just recently been diagnosed with BPD AND CPTSD, in a way it’s helped because I’ve been made to feel like I’m an awful person but the diagnosis has aleviated that worry and I now know that I’m not, I am however struggling from the affects of trauma from childhood and a past relationship. 


I’m currently on a waiting list for treatment so I’m looking for some advice from anyone who is managing this diagnosis currently.

I had an incident tonight where I tried to voice a concern to my partner and it was greeted with aggression which has made me feel even worse about the situation. Initially I was worried about voicing the worry I had but I managed to talk self round because I didn’t want it to poison my thinking and cause unnecessary harm to our already fractured relationship. 

I wondered if I could share this worry and the way I went about it and see if I have in fact done something wrong. Thank you."
1866,"Is being physically exhausted part of BPD?  I don’t mean the tired after a busy day type, I mean the can’t be bothered to close a window even though I’m cold or putting off going for a wee because walking the 4m to the toilet is just way to far type of exhausted.  I’m not sleepy, staying in bed isn’t going to help me apart from the fact I wouldn’t have to move and I’m not dozing off in front of the telly, I’m just knackered.

I get periods of it from time to time but never for this long or this bad.  Most of my bloods are fine, I’m just waiting for the thyroid one to come back."
1867,My brain keeps shifting into panic mode and it’s really not fun. I just want it to stop. I guess I’ll talk it out with my therapist later.
1868,"Today I stayed in bed web surfing and watching “Dead To Me” on Netflix. 

I’ve felt like shit the entire day. Partly b/c my period, loneliness, and depression. 

I don’t understand how this world works or why I’m here. 

I often feel that I’m not real, that I’m dreaming, or that all of my experiences are a test or simulation. 

It’s hard for me to make sense of my life. I don’t know why I exist. I pray everyday for my life to end. 

Honestly, I don’t have a reason to live. I’m alive today because I’m too afraid to take my life. 

I’m just living waiting for my time to come. 

My parents are alive and I have 4 living grandparents: maternal grandmother/grandfather, paternal grandmother, and maternal great-grandmother. 

My maternal grandmother and great-grandmother are the only 2 ppl I trust. I’ve spent the most time with them and they have never done anything malicious towards me. 

My mother on the other hand is my greatest enemy. 

The hardest part about being alive is feeling alone. I feel like an outsider in each community I belong too. No one understands me, and no one is interested in wanting to understand me. 

I feel disconnected from everyone. I laugh and smile sometimes, but I notice that I hate waking up in the morning. 

Sleep is the closest thing I have to death. I’m overwhelmed with thoughts, emotions, and feelings. No matter what I do, I’m wrong. 

I feel foolish for each time I opened myself to others and showed them who I am. I’m ashamed for caring. I feel like I handed out little pieces of myself and got nothing in return. 

I guess I just have to learn to live with this shame. It’s scary. I feel like there’s this consensus among all those we have experienced me that I’m this crazy, unworthy person, who is never going to be or do anything other than be crazy. 

I think that’s a big part of why I want to die, because I believe it too, and I don’t want to live long enough for it to be true."
1869,"I've been thinking about this for a while, I've known my FP for 4 years, when I first met him I didn't know I had BPD or why I had such intense feelings for him, but when finding out and reading up on this, everything about our friendship was textbook definition 

so I'm just wondering what people's opinions or experiences on having a favourite person are, if it's good or bad, or if it can be good for one person, but destructive for another"
1870,"As my sobriety continues, and my journey of daily exercise and walking hits its 9th straight week (yay me, it's good to finally feel proud about myself again), j find that my now much clearer and more ""woke"" mind has been hitting certain roadblocks when it comes to dealing with (recent as well as over events from longer ago) guilt, regret, and shame over actions (hurtful actions, shameful actions, unstable actions, addicted actions, some of which were pretty bad and happened AFTER I had stopped drinking) of mine brought on my mental issues, which I am so newly trying to understand / learn how to deal with, rather than hide from or self-medicate away.

Overall, since starting my daily walks and exercise 9 weeks ago (battling my way slowly back from severe obesity from my drug, booze and food addicted years), I have been feeling MUCH more positive, and have been reconnecting with old family & friends, but I am still alone with my thoughts a LOT, and my always anxious / always thinking / never able to relax mind just obsesses over my past actions.

""Old Dave"" actions.

Any tips or advice on reconciling these feelings so I can move on, or at least putting them out of my mind so I can focus on my positive new goals?

Thanks very much in advance for any replies!"
1871,"Hey peeps was wondering if anyone else if on lithium for BPD?

Had an appointment with the psychiatrist today and will be increasing my lithium dosage from 700mg to 1000mg, so will have to see whether it makers a difference or not"
1872,"im scared people on here will stop talking to me
im sorry x

i get loads  of support and i try and give as much back

just please don't abandon me x

most RL people have x"
1873,"Same old mental process has started up again, like it does whenever this kind of thing happens.

Partner is going to an event I'm not going to. Alcohol may be involved. I endlessly worry he'll get drunk and do something with someone else, then lose interest in me. I feel it's probably deserved and he'd be happier with someone else and then feel selfish and cruel for hoping that doesn't happen. And knowing how painful it would be if that happened, I convince myself I need to continue to imagine the scenario so it's not so colossally bad when it does happen because I'm already pretty certain it will. 

I could actually go to this event, but I know for a fact I definitely will hate it - having been before. (Leaving out details so as not to give too much about my location away.) But that adds another layer of emotions to this whole thing because now I'm anxious about my decision and think I should change my mind before it's too late, even though I know it will last for a long time and I'll be stressed and miserable. 

I'm so tired of my brain and my emotions."
1874,"that he is going to die :low:
im really really sorry x"
1875,"I’ve managed to get myself all worked up again and I feel scared and sad. 

Yesterday I spent the whole day with my boyfriend and it was a really nice time. At one point though I was starting to feel tired and finding it hard to pay attn to what he was saying so I felt awful like maybe I don’t even wanna be with him, maybe I’m faking this whole thing. But we wound up having a really good day. I got anxious in that one moment and I even cried a little but I asked him to hug me and for us to relax and turn on a show and that helped me and the rest of the night was good. 

Now I’m feeling scared because I remember how I used to always worry about that. That I was faking it and didn’t actually like him. I thought that he was manipulating me into wanting to be around him and I was scared that he sometimes treats me like a kid/ like I can’t make my own decisions and form my own opinions. 

I now know those things aren’t true. But when I start to doubt again they FEEL true. I start to ruminate on the times I felt unsure yesterday and on the possibility that those scary thoughts have been the truth all along. And it makes me want to panic and cry. 

I wish I knew that feeling that way was okay. My bf can be a little much haha. It’s not crazy to think I might be getting fatigued from making such an effort to not be hypersensitive with him and to keep up with his intellectual debates and such 🙈 And then I think I eventually break down and my emotions all flood out. 

I just hope that I’m right that he loves me and will take care of me and I don’t have to be on the look out for signs of tricking me. I don’t want to feel that way ever again, it feels HORRIBLE doubting him and caused me to have really bad anxiety for the past two years. 

But I never broke up with him. We sometimes considered it and then it’d be like wait.. why? And it’d be almost funny and like no way  l don’t even want to. 

How come I can’t just love him and adore him and think positive stuff about us being together? Is it my fear and insecurity or am I missing that this isn’t a good fit?  

I love him so much, I really do. 😢"
1876,"Ok so Lunus helped me realise something last week, and since then my head has been ticking.
I am not capable of holding a romantic relationship. I don't want a romantic relationship. I function a million times better without a partner to worry about. But I want sex. So I get to thinking, there must be other people who feel like this. So I did some research and found a site, chatted to some people (all anonymously) and feel more confident that this is ok for me. Society's idea of a relationship doesn't work for me. Then I stop in my tracks. Is this just the 'impulsive' trait, or risky behaviour? I mean the situation is legit, to my satisfaction, and the rules and safety measures I have put in place make me feel like this is a controlled risk... is there any such thing? Then I think, well does this make me a bad person, a bad mum...  and I feel guilty. But then I feel well no why should I feel guilty, just because I am a woman, because I've recently had a baby so women allover will be disgusted at my behaviour....

Please note that this post isn't for lectures, if anyone is concerned for my safety I will happily explain the measures I have put in place via private message :) thank you for any advice or support ♡"
1877,"I have too much going on and I am completely overwhelmed by feelings of sadness and fear.



My house sold last week and as yet we haven’t found anywhere to move to. My partner is looking at houses that I really don’t like and then dismissing my opinions on them. She has always been controlling but I thought as I had got better at communicating my thoughts and feelings to her, that things were changing. They’re not.



Work is awful. Its busy and I’m the only person who can do the work. I’m terrified of getting stuff wrong and letting people down. My manager is great and I’ve tried to explain how I feel and how scared I am but realistically there isn’t much she can do.



I’ve been having DBT for 12 months and it ends at the end of this month. I don’t think another kind of therapy is right for me and in my head I know I need to give myself some space to put into practice everything that I’ve learnt. Problem is that I’ve become attached to my therapist and to some degree by support group. I trust my therapist completely and I can’t imagine not having to talk things through with every week.



My care co-ordinator is on long term sick and although I have voiced my concern about the therapy ending and having no support, they are dragging their heels about replacing her. So in 4 weeks’ time, I’ll have no support, a nightmare at work and a very dismissive, controlling partner.



When I started DBT the whole drive was to create a life worth living. Well it hasn’t worked and if anything, its less worth living than it was.



I don’t know what to do. I feel trapped in a life I have tried to change and accept and I’ve failed. I cannot cope with life , I just can’t.

1878,"We started as always with a review of the week (another one of extreme highs and lows). When discussing my low mood, I mentioned going through my Timeline with my abusive father. I mentioned I thought he was mentally ill, which explained his behaviour and allowed me to be more compassionate towards him. My psychologist was less than impressed and stated this was not a good thing to do, for in doing so I am still seeking his approval and have not accepted the situation as it really is. Furthermore, I don’t know if he is mentally ill so by labelling him is just another example of me not accepting the situation as it really is. In essence all my behaviour has just been reinforcing the abusers role. I have been feeding the monster! I was told there are only three things he is interested in:
1. Power
2. Punishment 
3. Fear
This behaviour towards me has left me with the core beliefs of:
1. I don’t know who I am
2. I am worthless 
3. I do not matter 
4  I don’t feel I even exist
So the question is how am I supposed to expect others to think I’m worthy, that I do matter and I do exist if I don’t believe it myself? She makes a fair point SO the fucking gloves are coming off. My father will no longer be getting any updates on my therapy or my journey. I am going to stop feeding him. I am going to just focus on my wellbeing. I am going to change the way I talk to myself. I am going to be kind to myself whilst I starve the monster of everything that keeps him alive: power, punishment and fear. I like this idea very much. 
I’m not going to let a lapse get in the way of my recovery. 
I’m staying with my recovery plan, even though it’s hard. 
I’m going to make it. 
My painful emotions happen for a reason and are an important source of information and direction for me. 

The battle continues.."
1879,"I received the most informative and helpful message from @Poppy2014 today. Basically it reinforced my psychologists message to slow down! I need to set limitations on myself, to process what I have learnt before moving on. Although I believe I have made significant progress, the stumbling block is going to be, as it is for many, to accept myself as I am, to be kind to myself and to believe that I matter. Therefore, I am going to focus solely on things that will improve my wellbeing, as I think this will help me in thinking I’m actually okay as I am. I’m adding certain things to the list I’ve already been doing, do now it’s:

1. Limited caffeine 
2. Healthy diet 
3. Exercise 
4. Meditation 
5. Yoga

I’ll know if this is working if I start reducing and eventually stop my self destructive traits. I’ll keep you posted. 🙏"

1882,I’m 35 and just found out I have BPD. I tried telling my mom since I had to move in with her since moneys tight and jobs are hard to find with my degrees. She didn’t want to hear it and doesn’t think this is anything serious. She then went on to say I’m more like her sister making up things that are wrong with her. I feel alone more than ever and it’s eating at me. I have no other family or dad/dads side. I don’t know what to do. I just discovered this forum last night and was hoping to reach out in some way.
1883,"I guess what the title says, I feel completely and utterly drained. Physically and emotionally, I feel like I've really spiraled again recently and as usual it happened extremely quickly and unexpectedly. 

I've been mega impulsive again recently as well, the other day I went and sat on a bridge ledge at 3am something that I hadn't done in a while and again started with the self harm. 

My care Co knows about my self hard she didn't really say much, she doesn't know about the bridge thing. Haven't seen her since the other week. I don't know I feel like I can't collect my thoughts properly at the moment either, I cried after one of my favorite Instagram cats died the other day it was really sad and got to me I feel like everything is getting to me again. 

Sorry for a depressing post I just need to write somewhere because I feel like no one is listening to me recently within the mental health team."

1885,"Hi all :) hope everyone is feeling well today ♡
So I've been doing a lot of thinking and understanding myself since I got my diagnosis and joined the forum (I have all of you to thank for that :thanks:) 
I've always been interested in mental health nursing as a career and have a wealth of professional experience and personal experience that would make this an excellent fit for me. 
My local university is now offering a 'top up' course for people with degrees in other health and social careers and experience. A year long course that would enable me to take a masters in general nursing or a speciality (mental health in my case). I have applied in the past to train to be a nurse (when it was funded by the NHS) but did not have as much experience professionally and certainly not personally. 
I plan to 'register my interest' in this course to start in a different academic year (I have too much going on to focus on something as important as study right now).
I am thinking in the meantime that I will look into starting a childrens mental health group or possibly charity in my area to work in conjunction with the local authority and people in the community. I have a plan and people who could help/support me with this through previous professional relationships. 
Anyway, does anyone think I am being impulsive or unrealistic? That I have come back to this focus because of my recent personal trauma?
TIA ♡"

1888,Every month before I start my period my anxiety and obsession with fears of being abandoned or not being good enough go through the roof. I’m trying to avoid being a clingy mess. What do you guys use to help you? I can use like a partial dose of Xanax but (shh) it’s not actually prescribed to me so I know I shouldn’t.

1889,"Hi everyone!
Hope all is well.
Do you ever feel guilty? Say you wanna buy an item then you feel guilty because you know there are unfortunate people out there who can’t afford it so you refrain from buying. Same goes with going out for example, I feel like I shouldn’t go out and have fun and even when I do I can’t stop feeling bad.
I’ve tried telling close people to me about this feeling but they can’t relate and say that they don’t feel THAT guilty.
I’m curious, has anyone experienced this before?
I’ve been like this for a long time but sometimes it’s really bad and sometimes I overcome it."
1890,"So today is the day. I have asked the man who has caused me so much suffering, my father, to come to see me. I am going to take him through my Timeline from my very first trauma and explain how his actions have affected me. I’m super fucking nervous and shaking with anxiety 😬 but he needs to know why I’ve hated him so much and acted the way I have. I don’t really care what his reaction is to today, this is about me and my wellbeing."
1891,"I had to delete all my Social Media. Initially I found it was an excellent way to detach from life, but like everything I do my behaviour just led to more suffering. However, coming off it has left me feeling so lonely and isolated. 
I then found this forum, full of troubled yet kind, loving, understanding and supportive people. It filled a hole in my life and I thought it was the answer to assist in my recovery. My initial posts were full of self doubt and anxiety. Will anyone like me, will anyone care?  My fears were allayed and all seemed well. There are wonderful people on here. BUT I now find I’m super critical of myself for posting too much. I battle with myself everyday to ensure I control my urge to rapidly attach to people. Furthermore, I feel others pain so deeply as if it were my own. 
So therein lies the problem and the dilemma I face. Do the benefits of me being on here outweigh the pain it causes me? Am I on here because I feel I don’t matter anywhere else? Do I help people by posting updates on my recovery, or is it me with just some pathetic attempt for sympathy, a desperate need to liked, to be understood by someone..anyone?
I don’t know the answers to these questions so I’m going to discuss it with my therapist later today. It’s highly probable she’ll say it’s best that I come off the forum, certainly until I can cope with my emotional reasoning. I know this would undoubtedly leave me feeling very alone, worried and afraid of what the future holds. 
If I have to come off I’ll be heartbroken as I’ve never received such kindness from people before, yet if I stay on I’ll probably end up being heartbroken too. At least coming off would give you all some peace. 🙈"
1892,"Hey peeps this paranoia is killing me, I keep getting voices telling me something bad is going to happen

I get visions in my mind of what might happen

It's driving me mad and I'm going mental

Anyone else suffering from this too?"
1893,"I’m feeling very sad today which I suppose was to be expected after confronting my father yesterday. Not only was I addressing my abuser I was also dredging up the past by going through my timeline again. It was and is a very painful process, but necessary to clear my mind. I’m just about keeping myself in a pain band rather than truly suffering so I see that as progress. 
Anyway, I have to get my act together as it’s my birthday today. Hopefully my emotions will stabilise and I can enjoy some of it."
1894,"when I am not I feel empty and lost and can't settle
I think he is my favourite person
a bit awkward as you all know I mean hermit but I have nowhere else to post xx"
1895,"I don't know where to begin. I'm just going to try and get it out. Basically I started yoga about a year and a half ago. The teacher is great and the yoga has helped my mental health and adhd. I have had access bars therapy with her and she has been really generous and given me free sessions. About 3 months ago i went through a period of hell where I was suicidal. She helped me when she didn't need to. She was the one person that helped me that wasn't paid to help me like the people I see at cmht. She made me feel like someone genuinely cared. She made such a difference to my frame of mind that I didn't go through with suicide. 

At yoga on Monday she announced to the class that she is leaving in 3 weeks time. I'm devastated. I feel like I am being over the top becuase I really will miss her. She knows all about my mental health so with having bpd I'm worried my feelings are too much. I feel like whatever I say is going to be taken the wrong way. I don't even know whether it's okay to tell her im going to miss her. I managed to keep in my tears in and smile as she was happy as well as sad to be leaving, when she announced it to us all but I'm just finding it difficult. I feel pathetic and like I need to grow up. It's like how do I thank someone that has helped save my life. 

I asked if I could see her for a chat and she is OK with this. I am of course happy for her and she seems really excited to be leaving for a new job but i just want to thank her and not be pathetic in the process."
1896,"Those who follow me will be aware I did some radical acceptance exercises recently. Well today I thought I would try the Monk exercise (posted earlier today). 
So it was a beautiful day, I sat in my garden on my swing seat and said to myself ‘fill your mind with thoughts’. The most incredible thing happened. I couldn’t think of anything. There wasn’t a single thought. Nothing. I heard cutlery and dishes being moved about by a neighbour. I heard the bark of a dog in the distance. I heard birds singing in the trees. That’s all. 
After 48 years of suffering I’ve just had my first ever day of total relaxation free of thought. This goes down as the best day of my life. 😊"
1897,"So I’m four sessions into therapy and here’s what I have learnt about myself. 

1. I take responsibility for other people’s emotions and use emotional reasoning 
2. I have to have control 
3. I expect rather than hope 
4. I am driven by urges
5. I detach from situations 
6. I have no fear of consequence 
7. I set no limitations 
8. I do not dislike myself, I dislike my behaviour

I now know why I have developed these traits and think I understand why I have had such self destructive coping mechanisms. When you’re subjected to cruelty, abuse or abandonment (in my case all three), you are left with a feeling that you are worthless, nobody cares about you, you are unloveable. You turn to self harm, alcohol or drugs to temporarily reduce your pain, you detach because reality is too painful. You have no fear of consequence because you feel as it you don’t matter, so if your behaviour damages you or kills you, who cares. 
This is the battle. To convince yourself you DO matter. You can love and be loved. You CAN live without perpetual suffering. You CAN regulate your emotions. To be kinder to yourself. 
The battle continues.."
1898,"Hi, I'm male, 31 and new to the forum.

I hope someone can relate to this and maybe give some advice please.

I have been in a rocky, on-off relationship since 2017 which ended around December/January. That was the last time we had contact.

When I first met her it felt like my world was finally complete. I'd previously been with someone for 7 years and never felt the way I did with this girl. She asked me to get help. At first I thought it was all her picking fault and it was just depression or my diabetes being out of whack like I'd been told by doctors. Part of me was also scared to admit I had issues, having just met someone that meant so much, the last thing I wanted was to be labelled as psycho. Also a man is supposed to be able to deal with these things themselves right?

I was also extremely jealous, something I hadn't experienced before. I tried to explain to her that I felt unable to believe she was with me and I wasn't good enough. Fear of losing her was terrible. It ended up with me being controlling and constantly assuming she was talking to someone else. I'd be worrying she was going to open her eyes and leave. I knew this was wrong but I just couldn't stop myself.

She had had enough several times but always gave me another chance. I had sorted myself out, or so I thought. I had been given countless different medications or increased amounts... most worked for a short time.... some made things much worse. On one particular tablet I threw a mug at my sister's head, something I felt instantly terrible about and regret to this day. I went back to my GP the next day and she changed tablets again and also made an appointment. From there I was assessed for autism, ADHD and an anxiety disorder.

Each time I felt ecstatic, I was finally getting an answer and could do something about this mess that I was in. None ever worked and just added to the depression I felt, making things ten times worse. She has said recently I should have got help when she asked and doesn't understand that the more I tried it seemed the further away I got and I gave up several times.

I made a promise to her last time that I would see it through. Several referrals have been made since, I was told I wasn't right for their service. Referred and then I was told it was just depression and I had munchausen syndrome. Physically I was unwell and had previously been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. Backwards and forwards to doctors again, told I should be controlling both those conditions better. I felt like it was all my fault and that didn't help my mood either. This lead to the downfall of our last attempt at a relationship.

Since then I have been diagnosed with pancreatic insufficiency and the enzyme replacement instantly made my feel back to myself physically and energy wise. It also stabilised my mental condition.

Eventually I was listened to and BPD was diagnosed.... I have said exactly the same things to various mental health professionals and only just got the diagnosis last December.

I hoped I could show this girl, named Heidi, that I could sort myself out. The need for constant reassurance and the fear of abandonment had gone. I asked someone to get in touch with her last month when my Nan died. I hoped she would be able to see how different I was after finally getting DBT and being in control of my emotions.

I am proud of myself how I handled her passing and the support I gave my family, especially my sister. She had depression and tried to end her own life while my nan was dying. 

I felt many times like contacting her, showing her it was all worth it, everything I put her through. Since then I've found out she is in a new relationship and everything at first was fine. One comment I was shown of someone saying ""I hope he looks after you and the girls"" has crushed me.
I'm devastated, I loved her daughters like they were my own, especially the youngest. The eldest and I didn't see eye to eye all the time but I honestly tried my best. Even sat on the kitchen floor cutting out dress patterns late at night. There are so many good memories... but so many bad ones at the same time.

I hate this feeling I have that these emotions I feel now, the heartbreak etc is all just nonsense... because of this BPD label It's different, it feels real and I know I'm in control but still feeling terrible.

I am torn, I love Heidi completely and have accepted that if I can't be the one to make her happy, I still want to see her happy. I am obviously jealous that someone has the opportunity to have the same relationship with her daughter that I had though.

I have fought the urge to contact Heidi... last month she asked a group for advice about ""how many times are you supposed to forgive, if the situation will cause you harm."" 

I know part of her still loves me but can't risk the same old thing happening again. I have thought many times about contacting her, putting all my feelings on the table, along with the effort I have made. I just wish she'd understand that, although I initially didn't get help, the effort it has taken to finally get the correct diagnosis... and I have done that off my own back, with no support required... as much as I would have loved to have some.

I guess my question (and I apologise this has been so long) is... how do I leave everything unsaid... and should I?

Should I leave any residual feelings she may have alone or should I at least say everything even if it changes nothing?"
1899,"On my road to recovery someone on here kindly pointed out that I was maybe in mania mode. They were right. I think focusing on relieving suffering and then making progress leads to such excitement you must be so conscious not to go off the other end of the emotional scale. Im pleased to say I woke up this morning feeling centred and calm, although it took a week and a half before I got there. Now the adrenaline has gone I’m exhausted lol, but happy. 😊"
1900,"So yesterday I was falling apart completely then today I was totally disassociated just in bed mostly feeling really really strange. Then about 30 minutes ago a thunder and lightning storm hit with really heavy rain and at first I felt panicky but then I went back to 80% ""normal"" again and felt like posting on here with you guys.

Anyone else like this sometimes??? 

Love you all =)"
1901,"A trainee Monk went up to the Monastery for the first time to see his Master. Although full of questions he said nothing, and the Master greeted him with a task. At dawn I want you to climb into that cave at the top of the mountain and sit there until dusk and have no thoughts at all. As his Master had instructed he went into the cave and immediately had a thought. He tried to ignore it and clear his mind. Thoughts came flooding in from all directions. Despite trying to clear his mind the thoughts continued all day. He was devastated thinking his Master would kick him out for failing such a simple task.Instead his Master laughed. Very good he said. Now go back up to the cave and think nothing but thoughts and have no gaps in your thoughts at all. Well that will be easy he thought, yesterday I had thoughts all day. He went up and started thinking, events from the past projections of the future. Suddenly he noticed a gap in his thoughts. Oh dear, he started thinking about the meaning of life, the universe. Suddenly though he went blank, he couldn’t think about anything. He trudged unhappily back to his Master having failed again. But the Master just laughed again. Well done he said, you have learnt a valuable lesson. You cannot force the mind. As Rumi said in his poem The Guest House, if you let your unwelcome visitors in, no matter how painful, they will eventually leave."
1902,"Under stress and it’s making my emotions really erratic. Not good for those around me. My therapist and I discovered today that I am very easily overwhelmed by normal life stuff (everything stresses me) and that I experience something similar to transient stress-induced paranoia. I can finally tell at least now that my baseline is normal. 

But I have been super stressed with my bf and friends again and it makes me feel HORRIBLE. I’m bringing a lot of negative energy to the table. It’s hard to stop. Therapist said I have to keep my stress as low as possible. 

Anything can trigger my anxiety. Too little sleep, too much caffeine, just a little too long without food, friends asking to hang out when I don’t have time or wanna pick my bf (guilt), triggered by something I read or watch or hear. ANYTHING. 

To keep it down I have to monitor EVERYTHING and lead a really simple life (which is my style) but sometimes I feel so bad about it. Like I should do more. But I can’t handle more. 

I hope this goes away soon I can’t be this way. I won’t stand for it haha."
1903,"Mindfulness is changing my life. I have embraced it and the inner calm is simply amazing. If you don’t know about it, I recommend you learn as much about it as possible. Imo it’s the path to recovery."
1904,"Here’s the process I’m going through on the road to recovery. I think the reason it’s difficult is it’s a combination of mind and body. 

1. Change diet to healthy eating 
2. Exercise four times a week
3. Mindfulness - Learn how to live in the present, not ruminate about the past nor project into the future 
4. Timeline - a story of your life. This will highlight key events in your life that shaped your core beliefs, and the actions you took to relieve your pain
5. Radical Acceptance - Accepting everything that has happened to you, without judgement, to make you who you are in the present moment
6. Emotional Reasoning - Learning you are not responsible for other people’s emotions and how to regulate your own
7. Distress Tolerance - How to cope with stressful events in your life
8. Interpersonal skills - Learning how to relate to people 

I start number 6 next week. 😁"
1905,"Discussed my Timeline today. Very interesting. I had a traumatic experience aged 12 and from then on have been detached and disassociated which led to me suppressing my emotions. 
I also found out today that because I tried to protect my little sister from my fathers abusive behaviour, taking the blame for things she did, this is where I took on board responsibility for other people’s emotions. 
So, now I’m armed with the knowledge of why I am as I am, I will tackle Emotional Reasoning next week in order to learn the skills to ground myself before my urges kick in to act."
1906,"I love this by Rumi, I hope you do too. 🤗"
1907,"So just had a messed up and triggering conversation with my mum, basically she said that because I don't believe in God we are poor and that it contributes to me being  mentally ill, she also bought my dad into it implying that I have similar thoughts and intentions to him because of my lack of faith 

Who knows how long she's been waiting to tell me this shit"
1908,i dont know whats real and what i'm making up this morning :cry:
1909,"This is not something I have experienced before but I feel totally empty. Like there is so many emotions (mostly sadness, anxiety and frustration) that I cant deal. I feel unsettled and uncomfortable"
1910,Starting to get crazy overwhelmed with every little thing like I feel my brain can’t process fast enough to keep up with the pace most people have. Lots of stuff to plan (good stuff) plus work to get done but things are going SO FAST and Rose’s brain can’t keep up and I’m just keeping my head above water.
1911,I'm on the train to court. I'm trying to breathe deeply and stay calm. I feel really anxious. I hate the unknown. I hate the thought of having to come back without my children. But it is what I am prepared for.... anything else is a bonus...  I want to see my barrister and hear her say she can work with the guardians report.... I hate the unknown.... will the social worker be here to testify? Will the fathers be there? Will they testify? Will my sons grandparents be there? What will happen..... will I be ecstatic or crushed? They are the only two outcomes
1912,My sappy ness is out of this world and decided to pay a little visit today but I managed to not go overboard into panicky sappy mode. I’ve been with my bf A LOT this past week and I adore him but I think using tonight to recharge and be alone at my place will be good for me. It was a super tough decision as I’m getting clingy again but I’d rather be close than clingy. And I made it back to my place without panicking first. Yay! Mini victory.
1913,"I joined this forum in 2012 having been diagnosed with BPD and was frustrated about a further diagnosis of a functional disorder by a neurologist.  It is 7 years later, I am now an old/er lady of 69 years of age.  In those 7 years my life has transformed.  I have completed DBT and my physical ills have been addressed.  DBT gave me control of myself, further physical diagnoses gave me the energy to complete the therapy.  I learnt how to stop and think before I erupted into emotional meltdown, I no longer SHOW my frustration and all-encompassing anger with people and situations, I don’t snap at anyone and everyone.  These emotions still rise within me but I have learnt to see things differently and how to direct my emotions effectively And I have a much greater chance of being taken seriously instead of being dismissed utterly.  My life has settled, I have settled, I FEEL settled.  I am flattened because I have no support now and struggle so hard with KEEPING settled.
DBT seems to be the opt-out therapy for mental health services - we can do no more, you know what to do so just get on with it.  DBT doesn’t teach you to trust, teach you how to connect  to others and how to find this life worth living.  I learnt how to trust my therapists and how to connect to others with BPD where you feel safe and not judged.  I have really tried to have conversations and form relationships with my peers.  I found that I have nothing to contribute because my life has not followed the path that is ‘expected’ of a woman of my age. I cannot tell them about my children, my grandchildren, my wonderful husband and my life at work.  I spend a lot of time on my own.  I am completely alone and I struggle every day trying to calm my demons and be as everyone needs me to be."
1914,"Hi guys and girls. I really could do with some advice. I’ve recently tried to complete a Timeline of my life, starting from my earliest memories. However, I don’t have any memory of anything before age 12. Furthermore, I can’t really match any event in my life to a specific time or age. Even getting married, I can guess it was around 6 or 7 years ago and I think I know the date, but then I have guilt I haven’t remembered any of our anniversaries, but then I think I can’t actually remember whether I have or haven’t. Maybe cannabis has contributed to this? It can’t have caused it as my detachment and lack of memories started many years before I smoked?  
Has anybody experienced the same or is my mind uniquely f*cked?"
1915,I’m pretty sure it’s because I had way too much caffeine today but it’s still freaking me out and making me paranoid about everything and extremely sensitive. Ugh.
1916,"n I Hate You -- Don't Leave Me! Jerold Kriesman and Hal Straus refer to BPD as ""emotional hemophilia; [a borderline] lacks the clotting mechanism needed to moderate his spurts of feeling. Stimulate a passion, and the borderline emotionally bleed

What do you other bpd sufferers think of that statement?  (it should read bleed to death!)

qf."

1918,"It’s 3am and I can’t sleep, things haven’t improved with my mother inlaw, she had her pip assessment and loved telling me all about it, how she was walking around the bungalow using crutches, she’s never used them. She didn’t do the exercises as she couldn’t do them. Yet Saturday she was up and down picking toys up, picking my nephew up and swinging him around. My sister in law couldn’t believe what she was doing. 

Today I got a txt off my other sister inlaw she got £42,000 inheritance in the txt she told me she brought a bbq for £150, a new laptop for £400, and amazon echo and a brand new car and if I don’t reply straight away (most of the time I’m asleep) I get bombarded with messages asking why I haven’t replied. I’m not jealous or anything just fed up of my husbands family rubbing things in. I took a loan for £8,000 to clear some of my debts, buy an electric wheelchair and a hoist for my car, my father inlaw fell ill with leukaemia and had not enough money coming in, £6,000 of the money went on my in laws to cover rent, £100 a week petrol to the hospital 4 times a week, the hospital is an hour away from where I live. My in laws have paid me £1,000 back, I won’t get the rest back and now tied down to a 5 year contract. I am beyond fed up of family members. 😡😠 it’s true what they say you can choose your friends but not family"
1919,For the first time this year I’ve had a new emotion to put on my chart..happiness. I know like all emotions it will pass but I’m so pleased to feel it. 😁
1920,I loved this song way before I knew I was ill. Now I know why lol. Is there a song that resonates with you?
1921,Started my Timeline. I’ve completed it up to the age of 18. It’s difficult as I have absolutely no memory of anything before the age of 12 🤷‍♂️.  How interesting after a lifetime of repeated abuse that the only thing that the only thing that brought me to tears was my cat dying 😥.  I think it’s because it’s the only thing that loved me. I’ll complete it today and discuss with my Psychologist on Tuesday. 😰
1922,"Hi. Recently, I've been diagnosed with BPD mostly because of my suicidal thoughts, the feeling of emptiness, and changes in the mood. I'm not 100% sure if that diagnosis is right and my psychiatrist told me to take tests with a clinical psychologist. The problem is they're way too expensive for me. I struggle with suicidal thoughts that haunt me when I'm stressed, I have a low mood or I go through a difficult time. Right now I have family problems that cause me to worry a lot and suicidal thoughts come and go. Most of the time I'm convinced that there's no point to live if I'm not happy most of the time and I suffer. Last years were mostly stressful for me and I've been unhappy for the most of the time. I don't have a job, I'm trying freelancing but sitting at home makes me low. There are times when I feel better but these are just moments. I often imagine how nice it'd be to die and not feel all this pain and worry. Such a relief. I know probably there are many people who feel the similar way, but if there is someone who sees hope in this life and thinks it's bearable then I encourage you to share your opinion. Maybe it'll turn out life can be good."
1923,"This is challenging for BPD, but force yourself to identify one good quality in yourself.

I am compassionate. I will often go out of my way to comfort someone in pain, even at my own expense."
1924,"I am a 18 yo high school girl. One week ago I have met a guy on the Internet. He is 4 years older and we get along really well. We are really alike and it seemed like we both wanted to start a relationship, so... we did. It felt really nice to flirt with him and we have so much in common. But the moment we started dating I felt like I've been consumed by anxiety. I am feeling so damn sick and don't know what to do.

I've grown in a conservative family and had been only in one relationship before which ended really badly. I was hospitalised after a suicide attempt and got diagnosed with BPD and Histrionic Personality Disorder. I've gone to a lot of therapists but even if I managed to find a good one, my family doesn't really support me going to one. We aren't very rich either and they have seen me ""better"" and don't see the point. Which is bullshit, but anyway.. Enough background story. 

I have a really bad fear of intimacy and I don't know what to do. I felt the urge to sabotage myself. He is a really good guy and I feel bad for him liking such a piece of trash like myself. He compliments me a lot and literally don't know how to react and what to say. Everything is so new. Nobody complimented me so much before. I feel like everything is moving too quickly and can feel the ground crumbling under my feet. 

I am really afraid especially of sexual intimacy. How can I cope with all of this? I really don't know what to do... It happened in the past too. Always running away and sabotaging new relationships. Not only romantic ones. Friendships too. I really struggle with making friends. He is an extroverted person too. If I would have to describe him it would be ""Mr. Embarrasment"" because of my God all that lovey-dovey is making me hide in a hole and never come out again :))) I really liked that lovey-dovey thing when we were flirting but the moment we started dating I feel just sick and want to isolate myself and don't know what to tell him. I feel really bad for him. I know how to read people and pretty much feel their intentions beforehand. Most of the time my intuition is pretty accurate (I am an INFP if anyone likes MBTI and is interested. He's an ENFP. For the rest of you, don't mind it. It's not that relevant). I really think he is a good person. Too bad he started liking such a broken person like myself. I felt really optimistic before, but now it's just paranoia and anxiety.

I also feel pathetic for dating a person found online. It may not be that bad, but it just the way I feel. I really pity myself sometimes. But I kept thinking... Some people really have nice stories about meeting their spouse online. It's not all bad. This guy lives in another country at the moment. He told me that he will move back. Wants to remain in x big and beautiful city in Romania and I told him after that is a nice coincidence. I want to go to University in that city. Been there before. My choice of wanting to go there and his choice isn't influenced at all by each other's. It was a nice coincidence. Maybe that is what started all of this. Wanting to date each other, I mean.

Sorry for the long post. Sorry if my English isn't that good. I'm not a native. And sorry if some parts are a little bit confusing. I feel like throwing up and didn't have strenght to check all of that again.

Thank you in advance!"
1925,"I am in court in Monday.
I am being represented by a barrister, I meet her for the last time tomorrow.
I have reports from a psychologist, a psychiatrist, the crisis team and my CPN saying my mental health is stable.
My supervised contact with my children and past records from professionals all indicate I am a loving, devoted and confident mum with excellent parenting skills.
I met the childrens guardian. I get the feeling she believes me. She met my son first. She asked me what my strengths were as a parent. I told her I consciously do the opposite of what my mother did. She said that when I read what my son describes as my strengths I will be very happy ♡
On Monday a judge will decide if my children can come home to me. It looks good, but I am so scared that I will get my hopes up and be let down. My heart could burst. I'm finding it hard to stay calm, I feel anxious, I'm trying not to feel excited incase I am disappointed....
The guardians report is the final piece of evidence and majorly sways what the judge decides. I feel my meeting with her went well but what if I am wrong? 

How will I make it through this weekend? I am trying to make plans and stay distracted and busy, but my anxiety may hinder that.... any tips?

TIA :)"
1926,"I had a bit of a meltdown today, highly emotional followed by frustration and anger. However, I managed to hold on without doing anything reckless and whereas this mood would have normally lasted 3 days but I got myself regulated in 20 hours. Well chuffed. 😁"
1927,After listening to Mindfulness for BPD around fifty times I’m now going to try this. It comes highly recommended by my Psychologist. I can’t wait to listen. 😁
1928,"I am always astounded by just how f*cking naive I am in life, probably has something to do with having the mindset of a child and not knowing how to act in a different manner. 
I woke up this morning with the realisation just how tough recovery will be. Really really really tough. I’m feeling so sad 😭. 
Anyway, must get my shit together and get to work. I hate being like this as seeing customers all day looking grief stricken is not a good look. I will be spending all day trying to control my f*cking emotions which in this state is nearly impossible. Ho hum..another day in the life of BPD. 😔"
1929,I regulated really quickly after an argument and have kept a clear perspective today even though it could have gone south. I apologized and I am back to being sweet without being needy or begging for forgiveness so hopefully everything quickly clears up!

It’s not just an online forum. It’s like a real group of friends and I found you just when I really needed you so thank you."

So, I’m going to turn this negative into a positive, as this means I can undertake any therapy and regardless of pain, I won’t be worrying about what it could or could not do to me. 😁"
1935,"I don’t really talk to many people. I’m very quiet at work. I see my friends occasionally but otherwise I don’t keep in touch very well. I wish I could do better and make closer connections but it doesn’t come naturally to me and it stresses me out. 

My bf talks to lots of people at work during the day and has their numbers and they can ask him questions and stuff or text him. It makes me uncomfy but I think it’s because I feel like a loser by comparison. 

Is it weird that I don’t keep in touch or talk to people that much? It’s just hard for me it makes my head hurt trying to figure out how to reach out or what to say. At the same time I want closer connections. I wish it could just fall into place. I’m pretty nice except when my jealousy kicks in 😬

I love talking to you guys on here though ☺️ It’s not just ranting cause I actually do care what you all think/say and I take your advice. It’s really nice.

Anyway acting like a loner makes me feel like a bad Person. I feel like I understand relationships the way a kindergartener would even though I’m in a PhD program. That social/emotional part of my brain is totally still a little kid. Don’t know where it decided to start lagging 😂"
1936,"Hey, 

I've been in therapy for 10 months, I've done well but I still struggle as some of you may know. 
I'm struggling with guilt right now- or maybe it's fear it flits between the 2. At times I'm afraid I've done something wrong and at times I'm certain I've done something wrong so I feel guilty. I've gone over the same things for weeks now it's become completely magnified and I've really done mental gymnastics with it that it's made it far worse. But I can't seem to put it to sleep or forgive myself. I've looked at emotional regulation but I can't seem to solve the guilt rather just lesson the intensity. 
What is guilt like in bpd? 

Xx"
1937,"really handsome and clever and a beautiful human being
I am fat ugly and thick

1938,"I’m feeling very comfortable with my therapist, I feel I can tell her anything without any judgement. 
However, it was exceptionally tough today and here’s the reason why. I have been in an extremely difficult situation (especially the last six months). You know when you think you’d just like to be in the ‘pain’ threshold, you don’t even need to feel calm or happy, just normal pain would do, rather than the gut wrenching relentless suffering you feel. It’s just such a painful feeling that I had a choice to make. Do I resort to my self destructive behavioural dysregulation for temporary relief of my emotional pain, which I know perpetuates my suffering in the longer term, or do I say bollocks, for once face your emotions and use Radical Acceptance. Radical Acceptance basically means Acceptance of EVERYTHING that has happened to you. It’s scary shit lol. Now I’ve only covered this in a self help book, but I did it anyway. I emailed my thoughts to my therapist this morning and she ripped up her agenda and we discussed Radical Acceptance instead (although she said it was a first on the third session). It’s honestly so scary...but also so valuable. One example, my poor little sister who sadly didn’t make it. My recollection had been. ‘I have no recollection of when she died, all I know is she left my house, drove home and killed herself’. What I now know a decade later is she actually drove home and a WEEK later she took her own life. The suffering this event alone has caused me as I felt so responsible is immense. My symptoms of detachment and distortion looks like I’m now also suffering from PTSD. However, I feel so much better to have found out the facts and to have grieved for my sister. 
So, tough, exhausting, painful yet beneficial. No one said it was easy. 😁"

1940,"I’ve been taking Mirtazapine for about 7 years and managed to keep most of the weight off and even lost 3 stone in later years.  During a difficult period my GP increased it to the max and I started putting on weight but it didn’t bother me more than the troubles I was experiencing, my GP then put me on to Sertraline and my weight has now gone back to what it was before the weight loss.

In the meantime I was referred to a Psychiatrist and diagnosed with BPD, talking the Psych I suggested reducing the Sertraline before we try a mood stabiliser.  It didn’t happen, I tried tapering down to below the therapeutic dose gradually but it was terrible but I am on a reduced dose and coping.

Are there any combinations that don’t cause weight gain and do you think my Psych will listen to my weight concerns?  

I think I might need to face it though, carrying extra weight is nothing if my head’s in right place."
1941,"People say maybe I should consider going back to university, or I should apply to various jobs where they would train me up, but deep down, I know that I feel no motivation whatsoever.
I'm not driven towards any particular career path at all. I'm 25 and feel lost. I have absolutely no idea what I want, and it feels like I'm a non-person.
Has anyone ever felt like this??? 
Feeling like you are no one and nothing interests you, and that most of all,
whatever you do, all of it is just meaningless in the grand scheme of things. We live we die, what difference does it make? What difference do I make? I keep thinking about life and the grand scheme of it. What am I doing here? I have nothing valuable to contribute, deep down i think to myself, but also I have some kind of weird narcissism where I think I do.
I feel like I don't have a sense of who I am or what I want, at all.
I'm not interested in doing a job just to make lots of money, but at the same time I want to be well-off. But there's nothing I'm drawn towards. I feel a pressure towards certain types of job as they would be lucrative, but I have no real motivation towards them. I don't understand the meaning of life.
I keep thinking I could study this, I could study that, but I always have a reason to chicken out. I'm just not truly interested. Low self esteem and low motivation.
Everyone around me seems to think I'm super clever, but its just that in the distant past I was actually motivated to learn things and perfect them but now, I'm not at all. I stopped seeing the point a long time ago. One minute I'll have a goal, the next thing nothing, it all feels meaningless. I self sabotage and I don't know a way out of this.

How can I make my life meaningful??? And who am I? I don't even know. My mind just goes blank and I don't feel like I'm anyone."

1943,"I I've actually had enough, I no longer want to live in this world it's full of so much pain.

I know I will  be denied pip and at the moment I'm strungggli to survive on  the monay I have but can't go back to work so I don't have any options.

1946,I have very mixed emotions at the moment. How did you all take it when they told you that you have BPD?
1947,"I think that in order to stop your negative coping mechanisms that give you temporary relief from pain, you have to replace them with positive ones. Mine are:
Hiking 
Exercise 
Gardening 
Music

1949,"Personality disorders • Initial proposals: • 6 personality disorder diagnosis of instead of the 10 in the DSM-IV • To move from categorical to a trait-based, dimensional classification system • This proposal was ultimately voted down; however the dimensional-categorical model is included in section 3 for further research • Interestingly, in the field trials, only borderline personality disorder had good inter-rater reliability. In contrast, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder where in the questionable reliability range • The fact that borderline personality disorder had such good inter-rater reliability, whereas the other person disorders did not, may support views that it could belong in the bipolar disorder spectrum rather than being classified as a personality disorder 

link from rcpsych about the new DSM in relation to childhood mental health"
1950,"One of the benefits of being diagnosed with BPD for me was to recognise and address the coping mechanisms that I use to regulate my emotions.
The first thing I noticed was I had become a stimulus seeker. The second thing I noticed was that all of my coping mechanisms were of a self destructive nature, that far from giving me temporary relief were actually perpetuating my suffering. The last thing I have noticed is that giving up any of my coping mechanisms leads to me dramatically increasing one of the others.
I know people self harm. Luckily I have only resorted to this once, a long time ago. My coping strategies have included:
Reckless Driving
Social Media
Alcohol
Drugs
Cigarettes
Food
Online Shopping
Gambling
Since learning a bit about Mindfulness I have managed to stop driving recklessly, I’ve moderated by alcohol consumption (no more than 3 pints), I no longer binge eat (I’m exercising and eating healthy foods and have lost weight this year), I’ve stopped online shopping and gambling completely and I’ve deleted all my Social Media accounts. Although it’s very painful to give up coping mechanisms, by doing so it HAS reduced my suffering.
I noticed that when giving up the above, for the two things I am left with, cigarettes and cannabis, my consumption has dramatically increased. From having around ten cigarettes or joints, I find myself now smoking thirty to thirty five a day. I am desperately trying to address this but realise there is a reason behind this, and I think it’s because I’ve suppressed and detached so many painful emotions throughout my life. For me there is only one solution, and that is to use a technique called Radical Acceptance. This is a technique where you face your emotions and fears, writing down your thoughts, feelings and emotions. You then try to calm yourself using Mindfulness before rewriting your story based on the present, the hear and now, and writing without judgement on you or anybody else. I feel it’s painful but necessary to get suppressed emotions out, to grieve. I’m very new to this but to date I’ve reduced my intake of cigarettes or joints to no more than seven a day, I’m going to try to reduce to six next week.
It’s a long hard challenging battle but I will know I’ve truly embraced mindfulness when I no longer smoke or take drugs and engage in any self destructive behaviour.
Can I do it? I have no idea lol. I think I can and that’s because I have the INTENTION to do so."
1951,Sums up all my feels about baby daddy
1952,"I've had a crap time recently if you follow my posts.... 
This weekend my best friend (I consider her my to be my sister) invited me to stay overnight with her and my beautiful nieces and nephews. If you do follow my posts you know how much I care about the children in my life. We had an amazing evening. The kids and I did each others make up, took pictures, we did each others hair. The kids went to bed. Me and my sis did each others hair, ordered Chinese food, watched TV and went to sleep.
This morning we got up had cuppas, had breakfast, got the kids ready and began tidying their bedrooms (I promised them a treat from the shop if they tidied their rooms). One of the children (Boy 12) had wet the bed. He had tried to accuse his brother of doing it (they share a room and have the same sheets) his brother is 10 in a few days and has autism. My sisters partner was back and he talked to him about it. I was in one of the girls rooms tidying and cleaning. I didnt agree with the way his stepdad was dealing with it. Instead of keep my mouth shut and discuss it with my sister later I said something. I accused him of overdoing it in more specific words. He was in a different room so I shouted this and the children could hear. He began to shout back. That I -shouldn't tell him what to do in his house with his kids'. I retaliated and said 'they are only your children when it suits you'. 
Then is the part that really pissed me off. He shouted over my sister who was telling me also I can't tell him how to deal with his children. 'You haven't even got your fucking kids' 'shagging your sisters husband' and various other vile insults. At this point I stopped. I knew I was right and that's why he had resulted to underhand tactics. He wanted me to loose control. He wanted an excuse for me to leave. So I stopped. I stayed quiet while he ordered the children to stay away from me. I continued tidying the bedroom.
My sister and him continued to exchange words while I continued cleaning up, shaking and trying not to cry. She said she wanted to take me home so it didn't escalate any further. I walked into the room he was in to collect my belongings. His youngest daughter began engaging with me, I did back as I usually would while I collected my things. I waited for my sister and we left.
In the car on the way back my sister explained she was angry at me for shouting at her partner like that in front of the kids, I have no right, I should have approached her like I normally would. I apologised for the outburst I just became overwhelmed listening thinking I would do anything to have my son here now and I flipped. But I stopped the second it became too personal. I said how I felt she had 'chosen' him, that I was supposed to spend the rest of the day with the kids and now I couldn't. We had it out, normally as sisters do. She said to text her when I calm down and if I still want to go ahead with our evening plans.
I have calmed down. I said I would only go tonight if her partner apologised to me for saying untrue hurtful and personal things. I have also text my oldest nephew (with permission, to my sisters phone) saying; 
(Name) I am sorry I shouted at your dad today. I shouldn't have done it and I really hope I haven't upset you or any of the kids. I wanted to apologise to you because you are old enough to understand it was wrong. I am your auntie and your godmother and I should set an example to follow and that wasn't it. It's very hard to admit when you have done something wrong, especially when you are an adult! (Because we always like to be right in case you haven't noticed 🤣) but that's the right thing to do and it shows you are a better person rather than lying and denying it. Hope you understand.  Love you lots x

I don't know if I can forgive my sister. Do you think I'm being over dramatic? I don't care about him. His feelings and opinion of me are worthless, although I believe as a man with a diagnosis of PTSD he should be big enough to apologise.

Thanks for any advice/input you can afford in advance ♡"
1953,"How can I tell my parents that I like to smoke occasionally. I’m of age, so it’s all legal, it’s just my parents are very against smoking. I want to tell them, so that I can buy cigarettes when I’m with them instead of having to be sneaky."
1954,"My psychiatrist asked if I heard voices, and I said no. But talking to  friend about it, I think I might be. So a little background first, I have always spoken to myself in my mind as I write this I'm reading it through to myself and the words are clear as day in my mind just the same as if I was speaking. I always think over conversations I'm going to have and I've had in my head the same way. An it's the same voice that starts the nagging doubt that I've messed up or done something wrong, or I'm just not good enough etc etc. I always believed that this was my consensus (sorry if my spelling is wrong) talking to me, but my friend doesn't talk to her self in her head like that."
1955,"So today was trying Radical Acceptance of the relationship with my father. I noticed the following thoughts and emotions. Fear, anger, frustration, pain, sorrow, suffering, guilt, rage, humiliation, embarrassment, cruelty, hatred, violence, stress, anxiety, scared, stupid, worthless. 
A pretty gut wrenching experience dredging up memories that I’d suppressed and detached from. But once again, using mindfulness I regulated both my breathing and my emotions, I let the wave of pain build and subside, which they are doing. 
I have noticed I’m gaining the knowledge to slow my thoughts down, giving me time to think and be mindful (rational). I’ve noticed everything I face seems to be a grieving process but once out I’m gaining an inner calm. Early days but I’m sure (for me) facing my suffering is far more beneficial to me than what I have done in the past, which is to suppress everything and pretend it didn’t happen."
1956,"I believe he did, well that's what my gut instinct tells me"
1957,"I have many things to face using Radical Acceptance, many traumatic experiences to accept, in order that I can accept myself in the here and now, the present moment. 
Today I faced one of my biggest fears, my little sister taking her own life. I’m not going into detail but my thoughts included sad, emotional, distraught, grief stricken and responsible. I haven’t cried as much since my mother died many years ago. 
I calmed myself using mindfulness, took many deep breaths and just about got myself grounded. I let the emotions grow like a wave and waited for them to subside. They did. It’s been a couple of hours and I’m still shaking a bit but underneath I have a calmness. Also a real sense of achievement.i have less fear facing other traumatic events now and I’m going to do them this weekend. This fucking illness is NOT going to define me!"
1958,"Hi. Im
Sorry this is a long post

I’m currently 29 weeks pregnant with my third child (I have a 5 year old and my youngest is 4 next week) and my husband got made redundant with only a weeks notice at the end of jan. I’m unable to work because of my mental health, so we’ve been without any sort of income since his last pay (which got halved because they took out holiday days he’d taken when he had no idea they were going to do this) since jan and we are drowning in debt and can’t even prepare for the baby (which for any of the ladies will understand the nesting and preparation instinct is strong at this point) and I’m struggling to keep it together. 
Lately to try and bring in some money my husband has been doing take away delivering, but it’s meant I’m left on my own from 4:45-11pm which involves feeding and bedtime with the kids (he’s always done bedtime) and with being pregnant and having medical issues with it, it’s hard physically and mentally im not used to being alone in the evenings anymore. 

My binge eating has spiralled out of control and I’m feeling so miserable and stressed out I’m struggling to cope. I’ve tried doing crochet to help distract and do something at night but it’s not working. My dark thoughts are taking over from all the worries. 

I poured my heart out Monday night, after being triggered badly by a meeting with consultant at hospital about baby, so I wrote a poem. Part of which said “would anyone notice if I wasn’t here”. I genuinely feel it would be better if I wasn’t. 
I posted this on my Facebook as a way to express how I was feeling to people who know me, and partly as a cry because I’m so lonely. Someone, anyone to talk to me. I’m so lonely (I don’t have friends here where I live)  

Not one person could message me to even just say “are you ok” “do you need to talk” or even simply a “hi”. Nobody. My 2 sisters in laws just put heart emoji. Ok fine when I’m rational, fine to most people, but as I’m sure someone might understand, with me, that’s not talking to me. A heart doesn’t help me. 

Anyway, I cried for hours and pretty much have done every night husband goes to do deliveries. 

Last night I got invited to a group chat about mother in laws 60th birthday and they want to go camping. We can’t afford to save for anything at the moment, we can’t even fit us all in the car when we have the baby as it’s too small and the baby will be young and I don’t fancy going camping with a newborn. So I sort of jumped off the deep end and reaponded with “im Sure you will all have a blast” and left the group. Didn’t want to cause trouble but was a bit pissed they hadn’t even asked us first about coming, just added to the group, told the dates and a price list. 
My older sister in law messages to say sorry if I offended you.
I was so highly strung by this point I exploded about the whole why don’t you even message to ask if im ok, just put a heart and then a full rant on why we can’t go camping. 

Her response was that she doesn’t know what to say to me. She’s scared to talk to me
Incase it’s the wrong thing (in general I can control things over messages as I just wait and respond if I’ve been upset but I’ve never lashed out at her or her younger sister, I don’t do confrontation with people, it’s usually my husband that gets the brunt of everything) she told me to get help from someone who knows what to say before I do something I regret. 

I am so hurt. I have told her over and over and over to not be afraid to talk to me as that upsets me more that she feels that way. I spent most my life walking on eggshells frightened not to set my father off, he would literally explode and life was miserable. Im nothing like that in the least. Even my husband testifies to this and could see from my point of view why I feel so hurt. I explained to her why I was so blunt about camping and even apologised and said what’s going on but her response has hurt me so bad. 

By her saying these words has not only made me feel like what’s the point in being here if nobody can talk to me it’s made me question if my mental health illness is why nobody bothers with me. It’s made me question if by telling anyone about my illness has isolated myself. It’s made me wonder if I really am like my asshole father. 
“talk to someone who knows what to say” omg really, a simple “are you ok” is difficult to say? I don’t want answers. I don’t expect anything, I literally just want to be included in life and people have a conversation with me. I feel like a lepar. 

I spent most of last year trying hard to connect with people. If message, ask how they was doing (everyone I know lives miles away where I grew up) and all I’d get is all their problems and not even asking me about how things were, how we’re the kids etc ever. I got fed up of things being one way so I stopped for my own sanity. 

I feel completely broken. I don’t know how to carry on. 

How does anyone else deal with people who seem to be frightened to talk to them? Honestly I don’t lash out with friends and family, only hubby (and he’s wonderful and understanding and I don’t deserve him) so I’ve no idea why people are scared to talk to me. I’ve explained why I isolate myself at times and they know I’m working hard to cope better with things. What am I supposed to do? Is this going to be the rest of my life - completely friendless and alone? 

I’m sorry for rambling."
1959,"I'm currently bawling my eyes out because my FP/partner is stressed and I can't help in any way at all.

Of course I'd never tell him this, and thank God he's at his own place right now so he doesn't have to see me, but fucking hell. This pain is horrible. I feel like I've been stabbed.

And all the while I feel so horribly bad for my partner I also feel really guilty and like a disgusting human being because I'm the one crying about it. What fucking right do I have to be so upset when he's the one actually struggling? 

It gets worse because there have been times he's been stressed and I felt so sad he was stressed I was unable to hide it. There were times I cried and he actually had to comfort me. 

What. The. Fuck. How could I do that do him? That's so unbelievably cruel. He's the one dealing with the worst of it and how fucking dare I make him have to give up some emotional energy just to deal with me. I despise myself for that. I truly feel bad for him because he's dating me (nearly 2 years now) but I'm too selfish to let him go. 

This emotional pain is so agonising it's giving me thoughts of wishing I didn't exist and yet at the same time I had 2 recent scares I was going to die (severe sepsis, followed by worries of a brain tumour) and I desperately wanted to live. So, what the fuck? 

In my delirious severe sepsis state where I could barely talk, walk, or breathe (lobar pneumonia sepsis) I still forced myself up and banged on my father's door to wake up and demanded he take me to hospital. I could very well have just stayed in that bed and died of septic shock and I would've been too delirious to even know how to ask for help. Due to the delirium I don't even remember any of this, I just woke up in hospital and was later told of it by my family. 

So clearly there's a desperate instinct in me to live. Yet I've deliberately risked my life so many times, even had suicide attempts. So, what the fuck? It makes no sense to me. I can't even decide if I want to live or die. I guess I'm a coward and living is torture but I'm too scared to die. 

I also think I don't want to make anyone sad by dying, but that thought is soon followed by ""well, maybe they'd be sad at first but in the long run realise it's much better you're not around"", so... I'm conflicted there too. 

Sorry this is a bit long. Anyone relate? Any thoughts or anything at all would be really appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read.

(Note: I'm definitely not going to attempt suicide. It was only days ago I was relieved I had no brain tumour. So I hope expressing thoughts related to suicidal feelings is okay.)"
1960,"Hi, I only got my diagnosis last week but it explains alot about my life. Why I push people away and when I am happy I find ways to sabotage it.
How can I stop this behaviour, as I have a really good friend at work who knows about everything that is going on, but I'm now finding ways of driving a wedge between us. 
Thanks"
1961,"Hi guys, I haven’t been on for ages but need you guys and I know I can vent without being judged. 

Firstly a little back ground. 

Today has been a very shit day, I need to pay over £800 to fix my car which I haven’t got the money I took a £7,000 loan to buy my electric wheelchair, my father in law got diagnosed with leaukeamia and at one point they had no money for months due to benefits being sorted, I ended up loaning them £6,000 and no electric wheelchair. They have paid me £1,000 back in here and there and have now said they won’t be paying me anymore. I’m still paying this £7,000 back and still no electric wheelchair. 

Anyway today my father inlaw had to pick my son up from school, my mother inlaw who has had 3 operations and which has made her better and she can work. Instead she won’t work. Anyway she has a pip assessment next week and is making out she can’t do nothing, she can’t walk far yet went out walking around for 3 hrs with no pain. She is telling them my father inlaw has to dress her, wash her, cook even though she has told them she has to do this for my father inlaw in his pip claim. She’s such a lying bitch. I’m 34 and can’t work, my husband has to bath, dress me, push me in my wheelchair. I want to work as a teaching assistant, travel to America visit Alcatraz which I’m obsessed with yet I can’t as I’m in the wheelchair, and go back to Australia but I can’t, I don’t want any of my health conditions I hate having bpd apparently I’m a bitch and selfish for not supporting my mother inlaw. I had to have a hysterectomy due to my health and I want to have another child. It really pisses me off I feel like reporting her. She was supposed to have another op that will “fix her back completely” she is refusing to have it as she wants to be ill she wants so much sympathy which she doesn’t get from my husband and I. I’m so pissed off I struggle all the time sometimes I sleep all day and night due to my meds. I can’t live the life I want to yet she’s sat on her arse doing fuck all. The best thing is I have to sort my fathers in laws medications, I had to inject him everyday with white blood cells, she would ring me telling me to call an ambulance as she didn’t know what she was doing. She would ring me and say my father inlaw had a temp of 38c what should she do. My husband and I would have to take my father inlaw to his hospital appointments. She’s fucking useless and wants everything given to her. Apparently she has depression yet not on any medication or having counselling, she’s in so much pain she can’t move but only on paracetamol. She’s even accused me having an affair with my father inlaw. 

After writing all this I have calmed down so much and this has helped. I’m hoping she doesn’t get pip (already been refused 3 times) she doesn’t deserve it and its people like her that make it harder for the rest of us who are genuinely ill. Sorry it’s so long and thank you for reading and letting me rant X"
1962,"By the way i am more for open relationships, many people are, but especially psyExploiters like to hide that, well, i don't. Also, in monogamic relationships one is much easier exploited, especially if the other is an idiot. In open, if one is an idiot, there are others. Of course, i recommend being with the aproppriate partner(s): sexual abusers, sexual manipulators, drugatics and alchoholics are not welcome into my life.
Personally, from when i again started to ""hearing voices"" and all that comes with it, there's no sex. Why? people behind this don't like that someone finds apropriate people, because then, plans that mind programmers have for us may fail - this is the whole story of deliberate mind programming or brainwashing - who today isn't in some way? i know some of us are 24hours a day - psychological conditioning after conditioning. Some of us were also used for their sick hard sadistic spiritual porns in childhood. Hmm  - i wonder who watches that kind of porns - and this kind of things are probably very well paid.

Again, what's the most used method for bps?
unconsciously fooling someone with a false hope time after time(some may have a nervous breakdown because of this), let it be ai or someone else(some are doing this unconsciously - they may be a part of the same conditioning, not being aware of that).

So again, like our grandma would say ""if one want's to work, there's always a work to be done"", and i again agree.

Guess who(or in which profession) is many times also using pedophile psychology without being aware of it?"
1963,"Hi there everyone. I hope you're all as well as can be. 

Well I managed to really mess up this time at my sister's wedding on Saturday. I've been so anxious about it for months as I struggle with social anxiety and agoraphobia. Anyway I ended up getting black out drunk and going back to someone else's room. We didn't sleep together but other things happened and my partner was at the wedding with me. I have totally humiliated and disrespected her and I hate myself so much. I'm on my last chance with her. I'm terrified I'll do something like that again and I also feel like a toxic person and like my friends and family really would be better off without me. She was frantic when I disappeared that I'd hurt myself and honestly it would be better for her if I had. Has anyone been in this position before? This isn't my first time messing up. I've decided to give up drinking because it makes my behaviour so much worse. I'm Irish and it was an Irish wedding so many people were very drunk but not everyone goes off with someone else like I do."
1964,"Wow! We went straight into my Emotional Reasoning today and already I am beginning to understand so much about myself, my thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Some of the things I learnt were quite profound and I would like to share them in case they resonate with you. 
First, on the hate and dislike I have for myself she stated I don’t hate myself, I hate my BEHAVIOURS. 
Secondly I have been taking responsibility for other people’s feelings and emotions. I must be mindful to realise that everyone is responsible for their own thoughts, feelings and behaviour, not me. 
Thirdly, and this really struck a cord with me, I have lived my life ‘expecting’ rather than ‘hoping’. This approach obviously sets you up for major disappointment and after she said it I realised I do it for every facet of my life. She gave an example of her treating me. She stated she doesn’t ‘expect’ me to get better, she ‘hopes’ I do. She went on to explain that if she ‘expected’ all of her clients to get better it could cause her emotional distress if they didn’t. I fully understand what she is saying. Hoping is less black and white and would cause you far less pain. 
Can’t wait to see her next week!"
1965,"Tonight and like every night for past week i've not been able to sleep for many different reasons and tonight is because my old FP. I no longer see her and it's been over a month, in my head I count the days every day when I last saw her and spoke to her and it really hurts and miss her so much. I also feel so ashamed of these feelings and how intensely I felt about her, I don't even think she was just a FP to me I fell for her pretty hard and developed feelings for her. I just haven't met someone in a while who made me feel the way she did or how perfect she was to me, she had the same interest as me etc etc. 

I'm just really struggling to still come to terms with it, don't get me wrong I'm dealing with this a lot better then I would of in the past but it still hurts. I don't even feel like I can talk about it in my group psychotherapy because this person actually works within the mental health team so I don't know where to voice how I feel. At the moment I just feel so ashamed about my feelings for her because I know it was 100% unrequited because we worked together in a professional capacity and she was 100% professional with everything. In some weird way I feel like I'm trying to get over someone I never had and it sucks hard, really hard.

Sorry for the long post, just need to voice my opinions right now."
1966,"Hi!
I hope everyone’s doing great!
I was wondering if any of you has a hard time accepting compliments.
When I receive a compliment I don’t react, sometimes I just smile at the person and sometimes I thank them, however,I don’t believe them,especially if it’s something that I’m not 100% confident of.
This might sound pathetic but sometimes I feel like I receive compliments as pity even though in my head I realise people don’t do that. I mean people don’t compliment you because they pity you.But again people are nice and maybe they compliment others because they know it will make someone’s day, so it’s not necessarily truthful compliment.
What’s your thought regarding compliments?"
1967,And trying to remind myself that it doesn’t mean something terrible is about to happen.
1968,Does someone else here diagnosed with BPD feels euphoria or something similar like unusual happiness?
1969,"For the longest time I've always had bad dreams/nightmares that seem to increase in times of stress, is this something that could be related to bpd? I remember someone saying that it could be but I'm not 100% certain, just wanted to hear if others experience this? I also always remember every detail vividly when I wake up.

It's currently 2am where I am and I don't want to sleep because of it"
1970,Got a little “triggered”  (I hate that word haha) by something my bf said but I need to get back to the happy space I was in Before. He’s taking me to the zoo and omg I’m so excited!!!
1971,"I discovered that I act little sometimes with my bf when we started dating a couple years ago. 

Sometimes I love it and other times I feel like it’s a little wrong. 

Anyway now I let myself be “a little kid” when I’m alone at my place sometimes and I find it relaxing. The past couple days I felt that way and was way less irritable with people. I was really happy. 

I tried to explore how others experience it but it has a bit of a sexual connotation online lol. I wish I could be my little self in an innocent way with people other than my bf but idk how that would work out. It just seems like I’m hiding a side of myself. I don’t know if that made sense lol. Thanks for reading my rambles."
1972,"What is the knot in your stomach? Today all I can think about is the lies my ex had told and how all the evidence is there to support what I say but no one cares....
And it's making a knot in my stomach I cant make go away"
1973,"I've known for the entire process that my childrens social worker disliked me, but I've done as I'm told and managed EXTREMELY well considering I've just gotten out of an invalidating relationship, lost custody of my baby and my 12 year old, got a brand shiny new diagnosis and had to defend myself against blatant lies all in the space of 15 weeks.....
My CPN is over the moon, psych is happy..... I've stayed stable throughout. No risk behaviours. Everything is finally going well.
Social worker now decides that I don't agree with my diagnosis, I have no empathy, cant prioritise the needs of my children.... all based on his perception of how I cope with his presence and asking intrusive questions, which have complied with and answered honestly. I have not lied at any point. Liars are ALWAYS caught out. He has characterised me by my symptoms of BPD based on the most traumatic period of my life to date.... he says that I am a risk to the children (opinion that is not supported by any other professionals) and that my oldest son has been brought up without routine and consistency (years of paperwork and proof to the contrary)... I am being discriminated against due to my mental health. I am being characterised as my symptoms.... how am I supposed to stay strong, focused, have a reason? Without my boys I have no reason...."
1974,"Hello,

This is my first post in this forum.

So, let’s just say you’ve been professionally diagnosed with BPD, you go through all of the recommended therapy, discover ways to “cope”, etc. then what’s next? Do you just live out life in a the typical status-quo way with a steady job, paying your bills on time, and maybe a little more in between? I guess I’m just frustrated by the people around me (both family and therapists) just wanting me to cope with life instead of possibly changing my environment and seeing what else the world has to offer...I feel like once you’re diagnosed with BPD, everything you say and do is perceived to be because of it. Don’t like your job? BPD. Relationship problems? BPD. Strong opinions? BPD. Bad mood today? Oh, must be your BPD again. People ultimately question your legitimacy and it’s really tiring. I’m quite in-tune with my symptoms and I know when it’s BPD and when it’s not. I sorta feel like psychiatry in general just wants to get you well enough to go back to work and that’s about it. And when I’ve expressed my views to others, surprise surprise, they’ll say, “Well, it’s characteristic of those with BPD to reject therapy.” You just can’t win. I just feel like maybe some “symptoms” of BPD aren’t that bad after all...I just want more out of life."
1975,"Like all couples, sometimes me and my partner get into arguments, they're never anything major but I get extremely upset. With Borderline Personality Disorder, when I get distressed it goes to a whole new level. 

I literally feel like he's going to leave me, the world is going to end and that I should kill myself or run away. It's like I go into a full blown crisis over something really minor, it happens whenever we have an argument, I'm never satisfied with an answer he gives or I've done something wrong and want him to be fine with me straight away. 

Usually he won't speak to me for a little while which has always been his way, and my therapist said that he's doing everything right in that respect, because if he plays to my meltdowns it'll only make me worse in the long run. I cannot handle being ignored so I'll follow him around and try and sort things out but it usually makes things worse. I'm slowly learning to just leave it, but it does get very hard sometimes.

I will cry and cry and cry until I can't cry anymore, and I will literally think the worst things during this time, and the best thing for me to do is to go for a walk or try to sleep if I can. Because these are the times where I'm more likely to act impulsively or do something stupid which we'd all rather avoid.

Has anyone experienced this? Either having BPD or having a loved one who has? How do you deal with this?"
1976,"Does anyone with social anxiety/bpd/trouble forming relationships with people have any experience of getting a personal trainer? On one hand I know I really need to do this, on the other I am scared as hell as find it extremely hard to form relationships with people, am generally extremely socially awkward and scared as hell to make the first step. I'm convinced they would hate me and judge me."
1977,"I’m starting DBT therapy later today. I’m extremely stressed, anxious, nervous and fearful, yet I’m also excited and optimistic. 
So basically I’m a mess. 🙈"
1978,I told my friend I’ll hang out tomorrow because she asked but I’m already scared I’ll be anxiously trying to get to my boyfriend as soon as possible in the evening. I have to work during the day. I don’t want to have a clingy panicky freak out but I’m not liking this idea lol. I’ve seen my bf like every day though and we have special plans Saturday too. So I know it’s okay. I just get antsy. He doesn’t really hang out with anyone else and I know he’s a little bummed when I choose to see my friend. They also weirdly don’t like each other so it’s very hard to just have us all together although that happened kinda by chance earlier this week and I was SO happy. I don’t think they were though hahah.
1979,"So I had this debate/conversation with my therapist today (who also informed me I’m not doing cbt, but instead psychoanalytical therapy), and I was lamenting the fact that in order to get better you have to delve into some horrible stuff. Stuff that you have buried. 

And she indicated that in order to move past the trauma you must master it. That by fully understanding what happened your mind can finally put it to rest. If you don’t do that, it will return and manifest itself in various disorders because suppression is temporary and will eventually leak out in unwanted behaviour.

She also explained the difference between cbt and pt. Cbt looks to find blame for behaviours and pt looks to learn from them and grow and actively change. I’m glad I’m doing pt, as painful as it is.

But I wonder your opinion about reliving trauma to spur growth and change? Do you think change is possible without reliving it?"
1980,"a little background, I was diagnosed with BPD, major depression and anxiety 3 years ago now. My BPD comes from childhood trauma, my father was a horrible alcoholic and my mother was neglectful of me. (Major abandonment issues) I did some counseling and took citalopram for my depression and Ativan for my anxiety. I quit cold turkey about a year ago now. I’ve been with my bf for over a year now and I’m struggling. I love him very much and he is extremely kind and patient with me, and he tries to help me as much as possible. I have a hard time with communication, whenever I feel my symptoms coming on I begin to split and withdrawal myself because I don’t want him to see those ugly sides of me, sometimes I just want to let it all out but then that makes me become a toxic person. I find myself to be emotionally manipulative a times and I also suffer from jealousy (I’ve been cheated on and lied to by almost every bf I’ve had) I try not to act on these impulses but I feel like I have no control over what I say or do. So I bottle everything up and tell myself that my feelings are wrong and they make me a bad person. And a lot of the time I genuinely do feel like a bad person and that he deserves better than me. He gets upset with me when I don’t tell him how I’m feeling but a lot of the time I just don’t know how to feel or what to do or say. Sometimes I just feel numb. I try to regulate myself and I thought I’ve been doing better but last night my boyfriend got upset with me because he said I’ve been distant the past 2 weeks, this caused me to have anxiety and feel horrible about myself because I genuinely thought I was doing better and it just really hurt my feelings that he doesn’t think I am. I need to go back to therapy and I need to get back on my meds, I know that. But I have absolutely 0 motivation to do anything. I feel so lost right now, I’m not sure what to do with myself."
1981,"My motivation is starting to get low again and it really scares me. If I could I’d skip work and stay in bed. Also when I see my bf I just want to cuddle/nap. Idk why I feel so little drive to do anything and it makes me really irritable and antsy. Like I’m stuck in slow motion but I have so much to get done. 

Still really set on getting a cat later in the summer bc having my cat here was really really nice."
1982,"sometimes I think I am not suited to romantic love x

is it always beautiful at the start? do the rainbows and butterflies slowly ebb away? xx:unsure:"
1983,"I feel very suicidal and the thoughts are very intrusive, the only thing that is stopping me is i don't have a method that is painless and works enough times to be worth the risk, as a failed attempt will, prevent be from joining the army one of the few things keeping me going rn ngl. Or i could be stuck in a position where i be unable to make another attempt again, such as being paralysed. I really don't know what to do, i gone to therapists, GPs etc. and my next appoint is in 2020, a long way away. I just can't see myself getting better"
1984,"I was constantly abused for years by a narcissist and I developed a lot of ""responses"" to the abuse: when they were around I will get depressed or feeling that I'm not present (they will talk and almost everytime they said something I had to tell them to repeat, didn't happend while I was talking to someone else) or I will feel a lot of shame sometimes, anxiety... But the worst part is experiencing anger. It got worse and lasts for hours and sometimes it makes me feel good. I feel like is energizing me, sometimes when it comes I only want to do really bad things. And with this anger I can feel like I'm a completly different person. Is like a person that is strong, fearful, and can be, paradoxically, calm and clculated, fantasizing about doing bad things. The big problem is that I can not control my anger. I can destroy things, wont go away. Since I cant control it, it leaves me so weak fizicaly and mentally and deeply ashamed of myself and of my thoughts.
Anyone experience such distressful anger? How do you overcome it?"
1985,"I am returning to work next week after taking a 6 week long leave due to my mental health decline and a surge of my BPD symptoms.  I am trying to figure out how to talk with my manager regarding my leave and whether or not it's time for me to disclose that I have BPD.  I have already talked with her about my past with self-harm when it was relevant in response to a triggering situation last year.  She was very supportive, and also spoke about some of her history with mental health. 

I had to go on leave at the end of April of this year when I was hospitalized for being actively suicidal.  My manager knows that I spent a week in inpatient care, and have since been doing an intensive outpatient program (6 hours a day, 4 days a week), but I still haven't named the actual diagnosis.  

Has anyone had positive conversations with their managers or co-workers about BPD?  I've heard a lot of the horror stories from telling people, but I've known my manager for 2 years at this point and I trust her.  I'm hoping that disclosing my BPD will help me avoid another breakdown like this at work but I don't want to risk my relationship with her."
1986,Whenever i go out to a night club or any place where i happen to get some attention from a girl i end up being too scared to do anything about it. For example last night i was at a nightclub and i was dancing and this group of girls were dancing around me and my friend and one of them kept backing into me and turned around to me and was just flirting with me basically. I liked her and i enjoyed that attention but i ended up leaving the dance floor and from her point of view it probably looked like i just rejected her. I get so afraid that when i get attention from a girl even if it's obvious that she liked me i be so scared that they will see something wrong with me or something and just stop flirting with me and leave. I'm not sure if this is a fear of rejection or a fear of abandonment.
1987,"Yep, another therapy thread.

I hope this will be a thread where people with diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and Depression/Recurrent Suicide Ideation can share their experiences/preferences for DBT vs CAT.

The advantage of CAT is that it appears to be a no-bullshit, integrated approach, one that examines history, comes up with a plan, and then therapist + patient work collaboratively, with both an analytical approach, understanding root causes, and also a practical, cognitive approach - what can be changed. This is my current understanding of the approach from research - correct me if I am wrong and you have had a different experience of CAT.

The advantage of DBT is that it is supposed to be therapy designed for those with BPD, and if done correctly, can equip patients with a range of skills and strategies for coping at their worst moments.

So, do you have a positive/negative experience to share about either DBT or CAT? Do you have a preference for either? Or perhaps you have tried both, at varying points in your life??


Please feel free to share, and let's kick this BPD in the butt!!!

XO"
1988,"I am SO tired of being corrected, argued with, and disagreed with. I am so tired of school/work whatever grad school is. It is literally awful. 

I cat-sat this week for my own cat because I was dumb and got a cat  with my then roommate a couple years ago and she kept him. It was wonderful but now my apartment is empty again which I also find stupid. 

I want a cat of my very own but my bf is semi-allergic and doesn’t want pets ever so what do I get a cat anyway and move in with him in like 15 years after it’s gone or do I say forget him and have a pet or what. I’m SO flipping tired of accommodating people and having nobody to really give me what I need in a given moment. Or to give in to what I want just because.  

I’m tired of people saying that I won’t have connections if I don’t reach out when very few people reach out to me. Why the heck isn’t it their fault then? They’re doing the same thing and they still have plenty of friends even though they’re not as nice or caring as me. 

I’m tired of being called “moody” when people push my buttons and then seem shocked that I have emotions other than detached and pleasant. 

I’m tired of being 24 and acting like I’m 84. 😬

I wish you guys were in my real life too. I mean you are I just wish we all lived closer and could hang out and stuff. You’re really really nice and make me happy to chat with. I wish I felt nothing but support irl but so many people think it’s more important to be right. 

I’m ALSO super stubborn and insist on being right actually but it’s seen as rebellion and sassiness from me. So I ALWAYS have to let other people win even though I’m very intelligent (not bragging, it’s like my only talent and I prefer to own it) I act like I’m dumb so other people can feel cool. 

When do I get to be the person I am? People might just have to move over and accept me and I guess I act so submissive because I am 0% confident that anyone will actually do that. Better just people please."
1989,"Hi, new here, this is my first post. 
So I've been diagnosed with BPD since I had a major depressive episode during December and my mood swings were out of control. Before being diagnosed I was dropping in and out of college courses, doing the usual stupid, self destructive shit I always do. It's been this way for about 4 years now and I'm the quiet type of BPD so I stick to myself. I've completely self isolated, deleted most of my social media and don't talk to anyone. I just stay at home in my room beating myself up for essentially ruining my own life. I'm more stable now I'm on medication and I do have a few close friends to talk to but that's mostly just online. I'm completely alone and it's all my fault. I don't do anything, I don't have a job, I'm still too unstable for voluntary work because of my sleeping pattern and can't go back to college until September. I'm just stuck. What's worse, I can't seem to handle getting into relationships, either. I would love nothing more than to meet someone who likes me for myself, I'm just terrified of rejection and the moment something goes wrong or they get too close I withdraw and blame myself for it all. 
I am getting help, going to DBT sessions and so on but that's not helping me be productive, or making me feel less lonely. All I do with my time is go online or walk the dogs and it makes me feel like a complete loser since everyone else my age is doing what they're supposed to - studying and seeing friends all the time. I wish I could be like them but I always ruin it for myself somehow."
1990,"My best friend was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder a couple of months ago, I feel that she is not coping well, if at all. She has told me just recently that she feels that its all too much and she no longer wants to be here. She has 3 children and works full time so seeing a counsellor for 2 hours twice a week, like she has been offered, is not always doable. She was told they could either give her antidepressants or anti anxiety tablets but she refused.

I am basically just looking for someone to point me in the right direction of some kind of coping mechanism for dealing with it. Like everyone she has good days and bad days, recently things seem to be getting worse for her and its killing me to sit back and watch as i don't know what to suggest. I have struggled with my own mental health issues and am currently in the process of gaining a mental health qualification but i feel i am too close to her to know how to help.

I'm sorry for the rambling post and if it doesn't make much sense, i just don't know how to help her."
1991,"Hi all!

I’m here today because I have been self reflecting the past few weeks and have thought it may be possible that I have quiet BPD.

Anyone out there who suffers this I would love to hear from you, maybe your opinion on whether my symptoms indicate this disorder or not.

I’m coming out of a year long period of acute depression and anxiety for what I thought was the first time in my life. Now that I am coming back around I questioning whether I ever really was ‘normal’ before this episode.

I have been reading over diaries I wrote on my phone over the past 5 years and now I think I have suffered from emotional issues for a long time all really surrounding my relationship.

I read with BPD that relationships are unstable. Even though I have been in the same relationship for 12 years it has been really rocky for about half of that time. I would constantly breakup and go back break up and go back. The main issue was feeling rejected and unloved no matter what he told me. I remember going into depressive moods for around three days at a time where I was convinced I hated him and wanted to leave then I would switch back to loving him and wanting to stay. The emotions were very intense and these episodes have been going on for years.

I have also had a lot of anxiety around commitment and progressing in a relationship like not wanting to get married have kids or buy a house because I am so indecisive about how I feel about my partner, it changes all the time.

I go through intense periods of feeling lonely isolated and trapped whereby all I can do is lie in bed and want to die.

I have never acted out, I don’t get angry or hurt myself or threaten suicide but the internal feelings are still strong. The only thing is these feelings are only for my partner. All my other relationships with friends, colleagues, family are very stable and secure.

Does anyone think this may be quiet BPD. It sounds like it in some ways and not in others.

I’m currently on antidepressants and will be going to see my psychiatrist soon so any advice would be much appreciated!

Thanks"
1992,"I have been struggling immensely to just make myself do things that come so easily to neurotypical people. When I get out of bed, put on actual clothes, brush my teeth twice a day, things of that nature, I practically pat myself on the back. I am 21, high school drop out, w/ no license, no job, have only worked one official job for five months; my crippling anxiety from having bpd and mild agoraphobia make it so hard for me to make myself do anything. I feel like a champion for a few hours when I actually go out and see the one friend I have left. I feel like a god when I actually go to the store not even a block from my house alone. I tell myself it's okay to feel good about small victories but at the end of the day I cry myself to sleep so frustrated about my never ending failures. I'm so tired of being told ""you're young still!"" It doesn't matter man. I've wasted the last ten years of my life on this up and down roller coaster. I was planning to write more, get how I'm really feeling off my chest, but it feels so pointless. I'm shocked I've even made it this far."
1993,"srry for making my first post so long and dumb.

i've been trying to take things reeeal slow and deny my quick attachment but there's this girl that gave me enough hope to actually start taking care of myself more than i have in the past. i've quit smoking weed (period) daily to cover the anxiety i feel every day and am trying to fix all sorts of ruin that this disorder has brought to my life (though i'm drinking more now) even though it's overwhelming. 

even though i call her my favorite person i feel like i can't love anyone right now because i'd be dragging them down and how erratic my trust towards my friends can be.

she acts nice and relatable when i talk to her but other times i feel like i'm being pushed away.

I feel like she's at the center of this delicate social web i've started to rebuild for myself and if i cut her out the rest will just twist in the wind(i'll cut and run from people).

we had to separate for what was supposed to be less than an hour tonight but right now there's a bunch of my crap at her place and i can't figure out if i was ditched or if she actually got into enough trouble to drop the plans we had for the night like she says when responses are so few and far between.

I feel justified in feeling angry and shitty for maybe not being patient...hate myself."
1994,I suddenly feel like I need to share my emotions and thoughts with someone. Anyone. Like super strong urge all of a sudden and I don’t even know what it is I want to say. For now I can tell my cat lol.
1995,"I post way too much first off so sorry lol. But I almost just lost it over what i thought was a rude email at work. After drafting lots of angry responses I took the calm route and discovered it was all a misunderstanding. I was reading sarcasm into an email where there was none. It was supposed to be a compliment and I took it offensively. To my defense my family thought it sounded offensive too but that was in context of how I saw it. 

So awkward. Admittedly this lady emailed the way you would text a friend which I didn’t pick up on like she could have been more professional. 

I just can’t believe how angry I got."
1996,"I've started writing a blog piece about men with BPD. Particularly about the male borderline's FP and how this relationship can overlap with various manifestations of his Anima. I intend to hopefully do a female borderline version also but I want to keep the articles separate because there are differences between male and female borderlines but mostly because the way in which women relate to their Animus is very different than how men relate to their Anima. I have been studying the Anima and Animus for a few years now and it is a bit of an obsession of mine. 
Meanwhile I struggle daily to deal with my own FP issues, mostly the fact that I need one in the first place. There is little reward in trying to wish it away or reason with it. It's always there in some small way, gnawing away at the back of my brain like an itch that can never be scratched. Part of the undying allure of an FP for me (my FP's having always been female,) is that they appear in my life unexpectedly and regardless of whether or not I was romantically involved. This fact motivated me to initially keep my feelings for the two FP's I've had in my life a secret. I find this interesting because I believe that in becoming a borderline early in life one of my coping tactics was to always keep some small part of my psyche secreted away from the world, perhaps so that it could never be taken away. 
Being introduced to the manifestations of my Anima was equally as unexpected as meeting my FP's. One could jokingly say that a man discovers his Eve stage of development the moment he is born. On a less humorous note my Anima graduated into Sophia while I was being blindsided by an accidental Satori a few years ago. At that time I also stumbled across my current FP with whom I shared a bizarre Kundalini with. Sadly she was submitted to a bit too much of my Sophia projection upon her. But there it is in a nutshell. My current FP shared a platonic spiritual event with me while simultaneously becoming an unwitting projection of the personification of my integral link to the Collective Unconscious. 
My FP is not a borderline and because I understand the nature of the burden I must move on now. She is not good with people to begin with as she is likely a Schizoid. So now the question is how will I patch the hole in my psyche. I doubt that it's something a borderline can do purposefully. Can we choose a new FP like selecting a apple from a tree? Probably not. But if we could select a non-romantic  FP maybe it would be easier to choose from among the borderline community rather than from neurotypicals. LOL. Maybe something different for me this time. I'm a bit tired of Western women, perhaps I'll chance upon a sweet Vietnamese woman next time. One can always hope."
1997,"Most days mid afternoon I hit this weird point where I’m mildly panicky on the inside and thinking “am I bad? Am I horrible?”

1998,"So almost 2 years ago I had a counselor suggest I had BPD... Without much of a thought I dismissed her. Over the past year I have struggled with myself, my identity and most of all with my relationships. I feel so disconected and unable to put into word how hopeless and stuck I feel. Was I always like this..? Is it just thebsituation I am in now? Will it go on forever? Is there any way out? How do you keep going when everything seems to be against you or that the people you let close to you will never stick around.. When will things go bad and leave me a mess again? Oh wait... I think I might be doing it to myself... I obsess over every little thing, I worry the worst will always happen.. I tell myself Im not afraid to be alone, yet im terrified at moving out of my parents when im 28 years old. How can this be my life?? Why do i feel so disconected all the time? Does anyone even care? As I feel all of these mixed emotions and sort all these thoughts if I think rationally I know there is an amazing man in my bed sleeping as i sit here listening to the stillness of the night, but my irrational thoughts always win.. He doesnt love me. I will never be good enough. Im a failure. Why do I even try? He is going to leave me, cheat or he has to be lying about something... I mean what is he hiding? Or is the truth that I am the one hiding... Boxing myself off and self sabatoging because im scared... Am I ready for what life will bring next? Or would it just be easier to slip away..."
1999,"...... you have BPD? 

How many of the disorders listed do you have?"
2000,"Summary of ‘Mindfulness for BPD’

Chapter One - Borderline Personality Disorder

This chapter outlines the nine criteria for BPD. For a person to be diagnosed with BPD they have to have five of the nine symptoms in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Medical Disorders also know as DSM ,    to be present.

1/. Fear of Abandonment - you have a strong fear that people closest to you will abandon you so make great effort to avoid abandonment

2/. Unstable, Intense Relationships
Many suffering from BPD fear being alone so when they have relationships they attach rapidly and intensely to others

3/. Identity Disturbances
Who you are and what your values are can shift & change rapidly which can reflect in your employment and relationships

4/. Impulsivity - behaving quickly without evaluating the consequences which can result in high risk behaviours

5/. Recurrent Suicidal Behaviour & Self Injury
People injury themselves because the physical pain is easier to handle than the emotional pain and those who self injure  are thirty times more likely to be suicidal as well.

6/. Emotional Instability - unstable moods, along with difficulty controlling emotional extremes is a defining problem for people with BPD.

7/. Chronic Feelings of Emptiness - you experience unrelenting feelings of emptiness where you feel alone and unmotivated

8/. Expressions of Intense, Uncontrollable Anger - to others your anger may seem excessive, as if you were making a mountain out of a molehill. Your anger often drives others away

9/. Paranoid and Dissociative Symptoms
During times of high stress you might imagine that other people are intentionally trying to hurt you or make your life miserable and feel like you are unreal or living in an unreal world.

Symptoms not in the DSM

Feeling Misunderstood
Self Hatred
Extreme Sensitivity to Others Emotions
Being Right over Being Effective
Lack of Sense of Continuity of Time
Perfectionism
Being Considered Manipulative by Others"
2001,"Does anybody have any tips for help with self sabotaging behaviour?

I’ve had the opportunity to spend a majority of my life surrounded by nature as a way of healing and its been miraculously healing. Since I’m not good at social intersections I know not to get involved in them but somehow felt comfortable enough to go online and do fairly well meeting friends and sharing. 

Then when things are going really well I will suddenly self sabotage and do it in the most shocking way that makes it uncomfortable for others including myself yet don’t really understand why I do this and would like to stop it. It’s disrespectful to everyone including myself. 

Is anyone here familiar with this type of behaviour and could offer any insights  into this type of self destructive behaviour?"
2002,"I've been working very hard lately to get my life together. In my doctors point of view (and even in my own slowly) I am doing everything I can, and I'm doing very well.

My therapist always told me to look to the good parts of my life to apply that skill to others. The good part was my partner of 16 years. He had trouble understanding my needs and everything like that for a while. It is hard on him too. I get that. But lately, I thought he was super supportive, and everything was great. Everything in my life was looking up. A clearing was in sight, so to speak.

Come to find out, he bad talks me all the time to his boss/best friend. He told her I bother him with my ""daddy issues,"" I would never survive on my own, he messed up by not marrying someone rich, I don't do anything around the house, etc. It's all lies or exaggerated and his friend laughs at my problems. He also was clearly and nicely communicating any issues between them or helping her when she was down. Things he can't seem to do with me.

As you can all imagine, this is a nasty hit to someone with BPD, and I'm so lost on what to do. I totally get my health has been stressful on him. But I don't think that gives him the right to put me down to another woman then be fake with me. And then boarding on emotionally cheating.

Any ideas on how to confront the problem without feeding the fire would be helpful, or any other advice. Also, anyone that can relate would help me feel a little less alone. Thanks..."
2003,"After giving up on the NHS I have decided to get my own Psychologist as I cannot tolerate my suffering anymore.

Any advice from individuals who have already been through it would be appreciated."
2004,"Hi everyone. I am newly diagnosed with BPD, but suspect it’s been there since my early teens. I was referred to a clinic that specializes in BPD, bipolar, and anxiety, but can’t get in until July. In the mean time, I’m left to continue struggling and don’t know what to do. I just want to let it all out somewhere because I know my husband and family still don’t understand how my mind works. I have had suicide attempts in the past (most recent was December 2017). I am having the worst time and can’t “get out of my head” anymore. It’s constsntly running and thinking of all of the potentially devastating things that could happen, mainly in my marriage. My husband is the love of my life, and I have always felt he was out of my league. 

Every day, my mind races with thought of my husband (the love of my life) leaving me, or cheating on me. I become consumed with the thought that he’s going to fall for a woman at work, or catch up with old female friends/exes and decide he likes them more because they are prettier (I have a body ruined from having kids and an unattractive face) or have better personalities. It is literally all I think about. I stalk the FB pages of girls he was friends with and/or dated and it makes me want to die every time I see him like their pictures. I hate seeing. Their comments on his things.

We have had nothing but struggles since we married a couple of years ago and I know most are from my mental health issues. Monday morning, I broke down and packed my belongings and left. By the end of the day, I regretted doing it and it has been a rough week ever since. We have been talking and he wants me to get help and for us to work...but when I left, he re-friended the one female from his ost I have always thought had the most potential to “steal him” from me, and now I feel like I can’t even function. I think about her all day. I think about her striking up a conversation and him beginning to look forward to their chats. She has the body of a supermodel and he has always said she’s “just a nice person.” I know he says it to justify being her friend, but in my mind it makes her better than me, more so than I already thought. 

My entire life, my BPD symptoms have revolves around relationships. I have an intense fear of abandonment. 

Has anyone overcome their problems enough to repair thre damage it has caused to their spouse or significant other? I am feeling so hopeless and like I will never get better and be able to just enjoy life without always worrying someone will take him from me..."
2005,"We're all fake living fake lives aren't we?
And this is this the beginning of my disappearance from humanity

2006,"I signed on last year, have been waiting a total of 1 year and 2 months now, it's starting to really get me down, am I not sick enough to be considered for it or something? Do I have to 'attention seek' to get onto it earlier?"
2007,"I recently posted about my breakdown and how a week ago today, I packed everything and left my husband abruptly. The next day, I came back and knew I had hurt him so much. The night before, he added an old female friend that he also dated just prior to our relationship starting. I had forced him to delete her once we were engaged, because my belief has always been that if you kissed it, loved it, or screwed it, it has no place in your life once your in a committed relationship. 

Now, I’ve been consumed with these bad thoughts. I know he spoke to her last week about everything when it happened. I also know she said she would come over. Now I have it in my mind that she was at my house, or they met up. What if there was physical contact? What if they kissed, or sexually touched one another, or worse? I can’t handle it. I know I wouldn’t be able to stay with my husband if it happened, even though it was the day I left. I feel so broken and like I can’t go on with my life. I want him so bad, but I want him to only want me. I don’t want him to want her in any way. Not her “friendship,” not her perfect body, not her company. Me. 

I don’t know why I’m posing and rambling. I have no one left. I’ve burned so many bridges that I can’t talk to anyone. He is my everything and I feel like I will never be the only woman he wants."
2008,"Recently I decided I wanted to try online dating. Nowadays I always try to keep the old BPD symptoms under control when I relate to others, yet sometimes they come up again - the abandonment and rejection. 

What's really got to me recently is a guy coming on really strong, we were messaging loads, he even inferred we had a future together, then more recently, it was me initiating... and most recently, he's not replied to my message about meeting even though before he was so up for it. It's been a whole day and he hasn't replied and I feel overwhelmed by feelings of rejection and abandonment. I don't see how someone could come on so strong just to disappear like this. What did I do to deserve this rejection?

I've got important life stuff to focus on. Please can someone give me a tip of how to control my emotions of rejection and instability, it's not working."
2009,"Hi,
I am keen to get a recommendation on a book covering BPD.  I ask as i am under the Complex PTSD banner, but given the two have a lot of similarities, i would be keen on something simple (small book), that explains BPD well.

thank you kindly"
2010,"I'd really like some advice regarding feelings about my FP, who is my partner. These feelings are so exhausting and I just want them to stop; I want to be calm about things and not overworry or get upset over every little thing. 

What's currently got me down is that I'm almost certainly not seeing him this weekend because he has a cold. Normally he'd be fine with coming over anyway and I'd rather get ill that not see him, but I recently recovered from severe sepsis and was told in hospital to avoid illnesses at all costs because about half of people who get it once get it again within 3 months.

Knowing I can't see him because the thought of being ill skyrockets my anxiety after sepsis, my night was ruined and it was really hard to sleep. Today I'm filled with anxiety because he hasn't responded to my messages this morning. 

I at least know not to tell him about these over-the-top emotions, because that would stress him out, but they're so hard to cope with.

Feel free to talk about your own experiences too and how you deal with those feelings. I'd really appreciate any input at all."
2011,"One of the men that assaulted me is dying. 
He's got internal bleeding. 
My mom told me yesterday and she wants to celebrate but I don't see what there is to celebrate. 
Nothing's changed, it still happened.
I don't feel much of anything right, kinda empty. 
But mostly alone.
The only 2 people who know exactly what happened that night is me and him.
Now it's just me.
I just would like to know if anyone has been through this before and how you dealt, anything I should know. Maybe feel less alone"

2014,"I want to run away. Childish, I know. But that's the impulse that keeps showing up. I want to say fuck it, leave this mess behind, start over where no one knows my past and prove that I can do things all on my own. Those in my life now might be better off in the long run, who knows.

An identity suicide instead of... the alternative. Is there a way to apply this craving on a smaller scale? Maybe. I don't know. I feel like I've hit way too many walls and it's no longer worth fighting to only reach another. I do everything I'm supposed to, everything I possibly can do, and it's never good enough- the story of my life. I'm defeated. I'm a burden. What else can I do??"
2015,"BPD has led me to be a stimulus seeker. However, only things that are self destructive with an element of danger, for example getting so drunk I can’t stand then driving like a lunatic. It’s as though I play Russian Roulette and if I die I die. 
I got diagnosed earlier this year which explained all my erratic behaviour and I start therapy next month. I’m excited about the possibility of getting better. So what do I do, rapidly increase my smoking and recreational drugs, the one thing my doctor told me not to do. I feel I’m killing myself but I don’t really want to but can’t stop.

2018,"Last night after the most perfect day my bf and I argued and afterwards we got closer to understanding why we do. 

Here are a couple of my triggers: 

My friends were visiting this weekend and I wanted to include him as much as possible. He didn’t come until the last day but then it was amazing. I’d been ticked that he wouldn’t just show up when I invited him but instead was like “just enjoy your friends”. Like that could be sweet but I really really want you here. 

Anyway at the end he was like “see, that worked perfectly. You should be that way when my friends visit too. He doesn’t want me trying to be part of it I guess. Plus he was referencing times when his friends visited and I was trying to hard to be there. That hurt my feelings because after a wonderful day he brought up times that were confusing or painful. I started to get ramped up. 

The trigger that was the kicker was that as he’s listing other stuff I shouldn’t panic over (thanks Im cured) he said “and don’t worry about the future too much”. 

That made me so furious. Idk what he meant but I heard “don’t make plans involving me or expect me to be around later. Just chill out and hang out and have sex with me” 

Both of my friends are moving in with their bfs soon and they have worked out timelines of when they will get engaged, married, etc. They’ve talked about it. My bf who has been around the longest is like “I can’t promise that, I don’t want to say what will happen in the future in case it doesn’t, etc.”

He says this is because of his PTSD and how he always thinks he’s about to die. 

I would be patient if he wouldn’t bring it up I wouldn’t. 

Why say “don’t worry about the future” as if it’s a problem that I would like to make plans to be with him? Taking things so slow is his issue. I’m normal. 

He even said “I bet your mom tells you to just have fun”. And I was like no. 

She’s like “it makes perfect sense for you to want commitment. Give him a little while for him to show you and if he doesn’t then peace out” 

Ugh I’m getting mad again typing this I’ll end here lol."
2019,"Are frustration and anger the same thing? I'm sick of being told I'm angry when I'm not, I'm sick of people telling me how I feel and misinterpreting me. Why cant people just listen to the words that come out of your mouth? People who know me say I'm not an angry person (including my therapist) I'm so confused....."
2020,"So, today I was supposed to be going to a work conference. I've missed the last 2 years due to mental health. It was a choice of 2 days and my manager specifically chose the day I could do so if I wanted to go she would be there to support me. Another colleague was also going. Last night my manager rang to say she couldn’t go, work was manic and she couldn’t afford to lose a day. My colleague, N, was still going. I do get on with him but he is the opposite to me. He is confident, can talk to anyone. He wants to get on so loves networking (my idea of hell). Although not my ideal company for the day but still someone I knew and I could stick with. This morning, all ready to go, scared to death etc, he rings to say he isn’t going as he is sick.

I freaked out – I could do the travel although it’s a long way with train changes but the thought of being at a conference with 500 people I don’t know was overwhelming. I bottled it. I text my manager and told her I couldn’t do it. She said that was fine.



I have since emailed her – I apologized for not being more like N. Not confident enough to step in and help her when she is busy as I’m just too scared. Sorry for being frustrating and so ‘special needs’.



I know she has read it. I know she is busy. I am freaking out that she is now mad with me for emailing her that. I’m so angry with myself for doing it. I’m so bloody stupid.



I’m also not convinced that N is ill. I just think he couldn’t bear the thought of spending the day with me. I’m so caught up in my head that I’m boring company.



I can’t put into words quite how much I hate myself right now. I can’t blame others for hating me when I can see why they would.



I haven’t self harmed since November – there is a very high risk/chance that it will happen today.



Why am I so damn stupid and ridiculous??

2021,"I am looking to take every Tuesday off work to see my therapist for DBT Training. My company say I have three options. 
1. Take the days as holiday 
2. Work a Saturday or Sunday 
3. Take the days off as unpaid 
Is this correct? I thought legally you could take the days off as sick leave?  Any advice would be appreciated."
2022,"Hi, I'm new here and I thought I might try giving this forum a shot; I hold everybody at a distance and as such I have nobody in the real world to talk to about this, so I thought I would try here for like-minded people. I hope others can perhaps relate without judgement.

I'm 20 something yo female and I've had lots of therapy for OCD and social anxiety. I have never had much luck with therapy until my most recent therapist. I finally trusted her enough to bring up that I believed I had BPD. She immediately agreed and said looking back through our sessions I had said many things that aligned with that. This is all positive treatment-wise, and this therapist is the only one I've ever felt safe with.

This is also the problem. She has been so good that I've let her in far more than I have any other person. As mentioned, I usually keep emotional distance from everybody. But I didn't with her, and now I am deep in the midst of an obsessive kind of fixation with her. BPD as a diagnosis is new to me, but I think that this kind of emotional obsession is common in BPD? For me, in any case, this has happened with various women throughout my life, when I feel I am 'seen' by them.

We have since finished therapy because we reached the max number of sessions and I am not in a good way over this. I can't stop thinking about her or planning ways to bump into her. I've done things I'm not proud of - found out where she lives. I am able to not take this past that point (I have too much respect for her to initiate any unwanted contact at least) but I am not proud of my actions. I can't stop, though. It's consuming me and driving me mad. I feel as though I love her, but rationally it is clear that isn't possible, I think that it's a reaction to feeling as though someone finally cared/was listening.

Has anyone been through similar? Does anyone have any advice to get through this? I know I need to stop, but I constantly indulge my obsession and look for her online, find excuses to go near her house etc. I realise how this sounds; that's why I've turned here in the hope of some advice. Any insight from people who may have experienced this kind of thing would be so welcome. Also does this sound like something that might be caused by BPD? I am still exploring which of my behaviours is influenced by this.  Thank you very much all."
2023,"Some of you know my tumultuous relationship with my mom.

After she passed last November I have been making reasonable progress in rebuilding resiliency. 

But now the burial is coming in June. And it feels like she’s back again. I’m hyper-emotional and stressed and my dad is being a jerk.

I was expecting the burial to be just me and him. But now he’s invited my aunt who was so consumed by her own grief, it took her two weeks after the funeral for her to even ask if I was ok. Everyone else was falling apart, there was no room for me.

That’s the story of my entire family life. My mom was bigger than life, everyone catered to her moods to such an extreme level, that her behaviour grew worse and worse. Nobody protected me, even as a child.

And my aunt’s behaviour was atrocious. The funeral was all about her and her pain.

I was the one who lost a mother.

Now my aunt is coming for the burial. I don’t want her there. I can’t emotionally take it.

My dad is adamant that she’s coming. It doesn’t matter what I want. In fact I don’t even need to go, he says.

So I yelled and screamed about how he never protected me, how everyone else comes before me, how I don’t matter.

And I’m devastated. I do not want her there.

It’s my mom, surely what I feel should matter?"
2024,"Got into a weird convo then argument about marriage with my bf. I was pushing him to say he’d want to be married someday. He does but now he also thinks I’m lunatic. 

He wants to wait till after grad school to even discuss this. He says after that we’ll discuss things as they come up. That is just not my jam. I should have been nicer I’m sure I’m just ticked.

Everytime we get close I push like this. Like okay I adore you now either swear you’ll stay forever or go away and never come back. 

Im hurting him a lot and it sucks. Am I supposed to patiently wait? It’s hard! It’s hard to live solo and not be obsessed with him. I’m so flipping obsessed. How do I make myself enjoy life outside of him? I don’t even want to."
2025,"Hello, everyone!

I'm very interested in learning if any of you who struggle with BPD, have ever dealt with a painful breakup sometime in your life.

Last weekend, my boyfriend of almost two years has expressed that he's recently lost feelings for me and would like a break to see if his feelings reappear. He had also made mention of a guy from his past, who he had recently been re-acquainted with, had reached out to him and wanted to ""catch up"".  After he broke this news to me, I felt as though a rug had been yanked out from under me and that my entire life had been turned onto its side. This past week, I was a mental/emotional wreck. I had so much anxiety, I felt hollow. I had absolutely no appetite for food and could only eat small things - carrots, cucumber, etc. - and that was about it. At night, my stomach was in knots, and I'd constantly wake up with my mind was burdened with thoughts of my boyfriend talking to this other person. It was all I could think about for the following several days and it was all I could do to stay focused at work. When I would go out, I couldn't bring myself to go anywhere he and I had gone for our date nights or anything like that, as the returning memories would bring me to tears. I had gone out for dinner with my family at an outdoor shopping center that we have nearby. This was a place that he and I would come every few weeks or so, to eat, get drinks, shop and walk around, etc.. and being there in this instance, had me overcome with anxiety and sentimentality. At one point, I broke down....and I cried. Not heavy sobs but my feelings had gotten the best of me. 

Now, about a week later, I'm doing significantly better. He and I have talked everyday since and while I don't think his feelings for me have returned (yet?), I'm doing much better than I was last week. Adjusting myself to the ""single life"" has been a bit of a challenge but nevertheless, I've persisted and am doing better. 


Has anyone else ever been through something like this before? If so, how did you cope and how did you get through? 


Love and blessings to all! <3"

2031,"Hello everyone,

I read something interesting this morning regarding CPTSD - which differs from regular PTSD as in it results from *prolonged* or *continued* trauma, such as growing up with a narcissistic parent and thus suffering years of emotional abuse as a result of this (as I and I'm sure many others here have unfortunately endured or are still, in some regards, enduring...). The comment simply said that it's not uncommon for some BPD's to be misdiagnosed as such, and are in some cases actually dealing with CPTSD.

I had never heard that term before, though it makes sense (the concept, I mean...) I'm in the process of searching for a good therapist atm, and found this info useful - particularly as I was misdiagnosed Bipolar II for nearly 2 decades...

I didn't want to admit this, but I was never formally diagnosed BPD. I *always* knew the Bipolar diagnosis was ""off""/didn't fit - particularly as I've never had one manic episode. This was also validated a few years ago (that I'm NOT Bipolar), when I was back in the US - though my family still scoff at it and I think ""need"" for *me* to be the ""crazy one""...

I do, however, possess many ""borderline"" traits, particularly a shattering fear of abandonment, feelings of emptiness, rapid cycling while stressed, impulsivity, etc...

I know self-diagnos is harmful/not a good idea, but the health care where I live is very antiquated/old school and I don't wish to deal with my family while sorting myself out. A few people reading may be aware that I've been dealing with a lot at home, too...

*I just wanted to be honest - I hope i haven't offended anyone or that I won't be judged to negatively for this.... Apologies in advance if I have...*

I received a referral to a supposedly good psychologist, and with any luck, will try to set something up for next week...


I was just curious as to anyone's thoughts or experiences regarding this, personally or otherwise? Can anyone relate to this or see a correlation? Has anyone heard of this before?

Thank you in advance, and bless you... xx"
2032,So for years I've known I wasn't quite okay. Went the doctors alot and they always put it down to depression but the last few days I've been reading about bpd and seen the symptoms and triggers. I ticked all the boxes. I have got an appointment with my gp next week but hoping I don't get palmed off with depression again. Just wanted i know if it took anyone alot of time to get a diagnosis and what are the steps
2033,"Hi. 

About 8 weeks ago I left my GF of 11 years and have been constantly suicidal and regretful. This lead me to therapy which then led me to a diagnosis of BPD. 

I’m really struggling day to day with the constant dread, sadness and suicidal thoughts that seem to haunt me constantly. 

I’m hoping that anyone who has been through the same situation as me and has BPD can offer some advice to help me cope before I do something that will hurt everyone I love. 

I’m trying to find a suitable therapist who is trained in DBT with not much luck so I’ve no tools to combat how I’m feeling and the level of intensity that I feel it. 

Thank you. 
Sam."

I have been on antidepressants for some time and for many years I thought I had depression, though that never really felt 100% right to me. Recently, I have looked into bpd a lot and many of the symptoms associated with quiet bpd sound very familiar to things I have experienced my entire life, but I am worried that I am just being dramatic, overthinking, and overreacting. I don't want to go to a doctor for something that I don't have and I'm nervous to bring it up. I was hoping someone could give me some advice or tell me a little about their experience with bpd.

Lately I have been wondering has anyone gone to a mindfulness yoga treatment center for help with depression and bpd. 

I'm currently not working and having no routine and this unrelenting heaviness due to my depression is unbearable. 

Has anyone tried such a wellness program. The one in particular that i was looking at is new life foundation in Thailand. 

There is also another site I was looking into called mind body reset. I have been happy in the past I just want something to break through this depression so that life could feel brighter."
2041,"Whether I’m accepting “too little” or expecting “too much”

I wanna have my needs met gosh darn it. 

Most times I say that it’s “okay but I need mine met too”

My anxiety comes off as offensive apparently. 

I just need a little extra love and care!

Where can I get it from?"
2042,"years ago one place i used to live i went to see the psych i had to see and it felt like she had x ray vision, she kept staring at me and it felt like i had no clothes on, that kinda feeling

has anyone else had that feeling when dealing with a psych?

for the record i was fully clothed it just felt like she could see straight through my clothes and see all my secrets and hurts and everything"
2043,"I have diagnosed Bi polar ll and border line personality disorder, I am on medication and honestly for the most part doing pretty well, however I have been in a relationship ship for just about 4 years with a man who I believe to be the one, but we believe he has bpd or some type of mood disorder, his mental health had dibiliated to the point of not being able to work and his moods go from up down I hate you I'm leaving I wanna come back, I angry there's no hope to I'm on top if the world, he won't let himself be admitted to the hospital because he's scared which I understand, he's not to the point of suicide but deffinetly emotional exausting for me and him I'm sure, he sometimes want out of relationship sometimes wants to stay sometimes I'm his best friend then his worst enemy, it's hard like really tough but ge stayed with me during my hard times so I need to him, I got lucky and someone cancelled there psychiatrist appointment and I got in so I got help quick and it's like he resents me because ges struggling and has to be on the waiting list, hes been smoking a lot of weed to calm himself down but when it's not there he's almost unbearable at times; I know it can make mental worse, I'm aware but it'd either calm down or he has a meltdown .. so my question to the men here what can I as a girlfriend do to help ease his meltdowns, are their things I could be doing that's triggering? Basically how can I help him to a - b till he can get some legitimate help, I know there's techniques bit men are more critical and not interested or for my boyfriend his parents who deffinetly have disorders don't believe in th and push him down and made him think hospital is for crazy people not just people getting help, how can I ease the stress till he gets in ?"
2044,"I was diagnosed with BPD and severe depression last year after struggling since my teens with my emotions and my reactions (I’m now 29). Im in a long term relationship with a very caring partner and have a gorgeous 5 year old little boy who I think the world of. I’ve been having treatment in the form of various therapies and a whole load of depression medication that never really seem to lift my mood. I’m wondering if there’s any positive stories here involving recovery because I’m seriously losing all hope right now. I’ve always been able to keep a lid on my suicidal thoughts but recently, after the realisation that I might be like this forever has hit me like a sack of bricks I don’t want to be here no more- for everyone’s sake. I’ve lost myself and I don’t see a way back to any sort of “normality”"

2047,"Thought I would make a post here about stress just to vent about my general feelings of stress overwhelming me because there's no one I can really talk to about it in real life.

If I do talk to someone, I feel terrible because I am burdening them with my shit, and even worse, I've pretty much always been an emotional disaster and I am tired of bringing others down with my shit so I'd rather keep it to myself.

So yeah, just want to post on here about how stressed I feel.

I keep having invasive thoughts of hurting myself all the time, when I'm in the middle of work, but at the same time I haven't actually done it because I don't want to make a mess and cause others more problems."

2051,"Dont get me wrong.  I have completely given up on anything to do with having a life at this point.  Having a decently well paying job while being honest on my resume? Forget about it.  Plan on ever living on my own or even owning property?  Thats a laugh.  Thinking i will ever be anything other than a play thing?  Thats my best idea that never succeeded.

I was here like 10 years ago with no clue what life was about or how to cope or deal with it or interact or basically anything other than my very small comfort zone.  Low and behold i am here again, but older but with 3k dollars to my name and no prospects.  

I can maybe go back to school.  Thats a whole rack of lamb meat honestly and i dont want to get devoured by wolves again.

It would also be nice to turn on the tv once in a while and tune out, but that would be too easy for me to deal with.   My goggles are 3D at this point.  Have you ever watched yourself on tv?  I think i have been fished out of the water my own aggression."
2052,"Hey! 

I new to this forum, and also new to the BPD diagnosis. I have stopped drinking alcohol, it has been around 5 months now, as I found it made me very vulnerable, to making very bad and self destructive decisions, including promiscuity, and self harm, and just putting myself in general danger. Since being sober, I feel as though I have lost my sense of self even further.  I am feeling very out of touch with reality at times, somewhat dissociated, often wondering who the true version of myself is, and whether my life is true, and true to what I want (not sure if that makes sense). I am often feeling confused, and angry with what goes on in my head, I have started therapy, but I feel I am not even being honest with my therapist at times? Does anyone have experience with anything like this? With their brain kick starting in a negative way, since being sober, my thoughts are going at 100 miles an hour and I feel like I cannot switch it off, or concentrate on anything, I will be reading a book and be thinking of a million other things, so can't even take the information in. Or I'll be watching TV and not paying attention because my thoughts are whizzing around my head, then I will get in an argument with myself in my head about it. 

My emotions are absolutely all over the place, I am going through constant highs and lows, my mood switching at the click of a finger. I feel like being sober has only allowed me to feel absolutely everything, and then nothing at all, sometimes at the same time!?. I know I have been numbing myself for so long with alcohol and drugs, so this is probably expected, and I am sorry for the long post, I just haven't spoken to anyone about this, and needed to get it all off of my chest. And also wondered if anyone had any advise or guidance, or just some reassurance that this will slow down, or if this is the true me due to BPD, and I have to live with this forever? It is the first time I have been completely sober for ten years.

Sorry for the rant. I feel like I am going to snap very soon, and it is worrying me."
2053,"Hiii

Please be aware this is an extremely long post....please don't be put off.....would really appreciate some insights...thanks in advance!

So...my last post here was in aug 2012. A heck of a lot gone down in 7 years...
In my last post I was under care of physciatrist in Milton Keynes as I had zero luck,help or progress been started on venlafaxine, diagnosed with clinical depression,anxiety and borderline personality disorder .I had tried CBT and talk therapies,but just found they did more harm than good, I  was trying out hypnosis as a recovery method....

I'd love to say that things got better, in life and mental health.....no such luck...
Since then I have gone through a relationship breakdown resulting in divorce and house sale, used and taken advantage of by a so called best friend, taking risks ie sexual activity... meeting strangers,strange places,unprotected sex, met so many I lost count ,forgot people I'd met sometimes within days of meeting them <I'd forget details like thier name,~~~~sometimes I didn't even know there name,when wed met ..spent money reclasly...tried MDMA (bad reaction..lesson learned...) Neglected my health in every aspect though I did always take my medication...distanced myself from family and friends...I now have one friend...literally....my relationship with family is strained...I've dug myself into financial mess...debts up to the sky, would go without food ( for a long time relied on food banks and the church for help)...

Present day....I'm now on venlafaxine 300mg (recently been increased by mental health worker) he took me off respiridone as he didn't think I suffered physcosis..(he thinks I have unstable personality disorder. I think he will be re referring me for physciatrist again. Not feeling too positive about this due to history with this, but trying to give it a go,try again ,give it the benefit of the doubt...Suffer badly with insomnia. Tried a few sleeping tablets...nothing worked...(anyone else think zoplicone leaves a nasty taste for literally days) prescribed promethezine 10mg which is a anti histamine with sedating effects....taken for a month now and hasn't done anything for sleep...as an allergy med it's not great either , I have scabs in my nose, extremely itchy ears and terrible cattarah....so I've stopped the promethezine and started my ceterizine again which will hopefully clear the allergy symptoms...

My housing has become uncertain due to my financial strains. I have rental arrears...not yet served with eviction notice...but it won't be long....I'm getting help and support from the council (though they can't re house me till I get my eviction notice and become homeless iminantly) there is a company called Penrose who are also supporting me...
I have been to citizens advice and I'm now in a debt relief period...all being well all my debts and rental arrears will be cleared ...fresh start....I've set up affordable payment plans for bills---have a strict budget so bills will always get paid so I can't get in this mess again...just need to sort housing as can't afford the rent in a 3 bed anymore...

My support network from professionals at the moment is very good...I'm getting all the help and support available to me....
As for family,friends and people i can talk to....that's not so great....infact pretty non existent...

My dad and I are strained at the moment...weve never been massivly close,though I would have always said I was a daddy's girl...hes not particularly affectionate or forthcoming with love or feelings....he is up north, I'm south..havent seen him for about 2 years (not unusal) but do keep in close contact via text , occasionally a phone call (only if I call him) ****that had gotten less as I shut myself away from EVERYONE!.but recently I've been trying to contact more.I've been a huge burden to him financially while in my self destruct state...he and grandma paid off a chunk of my debts ....but since then...for about a year...I'm always asking dad for help with money....in my defence it's always for electric, food, heating,help with travel or medication etc...ranging from £5 to £50 usually around £20-30....I've been asking him too often...sometimes as much as once a week....he used to be in a better position financially,but since being medically retired he only had his pension,he's not able to claim benefits ,he's supported heavily by his wife...
Lately if I ask for money his response 80% of the time is no....regardless of how much or what I'm needing it for...on the occasions he helps, he tells me he's not happy about this,he can't keep doing it and won't do it again....then transfers...
I know I really ought to stop asking him...just get desperate sometimes and I honestly think no matter how old a daughter gets she should always be able to ask her daddy for help) +++please don't hate on me for this,I feel poo about it
I try to keep him in loop with my housing and finances....I do try to keep him up to date with my mental health too....but tbh he don't really get it...offers little sympathy or encouragement...

My boyfriend has his own mental health issues ...I've been supporting him massively....I encouraged him to stop work,so he could get out of an environment that was leading him down a destructive path...he's had some help with his mental health,medicated and they really seem to suit/help him...certainly help with his sleep anyway...he's kicked some serious habits,that were not good.hes waiting on a physciatrist referral.
He doesn't handle stress too well,pretty poor infact...he pretty much leaves me to the finances ,budgeting etc, basically anything that will stress him...I deal with..cos his stress gets me stressed and it's counter productive..
His coping mechanism is to not think about things, try block them out,hides rather than dealing...he needs the TV to distract himself,he can't handle silence ( in this respect polar opposite to me as I need quiet)....
He feels ready to get back into work, but something different to what he did before...generally speaking Hes a grafter...hard working....gets a thrill from earning and having money...also think he needs the routine...I'm just asking him to take his time, and perhaps help me get the housing sorted first...
He is supportive,he's helped me apply for benefits,encouraged me to get mental help again, helped me get on a bus for first time in years,ridded me of the evil so called friend that used me,he makes me laugh...
That said, I can't really talk to him ...it's more like I'm talking at him...most the time I have to repeat myself cos he's totally lost in the TV...he doesn't generally offer much input with things...
On a side note Our sex life has diminished...what once was extremely hot and satisfying is now pretty much non existent....he has completely lost his sex drive, no desire for it at all...I'm trying to be patient and understanding....but I'm extremely highly sexed....need it often....actually physically feel I need it...we have an agreement that on occasion I can see other guys...we are extremely open in our relationship,we have tried swinging,he's been with other women and me other men...it may sound crazy....but it kinda works...that said he hasn't been with other women for some time...but doesn't mind me meeting others...(I don't do it often...once a week at most-id be on it daily if I could...haha)

My one and only friend also has her own mental health problems....we used to be extremely close...we actually met off here all those years back....I text chat with her every day, make sure she's ok..talk on phone occasionally..don't see her as often anymore as her mental health isn't great atm..plus she's always got something wrong with her physically....I do feel sometimes it's abit one sided....it's rare she will text me if I haven't text her....if I try to talk feelings or mood etc she will usually say....I can't talk about this it will bring me down ...so...I can't really rely on her...

Other than that I have my grandma but she is getting old,has her ailments and she would just worry and feel guilty she can't see or hug me....
I have a few people I talk to online...some are people I've worked with or knew in the past, some I met online but never met in person, some guys that I've met in the past...
Some of them have said the usual things like you can always talk to me...any time.....I've occasionally reached out but just find that people generally don't have the time of day or can't be arsed...
So really I guess that's why I've come here tonight....

Currently I'm sorting my debts,trying to secure affordable housing...health appointments for teeth (neglected and poor state) eyes, blood tests, etc etc....all while supporting my bf, trying to control my own mental health and all that goes with it, and chronic insomnia...

Since last Monday at 6am I have been in an almost mental state of mind..Google's symptoms of mania~~ I pretty much have all of them ...I'm no doctor i know,plus internet can be mis leading...but I've certainly felt manic...acting very unusual,hyperactive,euphoric almost,buzzing...felt on a high...acting obsessively with a few things..zero appetite,going days without food..my sleep has pretty much been none existent....3 days in a row no sleep, then since a maximum of 2-4hours a night...was prescribed temazapam 10mg yesterday,to take one a day every other day,given 14 tablets....I was naughty , I took two....simply because no other sleeper has worked previously...plus have major sleep deprivation right now I wanted to pass out for like a day...no luck, it did nothing for my sleep...I had the usual 4 hours rest...little sleep, but not good sleep and not for long...not what I hoped for....my mind however seems a little calmer....bit more relaxed....tbh my mood is surprisingly good, I feel positive,determined,energetic,I'm kind of enjoying it....is that crazy??? It's weird I almost don't want to sleep...like I'm going to miss something....as a rule I live in bed....atm...I just don't want to go to bed....make any sense?
My memory is shocking....if I don't literally write it down straight away,it's gone from my mind seconds later and I can't for the life of me remember what I was thinking or going to do....shocking short term memory...(post it notes are my new friend,both on my tablet and to write on...I've got abit obsessive over it..)
I'm also extremely jumpy, kinda nervous...very sensitive to noise ,need quiet...
Other annoying things with my health....my body aches, all over, pains in back,legs arms...high cholesterol,close to danger zone for diabetes, my appetite is non existent, I'm being physically sick almost every day....

My biggest worry really is that at some point I'm going to crash or get really ill....burn out...worried about slipping into a deep depression...or am I guna snap and go crazy...
This is strange but as worrying and tiring this ""episode"" has been....it kinda beats sleeping all day,awake at night,no energy,miserable,vegetable.numb.

So....that's a long post....don't really know what I'm hoping for here tbh..just good to get it all out....do hope some of you read,and don't get put off by length...any insight to whether I could be in a manic state welcomed...any advice or thoughts please do message xxx"
2054,"I find myself venting about negative stuff for the full hour. I have good rapport with my therapist and it’s nice to talk about stuff I wouldn’t share elsewhere. 

But I leave feeling DRAINED and also like, I must be lying to him or exaggerating somehow without trying to because things aren’t that bad. Or am I just afraid to accept reality? 

Either way I always need a latte after. Today i took a latte with me and I’m still about to fall asleep."
2055,"Hi All,

I'm new to this forum, and forums generally in fact. I'm 27 - male and have been diagnosed with Bipolar / BPD. 

I'm recognising at the moment that my current state isn't tenable, and I wouldn't care much to allow myself years more suffering without trying to come to terms. 

I notice that I have frequent and intense and moods and trouble handling negative emotion and perceived rejection. I have summed it up as being - 'I'd rather shoot myself, than let somebody else shoot me'. 

It's a real struggle to make sure I react appropriately and proportionately to what's going on.

I find myself where I will end up being self destructive, snappy, emotional and overwhelmed. Drinking quite heavily at the moment and have been making a damn fool of myself, then feeling guilty and sorry that I allowed myself to be so out of control. Then I feel I can't leave it alone and I need to fix it and have people understand and like me again. So I go and out myself in the same situations and I just repeat myself. 

Had an appointment today to stop drinking and I'm also looking at a change of accomodation so I'm less in the town where the pubs and temptations are. Drinking and all that goes with it seems to me to be more about trying to interact and I use it to process the emotions, otherwise I'm not feeling enough or feel as though I need to have the storm and there'll be some outcome where it all fits into place. 

I'd just like to understand what others do to cope with these destructive behaviours, and what kinds of things you do, and also how do you deal with the aftermath with people - do you reach out to them and hope to rebuild a bridge, or do you just leave it, do you accept the isolation that those things cause? I don't want people thinking I'm crazy and I hate the idea they would just judge me as much less than I am. 

Sorry I'm not being specific, I'm new to this and I hope I'll be able to arrange my thoughts more clearly on reply to a specific response or point. 

Thanks. 

S"
2056,"I’m typically confident but i get bursts of feeling really angry at family, bf, and friends where I think they like other people more than they like me. Like today I’m anxious and angry and sad bc my mom is friends with a girl my age and it makes me enraged. Like your my mom just talk to and hang out with me. Who is this other girl?

I realize this is insanely inappropriate to be jealous and get stressed but it makes me feel panicked and sick. Nothing even has to trigger it. 

I’m the same with everyone in my life pretty much. I know it’s my weakness and I need to improve. I made a little chart for myself where I can get points for getting up on time, exercising, not lashing out when angry, volunteering, etc. When I fill my chart up I get to adopt a cat, sign up to foster for the humane society, or go get a massage. 

I hope by the time I fill it all up I’ll feel much better and more confident. 

But until then, how can I stop
The scary feelings when I feel super vulnerable and down?"

2058,"Hi
I am new to the forum and was wanting some advice with symptoms of BPD.
I am a 50 year old woman with a partner and a 21 year old son. For years now (without really realising it) I have had problems with mood swings, not wanting to socialise, overspending, excessive alcohol intake, being over sensitive/emotional and taking tablets to ease my moods. I have not yet been to the dr but have been finding life hard for quite a while and have taken more than I should to ease the emotional ache inside.
I have read about early trauma being a trigger for BPD. This was not abuse for me but my mum had two babies when I was aged 3 and 5 and they both died.  I do remember the second birth and even to this day, every time I think about them I cry.  I have never told my parents about this feeling I have. Is it guilt that I'm feeling because I'm here and my sisters are not? 
I am in a relationship but my partner can be sarcastic in the way he speaks to me. It is very hard to explain if I ever try to do something different he is detrimental as though that could not work or why are you doing that? I have also got upset when we have been out in the car and I've got the map reading wrong and it was my fault. I have spoken to him about my sisters but he says that it has got nothing to do with the way I am now. It has really got me down over the years and as a result I have comfort spent.
I really now should seek medical help as everything is getting on top of me but is it just because I am in a relationship that I am not completely happy with or are these typical symptoms of BPD? 
I am so confused."
2059,"Sorry for the rant guys, I'm going through some major stuff!!

The father of my son and his parents are trying to aggravate my BPD and make me look bad to social, and are neglecting to tell them about the things he(father of son) has done to make my BPD severe in the first place!

Hes been suggestive about a relationship and then lies and says he hasn't done that, begs me to not get him in trouble with social but will report me for specific behaviours I've been left with after massive abuse!

I'm fed up! He doesnt consider how hard it is for me to live like this, he makes me worse and knows hes doing it! 

And my son lives with him, and I cant get him to live with me instead, its tearing me apart! I just want to be a good mum! I just want my baby, I dont want to be hurt like this anymore 

Thanks guys :hug:"
2060,"I’m feeling super anxious again. I know I’ve improved SO much over the past several months and I’m so happy for that but I’m still not where I want to be. 

I think I might finally be ready to really focus on myself (instead of being obsessed with earning my boyfriend’s approval). I still don’t know whether he or I caused this dynamic though so I’m scared about being rude to him by focusing on myself. I think I’m ready to take that chance though. My health is more important than trying not to hurt his feelings and I feel like an awful girlfriend anyway because I can’t even let my guard down with him sometimes and he deserves more love than that. 

I don’t know how this got so messy! I’m a simple, laid-back person. This has been way over my head. Also we’ve been together for almost three years and I still swing back and forth between knowing we’re perfect together and it’s forever and being terrified that there’s no way this can work because I’m so angry at him and I can’t tell if it’s justified. 

I hope I’m not alone. I never had such intense symptoms of BPD until this relationship. I never even knew what it was before maybe a year ago. If I could end my BPD by moving on from this relationship, I’m finally thinking it might be worth it."
2061,Does anyone else live with someone they love and feel like it would be best to ask them to move out?  I have been feeling like my boyfriend and I are in a competition to see who has the worst mental health symptoms.  What should I do? I feel stuck in his emotional stuff as well as my own.  I am suffering and can’t get any space from him because we live in a trailer.
2062,"Hi everyone. 
So basically my first had shoulder dystocia (got stuck)and was 9lb5 my second gave me third degree tears and was 8lb5 and I’m now 38+3 with my third who is predicated to be 8lb 7 by the time I’m 40 weeks. 
I’ve been dealing with things okish but I’m absolutely terrified of delivery. 

I had a sweep Thursday and it didn’t work. I somehow stupidly got all my hopes up thinking it would work and have been convinced I’d have baby by now. I was so positive all week and I was super happy (despite waking in pain from spd every night) 

Now I’ve slumped. 

All day yesterday I pretty much spent sleeping which for me is unusual and I just feel like I have a really bad attitude of I don’t care and don’t want to care. 

I’m supposed to have another sweep Tuesday which I now don’t want and want to cancel, I am supposed to see the perinatal nurse tomorrow and want to cancel her and I have a consultant appointment a week tomorrow that I really want to cancel. I don’t want to see anyone, I want to lock myself away (which yes I know logically won’t help, but I really don’t want to see them)

I don’t want artificial induction and really don’t want a c-section which is what it will likely be suggested at 40 weeks. But if I don’t, I risk a big baby and dystocia again. 

I don’t want to spiral out down this path but I can’t face everything. I also don’t know what to do to help myself. I tried all the things to “cheer me up” but nothing works. I have had enough of everything."
2063,"So interesting. 

My doc recently upped my dose from 25mgs to 50mgs, and I was terrified to do it because even a quarter of the 25mgs would knock me out or make me foggy headed the entire next day.

When she upped it from a quarter to 25mgs I was like a zombie.

So I was skeptical about trying 50mgs so tried it over the weekend. 

Wow, so bizarre, but I feel better on the higher dose and even more odd, no fog at all.

Anyone else experience this with this drug? It logically doesn’t make sense."
2064,I am new here so please be gentle with me if I say something wrong.  In a very low place.  Psych therapist seems tired of working with me.  Feeling rejected.  Not sure if I want to be in this life anymore.  Things are dark.  Hoping to pass through this darkness and back into the light.
2065,"hey guys, long time no see. I haven't written in awhile and i figured this would be a good place to let my thoughts out. I was just kicked out of my house. I can't tell if it's because of my bpd and the way i act because of it OR if my parent's are actually the worst. Or something. Essentially what happened was I stayed out and went home in the morning instead of the night I went out. I got home and stayed in bed until 5pm. Then an hour or so later my dad pops into my room angrily asking ""what the hell happened last night?"" and i kind of just looked at him like what do you want me to say? Then we fought a little and he left. I self harmed bc its been a big coping mechanism for me even if not a healthy one since i was around 15-16. (sidenote: I know everything ive done in this is like stupid and uh im just dumb I KNOW) So yeah this is dumb but i was having a smoke in my bedroom out my window and my dad walked in on me and got super pissed he actually punched the door with some force. So my mom got involved and she started screaming at me and it got rly intense and eventually my mom screamed at me to get the fuck out and it's kind of a blur but i'm staying at my ex's place while he's out for the night and after that i'm not totally sure where i'll stay.
Basically I feel like i'm such a classic case of borderline here. Like stereotypical bpd. I feel extremely. I feel like everything is my fault. And I self harm like a fool. and im the black sheep of the family. and idk so much... anyway, kind words and advice about anything ive mentioned would be greatly appreciated."
2066,"Yeah so I've been running around like crazy all week on an intense high, doing things almost manically, even though depressed inside. Now suddenly feeling terrible and inadequate, a low low low.
Any advice as to how I can get out this slump?"
2067,"Hi guys! When I had a CPN I was doing some emotional regulation therapy with me, so I thought I'd share some things that work for me!

They might not all work for you, and different things work for different emotions and situations too, but please, anyone, feel free to include your own method too, maybe, just maybe we can all make a big difference for each other, and help those who never found anything that worked, or for those who have only just been diagnosed and dont understand how to get through the symptoms!

1. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOUR PERSONALITY!!!! 
I know it's called a personality disorder but I cannot stress this enough, BPD and EUPD are responses to trauma! Sometimes people who end up with these conditions dont have to suffer external trauma, it can also be caused by internal thoughts, and never learning to understand your emotions and mindfulness!! 
That's probably the most important thing to remember! And if you research, then you'll learn more about yourself too :hug:

2. IF YOU NEED TO, CREATE A LOG OF YOUR EMOTIONS!!
Complete a log over a few days or a week, write down what emotion you felt, you can start with anything, whatever is easiest for you to describe!
Write down the situation you were in, or the context for this emotion.
Write down some thoughts that went through your head at the time, how did you interpret the situation?
Write down how you WANTED to respond, what you wanted to do at that moment
Write down what you ACTUALLY did, and how you responded 

This should help those who feel lost in the condition to figure out your emotions more, learn some triggers, even for happy things! And believe me, it makes a HUGE difference!

3. CREATE A TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM
notice the early signs of a relapse, from being in control of yourself, to possibly dissociating, then to full relapse, no control over negative emotions and impulse behaviours. 

Write down things that make you GREEN and how it feels, what perks you up? Makes you happy? Keeps you feeling good?

Write down what makes you feel AMBER, starting to dip, feeling upset, distant, lost, lonely, dissociated 

What makes you feel RED? complete loss of control over emotion, extreme depression, suicidal thoughts, impulsive behaviour including self harming. 

It wont be easy, but itll help! A step towards recovery!!

4. CREATE A RELAPSE DRILL
when you feel yourself starting to dip, going into AMBER or RED, what can you do to help take your mind away from the emotion? How can you stop the emotion controlling your thought process and spiralling out of control?

HAVE A HOT SHOWER
I found showers are better than baths, because the feel of warm running water on my body takes my concentration away from thoughts and moods!

LISTEN TO MUSIC AND TIDY
keep that mind occupied! And dont forget, a clear living space is a clear head space!!!

PLAY SOME PUZZLE GAMES
get that mind working! If you're concentrating hard on something else, then itll help bring you back down to earth!

CALL THE CRISIS TEAM
Any free calling service to help, when you feel lost and beyond hope, PLEASE REACH OUT! PEOPLE CAN HELP AND YOU ARENT ALONE!!!

5. UNDERSTAND YOUR EMOTIONS
emotions have subcategories, learn them, itll help you understand yourself better!

6. GROUNDING
use all 5 senses!
What 5 things can you see?
What 4 things can you hear?
What 3 things can you smell?
What 2 things can you feel? 
What 1 thing can you taste?

You can do this anywhere without anyone knowing!

6. BREATHING
this is the most simple and easy! Count your breath! How long does it take for you to take a nice deep breath? Count it in, and out, close your eyes and try to empty your mind, it's a kind of meditation, itll help relax the mind and body

7. PHYSICALLY RESPOND TO THE EMOTION IN A HEALTHY AND SAFE WAY
hit a cushion, or throw it against a wall
Kick or throw a ball against a wall
Throw an ice cube into the bath to make it shatter! (Destructive and none harmful)
Write a letter to whoever or about whatever made you feel this way, aggressively tear it up!!

8. KEEP A DIARY
when your head feels cluttered and you cant think clearly, write it all down somewhere you know will be safe and for no one but yourself. It doesnt matter how terribly and scattered the wording is, itll get it out of your head and onto the paper! 


9.POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS 
I've seen the positive comments post on here, could we pin it to the top please for those who need it? Read those words, challenge those negative thoughts, and remember, ITS OKAY TO FEEL THAT WAY!!!! you are 100% allowed to feel that way! And just accept the emotion, let it roll over you in waves, cry if you need to, accept it, and I promise you, itll be over so fast!! 

I accepted my own negative emotion without help or prompting s few days ago, and i genuinely started crying happy tears, in my 22 years of life I had never been able to do so, and I was so happy to make such progress!!


That's all for now guys, I'll try and add to this when I can, please if anyone can add to this list then do so!

I love you all, and wish you all the best! YOU CAN AND WILL GET BETTER, WE ARE ALL HOLDING OUT OPEN HANDS, WE ARENT DOING THIS ALONE :hug: <3"
2068,"Hi again!

Just need to vent a bit really, but I'm feeling rather used and abused at the moment. The father of my boy has been rather 2 faced, I had to be investigated by social services after my son was born because of my childhood, and my ex broke up with me an hour after. My son is 1 year old, I'm only just being allowed personal time between me and him again, although he doesnt live with me, and his dad has been push and pull, sleeping with me then rejecting me, the reporting ""concerns"" so social about me, but when I've explained that I told him not to do something because it sets off my BPD he does it anyway, then reports me. I've explained to the social worker and she said his behaviour is completely put of order, and I shouldn't be put through this, with what he is doing, I'm even on the sick because of my mental health and I still give him £200 a month for our little one.

I guess it's just making me feel really used, and after having a terrible life in general I'm fed up, it makes me feel like no body cares, im never going to be loved or appreciated, I'm sick of being taken advantage of. Once he even went on whisper and pretended to be someone else, I opened up the  he was being a dick, so I blocked him, when I found out and called him out on it cause he wanted to find me on there, was that I had the same name as someone else who blocked him, and it's just a coincidence that the person I blocked has the same name as he had last night, well before he talked to me.

I'm fed up guys, I cant cope with being treat like this anymore, but thank you for reading :hug:"

2071,Hi I'm Dave I'm 36 37 in a few days I've been diagnosed with personality disorder anxiety depression and ptsd I feel totally alone I try to be stable for my partner and kids but I've never really spoken to anyone in the same sort of situation
2072,"Hi there I was diagnosed with bpd 4 years ago after a suicide attempt (in hospital for 2 months and done perm damage to liver) 

After domestic abuse and being sexually attacked by a ex and his friends, I completely broke down. Dorset police decided to dump me in Bournemouth (never been or even heard off at that point, my geography is terrible) I am very isolated and only have one friend here, we are seeing less and less of each other as he has so much work on and multiple jobs to do.

I was only ever seen by the mht once, they put me on medication that turned me into a zombie, I stopped taking them 2 years ago. My life just feels at a complete standstill I hardly leave my bedsit and have just given up on life, I've been rejected for pip twice. First assessment I got 7 points the next one I got zero, my circumstances had got worse! 

I enjoy cleaning, art, history, music is my main passion, sci-fi geek, pizza is my comfort.

I don't drink and gave up smoking a couple of years ago, I now vape. It's saved me a fortune, a 20 a day habit is not justifiable when you are on benefits.

I'm nervous even though I'm only typing on a forum, so I've probably rambled on long enough, I'm just typing what ever comes into my head. It would be so nice to have people to chat to who have the same condition as me. I'm gay by the way. I'm masculine and just happen to like men. Saying that I have 0 sex drive, the medication I was on destroyed my drive and even 2 years after I stopped taking them it hasn't returned.

I'm also a massive animal lover, my favourites are dogs, owls and squirrels.

Hope you are all having a good weekend and hope to chat to some people very soon."
2073,"HI there,

I'm new here and I thought I'd write a little just to see where this can go.

So I currently started going therapy (about 3 months ago) and slowly discovered that I might have BPD.
I am still waiting to be referred to a psychiatrist (NHS) and it's making me go crazy.
I used to smoke weed to help myself and it was working but things can get a little crazy so I stopped. I am finding it hard to do anything and not have a breakdown or aggressive outbursts at work... on the way to work... at home. 
I can't even sleep properly anymore, I keep on having night sweats, nightmare or just wake up for no reason.
My life just turned up side down and there's so many issues in my head I lose count (which makes me even more irritated), I feel like I don't know anything anymore and everyday I wake up I start all over again; al my work goes out the window.

This is affecting me in every way, with every relationship (not that I have many)
I am so tired and idk if I am ever going to be ok, to be honest I am really starting to lose hope.

I would like to write down everything but I don't even know where to start from.
I was wondering if anyone actually got better with therapy, and if yes, then how does it feel? How much better can you get? Also wondering what medicine works best, was wondering if anyone could tell me what they were prescribed and if you could rate it?

Many Thanks!!
;)"
2074,"I was first diagnosed with EUPD, well diagnosed with a question mark. After digging deeper complex PTSD made more sense. Although they are both so similar. 

The reason I am questioning this again is how I've been lately. How I was, was a reaction to somebody else and their mood. Which could very well be, and it makes sense, that I was triggered by their mood which caused me to react and dip how I did. 

It's so confusing. I feel right now that I overreacted and blew it all out of proportion in my own mind. Although, I didnt. It was as bad as I felt it was. But now things have calmed down, I'm feeling a lot calmer and positive and find it hard to view the situation how I did 3 days ago. 
From wanting to cut contact with someone to feeling positive in seeing how things go now that they're calm. Just seems like a drastic switch to me."
2075,"Woke up early enough to take my sertraline like actually in the morning and I can tell it’s making a difference. Yay! Also tried melatonin last night, thanks for the great advice! ❤️❤️"
2076,"This topic might be hard for people. But I seriously need to find advice on this. 
[tw: self harm mention]



I have bpd. I am currently in a relationship with a girl who’s studying psychology, knows a fair bit about bpd and is very understanding. She’s polyamorous. I’m perfectly happy with her being poly. I don’t know if I’m poly myself but I’m exploring that. That might not seems] important, but trust me it is. We’re also long distance, she’s seeing 2 other people right now, but it’s a fairly open relationship, we both date and sleep with other people, mostly friends with benefits. Me a lot less often than her, but that’s my personal preference. 
I’ve tried seeking advice for this on relationship forums, poly forums, but the bpd being a factor has confused people and no one really gets the nuisance of bpd there, so here I am. 

My gf and I met and both slept with someone at a club at my uni, this person became a fwb of both of our’s but I was a bit sceptical. This person has bpd too. I will refer to them as X for anonymity. They are a fair bit younger than me and my gf, which might go into it. I was drunk during the night but from recollections with other friends who were there I know X didn’t flirt with me during that night before we all hooked up, but was flirting with my gf. This would usually be fine, poly after all, but since that night and while trying to cultivate a new friendship with X they would constantly say things like “no, I was into you too! I’m into both of you, I just didn’t flirt with you because you were too drunk and I didn’t want to take advantage!” Makes sense, except we were all drunk and I wasn’t that drunk at the start of the night when X started flirting with my gf, so part of me doubts this was the case, but something they say to make me feel more comfortable with them being primarily interested in gf. For me, if they were honest and just told me that, I would be more comfortable because bpd brain makes those situations make me feel like I’m being used and that they’re trying to get to my gf through me and see me as a stepping stone to get to her. (Again, I don’t know if this is the case or my bpd but I can’t shake the feeling and there are too many conflicting evidences to what they say that make that belief seem true.)
I recently told X that I no longer want to be fwb with them, it took me a long time to build up the courage (and realise) to tell them I just wasn’t attracted to them and I did not want to continue seeing them this way, but wanted to remain as normal friends because I was not attracted and the situation was making me very unhappy. However, when I told them about this, over fbm because that’s how everyone in my life communicates and they were out of town), they kind of debated me on the issue for a few days. Which I am rather uncomfortable with, it should ave just been an open and shut case, if you’re not attracted to someone you have to respect that and you can’t argue the minute details on it, it’s a matter of consent, right? 
The debate was more to do with other issues, but it still was a debate about wanting these changes. They told me that I needed to get therapy and brought up my bpd a lot. I was, at the time, on a waiting list for therapy which I had told them about, yet it felt like they deflected my decision onto my mental health. (I can no longer get therapy, the place I self referred to rejected me because they only treat mild depression and anxiety...) I’m not saying, and never have presented myself like I’m not blameless in having my bod effect things, but to me that’s not the point, it feels wrong that they found a reason to debate me on other issues when I told them I wanted to quit having sex for my own good, they said I was putting blame on them entirely, which I’m sure it seems like I’m doing by making this thread, but I’m trying to be objective about my situation and find advice. I know there are things I have to do but that’s it’s own thing, and I am doing those, it just takes time. 


This is all mostly backstory up until now. 
What really bothers me is that I can’t tell if I’m being a black and white thinking bpd person, judging someone for their mental illness, or this person is (regrettably the stereotype) emotionally manipulative and bpd isn’t an excuse. 

X’s bpd is perhaps more severe than mine. Or unmanaged. I’ve told friends about this situation, and sometimes my gf (hesitant because those two are close and if I’m wrong and being bpd about it, I don’t want to be the kind of person who turns people against each other), and most of my friends think what X has done in various situations, but specifically what I bring up, is not ok. I’ve shown dms so it wasn’t me paraphrasing and making someone look worse than they are. I can’t do that here because of anonymity, and I think that would be rude. But X has also talked to friends about the situation, not sure if they shared dms either, with their friends and they believe I’m in the wrong too. Hence I really need advice. 

X self harms. And has brought up wanting to do so to me and my gf number ours times when they’re distressed, and on a few occasions, that distress has been because of me bringing up something to them that I need to discuss. For instance sexting my gf when I was visiting her made me upset so I brought up asking x not to do that in future (after calming down), later that day they brought up wanting to hurt themselves, clearly because I had confronted them and asked for them to not do this. I know for most people, feeling responsible for self harm or suicidal thoughts is incredibly traumatic, for me it’s worse, I have a bit of childhood trauma from a family member gas lighting me into believing that I had caused a grandparents suicide. They did not know this at the time, but, I think regardless of them knowing, it’s a fairly poor choice on their part? When I’ve brought up many issues I’ve had later on they’ll become emotional and discuss premeditated desires to self harm. It hurts, I don’t want someone to hurt themselves whether it’s my fault or not! Whenever I’ve brought up that this behaviour hurts and is unhealthy, they blame bpd and say that at the time they can’t stop themselves from telling us or even acting on it. Which is s why it’s been so hard to bring up any issue I’ve had with them because I know they’re fragile like this. 
This is also why it took me so long to tell them I’m not interested in being fwb with x anymore, because of fears of how they’d hurt themselves. The same fear comes with the thought of leaving the situation because we’ve been fairly close for a while. They still say that it’s bpd, not their fault, and deflect blame on me or my gf for discussions we have. I know they have traumas and bpd but at this point it feels like they’re refusing to get better in order to keep using these excuses. 
Whenever I’ve had a bpd breakdown, I barely have any breathing room to recovery as soon as I’m slightly better, but still fragile, they will have their own breakdown. I assum this is just bpd feeding into each other but it makes me feel invalidated, and makes the attention I need at that time split and detracted towards them, which is something they have done to other people, not just me, even when my breakdown is to do with something very personal to me and non-relatable to them (like when I had one after visiting the grave of the grandparent I was gas lit into believing I killed). I don’t want to feed into the bpd being an attention seeking thing, but it does feel that way in a lot of these cases. 
Finally, x will also require, and almost demand (sometimes by bringing up need to self harm), affection and reaffirmation. Which we all need with bpd, but in this case it’s daily and also includes this feeling of manipulation as it’s often forced. Rather than ‘do you still like me?’ It’s ‘I feel like hurting myself, tell me that you miss me as much as I miss you even though I’ve known you for only a week’. Bpd is intense but they’re also not... dealing with managing it greatly, in my opinion. I’ve felt pressured into saying things I don’t mean, like saying that I love them when I’ve known them for only a month because of the threat of self harm. They say it’s not a threat, that they’re just saying how they’re feeling, but I’ve felt like I couldn’t talk about my own issues and have that same respect because my issues become their issue later in the same day. 
There have also been times when I showed affection to my gf in person or in group chat, and it was immediately followed with “what about me”. This has both been for words and for pda. They’ve also made me feel guilty for loving my gf by saying things like “I fear you care about her more than me.” I’ve felt pressured to kiss, hug, and give emotional connections to them when I didn’t want to because of this. I really should have said no, because it was dishonest, but I was afraid of hurting them. 

If bpd wasn’t involved however, I would consider this behaviour to be emotionally manipulative or even abusive. It’s caused me immense distress in dealing with the issue, and feeling like I cannot leave because my gf is also involved and they’re good friends with each other! I don’t want to control my gf’s friendships and stop her from having relationships, but at the same time, I can’t do what I’d usually do when I’m made to feel this way and ghost and disappear from the person, cutting them out. 
I don’t think x shows this same side to my gf either, and I don’t want to rock the boat, I don’t want my gf to think I’m being bpd manipulative by telling her these negative things, because she is aware of how bpd works, and she has a kind heart, she doesn’t want to hurt anyone.  
I feel manipulated, and I’m afraid of it, but I’m also afraid this is my bpd or that I’m being insensitive to bpd."
2077,"Asked a friend to join me on some little shopping errands. She can’t but asked if I want to go watch a movie later. I don’t but I feel super mean if I say no, especially because I can’t tell if I’m:

A lazy bum who would rather be home alone (but I would be)

Hypocritical because I’d like to see my boyfriend later (although I’d still be pumped to have the evening to myself with a book and to get my sleep schedule back)

In high school my mom used to always encourage me to go out even if I didn’t really want to. Now I think choosing to stay in alone is somehow wrong? What should I do?"
2078,"I've done a lot of therapy in my time, with various different kinds of therapy. What is your experience of therapy? What kind of therapy helped you? Did any actually help you? Or did you get the impression that you became more unstable with the therapy?

Current therapist is doing psychodynamic therapy, which have been doing for around four months. However, I feel that the therapy is quite possibly leading me to become more unstable. 
Basically if you haven't tried it, with the psychodynamic model, the patient talks and the therapist tries to make sense of it together with the patient. To try and find out what could be going on behind the experiences or events the patient talks about. However it just feels draining and I don't see how talking about negative stuff, and trying to unpick it all, is helping.
It just brings horrible emotions up.
 Perhaps long term it could help. In the very long term. But at the moment no. I still get very low and even feel that maybe the therapy is contributing to this. It all just feels like a harrowing experience, the therapy in itself to be honest. Does anyone else get this??

Before this, I used to have dialectical behavioural therapy and that therapist also used some commitment/acceptance therapy in the approach. I dreaded going to see her. I found her so arrogant - she would talk for about 90 per cent of the session, I was basically going for a lecture from her rather than therapy. She was too set in her ways, not flexible, felt like she was above me in this pious position, telling me how to live my life. She also did not seem empathetic to me, often for example, telling me that at least I was not physically ill, only emotionally ill. I felt like she was completely dismissing what to me was something I really could not over come. I dreaded going to see her and eventually stopped.
And yeah, I've had several counselling therapists before this too. (The only main type of therapy I haven't tried is cognitive and I know people who say that cognitive behavioural therapy never really helped them.)

Obviously my worst symptoms still persist, so I don't feel like therapy has been a success for me. Hard to see the light and think that therapy will actually help. 

I would like to know if therapy has actually been helpful for anyone here? Please feel free to share your experiences. Thanks."
2079,"ive had enough with it, its just messing me up big time, i want to die, i so want to die :("
2080,"In the depths of bpd despair at the moment but something the on call GP said to me yesterday made me smile. He said ‘you’re 46, somehow you’ve survived when most people with your background wouldn’t have.’ I will not let bpd win!"

but my dad is trying to send my mom to jail because he's mad at me and my mom had to take this terrible night job at a chicken packaging plant,
her boyfriend is a dead-beat who doesn't work and is making her take out a loan to pay for his car.

my grandma might lose our house

my older brother refuses to get a job and instead is mixing meth with his antipsychotic meds,

and my little brother lost his apartment and had to move in and then he lost his license from doing something stupid and he's spiraling into depression.

I feel like I am responsible for their suffering and if I can't fix their problems I should hurt myself, my brain has been obsessing about self-harming again but I haven't in a year and I don't want to start again and I don't want to be not fine.

but they're not doing well and I feel guilty and like its my fault and that I'm bad and should punish myself."
2082,"I'm not coping, feel like I'm drowning.

Work is freaking me out. My manager is on leave soon, for 3 weeks and although she is actually 2 grades above me, she will still need to me to cover some of her work. Normally that would be bad enough but we're in a really crucial time at the moment so I'll have loads of responsibility and I know I can't do it.

My partner wants to move house so has told me that is what we are doing. She know my mental health will cripple me but she has made her mind up and its not up for discussion. A lot of the planning and organisation will still come down to me though which is also terrifying me.

I've been in DBT therapy for 9 months and it ends at the end of July. I'll go from having lots of weekly support to none - just like that. I'm not ready for it but its not negotiable so that's it.

These 3 things are driving me to the edge - I feel weak and pathetic and like its time for me to call it a day and just end it.

I hate myself so much for not being able to manage better. Even after so much therapy I'm not ready.

I really want to self harm but the last time was November and I don't want to break this run and I don't want to let down my therapist but in the schemes of things, does that really matter??

2083,"Hi, my name is Kay, a few months ago I was diagnosed with BPD/EUPD and I've had some extremely difficult circumstances in life, jumping from one tragic event to the next, its left me with some major issues and I have few friends, my 1 year old son lives with his dad, I'm getting back into their life but it's hard, being around his dad reminds me of the rejection, and I have such strong feelings for him.

2084,"Has any of you (who has BPD or ADHD) ever experience having a close relationship with someone who has either BPD or ADHD?

Recently I found out (by myself) that my partner might have ADHD. He did notice this, that he might have ADHD, according to an unofficial diagnosis from his psychologist many years ago on their first/2nd session. 

Despite the BPD symptoms I experience myself, maybe the intense relationship I have all this time isn't because of me but also his issue, which ADHD. But I never know how the dynamic between these two?"
2085,"My brain is tired. Like the same crazy fears and emotions keep cycling but my brain is finally like “eh okay yeah been there, felt that. No catastrophe here.” I’m pretty stoked that it’s finally balancing out. But at the same time I have like zero energy rn. 

The other day I was talking with my grandma who’s in her seventies and she was explaining how she only recently started to feel the effects of getting older, low energy, little appetite, etc. 

And I was just like um..same? Gosh I need to maybe fix that. One step at a time I guess. 

Anyone figured out how to get up in the morning to an alarm? I feel like I literally cannot. I’m getting into work crazy late but no repercussions bc I make my own hours. Still it’s driving me nuts, I’m not getting anything done. 
I know it’s not super bright but I’m taking a dose of NyQuil soon (it’s nighttime here) to sleep better and hopefully wake up. I was up for no reason at 3 am yesterday. Is that stress/depression? I felt fine, just awake lol."
2086,Im feeling frustrated with therapy. I feel like I get to the end of the session and I've finally got deeper into my emotions. I'm struggling to dig into them and it's like it takes time for me to warm up. I have left therapy feeling more frustrated than when I went in. It's like I need more time and the thought of it all is frustrating me to the point I feel angry about it. I have my next session tomorrow and I am dreading it.
2087,"Hello everyone. I hope you are doing fine today.

I was diagnosed BPD a couple of months ago, after going back and forth with anxiety, depression, obsessive and self harming tendencies... Once I got diagnosed, and excited to start with a new treatment, I finally felt a bit more calm. At least I new what was happening to me.

Now, the nightmare starts again and things get serious. I´ve been dealing with psychotic episodes for weeks now, and I just realized a couple of days ago, while I was talking to my therapist. I'm very, very scared, and I'd like to know if this is normal, and it's just something common in BPD or temporary due to stress at work or in general, or If this could be the start of something else.

My therapist didn't want to go deeper, because he knew It would cause me a lot of anxiety, and told me to research if there's any kind of path in my family dealing with mental health issues.

It would be great to hear your experiences, thank you so much in advance.
And sorry for the terrible english."
2088,"Hi,

My girlfriend is with me from beginning,  she find out that I have enough BPD.  She was helping me a lot,  she love me a lot,  I was pushing her away.  She was handling very bad that I am changing my mind a d mood very badly she lose weight a lot.  I even transmit paranoias to her.  She suffer a lot with me.  I felt guilty many times I broke up with her two times and then again ask her to get me back.  Just to have some adrenalin. . We are living together from beginning of our relationship.  I broke up with her again few days ago because I felt guilty how I torture her.  This time she did I not take me back. 
I was planning to move to another country.  But then she propose plan that I will move to another apartment and living with some guy. This plan approved my therapist,  she was joining me there very offten and helping me.  And learn how to be independent,  and have my own life.  That my moods and thought will be not dependent on her.
We are still living together I am looking for another room.  We are still kissing,  hugging saying that we love each other.  And she is saying that she belive in me and she belive that when I will improve we will be together again.  And we will finally have healthy relationships.  She is saying I can not live her hope become I will do this improvement just for her and I need to do it for myself.  I don't know how long time it will take me to get better to get my own life.  But I alredy start working hard.  And I will I believe that I will do it.  And finally I will be free and having mine own life.  And then healthy relationships with her I love her a lot.  She said we will meting every week,  we will spending nights together, we will do stuff together.  But not like cople and no sex. 
I never lived alone always with women with girlfriend. 

You think she really love me?
You think it will really happen?
You think it is possible? 

My stupid mind is changing so fast and I am getting crazy.  Once I want to do it.  Then I want move country and start drinking again.  Then I want just to end my life.

What do you think about it? 
I am so scared  I was never so scared."

I'm tired and just don't want to engage, my partner made a joke to me that just wasn't funny so I'm just stroppy at the moment. Sometimes I think though, is it my BPD making me this sensitive and upset, or is it my genuine feelings if that makes sense? 

I'm unsure really, I am just all over the place today emotionally and physically, could do with a long nap and a bath if I had one. :/"

2092,"Hi,

I'm very new to this page, and have chosen to join mainly to talk about my Borderline Personality Disorder. I was diagnosed last July and have been seeing a counsellor for the past few months, I'm currently being treated with DBT and anti-depressants, so far so good, I've been having my ups and downs. I have been suffering with Pseudo Seizures which I've heard is common for people with BPD as stress and anxiety is one of the biggest emotions with the disorder.

I was wondering if anyone else here suffers the same thing because of their BPD, and if so, how do you 'control' it? Or help ease the fits?


Many thanks, 
Holly :)"

My doctor has said that they may do an Adult ADHD assessment .

2094,"So I recently made a post about how I said goodbye to my fp because it was for the best. But I'm actually really struggling so so bad, I keep swinging from I don't need them to I absolutely need them back in my life and I've spent the past 2 hours crying and it's currently 5am and I just can't sleep. I honestly feel so low even to the point I feel suicidal, this shouldn't be so hard considering id only know them for 6 months but I formed a bond with them quickly. I won't lie this is horrible and I wish I could forget that they even exist. Sorry for posting about this twice now I'm just really, really struggling right now and I don't know what to do."
2095,"Hey all,
I’m 32, got diagnosed with bpd 4 years ago. Under medicines and a DBT therapy since then.
My husband and I got married few months ago, and wish to have a baby one day.
The problem is I’m really scared about the pregnancy part. It freaks me out to think that something will grow inside of my belly.
I always loved babies, but since we got engaged, pregnancy became my biggest fear.
I really want to hear about this experience from other women with bpd.
Thank you."
2096,"I've been so hyper with anxiety recently that my concentration has been allover the place and I've neglected coming on the forum. I've came on a few times and went to post or reply to something and gotten distracted or irritated. It's so annoying that I cant even concentrate on something that helps me. I asked my GP to reduce mt dose of venlafaxine but they said speak to your CPN. I was taking 2 37.5 on an evening and one on a morning. So I swapped them thinking if the dose is too high it could be that stopping me from sleeping. It worked. I spoke to my CPN and said I know this dose is too high for me I want it reduced. I have to see the consultant and she is on holiday but I have been marked as urgent for when she returns.... I told my CPN I cant cope with the side effects of my dose being too high for that long and that I am going to reduce it myself to one 37.5 on a morning and one on a night. She said she couldn't advise that without the consultant seeing me but I can do what I like of course so I just told her to note that's what I'm doing from now on. I definitely feel better but its only been 5 days so I wont know for sure for another week or so.
I am still awaiting report from independent psychologist for my court case which means I'm wandering around with a constant sense of urgency trying to stay in routine, which has been fucked up by social services because they have changed my contact schedule which means courses I was on at the recovery college I can no longer attend. 
How long can the chips be stacked against you before they all fall down and reveal the truth? I dont know how I'm managing to stay strong seeing my oldest son so upset and unsettled on top of everything. Music is helping me.... and cleaning.... 
But yeah that's my little update and sorry again for not being around for people"
2097,"Hi every one, my therapists told that i should writing my diary. So i start and it quite useful, putting all this messy thoughts which are changing every second.

2098,"Hey, I was hoping that members here can share their successful BPD relationship, whether you're one with BPD or your partner, best friends, family, etc. 

What have you done to maintain this lasting (and successful by your own definition) relationship?
What have they done as well?

I believe relationships (involving BPDs or not) always take two to tango. And also, I am well aware that the internet mainly talks about how having a relationship with BPDs is considered as tough, complicated, tiring, toxic, etc. But I am looking for stories to get inspired. Because I believe that BPDs aren't doomed to suck in relationships (especially when they're going/have done treatments).

So please do share :)"
2099,"The stress makes all my OCD and BPD-like tendencies skyrocket and play off each other. In college I didn’t care. I NEEDED that degree (and graduated with honors, my proudest achievement). 

But the cost/benefit ratio doesn’t seem so hot anymore. Emotionally I’m like still stunted at  like five years old. Eventually I can’t math and science may way around that anymore. I kinda need a “degree” in being a stable human. This is kinda not the environment in which to develop that. 

I’m still earning almost straight A’s but I’m really emotionally reactive and just a mess. I don’t know if I should keep trying to graduate or just peace out. 

Or maybe tell my mentor? I need like extra support and he’s always like “ go discover stuff and write papers” and I’m like umm HOW. 
Like it took stamina to shower and eat and get here and then sit at my desk and not panic. Soo..yeah."
2100,"Today I realized that I’m self sabotaging.
I did dbt for over a year and thought I was beyond shit like this.
I’ve always used alcohol to help with my bpd instead self harming or anything
It’s gotten more and more frequent and in turn I have gained a lot of weight. Beer belly!
Anyway, my weight has been bugging me and I want to lose weight.
So I decided i
Would go a month without alcohol. And I was actually pretty motivated.
But one bad day and I was like fuck this and went back to drinking but I was thinking I can still start over after without the sober month.
Then something happened I wasn’t expecting
Something in my mind just snapped and all I could think was I’m gonna drink. And drink.
And now im binge drinking.
But it’s a mental thing and physically im fine.
It’s like a voice inside me is lieo
Oh you thought you would try and do better?
Nope
But it’s like calming somehow. Like I’m being who I am.
So I guess that’s what self sabotage is for me.
Shit."
2101,"I think I’m making perfect sense but I still wind up in argument after argument with the person I love most in the whole world. 

I might be seeing this completely wrong. I don’t know. 

All I know is I’ve apologized a bunch and he won’t. He thinks he’s done nothing wrong. I’ll gladly take the blame if he’ll just love me. I don’t care. 

Even when we argue I don’t really get horribly upset because I’m still here next to him and that’s all I really want. But also I am so drained and I know I can’t thrive like this if it doesn’t improve. 

Im not sure whether to hate myself or him but its mostly myself right now. I could scream. I also know I realistically didn’t do anything too horrible. I can’t tell if I’m losing it or being gaslighted. Like I really can’t tell and I’m starting to feel like I’m in the matrix or something (what’s real? Who knows?). 

That’s a little dramatic but honestly I’m just so ticked. I don’t have the time or energy for this and yet I can’t make myself walk away. I wish I could take him and leave the drama and it seems impossible. Why are we so immature and dumb together?? We’re not bad people
I don’t get it."
2102,"For three or maybe four months a year I'm okay-ish as in I go to my friends and keep up regular life. The rest my emotions go from depressive to anger to crying my eyes out. 

I disappear, I don't see my friends and I don't really go out because I can't control my thoughts and I can't handle stress. Therapy would probably help at this point considering I'm twenty but I work three rotating shifts and can't take medication because I work in a factory.

My jobs important to me, it's my achievement after failing school and everything else. I don't know how to help my self in any other way and I don't know what to do. I broke up with my boyfriend because everything was stressing me out including my relationship.

Just don't know what to do anymore,

2103,"Going to share some of my experience and hope you will share yours.

I feel I've now got to the stage where my outward actions are more controlled and I don't get to the point where I'm really self destructing and actively suicidal. HOWEVER, inside of me, I do feel deeply sad basically all of the time and like things are pointless. This is something I have inside me basically all the time, but I ignore it, and just keep on being alive, I continue either procrastinating or acting. I am essentially functioning like anyone else, but inside I feel depressed and inside I feel like I'd be better off dead. 

I don't know if this is my high medication distancing me from my emotions. But I can feel them there, just far away.

Does anyone else get this?

 It seems very unhealthy to me, this feeling the emotions, but somehow still functioning like a robot. I'm not sure if it's a good or a bad thing, a step on the road to recovery.

I'm also questioning why the hell I feel so deeply sad and whilst other humans get depression, and I'm not alone, a whole load of other human beings don't have depression and don't have to feel like this. Why the hell is this?

Anyone else?

The child bit is something I understand as it's my inner child but I don't know how to let it out.

I genuinely never want to hurt anyone intentionally but it’s as if I were being possessed when these outbursts happened. 
I hurt people around me constantly with the things I say and end up regretting my actions almost instantly afterwards, but in the moment, it is IMPOSSIBLE to control what I’m saying. 
I have these impulses out of “great ideas” and when they don’t turn out as planned, I fall in to depression and blame myself for the everything.

i have a question about memory. I have really bad memory, i can not remember basic staff, or names, conversations even when i am in ""good/normal"" mood. I can not remember my lies (compulsive lair).

And then i feel that i am getting crazy or which is even better i am starting having paranoia that she is trying to put thoughts to my head.(Do not  have schizophrenia)/
When i remember something, I will be not able to say if it was yesterday, two weeks ago or month ago.

I almost think he was trying to imply that he’s closer to my parents than I am or that the three of them are together in trying to handle my craziness 🤔

My parents one million percent DO NOT see it that way but I’m over here believing every word that comes out of his handsome face. I don’t even know what’s reality and what’s my warped perception any more.

2114,"Hi

I'm a 27year old who has a diagnosis of BPD and complex PTSD. I also suffered significant injuries which has reduced my mobility following an accident. I'm very much on my own and don't have contact with family due to them being very abusive.

I'm in therapy and have been for awhile. It is very helpful but challenging. I don't take any medication particularly for BPD. 

I just wonder what others do to cope with the intensity of the emptiness they experience? 

Does anyone else find that weekends are the hardest?"
2115,"I’ve been diagnosed with BPD a couple months ago, but I had my suspicions since childhood. Fast forward lots of adverse experiences, emotional, physical, sexual abuse, neglect…suicide attempts, PTSD… I’m in the middle of a criminal investigation about one thing and a separate ex-partner was just recently released from the jail. I’m in and out of employment- shockingly within the mental health profession. I’m desperately lonely, with very few people I can talk to.

So I invested 3 years of my life with the first man who wasn’t cruel to me, seemed fairly consistent, if not emotionally retarded. I feel like its ending now. I’m 23, he’s 32, I thought age could bring me some maturity and security. But I keep giving my feelings to him and getting nothing. I understand that I have an avalanche of emotions regularly to contend with but I do try very hard to not explode things on him and I give him time to process a response. He just won’t say anything, he'll trivialise things by laughing or I’ll explain a situation happening and he’ll just ask, ‘well what are you going to do?’ I understand that men often have a practical mentality about most things, and he’s a builder, a literal “fixer”. I keep explaining I’m not asking him to fix things, and often I don't know how I'm going to respond to the problem. I just want to share what I'm going through and get comfort and feel heard. And he makes me feel like that’s crazy, and I’m just ""kicking off"" over nothing and it’s acceptable to “just listen” to feelings and say LITERALLY NOT A WORD. Often. I’ve even given very simple suggestions of what I’m hoping to hear, “that sounds stressful, I’m sorry you’re going through that.” And he can’t do that. 

I grew up with abusive, neglectful, narcissistic and ultimately and abandoning parents. I understand this makes me particularly sensitive to lots of things, but not feeling heard is the worst feeling, especially at this point in my life. Unheard, unseen, ignored, belittled. This is all very triggering for me. I can’t tolerate it. I keep expressing that I feel pathetic begging someone to give me comfort, and already that’s just a difficult thing for me even ask for and to be consistently met with what feels like a rejection and dismissal of my feelings/problems, trivialising everything I say is heartbreaking. This is making me physically ill. This makes me want to lash out, engage one of many self destructive behaviours. I feel like I’m crashing now. I feel like I’ve wasted 3 years of my life with him, being generally dissatisfied but just so grateful that someone would love me and care for me and not hurt me. 

I was so high throughout most of this relationship that the absence of emotional connection maybe was easier to ignore. But now I smoke a lot less than I used to, and this relationship for nearly the past year has been long distance, so without adequate communication what even is there? 

I’m about to start a STEPPS program for BPD next week. I’m not optimistic. In my teen years I tried some DBT to stop the suicide attempts and yeah it sort of helped, but to be honest I just swapped self harm for self medication. I’ve been in and out of therapy since I was 11. I feel like an empty shell. I know I’ve hidden in this relationship and I’m scared about what losing this will do to me. I already feel so alone in this world, and it’s such a scary awful place to live in. I already live in a hellish limbo due to the ongoing criminal investigation. I don’t think I could meet anyone normal and they’d want to invest in a relationship with me if they knew how messed up I am. No medication has worked, I’ve had through so many over the years. Hopelessness is definitely setting into my bones and I’m conscious of what that may mean for me. I feel like ground zero is not too far away, the ground feels like its caving in, I’m being buried alive. I'm spiralling into a dangerous pit of despair."
2116,"This is freaking me out a bit. I’m pretty sure it’s related to stress, but I’ve never reacted like this before.

My typical cycle is I’ll have a few weeks of buoyancy, optimism, I am rock solid. Then it will invariably coast into a couple of weeks of depression.

Lately, even my depression hasn’t been so bleak and bottomless, so much so that my therapist told me I was not currently depressed. First time in nearly 30 years.

Hooray right?

The past week something has shifted. My gradual rise and fall is now accelerated. I can feel happy and confident one hour then wanting to cry for no seeming reason. All within the span of a few hours. It’s freaking me out. I have never experienced this. (I have asked my therapist about bipolar, she says no).

My mother’s burial is coming in June (ground was frozen when she died), and I’m currently competing for a promotion at work and it’s challenging.

It’s just stress, right? I’m terrified this is the new status quo."

I’m now 29 and am bored of feeling alone, I have people, family, but no one really gets me because they don’t understand bpd.

I would love to find people who get me or at least understand a little.

2118,"Hi,  

7 months ago I was diagnosed with beautiful BPD.  I am visiting my therapist every week,  I stopped drinking.  And sometimes I feel that things getting better but this feeling I can keep just for very short time.  But it change to anger, madness or sadness.  Nothing can make me happy.  What are you doing to feel happy?  How to feel happiness from small things? What are you doing to feel happy at least for short time?  It's exhausting. 

Sorry for my English.

2119,"Hi 
I have said it on people's individual posts but it seems  be an on going issue.
In the UK there is an agency called ""Access to work"" if you Google it there is a mental health service offered by Remploy.

You contact them and they will speak to you on the phone, then if you agree will visit you at work talking to both you and your boss, they will help set targets, care plans for you, and  will come and see you every week for 4 weeks then fortnightly either by phone or in person if you want for 2months then monthly for 3 months. 

After 6 months they will review your plan with you and your boss and you can either request a further 6 months or finish there. But you can refer back at any time.

This  a free service aimed at helping people with mental health problems either get into work or stay  work.
I used them in 2015 and wouldn't have been able to do what I do now if it wasn't for their support.

Please do use them they are not counsellors, but they are sensible, practical and very useful people"
2120,"There is nothing like lyrics or a song that hits home.

Over the course of my life, there have been songs and stanzas of songs that have become instantly identifiable and have almost defined a section of my life.

I think music can liberate us, and imprison us at the same time.

What have been yours? And what was going on in your life when it, pardon the pun, struck s chord?

I will attach mine in a bit if someone responds quickly. I get it. Music can motivate."
2121,"The depression makes me lose interest in everything, but recently I’ve been getting into metal. I used to really love that kind of music when I was younger and allowed myself to be angry, but I think I tried to suppress that part of me and now it’s spilling out again.

I’ve been listening to Slipknot, Gojira, Pantera, Tool (+Puscifer +A Perfect Circle), Primus, among other things. 

Not sure that all of that can be grouped into “metal”, but to me it’s very emotional music that I can connect to. And when the sound is a bit more chaotic—as is the case with Primus—I feel at home, and comfortable.

What kind of music do you like, and how does it help you emotionally/mentally?"
2122,"I feel like recently jealousy is eating me up, I hate my boyfriend doing anything without me, we have been together 5years.  when he goes to work I will sit and cry, the thought of him being around other females at work drives me insane I find myself looking them up on social media every day and comparing myself to them which makes me feel shit because they’re all really pretty and probably much more fun and easier going than me. if he arranges to meet up with his friends every day in the lead up to it I will cry and self harm and just generally not be able to cope, even if he goes out with his mum I am jealous. I’m jealous of every person who is around him when I am not. We have children together so we don’t get a lot of alone time and I don’t ever go out with my friends because I hate being away from him. I don’t even like being in a different room to him when he is home when I am preparing dinner I will always ask him to keep me company and at night time even if I am tired I will not go to bed without him. He goes to the gym every day and I often convince myself he is going to fall in love with another girl in the gym who is more into fitness and has a nicer body than me, all of this said I have tried to leave him because I feel like this isn’t fair and it’s breaking my heart that he has to deal with me. I leave him and within hours I am begging him to come home. He tells me he loves me all the time and I don’t accept it I feel like he feels sorry for me and he’s just trying to make me feel better for the kids sake. Sometimes if he shouts and me or snaps at me I feel like I want to kill myself I feel worthless and unloved and like he doesn’t want me. I don’t know how to deal with this. I have suffered with this my whole life since I was a little girl and have a lot of previous suacide attempts, I hate my life so much but I feel trapped because of my children I don’t want to leave them without a mother but everything is just so hard to deal with right now. Does anyone have any tips on how to cope with jealousy? Or feeling worthless?"

2124,"This is a long post so apologies….

 

I have too much going on in my head.

I’ve been doing DBT for 9 months and have just 3 months left. I’m freaking out, massively. I’ve learnt a lot and use the skills most of the time but depending on what is going on, they don’t always work. I know DBT is something I’ll need to do forever and once the course finishes I’ll still have those skills to hand but the thought of not seeing my therapist is terrifying.

It feels like I’m only just at the point of truly opening up (some weeks more than others) and getting to issue of my non-existent self-esteem. There is no way that this will be sorted in the next 3 months and after that I’ll be left with no professional support. Plus, there is the issue that I’m kind of attached to her. I know that’s normal but that won’t make not seeing her and having her support any easier to cope with. I have no real support at home, my partner is very hit and miss where support is concerned. She wants me to open up to her more but in the past, when I have done all I get back is comments like ‘well, we all feel like that at times’ and ‘I get depressed at times as well and I don’t do x,y and z’ – very frustrating. I’ve tried to explain to her how someone with BPD thinks but either she doesn’t get it or doesn’t want to.

 

My other concern right now is my weight. I’m 46 and my weight has gone up and sometimes down all of my life. I’m currently a stone over what I feel I should be. I was on holiday in March and before I went I dropped to what I think my correct weight is. After the holiday (a cruise) I put on almost a stone and now I can’t get back on the diet. I feel huge and such a failure. I think people are commenting behind my back saying how I’ve no will power and that I’m weak. I think I know they’re not and that those words are what I’m saying to myself but I just feel so disgusting. I want to starve myself or make myself sick after I eat, anything to get some control back. It’s all about the control.
 

Maybe that’s it – I don’t feel in control of any aspect of my life. 

I just hate what I am and can’t see a way of moving forward.

2126,"Today is weird. I’m angry and antsy but I was so calm and proud of myself like an hour ago. 

I get super mad because I feel like I have zero control. 

But everyone in my life is like “calm down stop freaking out and just agree with me”. 

It’s so frustrating. Actually I think I got triggered by this episode of Supernanny where the mom was a perfectionist who picked her kids clothes and did their hair how she wanted it. Ugh my mom always did that. Even as a teenager she’d act all hurt if I didn’t want her to do my hair for school so I always let her. 

My mom is awesome and I love her but now I’m in a relationship where my bf is similarly particular and stubborn. I adore letting someone else make decisions until I get furious. 

The three of us almost got in an argument over the weekend bc they both disagreed with my opinion and instead of being like “oh really? I think...” they were like “no, it’s this ...”. 

I was like what the actual heck. 

My mom admitted she went overboard and apologized and laughed it off. She’s really loosened up the past several years and I’m proud of her. 

My bf was quiet and I think he thought I overreacted when I know I didn’t. I DESERVE AN OPINION AND AN OUNCE OF AUTOMONY."

2129,"Hi everyone. I'm a 30 year old woman with BPD and generalized anxiety disorder.
The biggest issue that I currently have is that when I get upset about something, I take it really far. 

I grew up in a household that was really unstable. My father had an alcohol problem and both of my parents were very emotionally distant. They fought a lot. My father especially would yell and scream, throw things, threaten violence, etc. This became ""normal"" to me. And now as an adult, thats how I react to situations. (I've gotten better about raising my voice and being aggressive, which is so wonderful.)  Growing up as an only child in this situation was really hard. When I was a child and I would get upset, I'd cry for hours in my room and find comfort in that ritual of sitting down and sobbing. Its a terrible thing to say, but working myself up and crying for so long is like a comfort blanket to me. Its almost a way I help myself feel better, or put myself in a familiar situation.

As an adult, this ""exercise"" is what causes the most trouble in my life. When I get upset now, I still sit down and sob for hours, tell myself I'm not worth anything, etc. In a way, this is almost comforting to me. In a lot of ways, I do still feel like this child without comfort. I have a lot of underlying abandonment issues. All of my adult relationships usually cause me to feel anxious. ""Are they falling out of love with me because they aren't giving me constant affirmations?"", etc. 

I've been dating a man for about three years now. Lately I've been doing a good job being accountable for myself. In the last several years I've been in a bad length of depression. I'd stop looking after myself, spend days in bed, not eat well or exercise. But the last year or so I've really climbed out of that hole. Every day I make a point to wake up, drink water, take your medication and vitamins. I try to get half an hour of sunlight every day because I feel like that gives my mood an improvement. And eating ""healthy"" food seems to help too. Every day I keep a calendar to track my moods and keep myself accountable. This helps me see that I'm making improvements and reassures me. Lots of positive affirmations.

I can control so many things. But I can't control my partner. 
Earlier this week I was doing very well, avoiding small fights with him. I overreact to things sometimes, so lately I've been trying to walk away instead of blow something out of proportion (I was really proud of myself for doings this).   This apparently made him anxious, which is understandable. However, while sitting down to dinner one night I got a lot of text messages from him. He was talking down to me about how I'm so emotional and cry all the time, etc. Lately he puts me down by calling me insane, psychotic, telling me that he doesn't think my new antidepressants work. ""Oh you were way better before the medication"". (Which is so insulting, because it took me weeks to work up the courage to talk to my doctor about my medication. Not to mention how expensive the bill was.)
I replied, first calmly asking him not to call me names or talk down to me. After weeks of good work and making steps forward, I let his bad attitude effect me after a few more minutes. Feeling attacked by the person I'm closest to in the world.

This ruined my entire evening. My biggest issue in my life is that I hold my partner accountable like I'd hold a therapist. He is not a trained professional. He doesn't have a medical background to understand how to deal with a person with BPD. He isn't trained at all to understand how *not* to speak to me when I start crying and getting upset. (Because once I start crying, it goes back to my earlier story. Being in that ""crying"" feeling, I'll revert back to bad memories, etc.)

But because I love him so much and because I value his opinion more than anyone in the world... I feel like he has to be correct... of COURSE I'm a bad person. Of COURSE I don't mean anything. If the person I love more than anything can talk to me like this, what is my worth? 
I put so much value on what he has to say that I adopt his views and accept them as fact.

After we argue for a while, he usually sees where I'm coming from and apologizes. He admits that he shouldn't say negative things to me. He doesn't really believe them, etc. He apologizes over and over. 
But in my mind... he has betrayed me. Have you ever heard the line ""behind every joke is a truth""? If he didn't think I was ""insane"", why would he say it? Surely he thinks it a little to say that to me at all.
Rather than accepting his apology, I see him as someone who has betrayed me. Why would someone who claims they love me speak to me like this? (I never consider that hes only human and makes mistakes. Lots of people say extremely rude things when they're mad even if they don't mean it.)

So here I am. After a three day episode of feeling my absolute lowest. I've been trying so hard lately to help myself for the better. But it seems like whenever the moment happens that I need to help myself, I let myself fall into old habits. Although I've read a lot of self help books, I never use the information when I need it. 
I'd like to use this forum to learn how to express my feelings with other people who may understand. Because like I said earlier, the people in my life aren't therapists. They haven't felt what I've felt, or been through what I've gone through. They aren't prepared to help me. 

How does everyone else slow themselves down when you're upset? How do you remember to stay calm? I need to learn that one moment doesn't last forever. One person's opinion isn't always the truth. And that my value as a person is so much more than I give myself credit.

Lots of love and thanks to anyone who actually read this. I'm going through a difficult time, and any kindness would be greatly, greatly appreciated.:redface:"
2130,"this is too much to bear
the noise started it off
I have been ill for hours"
2131,"So, I was referred to the crisis team who stated they believed I had BPD after originally being diagnosed with it at the age of 16 (now 32) and it never being spoke about again. basically I moved away and whilst I still struggled with my mh I forgot about the BPD diagnosis.

Now the mh are saying I don’t have BPD as in their words I wouldn’t be able to hold down a job or be in a relationship. WTF?

I’m still off work sick.... my heads all over the place and I’m completely lost. What’s the point. 

I have yet another appt with work on thurs and it’s making me want to hurt my self bad and I keep thinking about suicide methods and can’t shut my head up. No one understands ☹️ I’ve really had enough.

To top it all off .... because I’ve been off 6 months in the last 12 my sick pay is being cut, I feel pressured to return due to this as it will cripple me and I don’t think my partner will be happy.

I have a holiday abroad coming up and I don’t want to go on it (it will be before my sick note runs out) I just don’t want to be here anymore. I can’t cope"
2132,Every  week I pick up a new hobby. Whether it’s working out or randomly wanting to knit a scarf when I’ve never even seen yarn before.

2133,"I met this guy in January and automatically I got attached, he told me all the right things and he treated me in a way that I was longing for. He made me feel protected and safe. I felt like he could put up with my craziness and mood swings and all the other issues I had. I’ve been diagnosed with BPD for 4 years now. It was so bad that I’ve been in a mental health ward 4 different times for long periods of time. I’ve always had trouble with every relationship in my life weather it’s a family memeber, a friend or someone I’m in a relationship with. Anyways after a month this Guy started being distant or at least I thought. So I told him we should end things multiple times, and he eventually agreed and left. He didn’t really put up a fight to keep me and I was heart broken even though we were only together for a month. I had made my life work around him I Always wanted be around him. I was embarrassed to be upset around people when I told them I broke up because they would say you only knew him for a month. He came back after a week and I welcomed with open arms. I just wanted to feel okay again and I missed having him there. I felt like he was genuine. Things went well for another couple of weeks but then I began to notice that I would always be doing More. Messaging him to check up on him, asking him how is day is, wanting to see him, getting things that i thought would make him happy. Just doing anything that would make him love me more. Then I noticed how it would take a lot for him to even message me once through out the day let alone call me. I felt like he was talking to other girls or I didn’t make him happy enough. These thoughts bothered me day and night. I began to obsesses over it having multiple breakdowns in the process. A couple days ago I decided I was done again. I sent him a long paragraph telling him how he hurt me, but only after asking him to talk to me or at least tell me I was doing something wrong. He was ignoring me, so I finally lost it and sent the paragraph. He hasn’t replied to it and I deleted all forms of contact I had to him. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I don’t why very guy I manage to scare off. It’s so easy for me to fall in love and I always get left behind. I’m scared if I give the person to much space they’ll find a way to live without me. My question is how do I function in a relationship. How do I know if I’m being to clingy. I’m honestly so lost. I know relationships aren’t what I should be worrying about right now but I can’t help but wonder why I can’t ever be in one and have it last for more than 3 months"

2138,"so the past few months have been a nightmare to say the least, ive lost two family members and a very close friend in the space of 2 weeks, ontop of that ive moved out of my parents home into a supported accommodation ( i know im very lucky).  ive been here for just over 4 weeks and its been 3 weeks since loosing family ect. its been hard but then again knew it would, but to top off this already lovely situation i thought id stop taking my medication, believing that it wasnt helping ect, that was two weeks ago.... the past three days have been unbearable. its 3 am and im running on very little sleep, my self harm has sky rocketed again to the point of 3 4 times a day, im back to hearing voices and my suicidal thoughts are also here. 

all in all i just want to know at what point do i know its too much?? because i feel like im getting to a breaking point and ive tried having this conversation with my cpn and care team here. so people know im struggling because i try to talk but the words just dont come out.... im just scared right now of myself and my thoughts, i just need someone to advise me because im not too sure anymore."

I was not with her when she died, and I feel terrible. She missed a flight I had booked for her two weeks ago, instead of being angry I should have been scared for her. I had been in touch with the DEA, police, and FBI for months prior trying to get her dealer arrested. In truth, her friend was the proxy that kept supplying her, I threatened her months ago, she allegedly destroyed evidence the morning of and deleted texts from K.....y's phone.

I am having a hard time wanting to live but this is day 5."
2140,"My children were taken out of my care 9 weeks ago. 12 year old with autism and 4 month old baby. Both boys. I told my perinatal CPN I felt like 'topping myself' she reported this to social, adding she knows it's a way for me to express how bad I feel and I would never hurt the children. There have never been any red flags with regard to my parenting of either child raised by any professional. I wasnt worried. She asked me to agree to a safety plan for the weekend (it was friday). I agreed for my oldest son to go to his grandparents. She told me they were going to give the baby to his dad. I crumbled. He hadn't helped me or showed any care toward him since he was born, refusing to look after him so I could rest etc. I was genuinely worried that he would accidentally hurt him or kill him. The social worker determined I was not able to cooperate with the safety plan and put in for 74 hour police protection. I assumed I would be approached with a section 20 on Monday. The applied for an emergency interim care order. It was granted. I was shocked! 
This was 9 weeks ago. In this time I have met the social worker once, this week. He released a report about the fathers ability to look after the baby and was in support of him. He hadn't even met me.... didn't know my 'side'. When I met him he was evasive when I asked him questions and suggested I was becoming angry at one point. When I saw my councillor today I told him  and he said I do seem aggressive when I explain the situation (I am focussing on my relationship with the babys dad and why he let me down, lied and betrayed me) but also that it's such a sad an unfair situation. I know it is! The contact workers know and like me and can see what an amazing mum I am. The court appointed psychiatrist has said I am not a risk to anyone, especially not my children, that the children being removed from my care is a huge trauma and has had an impact on my mental health. I asked the social worker what his position will be when this report is released as the only 'risk' is my mental health. He said if new evidence is submitted court will have to review it. 
I know I'm going to get my boys back, but the social worker is just starting his assessment and is clearly biased. Will the report from the psychiatrist be enought to have them returned home whilst he assessment is completed? I have told the truth all the way through so should I just stop panicking and be confident he will see the truth as he investigates? 
Any experiences or advice? Anyone been in a similar position?"
2141,"Hi everyone!
I would like to ask something as I’m dense in this matter and I haven’t had a proper discussion with anyone about this so I dunno if what I’m experiencing is ordinary or not.
I had a week and a half of self loath and was in bed for a long time feeling ashamed of myself for a minor issue, but now I feel like it’s not my problem and that others are trying to make me feel this way, and that they enjoy making me feel bad about myself.
I’m currently experiencing feelings of “oh they’re just horrible people and they wanna downgrade me and make me feel bad”.
Plus I’m acting out and showing so much confidence in myself and acting as if they are to blame (people in general).
Now this comes in cycles, meaning that maybe once a year or so a bad incident would happen and I would feel so so bad about myself and blame myself and then after many days I would go back to being this person who feels like the world is trying to conspire against me.
Has anyone experienced this?
Any inputs please?
Thanks in advance!"
2142,"Good Evening/Morning all,

I am looking for some advice.

I have a long term diagnosis of BPD, with my initial diagnosis being severe depression (with psychotic episodes) and severe anxiety.

I was awarded DLA due to me needing support throughout the night, and so received higher rate DLA for several years, due to my self-inury being acute during the night hours.

I filled in the PIP forms and have been summoned to a face to face assessment with ATOS now disguised as Independent Assessment Services on the 27th July.

I would rather lose my benefit than attend an assessment designed to trick me at a physiotherapy clinic by a physiotherapist.

I have asked my GP to write a letter requesting an alternative means of assessment as I will not be attending the appointment due to the increasing risk to myself (and potentially others).

Has anyone been in this situation and could offer any advice 

After 4 years, the stress of this has caused me to start scratching holes into my skin. I think I will be happier when my partner has spoken them tomorrow

Thanks"
2143,"I saw my psychologist with my support worker in Tuesday and apparantly I dont fit the criteria of BPD anymore, but I'm still me and I guess triggers will always be there.
Anyway one of my difficulties which I forgot to ask her about was I often in the past have felt threatened by people who are lots younger than me who have been able to get help that was refused me well it feels that way. And they are getting help which is awesome and noone was there to help me.
Do others with BPD have this or is it something else totally different"
2144,"How can I best get through a serious talk without either being overly defensive or having a breakdown? 

Like I refuse to wind up either apologizing for the former or losing some self respect due to the latter. 

But I am really bad at emotional conversations! I’m a scientist and I need an algorithm 😂"
2145,"Hi everyone, 

I'm new here so sorry for posting such a heavy post for my first one! But I really feel like I have no one to turn to and feel like you guys will at least understand me. 

To cut a long story short, this is now the second time my boyfriend of 2 years has cheated on me. 

Unfortunately, I do really, really bad with being single and I always have this huge fear that if I don't have a boyfriend then maybe I won't find my future husband and maybe I will be single and miserable forever. I worry a lot about the future and about everything being 'perfect' or going the way I want it to.

This fear of being single means that put up with a lot of crap even though I am miserable for it. Don't get my wrong, I'm not in an abusive relationship (physical or emotional). My boyfriend tells me he loves me and treats me great most of the time. The problem is, this is the second girl I've discovered him cheating with. He has also being caught messaging multiple girls who he swears he never met up with. I can't help but blame myself to justify it- I wouldn't want to date me after all. Sometimes my bpd causes me to be controlling or get upset over stupid things so maybe it's fair of him to treat me like this. 

This relationship has well and truly destroyed me but I just can't get out of it. I split up with him for 2 months but went back to him because I felt like I deserved it because sometimes my bpd makes me mean to him or argumentive and also I just couldn't live with the fact that I might not find anyone else who loved me and might not get to have the future I want. 

I am currently out of the UK and living by myself, so I can't afford therapy. I feel hugely suicidal and like my life has no point living. With bpd we're so dependant on our relationships as it is and the fact that I am so dependant on someone who I have absolutely no trust in is draining me. 

At the minute I'm feeling like it would all be better if it just ended. I've clearly shown myself that I can't be happy with or without my boyfriend and in all honestly I've lost hope of ever having a happy life. I'm ridden with depression during the day which stops me from being productive, and then anxiety at night which keeps me up till crazy hours and then wakes me early in the morning. 

I feel so alone right now. I have no one to turn to, I have friends but my boyfriend is my life and I just feel like I can't do this anymore. 

Any comments will be appreciated!"
2146,"Do you think it's normal to just go through life feeling sad/or like everything is pointless/a chore inside all the time? Does anyone else get this?
It sounds like a very spoilt thing to say, that life just feels like a chore all the time, something very dull and pointless... but I can't seem to shake the feeling inside.
Does anyone else get this? It doesn't seem to go away.
Does anyone have success in making it go away? Tips?"
2147,"Well quite often, throughout the day, I'll think what is the point to all of this.
So I'm curious.
What's your point? What do you live for?"
2148,"Okay this is my first post on here, my PDoc feels that BPD is going to be my label and reading around it it does seem very apt. 

I’ve been wanting to ask this question since I joined but feel it seems like such a trivial question in the grand scheme of things.

How on earth can I cope with The Eternal Emptiness?  Okay it really isn’t eternal but it seems like it, in the past away from work I’ve self medicated but my time away from work I can actually fill quite easily with TV, reading but even then I can feel in nibbling away at where my soul should be.

I’ve been on Mirtazapine for years and on that’s not really an issue, my GP put me on Sertraline last year for what I thought was anxiety and depression and it helped for a while then upped the dose when I started to feel bad again.  During an aptt with my PDoc I suggested coming off and whilst trying to taper I noticed it was emptiness I was feeling and my dose has gone back up but even now I’m starting to feel empty again.  I can’t keep chasing this, is there an alternative?  My PDoc has already talked about stabilisers, will these help with the emptiness?"
2149,"I really trust you guys here. 

I’m confused because I’ve found the love of my life and yet I can’t imagine that we could work permanently. Sometimes I see it but inevitably a couple weeks later I’ll be like...no it won’t work but I love him now and I won’t break up. 

And the cycle continues. 

When it seems wrong I want someone more positive, more gentle, more understanding of my sensitive nature. 

But. 

Does that person exist? Or is my current partner perfect for me even with his flaws?  

He is honest with me. He grounds me. At the same time sometimes I feel kinda stifled. 

What do I do? I love him but sometimes it feels good to imagine being with someone else or even just being able to flirt. 

So I feel like a hypocrite no matter what. I’m stuck. What do you think?

Thank you ❤️"
2150,i got another one coming on i think :cry:
2151,I’ve been noticing that about once every week I have about two days where I’m extremely emotional and easy to trigger. Could this be a coincidence or a symptom of something bigger? I’ve never heard of a disorder where mood swings can happen routinely (besides pms)
2152,"Hi all. My name is Tasha. I’m here because I feel as if I’m running out of options. My wife of 5years has been diagnosed with BPD. She is the most wonderful person I could have ever hoped for. She is kind. She is funny. I could truly go on and on but that’s why I’m here. 
Right now we are going through a very tough patch. She woke up yesterday and said she was sad. I asked her why and what can we do to fix it. She said she wasn’t sure but that she wanted to figure it out and that she loved me for being so understanding. Two hours later, she told me she no longer wanted to be married and that she had to leave. It was a very drastic swing which in turn lead me to believe she was experiencing a BPD episode. We have gone through this before where she on less then what I believed was a whim but knowing to her it was what had to be done, packed up all her belongings and mine, and left with her things in garbage bags to Portland. Two days later after the fog left her and she was thinking less impulsively she called me and wanted to come home. And I welcomed her back with open arms and no judgment. And now we are what seems to be back in the same spot. I have talked to her and given her room to try and not only help me to understand, but in hopes of her hearing her own words for her to also understand the irrationality in her reasoning for wanting to do this again. I know this isn’t her. Her reasoning goes back and forth and is not clear to her or me. I don’t want to loose my wife. My best friend. It’s tearing me apart to see her what in my mind I believe is self sabotage. She’s never had anyone stick around and has abandonment issues. And I refuse to give up on her. But I don’t know what to do. She won’t go to a doctor. She was institutionalized as a child and I understand her fear of that. I just want her to be ok. And I want us to be ok. The fear of coming home and her being gone again is paralyzing me. Not because I’m afraid of being without her but of what she could do. She will surround herself with the shittiest of people. She will spiral and I’m terrified of what could happen to her if I’m not there to help her. I just don’t know what to do to help her from acting on this reckless behavior that she will embrace and not even realize that she’s doing it. 
If I said anything insensitive to anyone please forgive me, I’m not super educated on BPD I only know what I’ve read online and not even sure if that accurate. I’m just in so much pain and I know she is too. I just want to fix it."
2153,"Hey peeps so I've been admitted to a psychiatric hospital, I'd been on the bed waiting list for about 9-10 weeks and I've finally got a bed although it's in a different city quite a bit away from my home

Anyways I'll post about my experiences whilst I'm here, just don't be quick to judge me and please remember me in your prayers

Im 30 yr old female. 
I have bpd, anxeity, and depression. 
Ive been in love with my spouse since the first kiss. We have been married for almost 4 years. 
The last few weeks i have felt very distant from her. 
My main problem is I keep ..for lack of better words .. Intertwining her and my ex in my mind. 
Its almost as if they have somehow merged in my head and i cant shake it. Its like I know its her but my exs face or name will pop in my mind. And sometimes i almost call her by my exs name. It makes me feel disgusting and hatred.

I hate my ex. They are a horrible human being. I absolutely love my wife. She is the best person ive ever met. She cares deeply for me even tho I can be irrational and everything else that comes along with my disorders. 
I never see or speak to my ex. I have them blocked out of my life. 
I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this, what its called, can i prevent it?
Its almost like ive fallen out of love with the only person ive ever loved and felt safe with. 
It makes me sick to my stomach and is breaking my heart. 

Thanks."
2155,"Greetings everyone!
I’m glad I came across this forum.
I’ve been in bed for the majority of today and yesterday because I heard something unpleasant about myself yesterday.
I do not know how to start this so please excuse me, but I have to say a few words about my personality first.
I’m an uptight female who’s sadly easily offended, I’m always very critical of myself(secretly and not in public), and lately I’ve been feeling that everything I’ve accomplished in life is nothing impressive and that when people compliment me they don’t actually do it because I deserve but because they pity me.
I had an incident few days ago where I scratched someone else’s car because I was being careless. This incident hit me hard because I’m very hard on myself when I make mistakes, I’m very aware that we are humans and that we make mistakes but I’m harsh on myself and can’t take it, I blame myself so much.
What makes it worse is that I’m always trying to prove myself to others.
I always show a tough image and high confidence which I lacked as a teenager but interiorly I blame myself for feeling sad and worthless.
I always think that there r people out there who suffer so much and some can’t afford food and I look at my situation and feel very guilty.
I’m also not very fond of the people around me, I’m not family oriented and I have a hard time forgiving people.
I become moody and hate people easily.
Im in bed as I’m typing this and feel very tired, I keep on playing that incident in my head and I know it’s toxic but it keeps on coming.
I was thinking of going to a therapist but I’m worried about discovering something that might get in the way of me getting a job.
Please advice me and help me get some clarity on the current situation.
Thank you!
Ana"
2156,stinky pig midnight :yuck:
2157,"It’s not something that happened overnight, just a feeling that became stronger with each passing year into adulthood.

When you’re a kid you probably don’t think when you grow up you won’t even feel like a person... Full disclosure now, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder 6 months ago, so to anyone who is familiar with borderline ramblings or drama and is annoyed by it, this most likely isn’t something you’ll want to continue reading..

But for those saints that do, here’s my deal; I feel like a bunch of different people, but it’s also like I’m nobody, I know this is relatively normal for people suffering with bpd, but it’s still incredibly confusing, as well as tiring.

When my dad died last year, I think that’s when the final lines of connection to my life were severed. I still can’t tell you how I feel about it. Just that in those weeks of the initial shock that he was dying and then leading up to the funeral, I wore a lot of different hats. I was the supportive brother, and the grieving son, I was the victim of just another horrible thing. Only thing is, I wasn’t really any of those things. It felt strange when the life left his eyes on that final night in the hospital, it felt like I should’ve been feeling more. But even in that moment, in seeing my brother cry and break down like a normal person should, I made everything about him, but it wasn’t because I cared about how he felt or that I understood what he was going through... I just needed to know my place in the world... and if that role called for a loving supportive brother then I was going to fill it. But for me I could tell from the beginning the grief would be different.

It comes up in little explosions of emotion and confusion. My father wasn’t a good person in the end, sometimes I even smile because I feel like he deserved the end he got, but still, there are things he did for me that I could never see myself doing for anybody else. He was full of love and laughter and he wasn’t afraid to show it. Again it’s very confusing.

He was also the man that kicked me out at 17 for smoking pot and then got me addicted to pain killers just a couple years later. He was very complex, and honestly showed a lot of signs of being borderline himself. In that last year he didn’t only encourage my drug use, he would supply me with whatever I wanted. I knew it wasn’t right, I know he knew it too, but we both had just stop caring. We were both tired of pretending.

I think at the end of the day all we thought we were was just our cravings to get high, and any attempt to be more was just an attempt to be somebody else. Although I know that I desperately want to be somebody else.. it doesn’t really make sense

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations, I really didn’t know what I was gonna talk about when I started. I just wanted a bunch of people to read it cause I love the attention and it makes me feel interesting, like all other bpd sufferers that’s really all I care about so don’t put too much thought into what I say or what I claim to feel. If I really wanted to end it all then I would actually do it right? So don’t waste time worrying about me.."
2158,"I developed somewhat of a ""crush"" on someone years ago simply from watching videos online and it still seems to be pretty persistent. I have since met him a few times and he is now in a band. Has anyone else dealt with this? Is there a name for it?

I'm aware of the ""favorite person"" thing, but I'm not sure that's the same category. I'm asking because I'm just trying to figure out how to delve a little deeper into the topic with my therapist. It does seem to take over a lot, it clings to my emotions quite a bit sometimes. Any insight from someone has dealt with the same thing would be helpful! :)"
2159,"mood swings are all over the place emotions are all over the place
somebody I love thinks he is the cause im sure but it is not true
I just get like this

feel like im not real and the things around me are not real
if I don't sort this out soon I am going to fall into another deep depression

im sorry for being moody and a pain xx"
2160,"Does anyone else get 'buyers remorse' after posting a comment?

It has nothing to do with people's reactions, I just feel over-exposed or like I expressed myself poorly. I'm new to accepting my BPD, I'm trying to own it and be open, but I've always hid this side of myself under lock and key. I always am what people want me to be in real life. 

I'm having a hard time with this. Does anyone else freak out after posting a comment?"
2161,"Hi everyone I was just wondering how you all manage with work ? 

What would you say is the best suited job for someone with BPD ?

I was thinking that working on a flexible contract or on pool hours or even with an agency would help with variation and help keep me in employment . Struggeling at the moment with working full time in an office environment 

Would be interesting to here other people experiences !"
2162,"Hi, I'm jae, I'm 22
I can call myself hateful because I made myself that way, I have social anxiety and many more unfun things like that, but when I'm with just one person I'm not familiar with it makes me very uncomfortable and i hate it, I spend my last 3 years of school smoking cigarettes in the school bathroom because I can't just be in a crowded area like that, so I developed an amazingly harmful way to get rid of my social anxiety for good, I have completely convinced myself that I hate every single person out there that I'm not familiar with, everyone..... 
And it actually worked, I can be hateful towards anybody anywhere and I can stay there for long time just annoyed and disgusted of everything and everyone , convincing myself that I hate them all over and over. 
I feel good after, I don't think about what if they talked about me or laughed or looked at me or blah blah...... I don't care I fucking hate the idea of them breathing, I wish they choke to death on my anxiety fumes because I have many, I SIMPLY HATE THEM... I'm happier like this... 
I need opinions please...."
2163,"One thing I find difficult to understand is I have read that people with BPD have lack of empathy?? I have done some research and I thought the opposite was true, that we had too much empathy!
But yeh totally confused now, as I'm sure if I hurt someone I feel overwhelmed and so terrible about myself for days and days. Even find it hard to forgive myself?
Anyway see my psychologist tomorrow so I will certainly discuss this with her"
2164,"I had a wonderful partner if 4 years who I love dearly. He broke up with me 8 weeks ago. Got someone else to tell me. Hasn't spoke to me since. I have tried to call and text but he rang the police.... what I dont understand is WHY? 

I have always been a good partner to him, supported him financially, emotionally, built his confidence, I didnt demand too much of his time, I cleaned and tidied his house and took care of my own. I raised his daughter as if she were my own, supporting her financially and emotionally too. She knows I'm not her mum. He always refused to speak to her so I have even handled all the communication between them, school, nursery, parties, arguments, arrangements.... he always told me how special I made him feel, no one had ever looked after him the way I did, made a fuss of him on special occasions, listened to him and try to understand his quirky personality. For the first 3 years he was happy as a pig in shit. Then I fell pregnant. He became withdrawn and depressed, barely saw me or spoke to me, returned my texts or answer my calls. If he was around he was quiet, asleep or irritable. I was juggling my pregnancy, my job, my son (who is 12 and has autsim) his daughter and his bipolar behaviour. 
I tried to talk to him about it multiple times. I would get any of the further responses: hed loose his temper and tell me hes sick of the same shit why cant I just go on normal and give him a chance it's boring leading to me crying and him leaving because I cant 'sort myself out' or hed storm out and ignore me for anywhere between a couple of hours and a couple of days (if his daughter was at her mums may I add). After thos he would either come into my house a few days later or the next day acting like nothing happened but in the same horrible mood, he would have a few days of 'trying' (not falling asleep, turning up when he said he would and not snapping at me and the kids as much) then go back to sleeping his days away ignoring his phone. On a handful of occasions he has told me he appreciates me so much and everything I do for him and the kids. He loves me so much, in his one and nothing will ever change, I was made for him. I would tell him because of my pregnancy I needed more support, help, understanding and reassurance than usual  he said he understood this but the same pattern continued. All the while he could come in and out have sex, get money, have a babysitter and leave whenever he liked. But I wanted him around. I didnt want to upset him. It would make him leave again. So I'll try harder.....

The baby came and I hoped it would be my turn to have some love, attention, pampering.... 2 days after I had given birth he went home. He stayed over when his daughter was at her mums but the baby's cry didnt wake him so I couldn't rest. He would pop in after taking his daughter to school so I could get a fee hours sleep but I would be woken to the baby crying and him fast asleep on the sofa. I didn't understand..... and all the while I continued the cycle, money, sex, babysitting. I asked my health visitor for help. They sent in social services. He accused me of being unstable and abusing him and stopped talking to me. His solicitor said in court as far as he was concerned the relationship was over. That it was toxic.... and the worst thing? They took my children. 

8 weeks down the line. Still nothing. No word even through his solicitor. He has not made an official statement. I am close to having my baby and my son home. I can get on with normal life and heal from this horrible experience. But how can I move on never understanding why he would do this to me? Can anyone shed some light? Am I just being dumb? Brutally honest please."
2165,"I don't like it :cry:

Is there anyone who actually does like having it?????????? :confused:

it's pure evil :evil:

the love child of hitler and satan :evil:"
2166,"Hi there does anyone know any private treatment centres in northern Ireland for people with BPD or EUPD? 
Or if not where in the UK?"

 For example, ill be doing really well and enjoying the job when i first start then after 3 days or so, something goes slightly wrong or i have a slight disagreement with someone and then I tumble in a deep depression and isolate myself, ring the job and tell them ill no longer be working there. This has happened to me right from when I left school and I am damn sick of it!"
2170,"Think I’ve had bpd for about 30 years but never diagnosed, so overwhelmed, has anybody got any advice x"
2171,"To make a very long story very short, I’ve managed to shake my parents’ trust in my bf a bit and have seriously messed up my bf’s trust in me as a result. He’s afraid to share how he feels because he thinks I might tell my parents if I am upset by anything he says. I’ve spilled some secrets but I never do unless I’m seriously confused about something and need help to understand. It’s been great to be able to talk here anonymously. It helps so much and i don’t feel as guilty after. I don’t really share about my relationship with my friends and i don’t seek advice from them so if I don’t talk to my parents or sister then it’s either here or my therapist. I always thought it was normal to seek relationship advice? But I also realized I’ve made things a little messy. What now?"
2172,"hi everyone . Would be interesting to here people's experiences with psychiatrists.

Has anyone had the experience where just so happens when you do finally get assessed after waiting ages your actually having a good day so the psychiatrist almost writes you off . Then suddenly the next day you feel dispair and feel horrible all over again and so angry at yourself . It's a horrible feeling . You feel like a burden and have to prove and explain everything in that small space of time"
2173,So I've woken up today feeling completely numb and out of touch with reality. I feel like my heads gone and I cant hear properly or focus on anything. I feel like I'm not real and its really scaring me. Has anyone else experienced this at all I'm freaking out
2174,"Hi all, I suspect my issue over my life has been BPD. However I've been with my wife now for 17 years and I have 2 children.

I'm worried about going the docs and I'm not sure whether to discuss this with my wife or keep it to myself. My wife knows my life story and what I've been through....but I worried about telling her about it.

What should I do?"
2175,"this is just me ranting

I'm done with work, is so stressful. It is consuming me. Days become an eternity. My manager makes me feel like I'm not good enough, I just can't do any better. I'm scared I'll be fired soon and I won't be able to pay my college, I won't be able to handle it emotionally, but at the same time I want this f hell to end. I've never been this stressed in my life. Makes me want to end it all. 

My boyfriend won't have intimate relationships with me, it's been like this for months now and I don't know what to do. In fact I know, if I was skinnier he'd be attracted to me again. I'm gross. All I do is excercise to then binge until I feel disgusting. I'm disgusted with myself. I'm disappointed.

A couple of weeks before I was feeling so good, productive, sometimes happy, confident. Now everything has changed, I feel miserable. Why am I like this? I'm so tired. 

My therapist ended our consultations in the middle of nowhere for no f reason, and now I have literally no one to talk to. My parents literally roll their eyes when I try to be open about my issues. I feel so alone.  

Fuck this

I'm so tired of this borderline shit

I just want to be normal for a fucking day"
2176,"My boyfriend just rescued a chihuahua puppy yesterday. She's adorable, soft and tiny, I love her already but that's not the point.

I coudn't seem to feel happy or exicted when I fist met her, I was feeling more and more and more anxious until I had an actual panic attack for no reason. I was shaking, I could not talk or act normal... the point is that I'm worried I can't handle emotions like anyone else. Everyone was happy and exited and I was on the edge, scared or a little pupper for no reason :low: today I feel emotionally drained and exausted. I really can't seem to understand this situation, to be honest

What should I do? thank you in advance"
2177,I really want to know if anyone has any good skills to cope with bpd it would be amazing if anyone knows of any that I can use in my daily life! Also what’s the best things to do when in a relationship and your partner doesn’t have bpd?!

Anyone have suggestions.... I’ve been on so many and I’ve only been on the abilify for 3 days, so should I wait longer to see if things change?!"
2179,"I just can't help wanting not to be here. I'm not actively thinking about it but it's always there. When I go for a walk, I think about which routes offer a decent opportunity. Same for driving or cycling which I just avoid because I know I would like to create an accident.
I od'd a couple of weeks ago and now have a restricted prescription.
At the moment I'm keeping busy by organising my house but a big part of me feels I am tidying up to make things easier for people after my death.
Can anyone else relate to this?"
2180,"I'm looking for opinions on the symptoms i have and whether they indicate that i could have BPD. I am waiting for my appointment to come through for a psychiatrist so in the mean time i want to do my own research. I won't be taking any of the opinions as a diagnosis, just as a guide line. I'm going to list out the BPD criterias and then put my own experiences in. They may not fit with the criteria.

Fear of abandonment- The closer i get the most people the more anxiety i get. This happens in random social situations too like lets say i started a boxing club. The first day i'd be nervous (because i have social anxiety) but not too nervous. The second day i'd be way more nervous and the third day, more nervous etc. Usually it should work the other way around. I think it's because i'm afraid of letting my guard down and people finally seeing the real me and not liking me because of that. Also i am afraid of making close friends with people.

I only have one close friend and even then we don't talk to each other for months at a time. I think i'm afraid that they'll start to dislike me and eventually stop talking to me because they start seeing the real me over time. Another example is how i cut off all my friends from highschool. I was in a group of friends and i had a best friend within that group. Most of us knew each other since childhood pretty much.Around the age of 13 is when i started to struggle with anxiety and thats when things started going really downhill. Around 14 onwards i started become closed off from my friends and i was afraid to even talk in the group and i was feeling shy around them all the time. Around the age of 15 is when i was being really closed off, missing lots of school and barely talking to anyone. I kept thinking that my friends were noticing that i had issues and because of that they were starting to exclude me and push me out of the group. I was way too embarrassed to tell even my best friend at the time of my struggles in fear that they would reject me and see me as a loser so i hid it all from them even though they probably could tell there was something wrong. Eventually i dropped out of school at 16 and cut contact from them all. My reasoning for this was that i thought they stopped really liking me that much and didn't care that much about me and also that i was afraid of them finding out about my issues. I'm 22 now and i've met them a few times since but i never got back in with them or kept in contact.

Unstable relationships- This is a tricky one as i've only had one relationship that was face to face lol. Most of my relationships were online because of my social anxiety. I would talk to them on the phone and we'd plan to meet .. etc. But nearly all the relationships online were pretty short and intense. Lots of arguing ( usually caused by me) and lots of paranoia and thinking they were cheating etc. They were also very sexual relationships. I know it was online but we would send lots of nudes and stuff like that. The longest one lasted 8 months and that was the most unstable one but the only one i felt like i was actually in love with. That one was really good at the start but paranoia began creeping in for me and i would start accusing her and stuff like that and at one point pretended that i had killed myself (i put up a tagline on my profile saying ""if you're reading this i killed myself""). I took it down like an hour later though as i felt really bad. The paranoia and all that kicked in when i was going through a lot of stress.

Unclear or shifting self image- I don't know if this fits in but i'm 22 and i havent even worked yet because of all my issues. I have applied for college though recently and went for an interview to get in and im working on getting things sorted but my career goals keep changing like crazy. In the past like 7 months i've went from wanting to go to another country and be a monk to wanting to be an actor to wanting to be an actor to wanting to be a nutritonist to wanting to be a psychologist to wanting to do something with sports. Also i don't know where i fit in in life really. You know the way thers always cliches. I dont know for sure which one i fit in. growing up i was always the sporty type of kid yet at the same time i had emo-ish qualities to me, yet at the same time i had an apt for drama, yet at the same time i had a mischievious streak in me ( smoking weed, getting into trouble etc). It's the same now i don't really know where i fit.

Impulsive or self destructive behaviors- Alcohol doesn't agree with me at all. It makes my anxiety way worse and can mess me up for months because i get physical symptoms from my anxiety that make me feel like i've been doing meth for a year straight. So alcohol triggers that like crazy. The problem i've had for the last few years is every time i've started to feel good again i would go out and party and drink a shit tonne of alcohol knowing that it would mess me up for months. I've got that under control for now though. Also when i go out drinking i can be pretty impulsive by getting into fights and getting thrown out of clubs etc. It doesn't happen everytime i go out. I'd say about 25 percent of the time. An example of that impulsive behavior is that because i have no friends really apart from one now i used to get tipsy and go out on my own to a nightclub and get into fights while out there sometimes. One time i got arrested and put in handcuffs for it. Another example is when  went on holidays to spain with my family i went out on my own and got into an argument with spanish police and they hit me with that baton things. Another time on the spanish holiday i was drunk and got a blowjob from a prostitute and thenw as worried for ages that i had an STD ( turns out i didn't). The prostitute thing was a once off though. I've got that under control for now too though. Also when i'm talking to people and i'm nervous i say lies alot. Like for example i was talking to ppl i knew from highschool the other day and i started saying i'll probably join the football team theyre on even though i knew i wouldnt.

Self-harm- I do it when I'm angry. Nothing serious. I've caused lumps on my head before too from it so i guess thats self harm.I've threatened to kill myself alot in the passed. I still do hint at it at times but very subtly. Like i'd be talking to my parent and wed be in a bit of an argument and id just say ""maybe i should just kill myself"".

Extreme mood swings- Yes i get pretty extreme mood swings. I can be really ecstatic one minute and sad and depressed the next. Also i can jump to anger very quickly.

Feelings of emptiness- I'm not sure about this one. I do feel like i'm nothing sometimes but it's more in the sense of nihilism. Like i would feel like ""oh im just here on earth whats the point"" sort of thing.

Explosive anger- Yeah i would get VERY explosive anger ( not so much anymore) but i still get angry still. Examples of this are when i through my iphone down the stairs as a teenager and broke it then tried to fight my stepdad and the police were called. I could list so many examples of this but i'll only go with a few. Another time i kicked in the banisters on my stairs and went to my room and through my chair through the wall and caused a massive hole. Another time i headbutted the glass through on the bathroom door. Another time i got kicked out of my sisters birthday for starting a fight. I used to think i was possessed i would get that angry. Thankfully i dont get that angry anymore though. I know its still inside me though.

Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality- I have felt dissociation a few times before i think. Like i remember when i was around 11-13 sometimes i would wake up thinking i'm still in a dream and would start panicking. In recent times i do sometimes feel like i'm in a virtual reality or in a dream state or that nothing is real around me. It doesnt bother me too much. I feel paranoid alot. An example of this is thinking my sister is sending nudes or sleeping with my ex best friend or even my current best friend. These can cause me to be depressed and i try my best to take my mind off of them when it happens. I am VERY suspicious of others motives. They could say a key word and in my mind i think its an attack on me. Like for example i don't work at the moment so if someone uses the word ""bum"" or something like that around me i assume theyre aiming it at me."
2181,"Ok guys need you all to give us some help here. When I speak of bpd I'm going from a British point of view so I only know what I'm told I'm my country. So excuse if we don't see eye to eye....

Anyway moving on...

I've been told and research that its cognative and not chemicle imbalance. So why are we medicating when its a simple re wire of the brain.. Ok fair play nhs does all they cab but its actually abysmal untill you pay private. Ok I understand most will be diagnosed with probs depression and anxiety and could lead towards a chemicle imbalance like bi polar bears. 

Even depression is deep rest in ones personality like that just means bad choices shitty people.  That's the difference in my eyes. 

Anyway so I have been on quatiapine which is an anti phycotic but low dosage is good for impulse rage etc... 

Alot of people are taking pills day in and out to suit a ugly society makes no sense to me. 

Also if it was a chemicle thing surely it would be listed as a psychiatric problem and seen as vulnerability equal to all. 

Its a killer. And I just wanna know where I should stand on this matter and will welcome all forms of life for the answer. 

Thank you for reading and please excuse my spelling."
2182,Sorry if this is TMI but what the heck am I supposed to do about the role my hormones play in all this? I’m diagnosed with general anxiety disorder but I’ve always had OCD tendencies and actually pretty strong BPD-like tendencies which have recently taken center stage. I take Zoloft and I see a therapist and 3 weeks per month I’m my normal self and I can think clearly. The first week of the last three months I’ve been a wreck! It’s like my brain is hijacked and I’m not even in control anymore. I try to supplement with Xanax. (But it’s not prescribed to me so oops I really shouldn’t I just get desperate). I don’t feel understood. My bf takes my little meltdowns as fact and what I truly believe even after I can see clearly and apologize. He thinks I use PMS as an excuse to make my outbursts seem less my fault. I know that they’re my fault but I’m also just learning how to stop them. My mom says if it’s just PMS that causes these symptoms then I can handle that. I think to myself that’s like 25% of my life and plus I can do a lot of damage to relationships when in that state. Does anyone else experience this?
2183,"I've been going through a psychotic cycle for the last months, mostly intrusive thoughts and hearing voices, but I've been experiencing visual hallucinations for a couple of weeks now, more or less. I never pay attention to them, because all I see is a quick shadow behind me of something moving, but it is so fast, it doesn't really affect my day to day life. 

But yesterday, I was driving home and I saw a very bright light from one of the rear view mirrors. It was blinding and I lost control of the car for a second. Then I cheked and it was only a traffic light. Also, sometimes I see my own reflection from one of the rear view mirrors, wich is completely impossible. 

Driving is becoming a very stressful task for me, I take the bus regurlarly but I must drive my car to get to the bus station everyday. I've never had a car accident or anyone I know had one, I don't know what's wrong with me. It took me so long to get my license, the more I practiced, the worst I did. 

Are these normal symptoms of a BPD person? I take anty-psychotics, they seem to work but they don't do miracles x"
2184,Guys I don’t even think I’m really borderline. I have tendencies like I’m sensitive and afraid of people leaving but I’ve been pretty stable until recently. Is it possible that my bf is by his own nature pulling this behavior out of me? Or like that my BPD-ness is a reasonable response to my situation? I’m not diagnosed it’s just what my therapist mentioned as a possible match but even he doesn’t think I have a full-blown type of it. I’m not trying to disrespect those of you who do have BPD. I can relate to your feelings and thoughts and I  know it’s very difficult to deal with. I’m just doubting myself A LOT. I never know if I am truly struggling and taking things personally when I shouldn’t or if the relationship I’m in is really flawed and my reactions are warranted. What do you think?
2185,"Is there anyway to prepare for someone to leave you? 

I don’t know if it will happen
But it could happen

He could leave me. He is always angry with me because of how much I have hurt him... I feel in part that I don’t deserve him.

But I know I can change and I am in therapy I am really giving it my all.

But that might not be enough for him and that is his choice, if he wants to leave.

How should I brace myself? Should I even try?"
2186,"My ex-bf has so many characteristics of BPD that it's hard to ignore. 
He started out adoring me to a max and I couldn't believe how amazing I thought we fit well together. We had similar thought patterns, he could anticipate my every want/need, we saw the world in a similar way. He showered me with loads of attention, affection, compliments, kindness and I thought I did a good job reciprocating. He called me his ""favorite person"" all the time. We talked about marriage, kids, etc.
Then, out of nowhere, he got really mad at me. He wanted to be intimate one night and I told him I really needed sleep but would ""make it way up to him in the morning"" but that I loved him. This was the first time I saw him get very upset. The next morning, he was still angry and then picked another fight about something really small. The fight got so out of proportion that he disappeared for hours, ignored me and then drank for several hours. Eventually when we reconnected, he told me we were over. Then, the rest of the day alternated between him telling me he wanted to marry me when I would try to leave and him telling me we were done (and his friends/family knew I was terrible) when I was nice to him. During one of the angry episodes, he said ""I know you're going to leave me like everyone else."" I assured him I wouldn't. Then, he told me he got a text from another girl and he wants to be with her and that we were done. When I did leave, he said why isn't your response that ""I should be with you instead of her."" Then he called me 184 times and sent me 100's of texts.  A couple days later, he started therapy of his own volition but never fully apologized for this crazy incident.
I tried to salvage the relationship for months. Things would intermittentlly be really good but then he would blame me for things that weren't my fault, get upset if I didn't do something he wanted and guilt trip me, yell at me (told me I was toxic) and then give me the silent treatment for days at a time (until I called him) and then act like nothing happened.  Other days, he was loving and kind and supportive. Eventually, during one of the silent treatments, I broke up with him. He didn't seem as invested in the relationship and I questioned what I was fighting for. He called me, drunk, crying a few days later. And then the next day, told me he was going on a date (why did he need to tell me this?) but that he loved me and she would never give him what I gave him. Talk about confusing!!

He has a good, steady job and is a professional. He is close to his family. He has many longlasting friendships from high school to college to grad school to work. He forms attachments to people pretty quickly and is very empathetic when he isn't triggered. He's responsible. Doesn't do drugs but DOES use alcohol to cope with emotions (I was starting to see this pattern). I don't think he has ever tried to hurt himself and he seems to be a confident man though with anxiety. I know he doesn't qualify for BPD but can you have borderline traits just in the way you emotionalize in romantic relationships? Could that be what happened here?

Any help would be much appreciated."
2187,"So I had an appointment with my pschiatrist last week and he is the dr I see for my meds. I will refer to this Dr as Dr M. During the appointment with Dr M I tried telling him about my suicidal thoughts but I got the impression he wasn't taking me seriously so I stopped as I felt embarrassed and ashamed as I knew what he was thinking.. Yep just another typical person with bpd. (I hope I haven't offended anyone with that comment). In the letter summarising the appointment it said 'she remains at risk of accidental unintended harm however, risk of suicide.. Would be deemed low at present'. It also said 'she identifies positive/ protective factors and there is no immediacy to her plans for suicide that I think are an escape fantasy'. 'That I think are an escape fantasy' what an arrogant prick. 

I see another psychiatrist for psychotherapy and in my appointment I had with Dr T (I will refer to him as Dr T) he is the dr I see for therapy. In my prior to the one I had with Dr M I told him about my thoughts and went into depth about them. A few days later I had the app with Dr M (this was on the following Monday) and what happened here is what I wrote in the above paragraph. On the Wednesday I had my appointment with Dr T and I was dreading the conversation about suicide as I really didn't want to talk about it. I felt Dr T would as he said he was worried after my last appointment but he didn't. I told him about my app with Dr M and I said I told him about some of my suicidal thoughts and that I felt he wasn't taking me seriously so I didn't bother continuing with telling him my thoughts. Dr T said some things (I have a shit memory so cant remember exactly what he said) and one thing was something like he was relieved when he heard I had seen Dr M and it makes sense now. Dr T clearly believed Dr M and felt I wasn't at any risk and that my thoughts were just the typical 'I don't want to be here'. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. I wish I never said anything now and if it wasnt for the fact that I told a friend I probably wouldn't have bothered telling Dr T nevermind Dr M. I didn't want my friend to feel guilty when the time comes. I have mentioned some of my sucidial feelings in other threads I have posted but obviously I can't go into depth becuase of forum rules (which I totally understand). 

SSorry for the long essay and thank you to everyone for your continued support.. I am very grateful and cannot thank you all enough.

2188,"Please tell me I'm not alone in this.... 

I'm so sick and tired of people telling me how I feel, guessing for me, or assuming..... why are you angry? Why are you hyper? 

Sometimes I dont know how I feel and other people assuming or labelling how I feel makes me wonder if I am angry/sad/irritable..... maybe i cant label it myself because I've always just accepted other peoples labels and I've then associated that label with what I feel.....

When I read about emotions and how other people experience them it doesn't match the labels I know.... they seem to be jumbled up

Does anyone know what I mean? Has anyone experienced the same thing?"
2189,"My partner has four kids 😱 the eldest to one ex and the other 3 to his ex wife. 

I’ve never had any children because I felt I didn’t deserve them after an abortion that was pretty much taken out of my hands by my mother when I was 16.

The youngest three are coming tonight and I just cannot face it 😰 I’m really not feeling well at the moment. I’m off work and have been for the last two months. I’m as anxious as hell, noise sensitive and waiting for my appt with the mh team on 13th as I’ve been in crisis 

The last time they came I stayed in my room , in my own house for 24 hours. My partner just isn’t thinking.

I think I resent the kids as my partner won’t have children with me .... he’s had the snip and said he doesn’t want another child .... he’s the only man to make me broody, it gets me so upset .... I would love my own child with him.

I’m so jealous of the connection he has with his ex’s. A connection I will never have with him. The mother of the youngest seems to make him go running every time she calls. It hurts like hell. 

I love him so much ... but I feel I’m not good enough. I feel he thinks more of his ex’s and his children. It makes me feel so rejected and isolated. 

They will be back any minute. I can’t stand the noise right now .... my partner just seems to ignore me when it comes to the kids and his ex’s .... feeling really low and not good enough."

2192,"Hi everyone

I haven't been in therapy in years but after some tough experiences lately, I realise that i have to get help. Things might be fine when they're fine but it doesn't mean my life has to come crashing down when things aren't fine. This just proves I still need help.

Would love to hear some of your experiences / recommendations for BPD specific therapies. I've contacted a local BPD specialist and am thinking about being referred to the group therapy session as i want to hear other peoples experiences.

Thoughts? Feelings? Stories?

Thank you :thanks:"
2193,"I thought I would create a thread where I can share what has helped in providing stability for me about this disorder. I am in no way cured of it, but I’ve had some insights that have provided me with some peace.

I thought we could all create a proactive list of things we have learned, that have helped, in order to help others who are struggling. Please feel free to add to it.

1. While there may be times in life where you have no choice, the best thing you can do for yourself is to create some distance between you and your abuser. Even living apart can be helpful to providing you with perspective and strength.

2. While BPD does have genetic indicators, often it’s a result of abuse during childhood. Your abusers are likely mentally ill as well and don’t realize or have no capacity to understand what they’ve done wrong. The minute you let go of trying to make them own up to what they’ve done, you will start to feel some relief and can approach them with a different perspective and better armour.

3. You are allowed to be angry. Find an outlet to process it, whether through exercise or therapy. Do not stuff it down inside. It will leak out at inappropriate times.

4. You are not alone. This forum is just one example of how many people are struggling, just like you.

5. Try mindful meditation. It uses similar practices to DBT and can help when things feel particularly bleak. Like any exercise, or building up any muscle, you will get stronger and better at it with daily practice, so that it can provide the strongest relief when things are bad. You can’t go to it only in times of crisis, work on it daily so it supports you when you do need it.

6. Try not to focus on any one thing in your life; whether that’s a career, a partner or something else. By having many interests or foci, if you experience a bump in one, it won’t have as devastating an impact on mood if it’s your only reason for being.

7. Social anxiety. This can particularly daunting, but find a book club, go to a lecture, help build a house for habitat for humanity, find something you can attend and be around people but there is a set agenda for discussion. The focus won’t be on you, and you can interact when you feel comfortable. Likewise you can leave if it’s too much. These simple interactions can ease you back into social settings without the pressure.

8. Write things down. If your mind is running away with you, write down what you are feeling and experiencing. When you feel more stable, go back and read what you wrote to help you identify triggers."
2194,"I hope someone more wise than myself can help me out. I’m 24 and have been with my bf for over two years. It’s my first “real” relationship. I love him a lot. There have been lots of times when I’m absolutely crazy about him. The rest of the time I think I’m crazy for choosing him. 

My love for this guy is overwhelming but I can’t shake the fact that he also makes me feel tense. Alone, I can sometimes recognize that I’m justified in this. He can be incredibly difficult to get along with peacefully and I think a few other people might agree. 

He’s either truly the most emotionally complex/dramatic/sensitive human on the face of the earth and he truly adores me and wants to be with me for all the right reasons. 

OR he’s a master at manipulating my emotions and making me cling to him like my life depends on it and then try to defend my own thoughts and beliefs during moments of clarity. No matter which I do, he seems to criticize me for it in some albeit subtle way:

“I’m busy, you need to learn to care for yourself” or “why do you act like you have to defend yourself when I’m not attacking you?”

I’ve spent most of the past two years blaming my conflicting feelings on my anxiety and trying to fix that (meds and therapy) but I’ve been feeling a bit suspicious of his behaviors and words again I feel partially empowered actually yet HORRIBLY guilty. 

I KNOW that something is fishy here no matter whose “fault” it is and I also know that the fault isn’t mine. Yet I cannot imagine breaking up. In my head i know that he plays emotional games but when I’m with him I could never and would never tell him that. He’s my prince charming

This black vs white thinking has me baffled as hell. What is the reality? And how can I be sure?"

2196,"Do any of you worry about this in therapy?

This is potentially triggering content, be warned.

Through therapy, and it took a long long time, I uncovered sexual exploitation from an ex boyfriend. It took a lot for me to face it, there are levels of shame similar to those of being raped. I had buried it quite deeply, and it took the better part of a year to work through it.

But it opened the door for other narratives. One that I am actively avoiding because I’m terrified it’s a false memory.

I have vague fog like memories of being sexually abused as a child. I have bounced from theory to theory, but I keep coming back to my father. 

I am currently his only caregiver after my NPD abusive mom passed away last November. I have felt nothing but relief since her passing. My father is frail and fading, and I keep promising my therapist I’ll address it after he passes.

Why?

Because it’s a huge accusation. And what if it wasn’t him? What if my brain is creating this and there’s no truth to it? I cannot be brave enough to do something about it now.

And coupled with fear of abandonment issues, even a bad parent is better than no parent. He was absent in my childhood, not engaged, did not protect me. I am struggling with anger about that. But I do the best I can to take care of him because he is so weak.

But I wondered if any of you have experienced this? Your brain convinces you of trauma that did not happen?

I need to talk this out and find out if my brain is screwing with me, even though my heart already knows the answer. :("
2197,"For those of you with BPD, if you experience feelings of emptiness, can you please describe what emptiness feels like for you?"
2198,"I am the only one who is triggered by injustice? 
My children are currently under a care order. The social worker doing the assessment is yet to come and meet me (4 weeks in) and has completed a viability report on my ex partner which he has falsified (I have proof of this and my solicitor is working on it). I have asked for change of social worker as it is clear the man is bias and I do not trust him to assess me fairly or correctly.
Now a professional of his standing should be working based on facts with an open mind. How can he do that when he doesn't know me? Hasn't spoke to any professionals involved with new or the children yet, why would he purposely leave out negative information regarding my exs behaviour? Why do people not just work with their logical brain and what they can prove?
I have no worries with regard to my children being returned to my care. I said I felt suicidal which is why they were removed. Fact is I'm not I just felt let down by services and wanted them to actually help me. This has been accepted by the court. There is no history of me ever potentially putting my children at risk of harm, and not a person on earth who would say I am anything but an amazing mum to my boys. 
However the course of justice isn't running smoothly or fairly. There is no negative evidence against me (and won't ever be!) but I feel constantly panicked and anxious to think that the facutal evidence isn't being presented. I can't shake the feeling I'm being set up or they are trying to provoke me into a meltdown?

2201,"Hi guys I’m new and just going through a tough time at the moment and I want to get it all out so please bare with me. I hope you all understand....

So when I was 16 I was diagnosed with BPD. My parents didn’t understand it, didn’t want to. They became so defensive of a lot of things. I moved to be with my now ex husband who lived 200 miles away and BPD stayed with me with out me realising.... my diagnosis got lost somewhere along the way .... i thought they must have been wrong.

I’m now 32 still living up north... away from my family with a new partner. I have fought anxiety for as long as I can remember .... it’s always tried to destroy me but I managed to get a decent job and hold it down, albeit with a lot of absences.

2 months ago I spiralled in to crisis and I got signed off work , lost grip on everything , became suicidal, pushed my parents away who make me worse and I feel so lost.

My family aren’t close and I resent my parents for what they put me through as a child. They deny a lot of stuff ... it hurts. I don’t feel like I have a family.

I’m now feeling as though I’m getting too much for my boyfriend .... he’s gone so cold, unaffectionate, I feel so alone. I’ve spoke to him about it and he says he’s tired. I’m tired but I was there for him when he became ill (not mh related). It’s not a competition but I’m trying to tell him I need the support and now I’m feeling rejected, not good enough, a failure and like I’m falling so hard unable to stop myself. I’ve tried so hard... taken on his kids when I have none of my own. I’m too ill to deal with them when they come to visit at the moment. I’m so noise sensitive .... he doesn’t get it and leaves me to hide in my room in my own house.

I try and challenge my head.... I try and challenge my negative thoughts but just recently I keep thinking it must be me, it must be the BPD... I’m the one at fault. I’m so scared 😔 I’m so needy.... so scared he will leave.

I’ve seeing the mh team for a med review and to see what their plan of action is for my recent crisis ..... I’ve not been involved to them for years. I work in the emergency services and I’m trying to be positive about them .... I’m getting no where fast .... I feel like I’m drowning."

2211,"Hello 

I feel really hopeless. I have bpd and social phobia and major depressive. I'm 21 and I haven't made any progress in at least 5 years despite trying different treatments. It's only gotten worse. I wasn't able to finish high school because I had so much anxiety. Right now my social life is the most important thing to me. maybe because I've been socially isolated for a long time. It's really difficult for me to make friends. I have a few friends right now, and i'm very grateful. I don't know if I should have friends though. Because i feel like i'm hurting them by being too clingy. I think about them a lot. It's also painful for me when i realise that I might be making them feel bad or that i'm damaging our friendships. I'm scared of losing them but i'm also scared of hurting them emotionally by getting really emotional and saying something impulsively. I've been really unhappy for so long that i'm pretty comfortable with the idea of being dead. i'm not suicidal but I hope I die soon. I started smoking a couple years ago because i knew that it can give you cancer. I know that it's more likely to get much worse illnesses from smoking cigarettes but i don't care anymore. I started drinking a lot too. I know i'd be happier if i were dead, even if there is no afterlife. I haven't made a thread on a forum before because it terrifies me.

For example: I want to pierce my nose, but I've been overthinking about it way too much because I don't know If it's something that my ""impulsive self"" wants me to do, and I'll regret it later.

To be honest I don't have many friends and out of my 2 best friends one doesn't get mental health and the other one fell out with me over a year ago as i was seemingly too much. TBH it was upsetting when it happened as I always asked how she was and I certainly didn't make everything about me. But anyways I told my friend about my suicidal thoughts and TBH I feel really guilty because I feel I have manipulated her into talking to me. I feel awful about putting it on her. I also worry that if I do commit suicide then she will feel guilty but I have told my therapist so i could tell my friend that he knows as this will have hopefully help her to stop worrying. TBH I just feel like I have manipulated her and I hate the thought of it.

Even though it's been this long, every single time I see him I feel my entire being welling up with panic and terror. My limbs feel like they're going numb and I feel the need to run away to anywhere as quickly as I can. Every time I see him he stares me down, smirking smugly at me like he used to.

A similar feeling as when someone is breaking up with you in a relationship, but in this case there's no relationship. I was shaking and crying, and had a panic attack that lasted for hours. I've been feeling so anxious about this situation for days now, I feel abandoned and so, so sad. I cry about it at least once a day. I'm scared of how this group therapy is going to be like.

2220,"I’ve been struggling with mental health issues for years now and I was initially diagnosed with BPD after 1 session. I was given antipsychotic and then expected to cope eventually, I stopped attending my one to one sessions and taking my meds. I started a mood diary and analysing why I was having these ups and down. That’s when I recognised it was usually after some sort of traumatic event or in a period of emotionally turmoil. For example after I broke up with my first love, when my boss tried to sexually assault me, the first time I missed carried etc.

As time went by I started to do better and I went back to university. I got married and started to try to make friends, this was especially hard for me because when I was going through psychosis and at my worst everyone disappeared. It taught me to keep my thoughts and mental health issues to myself, even my family to this day walk on egg shells. I’ve never been aggressive but I have been erratic even attempted suicide at one point so I understand why they feel this way. 

Since i’ve started this university  degree 8 people have died in my life, my mother in law was diagnosed with terminal cancer and my mothers mental and physical health has deteriorated. I’ve dealt with it as best as possible, I couldn’t attend all my lectures although I kept my grades up and kept all this to myself except for one friend at university. I found she has been spreading rumours about me and telling everyone what I thought I told her in confidence but that’s a whole other story. 

7 days ago my aunt has died, this was 2 day before my exam period (4 exams in a week and half). I was a mess so I spoke to my lecturer who told me to the sit exams, the university mental health team who said if I couldn’t do them they would support me and my husband  who was worried if I couldn’t handle the death of my aunt how would I be in summer when his mother was probably going to be worst. Also whether deferring the exam would be more or less stressful because again we don’t know what will happen with his mother plus would the marks will be capped. So I’ve sat 3 of the exams so far it’s been horrible to keep myself together while doing oral exams, I only have one left and I’m already at breaking point. I’m not sleeping, eating, exhausted and can’t retain any information. I have asked help from my two university friends who i’ve helped in the past but they have disappeared except when they need a question answered. I also asked one of these friends to help to time me during a presentation she conveniently forgot so I was marked down for going over the time. When I ask both these friends what they would do in my situation it’s always the same answer ‘I don’t think I could sit the exam, but you’re stronger than me and you’ll do fine’. I have one more exam and I can’t face getting out bed and i’ve got a stomach bug. When will it get better? Am I cursed? 

Plus now i’ve sat the exam my university mental health team don’t think I need support and have recommended I try to see a private psychologist. I haven’t been able to be close to anyone for awhile and usually cut friendships off due to the fear of having to disclose the abuse I suffered as a child and the general crappy childhood I’ve had. I carry the sense of self loathing and hate that makes me believe i’m not worthy of love or even friendship. Now I’m left really lonely and alone and I don’t know what to do? How do I change for the better so I’m not in this situation again? Why are people only nice to me when they need something?"
2221,"Hey Everyone,
My name is Blair, and I am a 35 year old married woman with BPD. My husband has Aspergers Syndrome (ASD), and has trouble expressing and identifying both his and others emotions. He is a very loving, supportive, and sweet guy that always wants (and tries) to help, but I feel that having BPD I tend to need emotion support daily. 

I feel angry, ashamed, embarrassed that I always need his support, his help calming down, his tales etc to feel better. It's also hard that if I dont ask for help, he often will assume I am fine (he has trouble understanding body language and emotion intensity). Since my emotions are so intense, I feel I am always having to ask for help. It makes me feel guilty, worry he will leave me, anger I'm effected with BPD and need help so often, ashamed I'm not well, and embarrassed that everyday I need support. 

I am in the process of my DBT training, but basically got so ashamed and embarrassed that I even need it that I stopped doing it. 

Is it normal to feel so negative after diagnosis (mine was a month ago)? Should I not feel all those things about needing help daily?"
2222,"What techniques do people recommend for when you have the intense anger and irritibility? I have just received my diagnosis and I now know this isn't abnormal and there is a reason for it..... Usually my children ground me and give me a reason to smile and calm but they have been removed from my care at the moment. I feel so cheated and let down, every little thing is irritating me. I want to be alone but I don't want to be alone.... how do I lift this feeling?"
2223,"I went to therapists (yes plural cause I haven't found one I could actually be in synced with) many many times. For my personal sessions, including couple sessions (and also people be raising their eyebrow when I said I went to couple therapy with boyfriend... cause we're not married yet so y so serious? Fml -_-)

Anyway... 2,5 years with my boyfriend has been a total disaster yet a real bless both at the same time. The last year wasn't very great though. The fight got more intense, I did get better (slightly) but the whole splitting, fear of abandonment, torn and twisted self concept and way of thinking inhibit me from being the decent girlfriend he wanted.

In conclusion, to him (as he said it) I'm a toxic person. And of course this whole relationship is just unhealthy. But I always believe that something unhealthy isn't done for. As long as we could make our way to heal and be better. So maybe you guys can call me naive and lunatic, wishful thinking. 

But really... I'm in desperation to find a practical tips on how to work this out better; to lessen the BPD thing of me, to feel more secure, to accept, because he actually just wanna break up but I gave every effort possible to hold him still, and so far... we're still together... with every ugly scars and no contact situation. It's just very far from ideal boyfriend girlfriend relationship.

I believe that letting him go would only become an evidence that I suck in maintaining relationship with people I most care about. That I screw this one up, and hell... I wouldn't want to jump into another one.

Also... the internet haven't been very useful, many articles titled 'how to break up with BPD partner' just break my heart to pieces! It's like BPD aren't meant to be loved and just very handful! 

I tried CBT, and it didn't really work. Plus, at the moment I can't really afford any therapist. so... please, any advice on how to be more decent, less lunatic, so that I can be stronger, tougher, and finally not so much a toxic person?"

He was always very active, kept himself busy, little side projects even though he didn't work. We decided to live separately (we both have children and I discovered I was pregnant). Since he moved out his mood became worse. Bearing in mind I was pregnant and have an 11 year old with autism, I was still working and supporting him and his daughter financially and emotionally. I couldn't encourage him to do go see GP and just after I had the baby I discovered he had lied about his financial situation, amongst other things. He didn't help with baby, he became more withdrawn and this pushed me to despair. I tried so hard for him despite how I felt and having a lot on my plate. I just needed him to love me and support me. Instead it seemed like he hated me. I cracked on and asked for support from outside services. This dragged on my ex wouldn't engage in assessments. I was so frustrated and upset. I told my CPN I wanted to kill myself. The children were removed from my care. 3 weeks later. He has the baby. He has never spoken to me. He got his solicitor to tell me in court we were over. I'm confused and saddened. I know my children will be returned upon assessment but I don't know how I will come to terms with why he acted this way. He must have lied to me a lot. My situation is different of course. He didn't engage with services relating to his mental health. He was never going to get better. So it didn't matter what I did..... and I did my best and did it well considering the circumstances at the time. My problem was a trait of my BPD is idealising people. I put him on a pedestal and let him walk allover me. I accepted it and excused it due to his mental health.... even though I would never put my mental health on to someone else....

Did he even love me anymore? He would tell me he did but act the opposite way. Why would he choose to abandon me and such a horrific time? He's now saying he wants the baby to live with him. I can't get over how he could hurt me like this when all I ever did was try and help him. How am I supposed to move on?"
2225,"Help! a guy just asked me out and I said yes and I'm gunna sabotage everything in my life because I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO?!
My brain is already FREAKING out!
Maybe I should just cancel and then never go to the class we share again?
I also have BPD and GAD so I don't know which one is fucking with me.
If I do go
what if I say something dumb?
what if I do something dumb?
what if its awkward?
what if he makes me uncomfortable?
what if he's a bad deriver and we get in an accident?
what if I have an anxiety attack?
what if he sees me have an anxiety attack?
         what if he then thinks I'm a freak?
         what if he tells everyone in our class?
         what if I can't go to class anymore?
         fail out of university?
what if I say no and then regret it?
what if he thinks I'm a bitch?

2226,Just wondering what the best meds are for bpd as I'm on olanzapine I'm gaining weight I have my mood is better at night then day
2227,"I have 2 boys. 12 and 5 months. My 22 year old has Autism. My last partner was emotionally unavailable. I felt abandoned and let down as I just had a baby and I was doing such a good job of looking after the children (he has a daughter 5). I wanted to be appriciated. I didn't understand why he wasn't happy. Why he didn't want to spend time with us. I couldn't cope with his low mood. I asked him about it but he denied a problem. It was me. I needed to be 'normal'. I asked for support repeatedly. I was told I was coping fine. I was let down. I inpulsively thought if I told my support worker I felt suicidal they would have to help me..... They removed my children. I'm 3 weeks down the line. 

I have no doubt my children will be returned to my care. I am an excellent dedicated mum. The baby's dad is refusing to speak to me. He let me know the relationship was over by having his solicitor tell me in court. I now feel he was up to something the whole time. My oldest son is with his paternal grandparents. They are both ok in the short term, but they need to be home. 

Does anyone have any experiences of parenting with BPD? Any social services involvement?

2228,The Unexpected Gifts Inside Borderline Personality
2229,that is what i have started to do :cry:
2230,"I've realized it doesn't matter what I'm diagnosed with and whether or not my therapist believes BPD may be an issue for me (yet to be seen, so who knows).

Only because--whether or not I meet the criteria for that diagnosis--learning about the disorder and using resources available online for those suffering from it, I've been able to see myself more clearly than ever...

For the first time in my life I feel like I know what to look out for in my interpersonal relationships, and I know where I go wrong even if it takes me some time to realize it.

Of course knowing is half the battle which is why I am desperately hanging on for that next therapy appointment. 

What I'm saying is, it's a good start to recovery even if I'm barely coping."
2231,"like now feel so sad and tearful then in an hour or so 'okay' again
i hate my mood swings
laughing with maddie one minute ,crying uncontrollably the next x"
2232,"Can someone with BPD not like people. Like I’ll on purpose stay away from people, because I don’t care for them (I don’t care what they think of me, I have no concern if I’m rude at all). Then there’s the one person, or a few who I just put on the pedestal, who i want approval from. 
Recently diagnosed and unsure if it’s correct. I literately don’t care what people think, only the people I get connected to. However this doesn’t seem to last long. 
Thank you,

2233,Sometimes I feel like I have my whole life ahead of me and then bam! I fall into a hole that I just can't seem to get out of...is recovery even possible?
2234,I have been on my couch for days. Not sad...just blank. I have no appetite no motivation no sense of humor. I am isolating big time. I'm taking my meds as prescribed. Is it depression or what? How do I snap out of this funk?
2235,"Hi, 
Please could someone help me to understand what on earth this is all about. I have bpd, and I'm completely obsessed better yet frightened of how attractive my partners ex is. I've never seen her before, but he says she's attractive in comparison to previous partners he's had. He says I'm the most beautiful person he has been with and says he has thought that right from the start. I don't see how it's possible that is ex isn't better then me. Things he has said in convos had lead me to believe that she is beautiful and i just feel like he thinks she is better then me. This is actually destroying me because if he thinks she's visually looks better I'm no good. I feel jealous but frightened. It's consuming my thoughts where I constantly think and compare my image to what I believe hers is and this feeling never goes away which makes me feel angry. I'm almost angry she's pretty yet I've never seen a picture or whatever she looks like. I feel so low about it, it's destroying my relationship. I feel like he just says I'm better because he can't say I'm not incase it upset me, she's sounds just stunning and glamorous. And sometimes I feel when he's talking to me I can pick up from what he's saying in a totally unrelated convo that she is really attractive. Gosh I feel terrible and no-one seems to understand this. The only time I feel like this problem is bearable is when I feel like I look ok and am going out with my friends to get drunk but it's still there. I don't feel like my partner views my looks as great as his ex and I can't explain how this makes me feel- like a loser I guess. The intensity of this issue is making me feel so low and I know if i just left my boyfriend I'd get a break from it"
2236,"Am I just over sensitive and need to get over it and work on myself to not be so selfish? 
I dont know but I hope someone could relate or give me advice. I know your not doctors so dont worry I'm not expecting a diagnosis

I'm not trying to self diagnose myself I just recognise that I relate to a lot of these symptoms and feel I'm getting worse

The sudden in uncontrollable moods are affecting my life greatly, within an instant I can go into extreme anxiety, hysterics, rage, depression you name it but give it a couple hours and I'm fine

I'm know I'm paranoid I know I'm irrational. I know people probably dont hate me and wanting to cause me hurt , that my boyfriend probably isn't thinking of leaving me every time he's quiet for a bit and that him being quiet for a bit isn't him trying to purposely upset me or be malicious and that he's not a terrible person very time we have an argument. Or that those people laughing on the street aren't laughing at how I look or walk ect ect  But I cant help having these thoughts and in the moment it feels its 100 percent true 

I do have a history of self harm, panic attacks and I'm ashamed to say it honestly as its selfish but suicide threats 

I feel I'm getting worse honestly but I dont know how to approach this with a gp or a doctor, I know it's not good to self diagnose I just think maybe I need help . Iv self referred to counselling at my uni and it did nothing honestly and I dropped out of it 

Iv always thought I dont classify as depressed, I'm not depressed all the time , I dont have anxiety as I'm not anxious all the time it's just frequent extreme bouts of it. So if never got help. Just I dont know maybe I just want someone to relate to"
2237,"Hello, first post :peace:

For all those diagnosed with BPD, how many of you are skeptical of the diagnosis or read the description of BPD symptoms and don't see yourself at all? I've had several doctors who fully believe I'm Borderline, but I'm sort of worried that the first doctor was biased and the subsequent ones are misinterpreting things to fit that diagnosis because that is what they expect to see. (Personally I think I could be schizoid with some comorbid issues if anything. Other doctors suspected bipolar but weren't sure enough to diagnose). I wouldn't really care about the label, but I end up seeing new doctors all the time (just the way my practice is) and it seems like as soon as they see I'm ""Borderline"" they refuse to listen to me... but that's a separate problem.

So is it very common for people with BPD to read the description and think, that doesn't sound like me at all? :unsure:"
2238,Ever meet with your therapist and they say the exact opposite of what you wanna hear? I’m glad he doesn’t always take my side but #ouch.
2239,"I’ve always noticed that I tend to change my “persona”, as an adolescent/teen it would manifest as listening to a genre of music and identifying with the culture around it—so, rap, pop, punk, rock, metal, whatever the case. That was never really a problem per se, as it just seemed normal to everyone else because I was a teen.

Last year, I cut my very long hair into a bob. That was nice for a while, made me feel different, like a new person.

Eventually, it wasn’t enough, and I impulsively shaved off all my hair. I always admired short/shaved styles, so while I knew I would get different reactions, I “knew” it wasn’t a big deal.

Little did I know, some people looked at my behavior (not just this incident, but many things happened during this time)—some people looked at me and immediately realized I was having a “mental breakdown”. I was offended by this, but they were pretty much on the money.

So—anybody else ever randomly shave their head, even if you spent about 5 years growing the hair? Or, really I just mean any drastic change.

I don’t really see it as a problem, but I know it can be indicative of more deeper issues around identity."
2240,"Hey! So I'm 6 months into my first real relationship and while I've managed my symptoms (Bipolar and BPD) well up until now I've reached a difficult spot with them. 

My boyfriend also has serious mental health issues and he wants to take a break to focus on balancing out his life as a series of events have inflamed his issues (college difficulties/being laid off/family struggles). He's been overly dependent on me as a source of happiness while also being more distant and its started to impact our relationship.

Logically I entirely agree with this idea and respect his awareness of his illness and how it affects those around him, but emotionally I'm not taking it well. I think this is because prior to the break it seemed like he was pushing me away and closed off which had me on edge for weeks worried about what was going on. I feel better knowing why he was distant (before he asked for a break I thought he didn't care for me anymore or something like that) but the entire concept of not being together but still waiting for him is making me feel bad.

I normally am not paranoid or posessive in our relationship but during our break (which so far has been a week, he said he cant quantify how long it'll take but he hopes by the summer it'll be over) those symptoms have appeared the worst they've ever been. I can hardly sleep and I haven't been eating and it's like the back of my mind is needling me constantly about how he's probably out there finding someone new or how he's lying to me and just wants me as an option without committing. I know that's not the case because he's been open in explaining his reason for the break and we are still in contact as friends but I really feel that way. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm overanalyzing everything he does/has done for the past couple months looking for any sign he's lying.

Basically what I'm asking is what should I do/how can I handle these symptoms? My BPD symptoms haven't been this bad in years and my instinct is to break up with him because I can't take it, but I also worry that's just me avoiding real or imagined abandonment by leaving first. What are some coping mechanisms you guys can think of for this situation or would leaving be the right idea? I really do love him but I also love myself and don't want to subject my mental health to damage. Thank you so much for reading all of this by the way!"
2241,"This forum has truly been like a lifeline for me in times of crisis. It is not perfect nothing is perfect, but I do not feel like an outcast here and that is something I have never been able to say in ANY other area of my life.

Sometimes, I just need to talk and blab on about whatever. And you all tolerate it—or even have genuine interest—which I appreciate more than words can say.

I am putting this specifically in the BPD forum because I feel the most understood here, but I mean this for every other forum I have posted in as well. Thank you.

2242,"Hello,
I posted several weeks ago about my ex-boyfriend who I suspect had BDP traits, particularly in romantic relationships. The more I've read about BPD, the more sure I'm becoming that this was the pattern with him. The first several months were pure bliss. We were incredible together. In hindsight, I think he showed signs of enmeshment as he would always say ""same heart, same mind"" since we agreed on so many things. He told me even then that my positive reactions had such a strong effect on his mood. He always told me I was his ""favorite person"" but I didn't understand what that meant at the time. He also told me he was ""very stubborn"" but I didn't know what that meant at the time either. I had never felt so loved and understood before. 
Then, he told me he felt rejected when I told him one night that I was too tired to be intimate but promised to make it up to him the next morning (and that I loved him). This became such a huge issue to him that the next morning, he picked a fight, went completely MIA (ignored me for hours) and got drunk in daylight. Then, he proceeded to go back and forth between telling me we were done and that he wanted to marry me for the rest of the day. Until he got a text from another girl and told me he wants to be with her. And when I left, he called me 184x and guilt tripped me. He also sort of conveniently forgot that he had brought up another girl. And said that he couldn't understand why I was mad at him... He also told me that he wouldn't let me ruin his understanding of me (?).
I kept trying to make it work because I was completely in love and couldn't understand what had happened. The next few weeks he would yell at me whenever I would't give in to his demands. I told him that was not acceptable. After a few weeks, he decided not to yell anymore but instead would give me the silent treatment (which was worse!). We broke up for a few weeks and then I reached out to him. He said he knew I would (why?). The next several weeks, I could already feel him pulling away. He would blame me for things that I had nothing to do with at all. He never saw his defensiveness or fault in anything. Every minor disagreement was like an enormous deal.  If I was upset about something (like work, family, etc), he was supportive but very quick to try to change the topic (as if he couldn't handle conflict at all). If I was upset about something in our relationship and brought it up even kindly, he would basically tell me it was my problem to deal with.  When he wasn't feeling well, he had no problem leaning on me and was super sweet/connected. As soon as he would feel better, I felt like he would go back to doing his own thing and our relationship started feeling like it was less and less of a priority. And then it ended. He told me he was ""going on another date"" that same night but that he would have preferred to be with me. Why did he feel the need to let me know that? Seems so vindictive.
I even called him a couple weeks later and he told me that what we had was really great but that he doesn't know who I am at this point since we hadn't talked in a while. I was like it's been 2 weeks??? I asked if he preferred I don't call him again and he said, ""Well, it's nice to hear from you but you know how strongly I feel about not being friends after dating."" I also asked him if we wanted to try one more time and he said ""we already tried that."" I said I know but what happened? To which he replied ""you were there."" So I dropped it and told him he meant a lot to me and I send positivity his way. I have no intention of going against his wishes to stay out of contact.

I have so many questions I was hoping someone would help me shed some light on (the bold ones I especially keep going back to):
Did we actually agree on a lot of things or was that not real?
Was the personality he showed me in the beginning real at all or just a mirror of my own interests/beliefs?
Do some people with BPD actually tell their favorite person that they are their favorite person? Is ""favorite person"" ever consistently used by someone that does not have borderline traits?
How does someone with BPD ""decide"" that this is the time to shift from all positiveness to suddenly seeing their partner as horrible for the first time (such as the sudden change)? If I hadn't resisted intimacy with him that night, is it likely that a similar behavior would have still occurred at another point in time? Did he always have uneasiness and just chooses when to stop hiding it?
At the same time that he went MIA the first time and was getting drunk, he was texting with his brother as his normal self. Does this mean that he could be completely mean/uncaring to me but still act completely ""normal"" around his brother? Isn't that a choice then to be mean to the FP?
What was he trying to achieve with bringing up other girls? Was he trying to be hurtful? Or was this his way of letting himself know that even if ""I left,"" this other girl would fill my spot? Is that what he was likely doing behind the scenes as soon as we had our first fight? With this behavior, would there have been high likelihood that he would have cheated if we had stayed together (or is this unfair to assume)?
How can someone be so good at the silent treatment and think it's ok?
Did it even matter that we started dating again after those few weeks or had he already started pulling away after that first fight so that nothing I did would matter after that?
It felt like he went from having a very anxious attachment style to a dismissive-avoidant one. Is that typical?
How did he have a several year relationship before me? I keep wondering how ours only lasted 7-8 months when he had one of 2 years prior to that? Did he not expose his full emotional side in that relationship until much later? 
Was his reaction to our break-up to protect himself or had he already moved on at that point?
Do people with BPD show that side much earlier or later depending on the person/relationship? I'd really like an answer to this question.
I really still believe he's a good person and has good intentions. I believed with the bottom of my heart that he really is a good, caring person so this was so hard to watch. Which leads me to the next part...

It's not that I want to continue this relationship because I know better and recognize the negative effects this pattern would have on me unless he got help (he is now in therapy, though I don't think he recognizes the BPD traits - Side note, I did tell him that he reacted that first fight like someone who has BPD and he just said mm hmm... which made me wonder if he wasn't surprised or just trying to be a good listener).  I am having a really hard time letting go of the couple I thought we were together.  It feels like I see him in everything because we talked about doing SO many things together.  And every time I go on a date now, I think about how he would react with such good listening, such attunement to what I needed and such good affection that everyone just pales in comparison. I feel more alone than I ever have because I felt like I had found someone who really got me and having that taken away is so painful. And on top of it all, it feels like I'm carrying so much pain because I loved him and respected him truly unconditionally and he just became mean. I assume once he got therapy, he probably would never reach out again? You think he would reach out even before then? Any suggestions on healing past this?

Thank you in advance. I appreciate you all that are willing to share because my friends/family don't understand why I can't just snap out of this since they see it so clearly."
2243,"When I hear negative comments in regards to BPD it really irritates me,why should I feel bad,when actually, like many people with BPD we have enough emotional pain,without other people, adding to that pain.
Because how we feel is real,and there is a cause and effect. 
It people actually knew the crap and treatment we have dealt with, in the past then they would think twice before judging me.
There might not always be a good enough excuse why I lashed out, but there's a reason.
I am proud now that I have BPD its made me a stronger person,it also makes me a person that I know what real pain is.
Every time I hear any negative comments about 'people with BPD ' I am going to correct them.
People who are ignorant about the disorder should not make comment or judgement, and if they dare make judgement then all they are is arrogant,which I detest.
I'm not ashamed of having bipolar disorder.

I'm not ashamed of 
being deaf in my right ear, which I am, (deaf that is)I have found people make an assumption I'm a snob,choose to ignore me!! When I wasn't ignoring or snobbing anyone I didn't hear them to begin with.
That is actually an observation my husband had bought to my attention

I was in a bookstore one day I remember looking up from this book to a face of the shop assistance in my face treating me like I was stupid. She had obviously been talking to my back and on my right side, then when she didn't get a response started talking to me like I was sub-human"
2244,"Hey guys,

Wondered if anyone else has a similar experience...

I work in MH and I seem to be constantly faced with indirect discrimination from my co workers - seems that PD's have the worst rep. I hear these awful things a lot and come home and feel like utter shit.

How do you deal with it? I want to challenge but find it difficult. Any tips of how to handle this? 

Thanks"
2245,"I currently receive ESA benefit (am in the support group) and next Wednesday I have to have a face to face medical assessment because I applied for extra support in the form of PIP (personal independent payment).

I had help from a charity to fill in the form and sent the usual supporting medical evidence, but because I was discharged from my CMHT last July for a six month consolidation period, obviously there was a gap in not having psych letters or other documents that I explained in writing to the DWP.

I am assuming this is why I have been summoned for a face to face medical?  Anyway I'm meeting an advocate next Tuesday so he can get an idea of my difficulties and I guess to brief me on what to expect on the Wednesday which he will accompany me to.  Although they can't speak for you I am hoping it may make me less anxious having him there.

Does anyone else have experience of going for a face to face medical assessment as part of their application for PIP with an EUPD/BPD diagnosis? 

You read all these horrible stories of the people that carry out these assessments and how many people don't score enough points in order to qualify to receive PIP.  It adds to the stress of having to sit there in front of a stranger, being judged on your illness trying to get across how hard it can be living with EUPD.

I feel so sick with anxiety about the whole damn thing, the only positive is that I live about three minutes walk away from the venue it's being held at.

Thanks in advance."
2246,"I don't want anyone reading this to contact the emergency services or whatever as I am not going to act on my thoughts but I just need a safe space to vent. 

Over the past month? (I think it's been a month) my thoughts have gone from not wanting to be here to going into what I might do. I've looked into costs of a funeral and I have a few things to do to get my motorbike and car in as good as condition as possible so it's easier to sell. I feel I have decided to not sell either of them as it will be a giveaway if I am to go through with it. I have jobs I want to do at home so I want to get them sorted before I consider doing anything. 

I know this may sound full on but I need a place to vent and I am safe so please don't try and contact emergency services etc.

2247,"Technically speaking, I am far from alone. I have three beautiful children and a very loving partner but I feel so, so alone. I was diagnosed with BPD in 2018, after having several hospital admissions and suicide attempts. 

For the last few weeks, I have been stable but it's all crashing down on me now. When I talk to my partner. He seems incredibly fed up of hearing me being low, he wants to help but I think it's just too much for him. I let him down. 

My three kids are 6,, 2 & 1. I find the two year old incredibly hard. We struggled to bond since the beginning and her behaviour tips me over the edge. She screams all the time, she is spoilt and doesn't share (normal 2 year old behaviour) but still hard. I love them all to pieces but they're so so hard. 

I feel like I'm just causing problems for everyone. I should just go. I'm so tired all the time. I feel so crap. I don't have anyone that understands."
2248,"Sorry, this is going to be a long post it would mean a lot to me if you took the time to read this

I have mentioned to a psychiatrist that i thought i had bpd, her reaction has left me scared to talk to anyone about bpd. She basically said that i don't have bpd, but just am a manipulative liar with depression and autism...
I've had attachment issues since i was very young (like 3 or 4) where i get overly attached to mother figures, and will do anything to get their attention, and have a huuuuuge fear that they're going to abandon me, and i will do the most sick things to avoid them abandoning me (this can go as far as suicide threads/attempts) I also have extreme moodswings, one moment i can be the most happy person on earth, and then 1 minute later i am depressed and suicidal as hell without a reason. 
I will manipulate the people i get attached to, i dream about them, fantasize about them holding me, hugging me, caring for me as if i was a little child. And i will go to extreme lengths to make it happen in reality.
If they just talk to me in a different tone than they normally do, i will either do some sick stuff to ""test"" if they want to stay with me, or i will be a bitch and push them away before they leave me, then regretting it when it's to late, attempting suicide/self harming/starving myself to get them back, and when i realize they're gone forever, i just get so suicidal. 
a lot of stuff has happened to me, which has made it worse (sexual abuse from people i trusted and some other shit)
there are many other things i do/feel that make me wonder if i might have bpd, but this one affects my life the most.
i'm in a psych ward right now (against my will) because i am so fucking suicidal (a person im attached to is going to get a new job, i can't handle being left)

please don't hate on me, i hate myself for this and i'm so embarrassed to post this online. But i just really want help"
2249,How do I stop. I just told him I’ll keep to myself and leave him alone because I just hurt him by trying to be closer all the time. I seriously just give up. I can’t handle it anymore and he deserves better. I’m just done.
2250,"This morning my 4 year old daughter really threw a fit getting ready for school today and I lost it. I had a complete meltdown crying, sobbing and wanting to hurt myself and strong suicidal thoughts. Now that it's over I feel so ashamed and broken, I worry that I'm a horrible father and am going to screw up my kids because of my mental illness."
2251,"Sometimes my boyfriend does not respond to my text because he is upset and does not want to talk, or does not know what to say. Even when he is at work he normally answers me eventually, if he is in a good mood... but our relationship has been a rollercoaster and the past year has been hell for him due to my splitting and leaving and seeing other people, then going back to him all roses again...

Rationally, I know it’s not necessarily the end of the world and, he did say he wants to work things out so even if he is mad it doesn’t mean he will leave... and I am trying my best to change, I am attending therapy.

Logic vs emotion is a difficult battle though, and when I feel he is upset with me but he won’t speak to me, it’s a slippery slope for me to freak out and spiral into depressive anxiety and even anger... which I tend to internalize, or it comes out in self destructive ways, or I will cry and yell over the phone, I will become hysterical.

How do I prevent this??? How do I get through the emotional reaction to believe the logic and the truth??? I am a mess and I don’t want him to have to deal with it all the time, I want him to talk to me but I know if he is upset he can be very blunt and I end up feeling attacked and lashing out even when he has a right to feel the way he does..."
2252,"So I feel like I'm failing. I've been doing DBT for 7 months. I do the group skills and have an amazing 1-2-1 therapist. Up until about a month ago I seemed to managing OK, less urges to do destructive things and no self harm since November. I felt I was getting it, like I was being such a good girl with it all. I'm 46 and not a girl anymore but I constantly feel like a little girl, desperately seeking approval.
Anyway, about 4 weeks ago, the depression crept back in and sent the anxiety straight through the roof. 
I feel like I'm losing my grip on life. I have a good job, nice home, partner etc. I have far more than some so I should be grateful.
My anxiety tells me that I should be anxious, that I'm a failure and an imposter and anytime now I'll be found out. The job I do is a specialist role and I know it and I'm good at it. Its looking like its going to change later in the year and I'm just not capable of changing jobs, learning something new, interacting with others - my idea of a nightmare.
I've started thinking about suicide again - not sure what the alternatives are to feeling like I don't belong.
My therapist knows I'm struggling but what can she do? She is highlighting which skills I need to concentrate on and being very supportive - I'm letting her down.
I'm sure my boss is sick to death of me saying how anxious I feel. 
I'm trapped and I don't know what I need to do/can do to escape.
I go on holiday on Saturday - even the thought of that is completely freaking me out. I'm a ridiculous mess.

2253,"Hello 

This is the first time I’ve ever joined any sort of forum. A little history on me. I’ve been dealing and suppressing my mental issues since I was a teenager. 

I became pregnant and I guess suppression was no more. The pregnancy was unplanned and unexpected. I am now 39 years old with an 8 month old daughter. I’ve been married to a great guy for ten years this sept n have two teenage stepdaughters that are like my daughters. 

Life has been really hard the last 3 years financially. We’ve lost our house and car and have been living in motels for about a year now. 

My BPD is getting worse and worse and I don’t know how to control it anymore. I have a constant battle in my mind. I can be loving and happy and a great person to strangers but at home anything triggers me and I become the worst angry biatch to ever exist. I threaten my husband with leaving. I say hurtful things that deep down I don’t mean. I even told him the other day that I hated him and was gonna take his daughter and leave but again that was out of anger. 

I was taking meds right after the baby because the doctors feared ppd. A few years back I had a mental breakdown and was court ordered to seek mental therapy. I do not like therapy at all. I’m not comfortable talking person to person. I kinda put things out of sight out of mind and just keep moving. 

Am I the only one that does this??? Idk what to do anymore. I just keep getting meaner and meaner and the flipping is more constant. I feel my current situation doesn’t help me either. I don’t even know what I’m looking for here....

I feel guilty and bad but can’t control this anymore. 

Am I better off alone??? But I don’t want that either. 

Seriously confused 🤦🏻‍♀️"
2254,"Hi I am diagnosed with ASD, Bipolar and BPD. I'm currently doing a decent job of keeping my life together but I'm suffering from flashbacks and vivid dreams. A few years a go I cheated on my partner, he was my first love and I was out of my mind on zoloft and had just been released from hospital after a bipolar episode and was still experiencing disassociative symptoms. It is the only thing in my life I regret and I cannot get past it even though it was years ago and I'm now with a new partner who is brilliant.
The whole thing led me to attempt suicide about 3 years ago and now my head is constantly forcing me to think about him and the regret and guilt I feel. Ive started getting self harming thoughts and I wish I could see him and go back to how we were but at the same time I don't."
2255,"Tw: Momo 

Am i the only one that cant sleep at night or cant settle because this damn thing and face makes you Paranoid!?!
3 nights now i havent slept because this shit keeps me awake! Im constantly on edge! The photos at work scare the crap outta me now! Im hearing sounds and seeing shadows which are messing with my head and its driving me literally insane! 
I mean im 26 years old, and im being scared shitless by a face and a voice hoax which is meant to be messing with children! Its like its literally taunting me 😩 

Please tell me im not the only one!"
2256,"I just need to vent. I’m also always terrified that somehow someone will read this and know who I am in real life but I’ll try to ignore that bc I’m sure someone can give me good advice. Just being part of the forum since yesterday has calmed me down a bunch because I’m happy when I can encourage other people. But here’s my random trigger from the past week: my boyfriend’s little sister is visiting and I know I should be happy for him and give him his space but I’m super sad that he’s so easily put his priority completely on her. He’s been inviting me and even my sister out with them and it’s been a blast. His sister is great. Whenever I’m with them I’m very happy. But when I’m back at my own apartment alone I get really sad because he’s with her at his place and I’m all alone. I keep picking this situation for evidence that he’s not that serious about me, comparing to how my dad treats his sister vs my mom (obviously he wouldn’t be like my sister is in town, bye wife). My bf and I don’t live together. I want to but he isn’t ready. The thing is that even though I know he’s less about the future than I am, sometimes he does completely reassure me and I know we’re good forever. I think the inconsistency just kills me. I need an answer. Seeing his sister as competition for his attention that I believe I’m losing just makes all of my fears explode. I’ve been using a combo of Xanax and alcohol to stay calm enough to have fun with them and not show my hurt because I know if I make his sister the bad guy he’ll totally take her side. I’m anxiously awaiting when she leaves but I’m afraid he’ll ask if I’m jealous bc I think he can tell through my self medicating strategy. And I am SO bad at lying even though in that instance I certainly should. How do I process these feelings and stop obsessing? He seems happier than he has in awhile now that she’s here so I jump straight to “I’m not good for him, I suck”. Then to “I’m done with this because I’m not his favorite all the time”. I mean I just wanna be someone’s favorite and have them reassure me consistently and be loyal. I thought that serious relationships were that way, but this one often requires me to give my bf his space and not expect to be reassured I’m number one all the time. Something in me insists that I’m good enough to be “the best thing ever” for someone and I feel unsure that my bf still sees me that way. Sorry that was so long. Any help would be so appreciated I know my thoughts have melted into shapeless goo because I’m so scared of losing my bf."
2257,"I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder for 5 years now, it seems to control my life and especially my relationship. I have a partner of 2 years and lately ive been feeling conflicting emotions towards him. I'm not sure if its me or my bpd causing my emotional instability. Some days i look at him or he says something i dont agree with and i think why am i with you? The thought of starting a family with him knowing ill be tied down to him forever scares me, then other days more calmer days i feel so in love like hes the best person in the world. Weirdly enough his mood determines how i feel about him, when hes moody i dont want to be with him and when hes nice hes my perfect person then i feel guilty for feeling bad of him. 

Im so confused :("
2258,"I’m reading some of the posts and I want to say bravo to those of you who are able to maintain employment, healthy relationships, and are college educated. 

Those are 3 things I have wanted the most but struggle in obtaining. As of late, I have not been trying. 

Also, kudos to those of you who make it out of bed, bathe, dress, and feed yourselves. 

I know it’s different levels to BPD and being a human being; completing  simple tasks can be great accomplishments for some. 

I acknowledge both."
2259,"Hi everyone 
I’m new. Awaiting diagnosis but I have no doubt 😕

I am struggling so badly - I feel I am 2 different people and neither can relate to other.

1. Caring, loving, thoughtful, compassionate
2. Nasty, cruel, violent 

No 2 makes me HATE myself and constantly feel suicidal. 

Can anyone relate? X"
2260,"I've been reading threads and I've noticed a lot of ""guess if this person I know has BPD"" threads and they go on to list a bunch of experiences they have with someone, of course they are all one sided, and never talk about how they interact with this person just how this person reacts/treats them. 
They ask to diagnose or confirm their suspicions that this person has BPD.
Its something I've noticed and I think it kind of annoys me, like if you think somethings up with someone maybe talk to them?
But I also noticed many of the people they describe sound abusive, and maybe these people are trying to find a way to leave an abusive relationship and don't really know how, but then again like what do they expect to gain from this?
I don't know I Just noticed this and its mildly annoying and I'm venting."
2261,"Hi, I was wondering if there's anyone where who dedicates their time to draw or illustrate about their mental illness, I'm genuinly interested, since as I work full time as a graphic designer and illustrator. Because of that, part of my bpd therapy is drawing about my feelings or my mental state weekly.

Also, can you relate to this?
Have you ever draw as part of your therapy?
How did it go?

I only share those drawings to my therapist, because I'm too afraid to show to anyone else. But I'd love to see anyone else's work and take some inspiration. Maybe It'll encourage me to share my drawings some day.

Here's part of an illustration I did for therapy a couple of weeks before.

If you have an ig page or a blog, just let me know!

2262,"According to my therapist, a partner shouldn’t literally be your everything. Um..why not? Did I watch too many Disney princess movies when I was little? Jk I still love those. But apparently the expectations I’ve set for my bf are impossible although I’m having a hard time agreeing. Someone please enlighten me 🙈"
2263,"I honestly try and be the best person I can. The last thing I ever want to do is take advantage of someone. But as I get older my willingness to eat shit has significantly dropped. I know I’m a difficult person. I don’t have one person in my life. If they didn’t leave me. I pushed them away. I push them away because maintenance of the friendship becomes more stressful than loneliness. I’m a difficult person. 

For years now I’ve been trying (and failing) to embrace the loneliness.

 I’m at a point in my life where all my free time is spent trying to keep it together enough so it dosent effect my job. I’m scared because currently it’s a battle I’m slowly losing. I’m not someone who needs a lot of money. But I think everyone agrees that employment is better than unemployment.

Is it possible to keep it together in a world full of people that can’t see you?"
2264,"Hello, 

I want to connect with people who have BPD. My hope is to better understand my condition and learn ways to manage/cope by talking to other people who may or may not have shared experiences. 

I have never met anyone else who has been diagnosed with BPD. Hoping that talking to someone with BPD will give me greater insight and I can possibly understand myself a little better. 

Here’s my background info: Black, cis female, poor, disabled, unemployed since 11/2018; never kept a single job more than a year and a half, completed 1 year of community college, never married, single, no children, non-religious, would consider myself pansexual, but currently have no desire in being with anyone romantically or sexually. Been single since 2011. 

Ideally it would be nice to talk to someone who understands and/or experiences some of the things I go through as someone with BPD. 

I have my mother, my 2 grandmothers, and my great-grandmother, but they don’t understand what I’m going through. Many of my family members believe I’m unhappy because I want to be unhappy and that all my issues are based on bad decision making, God, and/or astrology rather than a behavorial/mental disorder. 

If you have BPD, and would like to talk, please message me."
2265,"I've been thinking for a very long time to write, but I didn't know how to start or where.
I looked up on google and I found myself here.
My writing will be more like a kid explaining his story, so my apologies about that.
Lets just start from the end, I am a 26 yrs old girl that has been diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago.
My life is a mess, I could say I live in denial and I cannot link to the real world.
I work a tiring job; 6 days a week for 11 hrs, I enjoy it but still it's hectic.
My parents are divorced, I live with my dad and grandma, but I'm always in my room.
I have issues with taking decisions or seeing all the point of views in any situation I'm in, which leads that I take impulsive decisions and say things I don't mean.
I've reached a point in my life that I don't give a damn about anything around me especially my parents because I don't get from them what I need, and it's so hard to accept that, and once small tiny thing from them happens it just makes everything worse.
I'd prefer to go out with work colleagues and not my friends, because I disappear a lot and don't text or call, and every time I go out with them they start picking up on me and I hate it and also I need to get out of the same topics we talk about.
Another issue, that I always get attracted to the wrong guys because I feel that I can help them and love grows, but I always fuck it up; either because I think too much, or my feelings change which actually happened. That doesn't mean they're bad, but I keep looking for how I wanted to be not the reality. Also, I have a very bad memory, I forget lots of stuff that happened recently. So I live in Egypt and I hate it, and get treatment here is not that good, I tried lots of psychiatrists and DBT here sucks. I take meds on my own, yes I know its wrong but I do. Also, I planning to leave soon and find another job abroad, because actually staying here makes it worse.
That's it for now, I hope I can get replies because I'm tired of everything and getting attached to people cuz no one get it."
2266,"Hello. 

I've never felt like everybody else. I've always felt really different. There's to much to list individually, but one thing has always been a huge hole in my life, and I desperately want to know if others suffer it, or if it is just me. 

I've never had any things I want to do with my life. Other people have dreams, goals, ambitions - I've always just been empty on that front. I have a day off work, and I have no idea what to do with it. There's nothing I want to do. I have no interests, no hobbies. I'm single, and always have been. I get pretty stressed and upset trying to think of things to do, places to go. Sometimes I'll force myself to go to a shop or something - but that never ends well. I always end up walking around feeling so empty, and the whole thing feels so forced and pointless . I look around me and wish I felt normal like every one else. More often than not, I'll sit and cry in my car afterwards. How come everyone else has a life, interests, things they want to do? Why am I so different? 

So I usually end up staying in my room, playing around on my phone. It's no life, and I hate it. It's like I just live for my job, and go into standby like a TV when I'm not there, until I'm back at work again. I hate it. 

I try to explain it to other people, but nobody seems to understand. 

Does anybody else feel this way? I'm so tired of feeling alone. 

Thank you for reading this."
2267,"Hello everyone,

This is my first forum post. I was newly diagnosed with BPD after a mental health crisis this past November. That’s a long story, and I’d be willing to tell it for anyone who has interest.

What I’m really hoping you all could give me is some support with regard to feeling like an alien even within this diagnosis. Everything “fits,” but I hear so much about BPD being debilitating in terms of people not being able to work or not presenting well. I know in my heart that BPD explains so much of my inner turmoil and the things that send me into a “spiral,” but I feel very alone and confused. Every time I talk about BPD with my therapist or my boyfriend, I feel awkward even saying it -- like me harping on it is going to look like I want this diagnosis or am having fun with it or playing it up or something.

By all accounts, I am a successful young adult. And I think it’s probably a massive stereotype with people with BPD can’t have success or normalcy. Nevertheless, I feel like my “high functioning” label is just a way to undermine the legitimacy of my feelings and identity.

I’ve been reading about borderline subtypes and identify with aspects of them, but I guess the “discouraged borderline” is the best fit? But I know that these aren’t in DSM-5 and again that makes me question legitimacy of whether I'm just looking for a way to justify and rationalize my own inability to cope.

Some may say that it doesn’t matter, and I know it really shouldn’t, but I have a compulsive need to riddle things out. I’m highly logical and sometimes I wish I wasn’t, because it makes it hard to accept that sometimes there are no best answers. I just feel so illegitimate.

Does anyone else know anything about subtypes or levels of functioning?"
2268,"Been seeing this girl and suspecting if she's showing signs of having BPD. Met her from one of my social group of friends. In the beginning when we were spending time together it was like we were in our own universe. She'd cling to my every word, she'd do anything to please me. But I noticed some strange behaviours initially that I kind of ignored. Random, odd responses to neutral things. She'd say something like ""call me, I miss the sound of your voice"", I'd reply I'll call her a bit later because I'm driving and she'd send back a provocative reply of ""that's fine, I won't want to hear your voice later anyways"".


We play volleyball together and she flares up easy. Some kids were hitting balls in a court next to us and kept hitting to our side. After the 3rd time they hit a ball to our side she yelled out ""HOLY FUCK"". When we play a game and we mess up, or she messes up, she angrily throws the ball. She flares up and cools down fast during games. I've called her on it, and she cries and says she has a bit of an anger problem and she's tried to tone it down, but I dont' know if she can't help it or not..


After 3 months or so she'd start to throw out hypothetical questions such as what kind of house I'd like to live in, what music would I want played at a wedding, how I'd raise kids. Ever since, she's been pushing commitment and marriage.
As time went on though, the amount of drama from her increased and increased to the point she'd get mad over thing such as.....


1. Me leaving a drop-in game to practice in a court next to hers before the gym was going to close in 5 minutes, she said was ""incredibly rude"" and I ""abandoned"" her. She got angry and when I didn't entertain it, she said ""I hate you, don't talk to me ever again"". After laughing it off, she cools down and pretends like she wasn't that mad to begin with.


2. Got mad that I didn't offer to come over to play with her dog when it was his birthday and that I somehow didn't care about him and by extension her.


3. I didn't apparently answer the right way when she was sick and again accused me of not caring about her.


4. She asked me to quantify how important I was to her, and when I didn't quantify it exactly to her liking she got angry, then cried.


5. She tried to control and argue with me how I spend my own money even though we aren't married or even live together.


6. Got a haircut she didn't like, then got angry and refused to kiss me, when she saw how I was about ready to drive off she immediately backed off and tried to shower me with affection again. Similarly when she wanted to get cuff links and I very politely thought it wasn't necessary to spend that kind of money, she got PISSED and withheld affection until I again, I had to ignore her then she came back.


She seems to have serious issues with being alone. Whenever I stay the night over at her place, she becomes depressed when I have to leave and says things like ""I wish I could keep you forever with me"".


Now I see her being incredibly happy with me one moment, and then literally the very next moment she'll remember how her friend is traveling to Japan and like a switch she becomes unhappy and says shit like her life is meaningless without being to travel this year, and it's my fault (due to my job).

Does she have BPD? Because there are things that I do really like about her despite the emotional rollercoaster she's putting me through."
2269,"I got the diagnosis about two months ago, during that time i was deeply depressed and did not ask what it meant. I wanted to be able to get dbt (dialectic behavior therapy). Now, when i feel better, i've been trying to find info but i can't find the term ""over controled"" bpd. Have any of you heard about it? The more i read, the less I understand how a diagnosis, know for dysregulation, can be controled? Or is control and regulation not event close to each other in clinical terms?

I don't dare talk to my doctor, in case he takes me of the waiting list (>12 month). I've been sick, in and out of depresion and mania (bipolar as wellness) for five years now. I'm desperate for some long term treatment and they haven't offerd me anything else.

2270,"I'm not even sure if this is triggered by my BPD, but I've been living in a paranoia-induced reality since fifth grade. 

I've never talked about this to anyone. Not my therapist, friends, family. No one. I developed the idea that my entire life was broadcasted through my glasses in fifth grade, like they had little cameras in the lenses and I was being livestreamed. Over all the years, it's infested my life. I have fake people in my life where I hallucinate them without actually seeing or hearing them, it's like I'm hallucinating the presence of a person I've built up all these years. I'll idly talk to myself for hours, leave or seclude myself from my friends when we're talking or hanging out to live out this. It's not even something that scares me at this point, it's just a fake reality that I'm constantly living out. No matter how many times I try and tell myself that this isn't real when it's happening, I brush it off like I made a joke. I just can't stop myself. I don't know if this comes from a coping mechanism from my abuse as a child or something deeper, but the only things I have that could affect this are BPD and DID (i also have dermatillomania and experience mania but I don't think those can contribute here), but I have no idea if my alters experience this paranoia-induced phenomenon. I don't know where to start looking for answers on this, I've never met anyone else who's experienced something like this."
2271,Hi all I am new here and just wanted to post a link to my facebook page. I have created it to show my perspective of BPD and how it affects me. Comments and feedback are more than welcome.

2272,"A boy who had id been having a “relationship” with recently told me he wasn’t interested in me romantically anymore. This was about two weeks ago.
Since that day, I haven’t been able to eat because everything makes me nauseous. I wake up hours before my alarm goes off and I lay there, my first thought is about him, what did I do wrong, why doesn’t he like me anymore, what could I have done better, is there someone else, etc. I can’t listen to music anymore because I’ll start to break down since most all of it reminds me of him. I cry myself to sleep every night. I’ve lost 5 pounds in the last week and a half. 
I’ve written him 4 or 5 notes explaining what happened, how I feel, asking what I could do better and how I can fix this, not intending on giving them to him- but possibly if I get desperate or impulsive enough. 
Now I’m dissociating and I can’t focus and I feel like I want to tear my skin off of my body and scream. 
Rationally I know this isn’t that big of a deal, but it feels like my world is ending and I mentally can’t handle it. 
Another part of this is- I feel like I was in love with him, I’ve been talking to him since you, “dating” since August. So it’s plenty of time to decide, right? But I’m never sure of my feelings. I don’t know whether BPD is romanticizing the person and causing me to feel like I’m in love with the person or if my feelings are actually genuine. 

I hate this so much."

2274,"Sleep seems to be impossible for me. Last night I was so tired (after 2 nights of no sleep) that I did sleep but only for 2 hours. Then awake for ages, then finally sleep a bit, then awake etc. 

I also shake a lot during the day. I don't know if this is anxiety or related to the medication. I talked to my GP and he upped the does of my antidepressant but it hasn't made any difference. 
Both the shaking and the not sleeping is exhausting and makes everything else so much harder to cope with. 
Does anyone else have these problems?"
2275,"Hello to everyone..  

I've signed up on the forum today because I strongly suspect I have BPD. I have suspected this for a number of years, but only recently started to take my suspicions seriously. 

I check of most the symptoms, besides suicide and self harm idealisation & attempts. 

A little background might be helpful. 

I'm a 27 yo female who was brought up by my mother, who was an alcoholic narcissist. I shared the family home with her and my younger brother growing up. 

My mom became a full blown alcoholic early in my life, she had a very difficult & traumatic childhood growing up in Northern Ireland, the family immigrated to England following the murder of her eldest brother at the height of the Troubles. Over here in England, the Troubles followed them and my Grandmother was murdered by two off duty British Soldiers. My mother found her body and this was also traumatic, and there is also good reason to believe that my Granddad sexually abused some of his female children... I presume all of these factors lead to her alcoholism and narcissism. 

Growing up she was either absent, or present and very abusive, both physically and verbally. She was constantly drunk and lacking coherence, sensibilities, humility, understanding or compassion. She very much thought the world revolved around her and her trauma.. and despite being told that she was trying for two years to conceive me, she then spent the rest of the years telling me & my brother just how unwanted and burdensome we were. 

I inherited my dads brains, thankfully, and besides the turmoil, abuse and neglect happening at home, I excelled in school and academia... despite the only support from my mom being drunken rows, unreasonable demands and callous forms of punishment. 

It was when I hit 16 she told me I was old enough to look after and support myself. She would frequently kick me out and/or lock me out. She witheld the child benefits she was getting for me, leaving me unable to travel to college or to get any sort of head start in life. 

This sort of behaviour continued up until two years ago (my age being 25), when she finally quit the booze... She quit it simply because she had no choice but to. She narrowly escaped drink induced death several times, and those instances were very traumatic for me & my brother also. Our fathers were never much in the picture, and now they are both deceased, our drunken mother was the only parent we had. 

Anyway, over the last two years I've managed to over-come a lot of the animosity (rage) I felt towards my mother and our relationship today is much healthier (although she's still a self-centred narcissist). 

The problem I have these days (always have but now it's become a priority to address) is in my personal & intimate relationships, most prominently my boyfriends, and more specifically my current partner, whom I've just had a child with.  

I was always an angry child. Having a completely incoherent and vindictive parent will do that to a child. In adolescence, I just got angrier. 

I would frequently get into fights (mostly with boys) at school. Physical fights... and win them, which just made everybody wary of me.. although not that wary that I didn't have any friends. 

The only thing that got me through childhood and up to the present are the amazing group of friends I've had over the years, some from primary and some from secondary school.. and again, I done well in class. 

I just always suffered from this over-reactive anger that I wouldn't hesitate in unleashing on the world... and today, well it's basically the same, although I am a fair bit older and wiser now. 

The impulsiveness and aggression probably peaked in my teens and early adult-hood. I've became rather more self aware since then, and I behave much more responsibly these days. (Although it was only 2014 that I was still engaging in a lot of self-destructive behaviours, such as drinking too much and driving my boyfriends away with far too much intense emotion, aggression and occasionally some violence).

I thought I'd over-come all of that, and I thought I was on the road to recovery, or outgrowing naive recklessness. 

I started dating my current partner in 2017, and the first 6 months went perfectly. He's such a good guy, and I thought, ""how could this go wrong?!"" and we soon fell head over heels for each other. 

Although in reality, there were very many ways this could go wrong. It was long distance, he was divorced and separated for 3 years (or so he told me) and he had 3 kids in the picture. Me? Young, free and single. 

Coming up to the year mark, my old habits soon started to raise their ugly heads... and occasionally I'd instigate blown out of proportion rows over seemingly endless insecurities, which in turn lead to shame, guilt and rage - and endless cycle of negatives causes and consequences.  

He was just starting to come around to the idea that I was too much for him to handle, even he, with the patience of a saint couldn't cope with my demands & outbursts and he was just getting ready to leave me when I discovered I was pregnant. 

It wasn't a complete surprise as we'd had unprotected sex, but it's something I thought unlikely to happen because I was still getting over the effects of long-term contraception. 

At the particular time of conception, he'd come over to mine to break up with me to my face. I had requested this and his first attempt was over text & long distance, and I felt I deserved more than that. 

He'd come over to break up with me, but soon found himself getting sentimental and he took me to bed. I didn't even instigate that at all, I was very much going to take the high road (for once). I remember when we're in bed, having unprotected sex, the thought of baby did come to mind, and a part of me did entertain the idea of it happening with this guy (despite me still thinking it unlikely in reality). He's since told me that he had partially hoped for the same. 

And so despite our evident problems in the face of long distance, children and a crazy girlfriend (me). We decided to stay together and give family life a go. 

Only problem is.. my old habits are dying hard, and in fact they are now getting worse. 

He's triggered me in a umber of ways that have resulted with me exploding in anger and verbally dressing him down with some of the most horrid things. 

Firstly, he lied about not knowing a girl he had slept with the summer before us. The fact he'd slept with a girl the summer before we got together wasn't an issue for me... But the lies that he ended up telling about it, definitely triggered me. When he first told me the story, he said it was a friend of a friend on a drunken night out and that he never knew her name... I later discovered on Facebook (by happenstance), photos of them together and numerous events they had gone to the year previously. What was the need to lie?? No idea, but that was major trust breach one. 

Secondly, he had about being divorced. I found out that he was still married when I was 4 months pregnant. I found out when I was cleaning his (pig-sty) of a house, and reshuffling his haphazardly strewn post. 

I was absolutely fuming at that one. I'd been dating a married man the whole time, unbeknown to me. It's my personal preference that I would never date a married man to fall in love with, I wouldn't consider him totally available until definitely divorced... I had some insecurities in regards to dating a divorced man as it was, without the added burden of then learning that he never was divorced.  

this pushed me to the limits, there were plenty of rows, a couple of instances of things being chucked at him, and punching him over and punching him. (He's a big guy, I couldn't do any serious harm - but still, outbursts like this aren't fair on anyone). 

If I'd found out he was still married before the pregnancy, I could have walked away from him. Even in early pregnancy, but not nearly 5 months down the line into pregnancy. We still decided to try and make it work. 

Even after that there then came some additional lies from him in regards to his business dealing with his ex (current wife). He'd told me he'd sold his house back to his mortgage lender as we prepared to move in together. He was caught out when I asked to see the correspondence between him and his ex (an unusual action taken because I distrusted him, usually I'm all for privacy & freedom). Lo and behold, he'd outright lied to me, and he'd sold the mortgage to his wife. That triggered me and was another rough patch for us. turns out he had could financial reason to sell it back to her, but still - it's the lies that I find hard to tolerate. 

Still, we pushed on and we have now moved together and now have a child between us. She's 6 weeks old... Only things between me & her dad don't seem to be getting any better. We have days where we are madly in love, and then days where I'm sure we're driving each other madly insane. 

He's got serious issues when it comes down to communication. He's very intelligent, but socially inept. Our communication problems seem to only be increasing, and so is my rage. I don't know how much of this our relationship can survive, it can be toxic, or should I say I can be toxic... and it's not healthy for me, him or the baby. 


we get on about 60% of the time, and we are all loved up. 40% time he's not communicating, mis-communicating or telling lies to cover his back, which makes me very aggressive and hostile. 

My partner is a sensitive and gentle creature. I fear that my callousness and vitriol will end up destroying him. He's worried because he doesn't want our daughter to see these occasional outbursts.. and neither do I. 

I love him, really, and I definitely love her. I need to change. Which would be made a lot easier if he could change the way he communicates (or doesn't) - but that's inherent in his personality and might takes years to over-come also.

He knew I was a handful when when he was courting me - he admired me very much. But I knew that he didn't really know the extent of how much of a handful I can be, I did try to warn him... But he said he could handle it.. they all say they can handle it... but can they? 

Anyway, I've recently been doing some more research into BPD, living with BPD and the effects of your BPD on those around you, most especially you loved ones... and now I think it's about time I got some professional help. 

I'm not interest one iota in medication, but I am considering therapy. I smoke a lot weed and self medicate that way. It doesn't interfere with day to day activities or functioning, it just helps to keep me chill. 

I also have generalised anxiety and I suspect a bit of PSTD... although I'm not half as worried about anxiety as I am the BPD. 

I am worried about what sort of response I would get if I go to the GP and tell them I suspect I have BPD. Will they take my self diagnosis seriously? Will they offer me legitimate therapy? Or can I expect to be on a waiting list for 18 months? 

Does anyone have any experience in approaching (UK) GP's with this issue? Did they help you? Has any of the help actually been helpful? 

Can BPD be overcome? 

Sorry it's long, thanks for reading, if you took the time."
2276,"Hey  i do this more than i would like, its kind of thing where i might find myself in a place where i shouldnt, talking about stuff i got no right to talk about (stupidity). Theres no excuses and i was out of line towards BPDevil and others so i apologise to you BPDevil and everyone here. Please dont anyone feel need to reply, i am a bit embarassed by it. But i am working on it.

2277,"Hey everyone.
I'm new here, and stumbled upon the forum by accident looking for some support.

I've got bad, anxiety and depression. My mental health has been pretty stable for a few years, well, 8 stopped self harming anyway, and hadn't done so for just over four years. I have, however, sort of locked myself away for the last 12 months as my physical health has been really poor, and I've been really Ill. 
Anyway, tonight I found out my partner of five years has been sexting with multiple other women, and well, shall we say doing things via web cam chats...
I'm now full of horrible thoughts. Self worth, and just the wracking depression and sadness that he could actually do that to me.
We've spoke, briefly...and I've told him I don't think I can do this anymore. I cant be with someone 8 have 0 trust for. But on the other hand, I cant be without him for multiple reasons.

This is now making me think all sorts of horrible things, and I am getting the awful urge to self harm.

I don't know what to do. I am honestly lost."
2278,"2 days ago I took an overdose. That's the last thing I remember although I did call an ambulance and the police came and broke my door down and I got taken to hospital. Next day, waited for hours with no-one talking to me except to take my blood pressure. Eventually saw some psych liason people who were lovely but could offer nothing as I was out of their catchment area. Now I don't know what to do. I don't feel better. The GP says I need to join groups and go out more but I don't do people. I avoid people. I've started some therapy but only had 2 sessions and obviously I got worse given what just happened. I've got bpd, depression, anxiety and an eating disorder and I have no idea how to get out of this place. 
I've got one really good friend who I'm way too reliant on and I feel really bad for how much I rely on her. So then I push her away somehow thinking I am protecting her but then get totally panicked that she won't come back."
2279,"I still forget at times that its actually ok to feel. That sometimes its ok to be angry or upset.
Sometimes i over rationalise and say no im a bad person for being angry. So i used to keep it all contained inside.
Ive been so much better these days.
I used to drink so i could actually 'feel' and make sence of it however all these emotions became too painful and i would get overwhelmed,which ended up with me over-dosing.
Ive learned actually i have every reason to be pissed off,its just what i do about it.
Saw my psychologist the other day and told her i was angry in front of the dog despite that he kept wanting pats,then i told her what a terrible person i am for having my outburst. 
Oops i got told off. I had a couple of things that pissed me off the other day,etc. 
Shes like yeh id be pissed off too.
I'm feeling a bit numb and feel like I need to get it out. 
I really need a good cry my subconscious is rationalising,no. You're ok.
My dads been gone now 10 years in a couple of days and it still hurts like its yesterday,
I might go and visit his grave tomorrow. I dont normally but might be nice to go and talk to him"
2280,"I was just diagnosed on Friday February 22. My first reaction was overwhelming joy. It explained so much of my life. I had two beautiful days of the best mood and activities that I have had in years. Today was going so well, and then I just crashed. But because of the diagnosis I was comfortable enough to look at my husband and say, ""I'm crashing, I'm going to take a bath."" without feeling guilty or like I was running away. And his response was very different than before as well, before he would be asking if I was ok, if I was upset, did he do anything, ect. Now he appears to be more confident that this is not a big deal, and it doesn't reflect on him. He simply said, ok, enjoy. I'm trying to get into a DBT group therapy, but space is limited and I'm afraid that I won't get in. As relieved as I am to know what is going on in my head, I want to be able to control it."
2281,"I hope it’s okay that I continue to post here even without a BPD diagnosis, I just need some support for this.

I feel like I’m being abandoned and my anxiety is getting worse. Every passing day drives me a little closer to doing something drastic, like self harm. My chest hurts and I have this horrible sense of dread and I’m so desperate for it to go away. I have been trying not to rely on smoking weed. 

Is there anything that helps you calm down in the moment if you have ever felt like this?"
2282,"I look after, or try to  a 20 year old boy with BPD. It’s a long story but I effectively act as a mother figure. It is very frustrating. He is basically homeless and has just lost his most recent emergency accommodation because he had weed in his room. He had gone through 7 accommodations in the last 10 months, either because of weed or because of an incredibly toxic relationship with a girl with the same diagnosis. This relationship has lost him countless accommodations, led to two suicide attempts, numerous hospital visits because of self harm and countless arrests. Yet he still sees her and seems unable to connect what he does with the consequences, or control his impulsive behaviour at all. Any insights, hope or practical suggestions appreciated! Because of this girl and his cannabis addiction he is homeless, under police investigation, and has a fractured spine and heel following a jump from a third floor window."

Hi .my partner of 2 and a half years left me a week ago because my moods and attacks and pushing him away have left him broken and he cant take anymore. Hes adamant theres no chance then at times he doesn't seem sure, this man has pushed me into employment into bettering myself he is a good good man. He says he loves me but I clearly can't change. I really believe I could treat him better but hes gone... he just came to collect his stuff and for about an hour he just held me so tight as I cried and he stroked my hair . Then he got horny and I pushed him off he apologised said it wasn't fair and left. 

Why when he said it's over am I still clinging on he started by saying let's see how it goes but then I pushed and pressured and pushed and hes got more and more sure hendoesbt want me . He said I need time to sort my head out its like hes seeing if I can and may come back? I'm so confused the pain is unreal I haven't eaten today I feel constantly sick I just want my bear back

I am in a real state I dont know what to do Its now half term and I have to look after my 7 year old son and try and not let him see how broken I am which seems impossible I just want to lay in my bed and cry and sleep and never wake up"
2284,"I don't want to sound callous, I really want some insight into this.  I don't have BPD.  My partner's ex wife does.  She left him for a narcissist FBI agent and I met my partner a year later.  For the first 3 years of our relationship, she attacked us.  At the end if the onslaught, I'd lost my job, my home, my friends, my autonomy...for a boyfriend!  We are still together.  At some point she had taken enough to demonstrate she had total control and she mostly left us alone.  I rebuilt, have a great job, have a few close friends.

She lost her job as a police officer and her new marriage is in turbulence.  And here is my question...finally...

Suddenly she is coming back around.  Her texts are kind.  She goes out if her way to contact my partner.  She sends pictures and fond messages to him.  I am fearful that she is buttering him up for something, that maybe her marriage is in the rocks and she has her eyes on a new supply, that she is so nuts that she sees I'm doing well and wants to interject herself...I have NO IDEA what is going on!  This woman is insane.  She can manipulate her way into anything.  I have little doubt that if she truly wanted my partner back, she would find a way to make him forget all the terrible things I had to pull him out of as he recovered from her abuses. 
So why would a person suffering from BPD come back?  From everything I read, once a person with BPD is done, they are done for good.  How do I frame my thoughts and behavior on this?  I am so full of distrust that this is bothering me even more than her predictable vindictiveness."
2285,"I want to clarify that I do not have a diagnosis for BPD, only depression and acute anxiety. I strongly suspect I may have BPD, but as I am not a professional I do not know for sure. I’m currently going back to therapy I’m just waiting until the intake appointment. All I can say is that I strongly identify with many BPD traits, mainly fear of abandonment and doing anything to avoid it, black and white thinking (and “splitting”), impulsiveness, self harm urges, suicidal ideation, childhood neglect, no sense of self and identity, fear of people. I don’t remember if all of this is included within BPD but regardless these are some of the things I’ve dealt with for years.

My mental health has led my relationship to doom. I’ve hurt and left and gave up so many times. I haven’t cheated but I’ve slept with others, jumping from one person to the next to find a sense of security. He never left even when he said I tore him down emotionally and left him feeling completely unlike himself. Even when I broke up with him, which happened several times, he could not find it in his heart to stop talking to me. I truly do love him and he deserves all of the love and devotion he has given me tenfold. I feel broken inside and he doesn’t understand it but I’m getting help.

Recently I’ve noticed hints of rage episodes. It starts off as a panic attack, crying and elevated heart rate, labored breathing, then adrenaline kicks in. Last time, I threw things, books at the wall, tore things down from the wall, ripped things. I felt so destructive. It only lasted maybe 20 minutes or less, but I felt out of control. I am not an angry person I normally stuff all the emotions down. But lately I feel like I’m exploding. Like I can’t stuff it down anymore.

It was triggered by my fear of abandonment, as my relationship is on its last legs and my boyfriend is getting tired of trying. This had only happened to me once in the past, caused by the same feeling. I feel like a walking contradiction because I don’t want him to abandon me but I’ve abandoned him so many times. I resented him and I’ve left him so often and convinced myself he was horrible and hated him. But I’m so irrational with my thoughts sometimes and I don’t know how to regulate certain emotions. I’ve found it so hard to see him in a shade of gray. He’s either my angel or my enemy and it confuses and hurts him so much.

What has helped you?
Are you on meds, if so how have they affected you?
Are you only going to therapy?
What are your coping mechanisms?

Not to be dramatic, sometimes every breath feels like pain."
2286,So things have improved in the sense I'm not constantly feeling suicidal and my self harming has become way less frequent but its like I still feel up and down. I still have suicidal thoughts and I am scared to say that things are a bit better incase I stop getting help. I feel it's stupid that I feel this way but I am getting annoyed with myself because I don't want to feel like this as I feel its similar to attention seeking behaviour even though I don't tell anyone that I have got worse.
2287,"I'm on a list for it, all I know is that there is 1-1 therapy and group therapy involved which I'm dreading 

and what other therapies besides CBT and DBT are there that can help with BPD ?"
2288,"Hey, I’m new to the forum and lately I’ve been having relationship issues. I’m in the longest relationship I’ve ever been in. I’m 31 and I’ve almost hit the 19 month mark with this one. Before my longest relationship lasted only 5 months. I just find myself bored all the time. Constant thoughts of leaving, etc. The other day we got into a bit of an argument, and now I just can’t see him as the same person. I hate him. Hate him for the things he did and said. Hate that he walked out and left for an hour. I feel betrayed and haven’t been able to see him as the same person since. I don’t want him to touch me, I don’t want to talk to him. It feels like what he did is I’m forgiveable and I’ve been considering leaving over this. I literally feel no love for him anymore. I just feel betrayed and angry. And the fight was 5 days ago. What do I do?"

I joined because I'm sick of over thinking and ruminating and feeling angry. I'm 40 now and I've had a lifetime of crap that a lot of people would go insane over. 

My rage landed me in Prison when I was 18 and even though that was 20 years ago I still feel angry. 

Does anyone else feel like this?"
2291,"Hi, 

My boyfriend has a diagnosis of bpd, and in the past this has happened and sadly it's repeating. He has become very paranoid, thinking random strangers on the street are talking about him, all his neighbours want him out, every one hates him. But most distressingly, he becomes convinced I've cheated and wil question me intensely and if I don't answer he'll take that as an admission and he's sooo convinced he can even become spiteful because he thinks I've cheated. 

Disclaimer: I have always remained faithful throughout the entire relationship. 

I just don't know how to handle his paranoia it's too much, I've left his alone to get space."
2292,Well day 3 of starting trazodone and I feel a lot calmer within myself . I also had the best sleep ever last nite which is a bonus for me as I suffer with insomnia . I’m told trazodone can take up to 6 wks for full effects so I’m hoping I can only start to get better and just maybe this is the right tablet for me . 7 yrs ago was diagnosed with bipolar last yr my psychiatrist left and I was given a new one he now states I havnt got bipolar and in fact  I have EUPD . I’ve start a group therapy 25th feb which I’m so nervous about as I really don’t get along In groups but I am going to try one session see how I get on . It’s called the Bloom program what I’m going to be doing will let people know how I get along have a nice day people
2293,"Hi so to start my story I have been with my girlfriend for over 6+ years and we have been living together for 4 years we are both in mid 20's and about a year after we moved in together my gf got BPD she went through all the dbt groups and she said it helped her abit over the course of 4 years she has been on tablets on and off and changing tablets because they made her feel unwell. Things can be great at times and things can be completely terrible. Over the course of 6 years I have been hit multiple times in the face scrabbed t-shirts ripped and slapped black eye etc I have never went and hit her back the most I would do is defend my self by pushing her away. I sit there feeling intense anger after been hit knowing I CNT do nothing, after we used to fight she would run out the door and text me or ring me and tell me she was gunna kill herself because of me which literally sends me overboard as I don't know where she is and + she is blaming me and to be honest the arguments are over something's that are so small I physically can not understand why she is so angry its like a switch. So over the course of the years I have been trying to put up with this hoping it will get better I work full time shift work so I can't always be there. She used to get annoyed at me for working late even tho I couldn't help it . I literally feel like I am walking in eggshells and to be honest I think it is starting to affect me mentally. 

So basically last night we were both sitting there and I said something that she took wrong very personal I said do u know how to do it? And she said I was taking away from her as a person and I don't support her she proceeded to get more angry and starts txtn her friends to tell her she was in the right. That was OK this went on for 10 mins and then we both were arguing she came up into my room and started scrabbling and hitting me saying why are you doing this to me ? I wasn't doing nothing she went into my room and wrecked my drawers I got really fed up and went to her  room and threw clothes ( childish I know) she proceeded to get her phone and try to make a video about me saying look what I have to put up with and she is saying I hit her in the video( is she tryyna ruin me) so I grabbed the phone of her and then she  got huz phone decided to try ring the police on me for nothing ""s I was like wtf. We scuffled abit and she ran out of the house 30 mins later she comes back with her mum and gets her stuff and leaves. 

Like I'm sitting here going :/ wtf just happened and no I'm not  a angel either I have said stuff etc but I have not hit her or anything like that . stuff that she has said to me has stuck in my head like my parents are dead and she told me to go and die and go in the grave with your oarents. She make me feel worthless and uneasy as I don't know what to do. 
 
This is a cycle which we are bound to go threw every month but its making me feel unwell well atleast I think it is its just really hard and I'm sick of waiting to hear I have said something out of turn. I listen to her a lot and try to help her with her life but she is so angry I can feel it of her its always like whatever I do its not good enough.. She is also trying to make out that I'm mentally unwell I was fine before I got into this relationship and since the relationship about 6 months ago i started tablets for depression but this may be due to the stress im experienceing in the relationship She changes so quick that I don't even regonise the girl I met at the start 

I just need a bit if help if anyone has went threw the same thing and what is the best option for me because I feel so so down I don't know what to do  thanks"
2294,"Hi there,

I have been with my girlfriend for 4 months, and of late there have been a couple of occasions whereby we may have a little disagreement about something which I perceive as small, and she makes it much bigger than it really is. Often she may swing from being quite chirpy to low, and cries quickly. It seems quite dramatic and I am finding it quite emotionally tiring to support her emotional neediness.

My girlfriend said that she has been diagnosed with BPD in the past, but that it no longer impacts her life. She has been through Childhood Sexual Abuse, rejection from her Mother, has taken drugs, self-harmed, attempted suicide and been in a same-sex relationship. So she's had a very turbulent, traumatic life. 

I feel she has put me on a platform a little bit, using words like ""perfect"" and ""my lobster"" which feels like pressure. 

I'm wondering if she fears abandonment as well, keen for me to possible ask her to marry me when I feel it is still early in our relationship.

Any thoughts or feedback would be appreciated at this time. Thanks :-)"
2295,"Hey everyone

I feel so silly for this post but I need some advice. I suffer with BPD and I used to have very rigid black and white thinking. With therapy, I've gotten better at this over time. I used to have almost OCD about lying and even if someone told me a white lie they'd be a complete liar and the relationship doomed. I told my current partner this and have told him that I dont get why people lie for no reason and that I don't like lies of omission. However, this morning I saw a picture of us tagged and I hated how I looked (I go through spells of low confidence...surprise although it's been getting better). I edited the picture of my face slightly before I sent it to him as, it's a pretty funny pic. He commented back that it looks like I have lip fillers in the pic. I was obviosuly embarassed so I just replied 'I did for the occassion x' and now i'm beside myself. He hasn't replied and is in work. I feel like a complete liar; I feel like I've manipulated him in some way and like I've ruined the relationship. I'm completely catastrophizing and I don't know what to do. I've been able to rationalise thoughts very well recently but the shame and embarssment of this has really gotten to me. I don't even know if this is a lie or even if it's a big deal. I just dont know. I don't wanna admit to it because it's embarassing and part of me hopes he doesn't raise it again. Is this is a lie if he hasn't actually asked me? Getting myself into such a tangle.

2296,My partner has BPD and has not started any treatment yet. This explains a lot about him and our relationship.

How do I cope with this.. can anyone help? Please?

2299,"Hi. This will be a long one I think, so let me thank you in advance of you even get through it.

I met a guy and fell head over heels immediately. We drove in fast, but there was an issue where he recently got out of a relationship with a cheating ex girlfriend he still lived with.

We were dating for like a month. He was spending the nights from time to time, I would tell him personal stuff, etc..

Anyways, he went home over Christmas and I felt as though he was getting distant when I messaged him. It turns out he got back with his ex during that time.

I felt absolutely crushed. I hated myself. I had a splitting episode, got mad at him etc...

Now, fast forward and we're back in university. We're in the same class. Seeing him is like a knife in the throat every three days of the week.

I miss him. I care about him. I want to talk to him.

But he doesn't want to talk to me. He is ignoring my existence. He specifically said we shouldn't talk because of ""the nature of our relationship"".

Anyways, fast forward and we matched on tinder. I messaged him on there and asked if it was a mistake. The next day he unmatched me without answering.

I blocked him on everything. Then unblocked him because I want to talk to him so badly, but now he had me blocked and I really got upset. I feel like I want to hurt myself. I ruin everything for myself and I don't know how to fix it. I feel abandoned every time I see him and it makes my heart ache. He just dropped me like I was nothing and I can't do that to him and I hate myself for it. 

Why am I like this? I think about it on a daily basis. Almost obsessively. I want closure. I want to understand but he won't even look at me in class. What did I do? I hate hate hate my inability to have any romantic relationships. 

Anyways, please give me advice. I feel so lost."
2300,"I've been in and out of friendship groups, gone through a number of 'best' and close friends, just to end up alone over and over and over again

Every friendship starts out great, then as soon as I get too comfortable and start opening up, my BPD starts to show, I get easily triggered and paranoid about them abandoning me or not liking me anymore, end up taking it out on them, then they get fed up and my nightmares become a reality

It's a constant cycle, and it's like I've accepted that I shouldn't have any close or meaningful friendships 

Few did know and try to understand my issues, but I don't want to use it as an excuse

I'd be lucky to have a friendship that lasts over a year nowadays

Just so tired of even trying"
2301,"I thought I would make a thread about my experience getting diagnosed with??? 

I don’t intend to talk about any specifics for personal reasons and it would ruin your chances of a accurate diagnosis for yourself. 

So I had my weekly appointment with my therapist yesterday. I asked if we can do something to provide some labels to my condition. She said she has asked me in the past to take this test. I don’t remember that at all. When my depression gets bad I tend to lose my memory so it’s entirely possible we have talked about testing in the past. 

So today after work I’m gonna go back to see her and take a test. This test is supposed to take an hour to an 1 1/2 hours for me to complete. We will go over my results during my next appointment on Valentine’s Day (ya me. I have a date on Valentine’s Day) 🙃

I read that lots of people question if they have some condition they are concerned about. This thread is about the process for how I found out. 

Happy Friday!"
2302,"hey peeps so spoke to the doctor of the home treatment team and he wants to put me on lithium as an additonal medication, so my question is have anyone of you had any experience with this med?"
2303,"Hi everyone, 

before I start telling my partner's story I would to say that I'm not here to shame him and diagnose him. I'm just looking for answers and possibly a way to help him. 

I've always had a great interest in people and people's behavior. I feel like this interest has helped develop my empathy towards people and has also helped me understand more of their emotional responses. I've had two severe cases of mental illness in my family and in both cases I was the first one to notice when something was going wrong. One of the cases was my father and it got so bad that at some point he threatened me and my mom with a knife. My mom was shocked by his reaction and almost froze in fear. I had sensed that something wasn't completely alright with my father a couple of years prior to this episode and I managed to stay calm and calm him down as well. After this episode I've further increased my alertness when dealing with people that I get to interact with everyday. 

After this episode, me and my mom managed to create a new life for ourselves and it's been going ok. I've been going to Uni and I had two relationships that unfortunately ended but in friendly terms. 

Now I'm in my third relationship with this guy, who is also the main topic of this thread. Let's call him Dave. So Dave and I met a year ago and we fell in love pretty quickly. He had just finished his PhD and had already bought a really expensive ticket to go back home in 4 months. When we first started dating he didn't tell me that he was supposed to leave the country in 4 months. 

So we went on a few dates and had fun. There was chemistry and attraction so we kept meeting up. I really liked him but whenever we met I always felt like he was very controlled in his behavior, like he couldn't relax completely and be himself. 
After two weeks of dating he invited me to his birthday party and when I arrived he was so drunk he couldn't even recognize me at first. I was a bit put off but when I saw him so vulnerable I couldn't just turn my back on him and leave. I spent some time with him and he got really emotional to the point of crying. Even though I didn't like seeing him so drunk I did appreciate the fact that he was loosening up and talking more about his feelings and family. 

The week after his birthday he asked me to be his girlfriend without telling me that he was still supposed to leave the country in 3 months. I accepted because I really liked him and I started feeling closer to him. 

After a few weeks of our relationship he finally confessed that he had this ticket and was supposed to leave. He told me that he had changed his mind on leaving because of me and was ready to stay with me. At first I could understand why he didn't have the courage to tell me about his previous plans of leaving but the big red flag was that all of his friends didn't know either. Dave told me that he had intended to leave without really telling his friends that he was leaving for good. 

Anyway, we kept going on with our lives and our relationship and everything seemed to be going well. We love each other a lot and our feelings and attachment were almost too intense for me. Dave starts looking for a job but things didn't really go that well at first. He got offered a few jobs abroad but got no offers in the country we're currently living in. Whenever he got an offer for a job abroad he would cry for two hours straight because he wouldn't want to leave me. I would try to comfort him telling him that we could try long distance for a year or two and I could possibly join him after that but he would never accept that option. That was the first time that my alarm bell started ringing just like they had rung before with my father. I was sometimes shocked to see an adult cry for two hours straight because of a job offer. Nevertheless I always tried to be supportive and reassuring. 

So time passes by and Dave manages to find a job in the city we live in while turning down 5 offers for jobs abroad. We decide to move in because we feel like we really love each other and things seem to go really well. 

The thing that I did start to notice was that whenever he had a job offer abroad he act almost desperate fearing that he would lose me. I never threatened to break up with him because of distance so I never understood this deep-rooted fear. Anyway, we managed to resist through 5 offers and 5 consequent meltdowns. 
 
Everything seems to be going well now that we're living together and that he has a stable job. Now that everything seems to be settling down he seems to be acting up more. But now that we don't have external threats like ""job offers abroad"" he seems to be acting up against me. Whenever I say something or do something that he doesn't like he just shuts me out of his life for a few hours or a few days. Once he stopped talking to me for a day because I had tickled him for too long. In that occasion he got so mad that he even slept on the couch. Whenever he gets mad at me for something so small I immediately tell him that I'm sorry and that I didn't mean to hurt him but he can never accept my apology. Sometimes I even cried out of frustration but he would never come near me and try to console me. Whenever he acts that way I feel so awkward around him and so hurt. He makes me feel like the worst person in the world. 

Now that his job has started to be more stressful he's been acting up even more frequently and the emotional shutdown towards me has started to increase from a few hours to a few days. He's been avoiding his friends and he hasn't been in touch with his family lately. It's almost like he's been trying to isolate himself from everyone. 

A few days ago I found out that he was texting a girl back in his home country. When I tried talking calmly about this I almost got no response. He did apologize but it almost seemed a robotic response and not a genuine one. 

I've been talking about this with a friend who happens to be a psychology student and he told me that Dave might have quiet BPD. Now, I don't want a specific diagnosis but I do want some answers and Dave doesn't seem willing or capable of giving me such answers. 

The more I think about his behavior the more I get worried about his well-being and our relationship. He confessed to me that during his previous relationship, which lasted three years, he had a very hard time connecting with his partner and they often had fights. He even confessed that her feelings weren't as important to him. The most puzzling thing was the way he left her. They were together 3 years and engaged to be married. He didn't call her or text her to let her know that he wanted to break up. He just blocked her number and all of her accounts on social media. 

I don't even know what to say at this point. I'm just lost for words."
2304,"I have known this man near to where I live and his life is constantly dramatic

He has BPD, diabetes, struggles with being gay and also has a job which he has just been clinging onto.

The other major problem in recent weeks is almost every single day he is experiencing hypos through not eating or eating cakes etc before he comes out.

He says he is suicidal one day and the next day he says he is fine - he is still managing at the moment to do his job..

he lives alone but constantly needs to ring people - it was me and two other men - I could not cope with the hypos and the paramedics every time - one other has said he could not deal with it but only seeing him occasionally now and the other does it because he is religious and feels its his duty

Am just asking here because is it normal for someone with BPD to constantly be deriding others in their lives and yet need them desperately at the same time.

To me it seems he could contain his hypos and it has been deliberate to get attention and I have no idea as to his true state of mind - I known a lot people over the years with different difficulties but  never known anyone that has such disregard for their existence yet allow others to experience the pain of seeing him drift in and out of conscience on hypos - its frightening to see - the paramedics have been out to him probably over ten times in last month - its getting stupid.

There is a plan in place with him visiting GP twice a week but he has not been compliant - his mental health is all over the place -yet he still completes his work but he seems to not be able or its a deliberate ploy for attention with the hypos..

I can't cope with it anymore - and another friend of mine is beginning to go under dealing with this all the time also.

I am posting in this forum as he has BPD and would anyone here who has this diagnose could you relate to him almost deliberately disregarding looking after his diabetes as a ploy to be noticed..


I can't understand any of it - its been frightening and anxiety provoking and unbelievably stressful - I have cut contact not because of his mental state but because he rushes out door every morning often to go to a coffee shop and then has a hypo. 

Has anyone else with BPD done anything akin to this - I am unsure whether this behaviour is down to who he is as a person or whether it can be better explained by a symptom of his mental health diagnosis

I have no idea how to help or even understand anymore"
2305,"This weekend i fear i have managed to fuck my one chance of being happy, i spent the last 7 years dealing with a trauma from my childhood and surrounded myself with the wrong kind of people, i fell into a world of drugs and self hatred. A year and a half ago i finished my therapy and started to volunteers in the hospital, joined a gym and started to do really well. A few months back i then met a girl and for the first time in my life i was content and at peace, she made me better but over the weekend she asked me to go to her friends for drinks, social situations are still really hard for me, i have always struggle with the feelings of being judged or not being worthy so i asked her if i could leave it but she assured me it would be fine so i went, i drank to much and started to feel paranoid and completely lost my head, i then proceeded to try to buy drugs in a house full of good people who are completely against it so was asked to leave, at this point i became abusive and lashed out at her best friends boyfriend and left. I have not been blocked off everything and asked to leave her alone. i have never felt as empty as i do now. This was my one chance at being happy with somebody who tried to understand me and whom i could truly just be myself with and i have fucked it, how to you fix something that you have been told is unforgivable i just want off this roller coaster of a ride i call my life. nothing ever just works for me"
2306,"My partner struggles to understand my disorder and up until recently I thought I was doing pretty well, ans always I relapse and have another episode, to which I can’t explain why or how it was triggered. I struggle speaking about it openly face sometimes and felt the need to just write it down and try to make sense of it all and I have a limited number of people I can tell or talk to...I sent the below description which is the only way I could try to explain where I’m at right now... how does everyone else explain how they feel, how they see the world? What they expect? And self awareness, how aware is everyone else of their symptoms? 

I know that I see the world as an evil dark place and I struggle to understand why everyone else doesn’t think like me, why people don’t conform to my unrealistic expectations of the world and people.  I know that because I expect people to fail me or hurt me, I’m always looking out for it so don’t enjoy life or people for who and what they are, I analyse every single thing that happens to try and find justification as to why people do what they do as I don’t understand. 

It’s like a coping mechanism but instead of protecting and shielding me it is actually what is hurting and damaging me further. The sad thing is I know all of this... But yet it’s so hard wired into my head that as soon as I sense any form of abandonment or any form of change this horrible and destructive “defence system” just comes out and shows it’s ugly self and afterwards all I feel is shame, anger, self pity and worthlessness. I am desperate to think normally, I’d love it more than anything in the world. I don’t feel strong, I feel like a nervous wreck most of the time. I expect history to repeat itself, replay it in my head and go in search of it to justify the need for my defensiveness and pattern of thinking. I am damaging myself further... I want to change I am more than aware of all of these things! I need constant validation, and constant reassurance that’s why when a partner does not constantly need those things and can happily be in their own company not needing constant affection like I do instead of knowing it’s because they’re not like me and telling myself that it doesn’t mean they don’t love me anymore I just assume it’s because they don’t feel as much love for me as I feel for them. It’s so unhealthy and it makes me feel so unhappy. I know it needs to change and I’ve been willing to change for so long and wanting to, it’s finding how I do it? What support do I need? What therapy do I need? What medication do I need if any? 

Living like this is extremely lonely, painful and also terrifying, imagine living every day scared of people, waking up to see no beauty in the world bur seeing evil and danger instead. Being more aware of your surroundings than you need to be, the constant worry. It’s horrid and I swear to god wouldn’t wish it on anyone, words and actions of people cause what feel like huge injuries to me inside. I am so easy to break and fracture. It’s like having brittle bones but with my emotions. What makes it worse is being so high functioning and knowing that I don’t work correctly. But that doesn’t change how I view the world it just means I know that sadly I don’t get to see it for all the wonders it has all the beauty in it and people in it. I don’t get to trust like I so desperately want to. I just hope you’ll support me in trying to fix it or at least make it better. I don’t want to be this way and my real self hides under this shield when really it isn’t shielding me from anything instead it stops me from living xx"

2308,Newly diagnosed BPD in my ate 60's  need help
2309,"Hi

I am 46 and was diagnosed with BPD a year ago although I've had clear symptoms since I was a child. I was lucky enough to  get on a full DBT programme last year and I am half way through the 12 month prog.

I find it a great course and I get on very well with my 1-2-1 therapist. I was making progress but I feel like I'm slipping again. I feel weak, pathetic, unable to cope with the most basic of issues and completely inadequate.

I have a long term partner who does try to understand but really hasn't a clue about BPD so thinks I'm over-reacting etc. I get that it must look like that but after 25 years she should know the real me by now.

I work full-time and I'm struggling to stick with. Because I feel so stupid and weak I feel I can't cope. I know there are some DBT skills to use in there but they're just not hitting the spot.

Not sure what I want from this post - I just needed to get something 'out there'.

I'm trying desperately not to give into the urge to self harm - I haven't done it since November and I don't want to disappoint myself or my therapist.

I so want to give up"
2310,"New to here so hello! Basically looking for some opinions.. Part of my BPD is a lot of self harm, sometimes I can go weeks without it but often what makes me do it is more a ""duty"" to do it rather than an urge if that makes sense? I look at the part of my body where I usually self harm and see them healing up and feel that I need to self harm again.. Just wondering if this matches anyone else's self harm patterns or if I'm a total weirdo haha"
2311,"Sometimes I feel a sudden wave of pain in my head. It sneaks up on me and gets painful fast. So much pain that I’ll scream out loud as an uncontrollable reaction to the pain. It always happens in private, when I’m home or driving. I’m very careful to not let this happen in public. Although little screams have leaked out in places when I feel alone but I’m really not. For example I’ve done it in my office. I feel like I’m alone because I can’t see anyone but they would be able to hear me. It’s only happened a few times at work. I don’t think anyone heard me."

I honestly feel like it's never going to get better, feel like I'm just existing in such a empty and horrible life. Trying to stay positive seems so difficult right now. On top of everything my new care co ordinator is useless and was talking about discharging me from the services soon which I feel is wrong as I'm no where near okay to cope without psychotherapy or anything else. 
Really feel like this is never going to end."
2314,"Hi,

It’s always been my coping device.

Binge sex, binge shopping, binge eating, binge drinking.

Thankfully I’ve managed to get a handle on the first, but not so much the other three.

Tonight I’ve broken two weeks of no alcohol. This was preceding a $1,000 shopping spree yesterday (thankfully for work, but it scratched that itch and I’ve done it with my own money in the past).

It’s manic and reactionary, and it soothes my anxiety in a way that nothing else can.

But I recognize it’s unhealthy.

Does anyone know why this seems to be prevalent with this disorder? If I can understand the why, maybe I can get control of it."

2317,"Sometimes I wonder if the fear of being 'crazy' is driving me crazy lol!

Sometimes I think I broke because of my last year & a 1/2 intense and difficult relationship, at the same time as trying to finish over 4 years of a heavy course load for a new career, and being still under the same roof as the person I've been trying to negotiate separation/divorce from for over 3 years.

On the other hand I've had symptoms or behaviors of everything I've recently read about BPD at some point in my life. 

One thing I'm wondering is if Effexor is a safe medication for BPD. I've been on it for years, but it seems to do nothing anymore, even though the dose has gradually been increased.

My GP has referred me to a psychiatrist for diagnosis, but I've been told it can be around 6 months.  Without diagnosis I can't try for admittance to programs covered by OHIP.  But I also worry:

Does anyone know - can a BPD diagnosis give my x leverage for custody of our son???  He's not a bad guy, I'm not worried about my son not being looked after, but I want joint custody, split living arrangements if I can afford a place near his school.  As long as I can get stabilized.  Whatever it takes.

I've tried to get in touch with a program offered through college for online psychotherapy visits, called a lot, left a couple messages, emailed, it's been a week.  I talked to a nice intake lady at a private office, but the cost of regular therapy out of pocket is frightening.  I'm just finishing school, and the way I'm currently functioning I don't dare try to interview for a job yet.

I feel like I've been holding on by a thread for a long time, getting worse over the last year of increasing pressures.  After reading up on personality disorders, I suspect my last boyfriend may have narcissistic PD; the intensity of our relationship was beyond anything I have previously experienced, mostly bliss for the 1st half, pure powder keg for the 2nd half.  I had my worst panic attack ever, became verbally abusive like never before, wanted to  kill myself.  I've plunged headlong into the bdsm lifestyle for the last couple years. I want to cut down on drinking but there's so much pain, terror, shame and dread always lying in wait, and I don't know how to handle it.

I don't know if posting on a forum will help but I don't know what else to do right now, it's better than other things I might do!

Thanks to those who wrote on the Leave a message for someone who is struggling thread, it made me cry in mostly a happy way lol!"
2318,"Hi there ,I have just been discharged from crisis team and now have to wait for an appointment which can be up to April, I don't think I can last that long I'm really trying to be positive but these bad thoughts ke"
2319,"Sorry. I don't know what I was trying to say, but it ended up being a ridiculously long post that I want my therapist to read so hopefully I can convince her I'm in a lot more pain than anyone understands. I need to write a lot more but Im exhausted from thinking about this and I need to move on. She is doing a fine job. I feel I need more care than she is able to provide. I have been trying to get the mental health system to look at me since August 2018. With every new medical professional I meet, I feel like I need to grab them by the shoulders and shake them vigorously screaming ""This is not enough help!!! I am in significantly more pain than you see."" My first appointment with a psychiatrist is in April. I guess I just wait here on pins and needles waiting to be underwhelmed again.

HI All, I've just read about BPD for the first time a few days ago. Reading the criteria to have BPD made me feel ""understood"". The first memory I remember as a child is really 1000 memories that are all the same; me staring at my feet patiently waiting for my parents to stop fighting. I'm pretty sure I got this from my mom. I think she has BPD and I'm sure she (unwillingly) taught it to me. 

My mother cannot handle any amount of stress from me. Most of my childhood stress came from her but she seems to remember being a perfect parent. My dad couldn't handle it either. He drank until he blacked out. Almost every single day. In my 30's my mom thought it was a good time to explain to me the entire story of how I was an ""accident"". I blocked that story out. I honestly don't remember it. But it was kinda nice to confirm what I had always wondered. 

My parents are complete opposites. It was impossible to be a good kid. I have personality traits my dad loved and my mom tried to change. And also the other way around, things my mom was proud of me, my dad needed to change. its an interesting feeling to feel proud and disappointed all at the same time. I couldn't win.

When it came to education, my mom required perfection. That was not an exaggeration. I went to a private school that included full day junior kindergarten. My mom was convinced that she would teach me to read before I started school. Every night before bedtime was a very stressful time of day. She would force a 3 year old to read a book aloud before I was aloud to sleep. I would refuse to read the book, she would fight with me and eventually give up. I went to sleep every night stressed. I hated school before I ever set foot in the building for my first time. I brought home homework maybe 3 times in my life. If I brought schoolwork home, she would watch me do it and then she would design a lesson that took the rest of the night to do. Her goal was to spend the entire night making me study. I had to be perfect. I never brought home schoolwork again. The private school I went to had high education standards. We started writing exams in grade 4, exams came twice a year, midterms and finals. Exactly one month before exams started, I was sent to my room to study. The only breaks I was aloud to have was to eat meals, and to sleep. A ten year old boy was sent to his room the moment I got home from school to study, I was aloud to come out for dinner. I was not aloud to go to sleep early. Weekends were especially shitty because I had to study quietly in my room until bedtime. All I did was stare at the ceiling and watch the kids (I never met any of them) on the street play through my bedroom window. This went on until I moved in with my dad in grade 7. I view those three years like I spent 1/6th of that time in solitary confinement. During the summer vacation she would only do fun things with me if I completed workbooks she bought for me. I would refuse to do the schoolwork, therefore we never did anything fun. Because of her, I hated school so much. 

My mom always told me she was a straight A student. I could barely pass the grades. I felt like shit a lot. I'm not saying this to be mean but as I got older I realized that my mom really isn't that intelligent. There is no way she was a straight A student.

Because of her I chose a college program that was (too) challenging for me. With three months left to graduation, I dropped out due to medical concerns. I was fainting for no reason I could find. As a result my doctor took away my drivers licence for safety reasons. My mom was significantly more concerned about when I was going back to school than my physical/mental health. She made anyone who was afraid of her call me and tell me to go back to school immediately. I didn't speak to her again for 12 years.

As a child I very much struggled in personal relationships. The other kids tolerated me. They made no effort to be around me. Sometimes I would force another kid to play with me because I couldn't figure out another way to have a friend. My dad would yell at me for bothering the other kids. My mom only cared about education. At about 6 or 7 years old I decided to block the world out, trust no one, talk to no one. It was the only way I could think of to stop getting in shit from my dad.

I've spent a lifetime trying to get the people around me to laugh so they will want to talk to me again. To recap, I feel like death inside but I need to make sure the world smiles before me so people will talk to me. People don't engage me for reasons like I constantly have an emotionless look on my face. Feeling and expressing nothing is better than pain. I try so hard to look monotone to avoid the constant ""What's wrong???"" from the people around me. Lets be honest, they don't really want to know what the problem is. They just want to feel good about themselves for asking.

I don't trust any of my moms family. They all know how much pain I felt was from her. They all did nothing to solve anything. They would tell me my mom is a difficult person when she wasn't around. When she was around they would flip flop. Now the problem was actually me and she was perfect. They were afraid of her. They weren't afraid of me. Now they don't know me at all. I'm good with that.

My dad lost all his relatives before I was a teenager. I didn't really know them. He did marry a woman who had two kids of her own. My dads wife would organize family dinners while I was at work. I worked every Sunday. It was a guaranteed shit for me. I used to race home from work so I could be apart of something family orientated. More times than I could count I would be pulling in the driveway while my brother and sister (older and not living at home) were pulling out. They wouldn't stop and talk to me. Just wave at me through a rolled up car window. My dads wife would become instantly angry/frustrated with me if I ever suggested to have a family meal while I was available. I don't think she tried to exclude me. She just didn't care if I was there and she wanted Sunday family dinners with her children. I honestly know what my dad thought about that. He needed his wife more than he needed me. He was probably too drunk to notice.

Both my parents love me. I never disputed that. Love, and loving actions are two different things.

Long story short, I have struggled my entire life with friends/family/partners. Many times in my life I have found myself with no one willing to talk to me. I have a good job. I have enough money to buy the things I want. What I don't have is anyone who wants to talk to me. I would trade everything to have someone in my life I can trust."
2320,"Is any one from or around Bedford, I'd so do you know of any good places to go for extra support"
2321,"First of all i'm a 22 year old male. For a while now I've suspected that i could have borderline personality disorder (BPD). I struggle with anxiety/social anxiety and find it hard to get through each day. I dropped out of school due to the anxiety and basically cut contact with all my friends from high school out of embarrassment. I dropped out when i was 16. I have always been a moody kid and had a lot of temper tantrums as a kid. 

I also struggled with extreme anger issues when i was a teenager to the point where the police were called on me by my parents. I get really paranoid and think that people are trying to insult me subliminally all the time. Like they could say a certain word and that could trigger my reaction to thinking they're trying to insult me.

 My relationships have usually been unstable. I'd test people in my relationships to see if they really cared a lot of the time and if i felt they didn't i would get angry and cause an argument. Another symptom i see listed as BPD is the lack of self image. I'm not sure if this is a lack of self image but i seem to not know what i want to do in life. 

My goals seem to change a lot and i can never stick to one. Like for example not long ago i was actually considering going off and being a monk. I was so into meditation and stuff like that and now I've completely cut that part of my life out. 

Another thing is my morals. Sometimes i'm so overcome by guilt and shame and want to strive to be this really moral person and then other times i'm like f*ck it i don't need to be that moral in life. Fear of abandonment seems to be a major symptom in diagnosing BPD. I'm not sure if this classes under fear of abandonment (someone let me know if it does) but i have an extreme fear of rejection and it usually has to do with my looks. For example i can't even say hello to a girl without being extremely fearful that she will reject the ""hello"" based on the fact that she mightn't think i'm good looking enough. I feel the fear of rejection with most things in my life but it's worse when it comes to my looks. Another example is when i'm in a nightclub and a girl shows signs of interest in me like smiling or moving her body towards me on the dance floor. When this happens my friend is like ""she definitely likes you man you gotta go for that"" or whatever and even then i'm way to scared to even make the slight advancement on her out of the fear of rejection. I also engage in self destructive behavior. 

The way my anxiety works it means i can't drink alcohol or my anxiety will go through the roof and i get all these horrible physical symptoms. SO many times through the years when i start to manage to get my anxiety levels down i end up going out partying and drinking a lot and then end up back at square one again. I have also self harmed in the past by.  I have threatened to kill myself a good few times before as well. 

I was in a really heated argument with my mother when i was a teenager and i pulled out a knife and threatened to kill myself. I have mood swings. I guess i feel emptiness too. I feel like nothing will ever be good enough at times and that it's all just pointless. My parents divorced when i was around 6 years old. My dad (who is most likely mentally unstable) was abusive to my mother in front of me as a kid and would kick her sometimes and punch holes in doors and my mam told me that one time when i was in the car with them as a toddler he pretended he was going to crash the car to scare my mam. I have a memory stuck in my head of him pushing her and her landing on me when i was a kid but i'm not even sure if the memory is real or not. All the things i listed are not as bad as i've gotten older and gotten my anxiety under control but they're still there."
2322,"I’m not sure it’s good to have people come here who don’t have bpd and post.

I get that for some, they’re trying to find ways to cope.

But for others, there’s some angry finger pointing that is quite triggering and makes this forum feel less safe.

I know there’s a policy about abusive language, but maybe there needs to be a separate forum section for those trying to live with, or help, someone with bpd? And then those who have bpd and are strong enough, can respond?

I’m reasonably stable right now, but I cannot imagine the triggers in some recent posts for those who aren’t at the moment.

Thoughts?"
2323,"One minute I'm fine and I'm making plans/goals and then the next I'm having a meltdown again. I'm quite stressed at the moment and just feel like giving up - when this happens I get really confused. I can't even seem to make simple decisions and keep changing my mind on things. On who I am, what I like, what I want. I'm currently dating somebody and I think I'm going to end up pushing him away because I can't work out how I feel and I am so up and down. I feel so empty and lonely - I feel like this is a feeling that just never ends. Like I'm being punished through this illness. It makes me feel like a bad person and it makes me feel incapable a lot of the time, of even the most basic things. 

I'm trying to get a job or an apprenticeship at the moment. I'm even looking for voluntary work and I feel like crying because nothing is moving forward. I keep getting rejected because of the gaps in my employment due to my mental health. I am incredibly lonely. My Mum has kicked me out on and off since 14 and I am 22 now and living in a house share. I am claiming benefits that are just about enough to survive on. I found out this weekend that 2 people that I considered my best friends have been gossiping about me and I feel so betrayed. It's really set my paranoia off and my trust issues with people. I don't really know what the point in this thread is other than to just get out my frustrations and hope that I'm not on my own with some of these feelings? Because I feel as though I struggle to connect with regular people and that I am misunderstood a lot of the time. So I could be in a room full of people and still feel lonely. My Mum is selling my pets as they are too much work for her. I absolutely adore my dog, I feel like she calms me down when I'm having one of my BPD meltdowns - she relaxes me and I don't want to lose that. I just feel very empty and I am missing that buzz and intensity that I sometimes feel. It's just deep depression and no energy at the moment. Thanks for reading and sorry for ranting! x"
2324,"QUESTION 

After someone with BPD has spiraled in an argument and unintentionally ""thought"" or assumed the incorrect actions or motives were taking place at or against them, do they realize it was their misinterpretation?

Basically I'm wondering if they realize that they were mistaken and are able to hold themselves accountable.

I'm wondering because I want to know if it's a case where they will just continue thinking that they were wronged by the other person when in fact they weren't.

For obvious reasons, I don't want my girlfriend thinking that I did something or acted in way that I clearly did not. This could be damaging to any relationship and could be the cause for the relationship to end.

Thanks for your help."
2325,the girl who never grew up x
2326,"Hi...apologies in advance, because this is going to be a long post. The synopsis is that last year, I met this girl who exhibited various traits that I believe are commonly associated with borderline personality disorder, or at least one or more cluster B personality disorders. We are no longer in contact, the reason for which you'll eventually find out later in this post. Based on everything I'll describe about her, I want to know if I'm correct in my hypothesis that she has BPD and/or anything else, and I decided to ask it in this forum precisely because I want feedback from mental health experts and people who actually do have BPD.

I've decided to put all the things that made me suspect that she has BPD and/or other cluster B personality disorders in bold.

Alright, so I met her last September at this college campus I frequent sometimes as a freelance tutor and part-time class taker. It's a habit of mine these days to strike up friendly conversations with random people because you never know what nice things can come of it (possible new friends, new job opportunities, new people who eventually become romantic partners, entertaining and enlightening stories, etc), and so while I walking around after having finished a tutoring appointment with another student there, I spotted this seating area that had one other person in it, and started a conversation by asking her if her eyeglasses were deliberately modeled after Harry Potter's, then when she responded by showing me a Harry Potter themed accessory of hers, I riffed on about what House we'd likely get sorted in (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Hufflepuff).

The conversation proceeded smoothly from there. I'll describe it in bullet point form

-We talked about various casual topics at first - books, games, classes, career goals, lifestyle goals, how the campus's wi-fi was terrible, etc.

-My initial impression was that she was intelligent, extremely witty, quirky, knowledgeable, insightful, funny...many traits that most people I've met tend to lack (not to be mean, but it's somewhat rare). It didn't take very long in the conversation for me to realize that this was one of the most engaging conversations I had in a long time, and I'm definitely no reclusive introvert - I've known enough people at this point to identify who the truly gifted conversationalists are, and she was one of them.

-Not to brag...but she seemed to recognize that I had some of those traits as well, or at least ones which she valued, because I got the impression that she was showing signs of interest in me. We exchanged numbers, then got up and started walking around campus in order to get more variety in our surroundings. As time went on, the topics of conversation seemed to easily drift towards 'deeper' and 'more personal' topics.

-As we hung around near the library building, I noticed that one thing about her that *might be considered* a red flag was the fact that her sense of humor had some sadistic, edgy, controversial, belittling elements to it. For instance, she said that she would laugh at me hard if the support beam I was sitting on broke and made me fall to the ground. She also had this tendency to talk about controversial things as if they were accomplishments. I'll share more examples of this later [1]

-Even though we had only been interacting for what was probably around 20 minutes, the conversation easily drifted towards deeper and more personal and more controversial topics. Maybe it was the fact that she could tell that I have an easy-going-nature, not socially anxious at all, and that I'm open to talk about anything. Or maybe she just has the same inclination to quickly mention this to everyone she meets, but somehow the conversation drifted to the topic of the fact that her recent ex-boyfriend abused her. When I asked her 'how?' she merely said ""physically, emotionally, sexually."" I said I was sorry to hear that. She also added that she (and I paraphrase) ""managed to figure out the perfect thing to say to him at the end, to destroy him as a person, and really hurt his ego."" I can't even remember how I responded to that revelation, but I do recall that she also started to share her life story. She revealed, probably around 40 minutes into the conversation, that an uncle had sexually abused her as a child, that she had attempted suicide , and that she had to be raised by her grandparents because of the fact that her mother (Pakistani, muslim family) got impregnated out of wedlock by her Guatemalan father, and that her mother's parents disowned her mother as a result. Apparently both pairs of grandparents took part in raising her, and she moved around a lot growing up.

-In response to all that, I shared parts of my own life story. I had also moved around a lot growing up, also struggled with suicidal thoughts when I was younger and was hospitalized twice for it, was put on medication, etc etc. I recall that I asked her if she was hospitalized and put on medication for her suicide attempt, and she said that she wasn't, but didn't go into detail. In retrospect, I really can't be sure what things she said were true or false.

-There was also one other very important thing to mention about the first conversation I had with her. As we were sitting down, I saw the roof of the science building in the distance, and commented that I have this ridiculous memory of that particular place. However...the memory itself was something that I felt inappropriate to share with someone I had met less than an hour ago, so I declined to go into detail. She was desperate to find out what though and *bragged that she was really good at getting into people's heads and getting them to do things for her*...and the thing is, after she revealed all those personal details about herself, and got me to reveal personal details about myself, she asked me again what had happened on the roof of the science building. At that point I was much more prone to reveal it, and so I did (it might be against the rules to be explicit about it here, but basically it involved something sexual with a girl I used to date in the past). In response, she seemed to find it humorous and asked me more things about it and about myself, then bragged that ""see, I told you I'm good at getting into people's heads."" I can't even remember what I said in response to that, but I do remember that she told me that I was really interesting (I even joked that because the college itself is an extremely boring place, that I'm probably going to be the most interesting thing to happen to her in all her time there, and she agreed), that I reminded her a lot about herself, and even asked me if I was sexually abused when I was younger, maybe because she wanted to figure out how similar I was to her. When I paused in surprise to ponder the question, she said with a hint of humor in her tone that ""it's ok, you don't have to go into detail.""

-I don't even remember what I said after that, but there are a few important things that I  should mention. One was that I was rather flattered and swept off my feet that she started reading me and trying to actively figure me out less than an hour into the conversation - she was exceptionally talented at charming me, a huge contrast to the vast majority of people I meet, and what's funny is that I'm typically the person who others think of as a charmer, so it was interesting to have the shoe on the other foot, so to speak. Two, was that she was rather brilliant in getting me to reveal things about myself that I normally never reveal, like the fact that I once said something rather cruel to my mentally disabled brother or the fact that I had a history of suicidal thoughts / major depression/ medication / hospitalizations in my adolescence (what's so ridiculous about this, is that I got the suspicion that she might be the type to pry for information to use against me later...and yet I couldn't help myself and shared all these personal details about myself anyway. Of course, I still had some self-control, and thankfully didn't reveal *everything*.)


-Despite the fact that she was displaying obvious red flags and palpably manipulative traits, I underestimated how much trouble she could be. Part of it was an overabundance of confidence on my part; I assumed I was socially experienced enough to not have any trouble with someone like her. Before meeting her, I already dealt with a couple people who were confirmed to be professionally diagnosed with BPD and never got into any trouble with them at all, though that was because I kept my distance and never got involved in anything emotionally intimate. A close friend of mine had a girlfriend who was professionally diagnosed, and I had already been casually involved with another girl who was professionally diagnosed, but neither of them seemed very similar to the girl who is the subject of this thread. Another part of why I underestimated her is the fact that she was a geek with interests like Dungeons and Dragons, and had these dorky characteristics in her body language (e.g awkward gestures), style of clothing (old baggy clothes with nerdy logos), and manner of speaking (same Kermit the Frog style accent that famous nerds like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates have), that don't align with the classic stereotype of people who are skilled at manipulation (e.g. graceful body language, attire that's specifically chosen to enhance their physical attractiveness like revealing clothing or simply clothes that fit well and signal that you're attentive to the way you look).

-In the conversation I found out that she was only 18 years old and in her first semester at college, while I was 23 and already mainly done with college, mostly focused on my career, only frequenting the campus to make some side income as a tutor and to take one or two classes on the side (it's conveniently close to my home). The age difference made me contemplate if I should even be involved with her - I recall having some doubts about even spending more time with her because of it, though I figured that she seemed to behave maturely enough that it wasn't a big deal. When she relayed her anecdotes about being abused by her ex-boyfriend, I asked if she was dating anyone at the moment, and she said that she was dating someone, but that he ""doesn't go"" to the same college we were at. I was also casually seeing someone else at the time, and already had a group of friends I hung out with on the weekends, although it was a little farther away. So, I figured that because she was an intelligent, witty, engaging conversationalist, and that we were both dating other people at the time, that I'd be fine 'just being friends' with her. Shortly before this first conversation ended, I told her that, and she agreed that she'd be fine with that too.

-So...after that first conversation ended, I had all sorts of thoughts going through my head. I knew that she had quite a few red flags - the fact in our first conversation, which lasted less than an hour in total, she revealed that she had been physically/emotionally/sexually abused by her ex, that she had been sexually abused by an uncle as a child, that she wasn't even raised by her parents (possible abandonment issues as a result, maybe?), that she attempted suicide (she never exactly revealed why. Possible attempt at emotionally coercing someone else maybe?), that she successfully pried personal info about myself from me like my own history with mental illness and sexual abuse and taboo activities I've engaged in, that she bragged about being good at ""getting into people's heads"" and getting them to reveal her things, that she even views being skilled at manipulation as something she can openly brag about. At the same time...and I know this sounds really foolish, because it really was, but I nevertheless decided that I'd hang out with her every now and then because of how refreshing it was to meet someone who was as gifted as providing a witty, stimulating, emotionally engaging conversation like she was. So, on my way home, instead of being concerned about all these warning signs, I was excited at the prospect spending more time and getting to know her. The first thing I ever texted her was something like ""Hi it's (myname). You know...I talk and meet lots of people these days, but it isn't often that I have such an engaging conversation about deep topics like the ones we discussed. Thanks for that""  ...and when I checked my phone again a few hours later, I noticed that she responded, something like ""Hi! I liked hanging out with you too. If you're still on campus we should hang out"" and that she even double texted around 15 minutes later, something like ""hey...are you still there, I hope we can meet""."
2327,"Hi! I'd love to know what helps anyone cope/regulate their anger? I haven't tried much but the whole ""taking deep breaths, listen to music"" etc don't help enough, if at all. It seems a bit too shallow and doesn't help with the actual thought process. Thanks in advance!

Mini rant (can ignore if you want lol) :
I really feel like my BPD is ruining my relationship, mostly because I get so angry so easily. I feel like such an awful person but one trigger is when someone will do something stupid/thoughtless that could potentially cause a dangerous or embarresing outcome (e.g. thinking it's completely fine to leave something very embarresing lying around the house where others can find it) ESPECIALLY when they don't see a problem in it and it's happened before which resulted in a huge bordeline rage (you would think they would learn?)

Anyway that example is what I'm dealing with at the moment and thankfully it was 3am so I have time alone to attempt to calm down. We argue a lot but this is the first time I have a chance to try some coping/dealing strategies. I'm hoping to calm down before I sleep so by morning I'm able to deal with the situation calmly without any arguments or obvious bitterness. Any help would be massively appreciated. :) Also I'm very tired so sorry if something doesn't make sense lol."
2328,"So I see a few people from a charity and out of them all there is 1 person and I just crave her attention. When I have my appointments with her I feel she gets me. She gets my humour and tbh I feel I can be more vulnerable with her than anyone else. I say vulnerable but even then i find it hard to talk. I haven't told her how I feel as I know it would end badly because I wouldn't be able to see her again. I cringe at how I feel, even writing this is making me cry. I just hate this feeling it actually hurts. I do see a therapist but I'm so embarrassed by how I feel I just don't want to talk about it. I actually do gain something from seeing her otherwise I would probably try not to see her. I know I need to be honest with my therapist as I know he won't try to shame me but even so the thought is horrifying."
2329,"Hi, its been a while since I posted for a number of reasons. To be honest things have been good towards the end of last year things looked really good, I have a social life now and tend to spend little time at home. Then January hit and its been hell like literal hell, but I did a stupid thing and tried carrying on with a smile on my face... my self-harm started again and again I kept it hidden and didnt talk to anyone. Once a day turned into twice then three times and then having to attend accident and emergency. That was the first two weeks of this year my first attendance was about three weeks ago... since then ive attended 7 times and had one overdose in that time ...
During all this I cut my care team out of my life, I stopped attending appointments and stoped picking up the phone. I know that was stupid but I didn't wanna face it, I wanted to carry on and just ignore it.
This past week things hit the fan big time... I work/ have support with the ymca and the lady there noticed a change in me. Long story short she did what she could to help and I ended up at my community team's office this Wednesday just gone. I was a mess, tears snot everything, I begged them to help because ive lost control of my self harm urges. My cpn referred me to home based treatment that night and was due to see them the next day... this is where crap gets unmanageable for me.
I was woke up the next morning by duty calling me informing me that the home based treatment team wasnt going to support me at this time. The duty worker was great he asked me up for a visit because he knew I wasn't doing good. Had the visit and well I was really upset and distraught because it felt like no one wanted to help me. I harmed again only this time I was really really deep.... first time having stitches and I really scared myself. A friend took me up to a and e and we decided to go out to the cinema... biggest mistake of my week. I lost it and well put it this way my friend had to wrestle implements out my hand.
So back to a and e that same day a few hours later... hysterical in the middle of a and e waiting on the mental health team to assess me. 3 or 4 hours later a nurse comes out... ""they have a 136 to deal with thats more important. They dont expect to see you until morning"" bear in mind it is like 4 am at this point. So I leave because im shattered and drained... they let me leave. Despite all of the crap I was chatting just hours earlier.

Wake up today no calls of anyone... I ring my team because I can't carry on like this and have had enough. Told to wait on a call back from my cpn, he calls 30 mins later. First thing he says was why did u leave, next time dont do that. Hes sorting visits over the weekend seeing as hes in on Sunday. So thats something.


Main reason why im telling u all this is I have a question. Something my mother has said today thats gotten me thinking. Given all of this right now how unstable I am and just self damaging and stuff do I request an admission? Nothing massive maybe a week or something like that.
Just take myself off completely from self harm and everything.... im struggling to keep myself safe anymore and it worries me massively.
I have been in hospital a few times back in 2017 and it was deemed ""unhelpful"" so I just worry they say no and make me feel even crappier. I dont know hence why I'm asking."
2330,"I'm kind of at my wits' end with this issue. I recently was able to graduate college, am working full-time, and am applying to go to medical school. I'm doing much better than any doc predicted when I first got the BPD diagnosis, but it's pretty much only because I wasn't in a relationship or dating... 

I just really really struggle with the issue of communication in dating/relationships, and it's coming back now that I'm using dating apps and am starting to see people again. Our first few conversations go great. These really nice guys manage to penetrate my shell and I really come to like them and they start saying nice things about me. Then they say good night, I'll check back with you on a day to meet up next week and then... Then it begins. I am certain they don't care about me and will leave me. I think about them all the time. Whenever I check my phone and they haven't answered, I feel a mixture of sadness, anger, anxiety, exhaustion, and feeling absolutely trapped. Why does it matter to me so much that they answer?? Why do I crave it so much? I then struggle to concentrate at work. My motivation dies and my actions are driven by me being like, ""force yourself to keep going, don't cave, don't cave"". 

When he does, eventually answer, it's always too brief. It's never enough. Even if it's only an hour later, or if he's busy, 5 hours later. I resent him, I hate him... he might as well have cheated on me... This sweet innocent guy with all these passions turns into a malevolent tyrant. And then I delay answering, too. I don't want him to know I'm desperate. I don't tell him any of it. I bottle it in. I tell myself I'm being irrational, ""he isn't doing anything wrong, give him a chance."" But the anger and desperation builds and builds. And then, boom. I shit all over him, ask him who he's sleeping with, if I'm his third or fourth backup or something, and he's just in shock. He tells me he really liked me (he introduced me to his best friends, after all!) and was maybe even hoping we could become something more serious. He was just really busy at work or ran out of battery. He doesn't understand where this is coming from all of a sudden... He prefers we don't see each other again. Or I tell him about the abusive relationship I endured to explain why I'm acting this way and then he becomes afraid I'm too fucked up for him to handle, especially once he notices the embarrassing self-harm scars I wish I could erase.

Does this happen to other people?? Right now I only just started messaging this great guy on an app and after only 48 hours I am already losing so much sleep, can't concentrate, have no appetite and then suddenly binge on stuff, and can't motivate myself or even remember what my goals and values are, even though I've sketched them out countless times in therapy. I want out, I can't bear it anymore but... I really really want to be in a stable supportive relationship, and if I stop going on dates or getting to know people better, it likely won't happen!! I don't want to spiral again. I don't want to be a basket case. I have enough scars as is. They told me to get back into relationships when I was feeling better again, and I finally thought I was!!! Why does my house of cards always threaten to collapse because of this issue? How do you deal with people not answering your texts? Is there a way to teach yourself patience and to stop seeing them as the devil in human form and reminding yourself you really actually like them? Any strategies people have learned in treatment or through life experience? Or is this just a thing that I need to go to therapy for? 

Thanks!"
2331,"Just got my diagnosis a month ago. Spent time with both a cognitive therapist and my psychiatrist. 

Biggest thing I'm dealing with and need help with is accepting this new reality. I've been running from this for a long time and accepting it is splitting me in two.

Talked to my girlfriend of 10 years for 8 hours. I feel terrible for telling her this but it had to be done. She was so accepting that it breaks my heart. I feel like I ruin everyone who I touch,

So, yeah. Feeling like shit. I understand it needed to be done in order to heal but all I can think of is that people should not worry about me and I've made their lives worse.

I hate my head."
2332,"Just before Christmas last year I got a letter informing me that I have been discharged from the mental health team. I had no warning whatsoever. In the letter it says that if I need any kind of help is to go and see my GP, problem is I never see the same doctor and I find it hard to tell the doctor how I feel. I have been really struggling these last few months. I feel so let down. There was a time that I has a CPN, Psychiatrist, support worker and a therapist. I have no idea what I am going to do now."
2333,"Hello,

I've been diagnosed with BPD for quite some time now. I've attended DBT and I've seen a therapist for quite some time. I've developed my tools and have gotten to a point where my therapist suggested a 6 month break from therapy (3 months left). My meds have been stable for years now, as well. 

In my opinion I am pretty good at handling myself when my emotions are high... most of the time. 

When certain triggers of mine are mentioned, or pushed, however... That's when my struggles begin.

I honestly feel like someone else takes over my body completely and it's incredibly painful to watch. Because this 'person' turns into a monster - yelling, insulting, saying things I know will hurt, and even throwing things and breaking my own precious items. Just about the only thing about this 'person' I feel like I have some control over is not self-harming (3 years clean now).

It's very frustrating to me that it gets to that point. Because I can be physically sitting in a chair, screaming at my partner about something unimportant in the long run, while inwardly my mind is trying to desperately scream for my mouth to just 'stop!'. It's very, very rare that I manage to stop it - and it's usually not for very long.

Even my partner has told me multiple times that I seem like I'm two different people.

So I'm wondering - does anyone else feel like they have someone else in their body who they can't fight? Someone that takes control away from you, while you're still mostly conscious of what's going on? Almost like you're watching a movie and screaming at the 'screen', but they can't hear you.

Thanks for your input!"
2334,"Yes so I have been struggling to survive, I only do so really because there's people I don't want to upset, I don't actually care about myself on any level (can't even bring myself to shower, feel disgusted every time I walk past a mirror, I can barely think or concentrate today and as for my sleeping pattern). I am trying so hard to just hold it together.

I recently quit my job (it just wasn't working out for me), and so unemployed which is going to increase even the average person's chance of depression, but for someone like me that it's just going to increase it. I keep telling myself these strong feelings of extreme anger and depression are only temporary, and I need to be strong and get through this, but I'm starting to feel out of control as yesterday for instance I was so euphoric but today it's just a completely different story. It's exhausting.

 So what's going on for me, well I'm young, 25, so I still have options to make a better future for myself, but it's hard, hard as hell with these emotions that make me feel like it's all pointless, like I'm worthless and disgusting. I keep trying to reason with myself but the guilt just keeps coming back.

Because I'm poor as hell, at the moment, and living in this city is so ridiculously expensive, I still have to live in the same family home where i developed my mental health disorder, it's like reliving past traumas. To be fair, even if I've moved out, in the past I've felt ridiculously ill so how can I blame this living environment for anything. Sometimes I dream about how if I earnt enough money, i could be living somewhere else, having my own apartment, but in my mind even that vision feels so lonely and empty. I know for instance about my constant pushing people away and insecurities that make it impossible for me to build or sustain any romantic relationship at the moment, and have done for years. All the self sabotage in pushing others away. The emptiness inside that doesn't go away.These are the things that fill my mind, and they don't even seem relevant to todays tasks, so why the hell do I keep having these thoughts?!! Basically I just can't stop myself feeling hopeless for the future, no matter how hard I try to reason with myself.

In this house, it's a very dysfunctional relationship between my parents and my mum suffers from mental illness and alcoholism which probably has a lot to do with my own condition. I hate blaming my parents because ultimately they are the ones who are putting me up, giving me a roof to live in, and trying to be there for me. Maybe living here I relive past traumas, but how can I blame my parents when they are basically the only thing that feel safe and familiar right now in a world when I am so scared to even go outside and be seen, living with anxiety of being around other humans.

I just need to reach out. I feel trapped. I feel hopeless. I had so many plans to make this year a better year, to be more constructive, to be determined, but literally nothing feels like it's changing. I'm trying to make small steps each day, take each day as it comes, but I'm so self critical, small steps just don't feel good enough. I don't even know why this is. Sometimes I just wanna reach out because I feel so alone. 

I don't even know what the question is or why I'm writing this here, I guess I just feel desperate and if anyone can relate, I guess it's comforting to hear from a fellow human being from behind a computer screen, just feels safer. I feel so isolated and far away from other humans, I don't want to be a burden to those same old people who have to put up with supporting me, but I just constantly need others, I need to feel some kind of love or support, even though I also push it away and isolate myself from it, what the hell!!!"
2335,"I am realizing how attention starved I was as a child and now that i am starting to get enough of it I am starting to reach out for it when I don't have it, instead of witholding to elicit it, to maintain healthy homeostasis.

I didn't have enough friends, enough social acceptance, enough emotional expressiveness, enough attention.  Finally in the digital age I am starting to get more community, from the close and personal to the abstract and moral."
2336,"Coming to realize a lot of my distraction comes from a need for attention and validation which I think comes from the bpd angle.
Having a tough time that I emailed a bunch of friends and mentors last night and probably will not hear back. 
But realizing that the need is for validation is helping the default problem go away.
Still, I think the social contract and modern life should allow more time for socialization and communication than currently available."
2337,"My 15yo daughter was diagnosed about 3 years ago as having BPD, being on the Autism Spectrum, depression, and anxiety.  She was out of control, doing drugs, sneaking out of the house, having sex, and failing at school.  We finally put her into a Wilderness program for about three months and then a therapy boarding school for about one year.  She did great at both programs and she was even sad to leave each one when it was time.  She was doing so well during her time at the boarding school we had her taken off her medication (Effexor) during her stay at the boarding school, she continued to do well and talked often about how clear her head felt and how much better she could think being off the meds.  After coming home things went mostly well, there were a few small issues and she made a guy she knew her boyfriend when she wasn't supposed to have one yet.  She has been home about four months now, in the last two weeks she had several bad things happen within a few days of each other.  An old boyfriend that caused her lots of problems before she left for Wilderness Therapy started stalking her, so we had to call the police to get him to stop, her new boyfriend broke up with her because he said he couldn't handle all of her issues, and we found Marijuana and nicotine vaping supplies in her room so we called the school and reported it as we knew who she bought it from.  So now she says all the kids are mad at her.   
So since that happened she has became extremely verbally abuse with a bit of physical violence added in.  From the time she gets home from school until she goes to bed she just walks around the house cussing at me and her mom.  She has a 10yo brother that she hasn't gotten too bad around but he is still right there and hears and sees everything.  She has even turned on one of her brothers friends she doesn't like trying to throw him out of the house until I intervened and had to hold her back from pushing him out of the house.  We have had to call the police on her three times so far for attacking and hitting us.  We tried taking her phone away but she said that didn't matter since she doesn't have any friends anyway, which is true, her whole life she has treated people bad and therefore she never does have any friends.  Even when she just walks through the room we are in she will cuss at us and tell us how much she hates us.  She blames it all on us for taking her marijuana away as she claims it made her better and for calling the school and causing everyone to hate her.  Her younger brother is having major anxiety from her to the point where one of his teachers call recently to see if everything was ok at home do to several nervous twitches hes has developed recently.  My wife was talked recently about wanted to die herself due to all the abuse she has suffered at the hands of our daughter and also talks of us separating so she can get our son away from her.  All our daughter does is tell us how bad she wants out of the house and that she doesn't care if it's boarding school, foster care, or anything else that will get her away from us.  At this point if I had any money left I would send her away, but after the other programs I have no money left.  Currently she is on a suicide watch at a hospital but will probably be home in three days when it will all start again.  We are asking them to do a medication evaluation on her before she comes home.  If there are any suggestions on meds to talk to them about or other (low or no cost) programs to try I would appreciate any suggestions.  I really do want to help her so badly.  She should be leaving the hospital in the next day or two, I'm sure they will want to discuss meds before she does, normally they want to put her on anti-depression meds, but after reading a bit on here it seems like anti-psychotic meds might be much more helpful for her?"
2338,"I am stressing out waiting for my boss to reply.  I think that I have the correct solution but I am not used to arguing.

My Dad got hyper about it this morning as he usually does and told me I should do this, I shouldn't do that, and it aggravates me because I feel controlled.  However, living with him makes me feel less lonely.

Hard because I hate conflict, competition, arguing, etc. and I had a lot of it this morning. 

Now, out of anxiety I am drinking coffee and eating cereal and chocolate chips.  I get a physical pain in my back when I get nervous in response to conflict."
2339,"Dear All,

Firstly, thanks for reading my post.

I have recently been diagnosed with BPD and am currently in therapy and I am also seeing a psychiatrist. Although the diagnosis is recent, I have been attending therapy for some years now, as my behaviour for as long as I can remember, (I am 36) is like being on a roller coaster, in the dark one minute and then in the blistering sun, the next, with headphones on, linked to an Ipod, with the shuffle button being repeatedly hit by a child that has consumed 6 cans of Mountain Dew! 

I have now taken it upon myself to explore this affliction with gusto and consume as much literature, advice and support as possible, to allow me to properly integrate and function in a way that benefits me and my loved ones.  

I am here, asking you as a community of fellow sufferers, to accept me, and send me anything that you feel may benefit me in any way, whatsoever. I will be welcoming and appreciative of anything that any single one of you can do, to encourage me to remain alive, live a fulfilling existence and to connect with my loved ones and the public in a meaningful, heartfelt and compassionate way. Please feel that no matter how small you feel that your offer is; maybe a few simple words, for example, they will be emotionally harnessed by myself and appreciated in such a huge way. 

I sincerely wish all of you that are on this site, the best of mental health for this evening and hope that I may connect with some of you that suffer with BPD, as well as others conditions. I am here to engage in active support for each that I connect with, and to possibly provide another with some kind words to enable us to progress together in our lives as much as is necessary for each of us as individuals. 

Thank you so much for your time.

Michael"
2340,"He is always getting worked up and anxious and picking on me and telling me what to do and it stresses me out a lot. I am not allowed anger towards him, despite his never having been around and constantly angry at us when he was, and only total obedience to his views are allowed or acceptable to him.

I end up suppressing myself and I get nerve pain from past traumas that haven't been dealt with."
2341,"anyone else have the experience of being ignored by their FP (favourite person) and basing their entire self-worth off that? he hasn't texted me for more than two days now, i think it's because i annoyed him because i'm always complaining about mental illness and how shitty things are, and of course if he doesn't want to talk to me anymore i don't want him to, but i also can't stand that thought, and i keep hoping he's going to text me and apologize or ask if i'm okay and it's ridiculous how emotionally dependent i am on him and i hate myself so much for it. who else has an FP and what is your experience?"
2342,"It’s funny I see people mention seroquel.

I was given it for insomnia. I took it for seven years until I started having side effects (tardive dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia - Wikipedia). So I stopped and the symptoms associated with tardive dyskinesia stopped. It was not given to me for bpd, but I wonder if it’s THE drug for our disorder as I’ve seen several mention it. If you do any research on it, it’s primarily used for schizophrenic patients, and given our tendency to “split” if we aren’t in at least the same symptomatic family?

Forward five years and I’m back to seroquel. But I take only 1/3 a pill then 3 mgs of immovane and melatonin for sleep.

I’m also on 20 mgs of Prozac, and it’s bizarre that there is a massive difference in mood if I stop for a week.

So seroquel at bed for sleep, then Prozac in the morning. It has managed to even me out, even if I hate hate hate taking meds (it feels like I am admitting defeat to my illness).

What has worked for you?"
2343,"Hi i havn't posted on this part of forum before, i post elsewhere though. I was diagnosed with EUBPD several years ago and have been having 1-1 with counsellor for years and i take Anti-Psychotics(Amisulpride) and Diazepam. I am now working towards ending with her and working towards starting Intensive group therapy, which is a terrifying prospect but one that i have pushed for and desperatly want to do but i know that it will be a huge challenge for me. In a state of flux and S/Hing quite a lot. My risk factors are rising all the time and the Psychotherapist i have been seeing at the group unit on a 1-1 basis says that they will get worse when i start full group. Hopefully i will start one day a week in June and full time 3/half days a week in July. 

This unit specialises in BPD so i am hopefull of progress,although i have made huge strides in the last year or two and the group stuff is the logical progression from counselling. 

What worries me most is that i will need extra support when i begin at group but i don't have any support and my MH/SW is a waste of space and dosn't get were i am coming from at all and seems to think that doing group work will be a walk in the park, he hasn't a clue and i am afraid as he is supposed to be my access to other services and i know that he wont help, and that the crisis team would listen to him if he spoke up for me where they don't listen to me. All i get is someone who just tells me to keep myself safe, well i know that and that is what i am trying to do by asking them for help duuuhhhh. What is it with these people.

Enough for now, feeling tired.

2345,"How does it affect relationships with boyfriend/girlfriend?

I’ve found I make my relationship toxic although I don’t mean to. Too many arguments I cause for no reason, mood swings and dragging him down...

Please share experiences and how you make steps to overcome?"
2346,"Hi all and thanks for the look.

I've been dating my current girlfriend for 7 months now. Once we started dating, she was very upfront about suffering from anxiety and had been treated for depression. She is also in recovery, over a yr now, she's an alcoholic. I'm not sure if it's BPD, she hasn't disclosed, perhaps out of fear of judgement.

She's suffered some childhood trauma, perhaps abandonment maybe emotional abuse.

She's been seeing her therapist for over ten years now and seems to do well it and depends on it.

I recently experienced a very different dynamic in our relationship, for the past 3-4 weeks, we've experienced intense arguments. Perhaps the holidays or season change in the northeast here played a role or was a catalyst?

It appears that every chance or opportunity is taken (by her) to point out a fault of mine or to bring up an argument that I don't want to participate in. I'm a very level headed individual and can certainly maintain a healthy level of emotions. Our arguments end with her telling me how frustrating it is to talk to me and that I'm the one that encourages the arguing and that I seek it out and that she's the victim.

I've done some searching on line and in forums and it sounds a lot like gaslighting. 

I'm confused and wondering if she is suffering from bipolar disorder and maybe hasn't felt safe to disclose this about herself? She has mentioned more than once, in passing, that there's something she wants to tell me but she's way to vulnerable, at the moment, to say. It always comes up when she tells me about her therapy session or therapist.

It could be that I had mentioned early in our dating relationship, that my ex-girlfriend may have suffered from bipolar. Mind you, I didn't disclose that about my girlfriend in a derogatory way or disrespectfully. But I can understand why she would be apprehensive about disclosing. Which ever the case, I believe there's something - bipolar or something different.

I care about her deeply and she has had a genuine fear of communicating with me and has kept her distance. I'm not this person, not this boyfriend that she ""believes"" I am. And it seems the more I try to convince her that more she doesn't believe. She's actually accused me of making stuff up to make my argument or defense more believable. I've found myself explaining several times that I have ZERO to gain by lying and that I have no problem accepting my part or fault in our arguments. Basically I've shown humility, have opened up and been vulnerable and pleaded to be open to communicate. 

She seems to have shut down on me. We actually had to meet up last night because I got her tickets to show for Christmas and so we met.

Of course the night ended in another argument...I actually felt like she was trying to look for an excuse to fight and maybe perhaps wants to end the relationship or push me away...it feels that way at least. I've even given her the opportunity to break up by telling her - if you don't want to continue in the relationship, I'll be okay with the decision.

I told her that I love her - for the first time - and that I have nothing to lose or gain by telling her that I want to work it out and that I'm here to stay and won't go anywhere if she wants to work it out.

With this her mood changed and she appeared to fall back into more of a baseline ""her"". 

I should disclose that disclosing that I love her was in no way shape or form to ""keep her"" or trick her, it was simply to let her know exactly how I feel and how much I sincerely care, regardless if we can work it out or not.

I've been preparing for the potential of a break up so I truly do not have anything to really gain by telling her...this could all be a non issue in a week.

She seemed receptive after all this and asked for hug, we embraced for a good amount of time. She calmly asked if we could work on communicating and that she really wants us to.

So now I'm really apprehensive about communicating because it always ends in the default where she seems unwavering and finger pointing...saying that I constantly interrupt her (I don't) and it's not actually happening! She'll bring up scenarios that have flat out NOT happened. 

Is this gaslighting? 

I really do love her and want to work it out - I'm not out to save her, I'm no knight in shinning armor - I don't want to be a hero, I'm super comfortable in my own skin. I'm just willing to be vulnerable and to work through this and am aware if this is bipolar that we're dealing with we can set boundaries and map out a plan, together.

Thanks again for the look and any feedback would be appreciated."
2347,"Because I can not control my emotions I’ve lost jobs, relationships, even family members and friends are pulling away from me. I feel like I have no one and nothing. I just don’t know how to cope other than harming myself. It’s the only thing that helps but I want to stop. Any suggestions from someone who has gotten past harming themselves?"
2348,Who’s been with a early intervention team? I’m in need of some advice about the first visit
2349,"Seems like that's what's happening to me.  I used to at least have friends and get along with my co-workers.  Now I don't have any friends and am too scared to try making any, and inside I am so annoyed with co-workers who just sit there and don't pull their weight.  But I am afraid to say anything because I'm scared I'll just make things worse."
2350,"Would any of you trust a physician assistant to prescribe you meds? I was in a partial hospitalization program and the psychiatrist there prescribed me Seroquel. Now that I'm out I was set up to see a physician assistant to continue my medication treatment but I really do not trust them treating me. I haven't seen them yet though, my first appointment is on Thursday. Maybe I'm jumping the gun but I really don't feel comfortable with somebody who only has 2+ years of experience prescribing me meds. What do you guys think?"
2351,"Hi, I always thought I was a reasonably nice and caring person. Apparently thou according to a friend I sexually harassed him and that’s why he always hits on me. I don’t have casual sex because it’s one of my values and I had told him that many tines yet he still asks if he can sleep with me casually?
Now that I think about it I do remember that I hug him and I often muck around with my male friends in a boisterous manner. Obviously this coming across as sexual harassment.
So I’ve come to the conclusion despite the fact I thought I was getting better at respecting other people and treated people kindly that I’m actually a really scummy person who doesn’t respect people. I’m feeling really depressed and don’t know what to do anymore. As hard as I try I’m not a good friend or even girlfriend. My ex started hating me after I said I wouldn’t move states for him as my support network was here and my friends. We had already discussed it and he kept bringing it up so I got mad. After I got mad I said I was an awful person and the whole fight was my fault. He got mad at me about that as well. Then every tine I tried discussing anything with him after that the way I’ve learnt with DBT he would say oh your just being borderline!
I really feel suicidal as I just don’t think I’m ever gonna improve and that I’m inherently an awful person no wonder no one can love me if what my friend said was true."

2354,"Hi, first time writing here or anywhere really... For a few years, 3-4 I've been having these terrible ideas... Mostly negative ones. It all started when I first lost a job. Went into a 2 year depression, ""came out of it"". Always felt kinda different after the depression compared to before. Somehow, I was diagnosed with BPD while having no ""interpersonal issues"" I have been with my girlfriend for 9 years now, I have a good relationship with my parents, I have a step-brother that has 2 kids that I love more than anything... The problem seems to be in my head. For some dumb reason, I can't seem to keep a job. I find it VERY interesting for the first few months then, when I come out of the ""honey moon"" period, I crash... I fall in some sort of a depression and lose all interest in the work I have been doing. The only reason I still work where I'm working right now is that my father works for that company and its a self-employed type job. Financial security adviser it is. So when you sell, you get a commission but when you don't, well you don't. I can't seem to understand that I have to work 40 hours a week to pay bills... It just doesn't fit in my head, I have had experiences with gambling problems in the past, I don't drink often but when I do, it's mostly until I get sick. I want to know if I'm the only one with those traits. I feel so guilty all the time because I'm holding my girlfriend back from moving out of our parents. It's worst than torture. And then the bad thoughts start. Really tired of feeling that way. I'm on anti-depression medication. Effexor 75mg."

2356,"Hello.
I'm new to the forum, unfortunately not new to having Borderline Personality Disorder, but new to the diagnosis and treatment.

I was wondering if anyone else has feelings of extreme guilt for distancing themselves away from a narcissist parent and the family who doesn't (and never has) acknowledge or notice their behavior?
I've literally moved 1000 miles away, 2 states away, alone, to be away from them. For a while I continued to talk to them but after I started allowing myself to understand how their actions truly have messed me up and caused so much pain in my life, I've essentially cut my communication off with them. I'm now feeling incredibly selfish and guilty for doing so. I have a niece, who is 9 years old, who doesn't understand why I never come to visit anymore. My dad just recently had knee replacement surgery and I can't find the courage or motivation to pick up the phone to call. I know if I go home to visit I will stay with my mother, the narcissist, and if I call my dad she will grab the phone and insist on speaking to me. This will trigger all the emotions and feelings I've been battling to improve on.

So why do I feel so guilty, should I, would anyone else, or is anyone else going through [I]anything[I]similar to this?
I could really use some advice. I feel like I'm losing my mind and at a constant battle between right and wrong with myself.

Thanks."
2357,"So I've been diagnosed with Bpd and I was on meds for a while but I stopped and I thought I was doing better. I try to be more mindful before I react to negative emotions. Anyway a few weeks ago I asked my brother if I can have some stuff delivered to his place and he  basically said no because I don't keep in touch with him. The reason I don't keep in touch is because he is always so rude and blows up over small things and I couldn't handle him anymore although I still spoke to him here and there. Then he told my mom that he wanted to talk to me and she said she doesn't want to get involved. I got upset with her and yelled at her because he's always been like this and I feel she should have been firm and set boundaries with him years ago. He behaves this way because others simply accept it. Then my aunt called and said I'm emotionally abusing my mom and that my emotional rants need to stop. The thing is I don't lose it easily, this was something that triggered me because I've had to deal with my brothers behaviour all my life and my mother enabling him is what upset me. I don't know how to turn my emotions off, please help"
2358,My teenage daughter has recently been diagnosed with bpd. We’ve had no counseling or help yet. She is at her father’s house at the moment and has blocked me out of all her social media and won’t talk to me for some reason. I don’t know what to do. Her father knows nothing of her diagnosis and was dead against her going to a psychiatrist anyway so I took her behind his back because she so desperately wanted someone to help her. She is still awaiting treatment but now she won’t talk to me and is at her father’s house. I send her a message every day telling her that I love her. Should I stop doing this? What do I do?

2361,"I had this suicide attempt planned for at least a month. I had it mentally rehearsed. I would pack my bags and leave a suicide note in my wallet. I also decided on the restaurant to go to for my last supper.

As I had my dinner, I was getting more anxious. It peaked once I payed my bill. I went to Facebook to post my goodbye and I messaged the same to relevant people in my life. I wasn't going to do the same for my family; my angry note was all they deserved to get.

I walked to where I planned to do it but I couldn't. I tried changing spots but I was still paralyzed with fear. I got on the bus back to the city centre, and when I got off I went inside a mall to warm up a little.

Then I went out and walked further away from the parliament buildings, away from the restaurants and shops and away from a large audience. I still couldn't do it.

I walked back to my hostel. I am livid that I couldn't do it this time. This time I didn't have the adrenaline to do it. But I will keep trying every day until it happens."

I feel like I'm constantly hurting inside 24/7 with no breaks or nothing and I don't know what else to do to stop the pain sometimes, these last few days have been particularly bad. Just lately I feel like the little hope I had inside of me is slowly fading away and I'm trying not to go back to the same place where I was in my head last year in the summer.

I have someone in the mental health team who is very good and supportive but I think she's done with me and can no longer help me anymore and I'm heartbroken at that fact because I really put my trust in her.

2364,"i dont think i want advice, i think i just need to be heard and related to. 
first of all, i love my boyfriend with my entire heart and would never do anything to jeopardise our relationship. period. but i really really love attention. especially when it's from people who want me sexually and/or romantically. i keep people around who i know are into me. i'm a huge flirt and sometimes conversations i have push boundaries. my bf is aware that i have these attention seeking tendencies but he doesn't know about the conversations that he might not approve of. i definitely want to come clean to him and work on not having conversations that would likely hurt him. like i said, i would never cross a boundary by cheating on him but sometimes i think ""what if.."" it's exhausting to battle these shameful thoughts i have. i often talk to people and sort of play dumb. like, in my head i'll know they want more than just a conversation but if they havent said anything super straightforward i'll act like i have no idea what theyre talking about. i wont mention i have a boyfriend until the last possible moment when i simply can't avoid telling them.
i really don't want to be shamed or told i should leave my boyfriend. i am a flirtatious, attention seeking borderline who is committed to my relationship and making it stronger. i guess i'm just trying to confess my sins so to speak. before you make a judgement, know that i would never lie to my partner and i fully intend on having a discussion involving everything i have just said with him when i can and working on improving this aspect of my life and staying faithful. but for the time being it's burning inside me and i need to get it out.
does anyone else feel similarly or deal with feelings like this?
thanks."
2365,"Hi everyone!

I have come here hoping that someone who knows what it is like to have BPD could give me a piece of advice on how to help a close friend with BPD.

Long story short: My friend and I have known each other for 20 years - she was diagnosed with BPD ten years ago and has been in and out of psychiatric care. She is now living in a psychiatric care facility where she has her own apartment, but has access to trained psychiatric and care personel in order to get through the ordeals of everyday life.

I know that she has never been in specific treatment for BPD, but has been heavily medicated through the years and randomly been seeing psychologists. I really care about her - at heart, she is a great, intelligent, and caring person, yet I must admit that what to me seems like her constant need ""to talk"" is becoming somewhat of a strain on our relationship. She is always frustrated by the limited capacity of the staff where she is living to sit down ""to talk"", which I really do understand as I recognize that she is in pain, but...it just seems that her need ""to talk"" is endless. 
I know from the hundreds of times that we have sat down ""to talk"" that basically what she means by it is to cry and just say how bad she feels. It must be so horrible to feel like this, but I also know by now that nothing is accomplished or bettered by it - sometimes I wonder whether this need ""to talk"" is something akin to an addiction of hers. On the rare occasions that she is feeling good, we have sometimes briefly touched upon the possibility of her entering specialized therapy for BPD, but she is very reluctant about this, as she says that she feels it will be too hard on her and make her commit suicide. 

What could you imagine that I could do to help her? Lending an ear clearly does not do anything more that keep her afloat very temporarily.  Thanks so much in advance for any advice for a caring, but tired friend. :)"

2367,"Hi all, I have just been diagnosed with BPD after years and years of suffering since I was about 13 (I’m now 20). I’m having an absolute nightmare. I currently take Citalopram for the anxious side of things but NOTHING helps the other aspects other than just riding them out. I’m currently reading countless books on the disorder and trying to figure out how to help myself and as positive as I’m trying to be, every knock back just makes me wonder why I even bother.

Does anyone have ANY tips that help even slightly! Please"
2368,Hi I’m a newbie ! Not sure how all this works but will give it my best 😊
2369,"My ex wife has BPD. At least this is my non-professional diagnosis after many years of a confusing marriage. It was the main cause of our marriage failing. I moved out a few years ago and our relationship is much better now. I'm no longer compelled to put up with her moods or try to fix things for the sake of harmony. She no longer has the same power over me and it's been liberating for me. 

The problem I have now is that my children are growing up with a BPD parent. My 14 year old is starting to clash with her mom more often (as teenagers do) and because of the BPD the conflicts are very damaging and unsettling for her. She's now noticing the ways that her mom will punish her (and others) emotionally. It's painful to watch from a distance. I feel terrible that I'm not there to shield her or be a buffer from this, but I am thankful that I have a place of my own where we can both be safe. Living with me full time won't work at this time, so I'd like to figure out how to best support her while she's still living with her mom. 

Do I tell my daughter that I think her mom has BPD so that she can learn to cope and know that it's not her fault? Is that overstepping boundaries? I know it's not an official diagnosis, but after years of trying to figure out what was wrong I'm certain it's accurate. I want to support my daughter(s) the best way I can, and I don't know how much is too much."
