After living in different countries,1,mllk2z,0,"Just wanting to share my experiences with dissociation after frequent moves. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

I‚Äôm 26 and have lived in Australia, Canada and England since I left Ireland at 18.

I‚Äôm back in Ireland now and I‚Äôll remember my life in Canada or Australia, go back to that moment mentally and then start feeling insane trying to work out how I got here again.

I also will frequently see doppelg√§ngers of people I knew in other countries, in my hometown which also makes me feel crazy/like I‚Äôm in a Truman show situation.

My ex from Canada wrote to wish me a happy Easter and, despite living together and dating for over 2 years, I felt like I didn‚Äôt know her at all. I remember everything but the only feeling attached is confusion... everything is just ‚Äúhow did I get here? Was that (past life) really me?‚Äù"
Do you experience physical symptoms of anxiety in social situations? The physical symptoms can be intense and diminish your quality of life so it‚Äôs time to stop minimizing and to start being validated.

Dissociation or just triggered??,2,mlfj98,3,"So i read about the recent news of Farhan Tawhid and i read his entire suicide note as well. I took a moment to really comprehend what he did and his story.. and then all of a sudden i felt really weird. Like, i was tearing up which was normal but i feel like i‚Äôm empty? (the sort of feeling you get at gas stations, airports, etc. I think the word is liminal spaces.) Anyway yeah so i felt like everything in my life just came to an end too and idk what to do next and it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a wall in my brain i can‚Äôt continue doing my work for some reason. 

I didn‚Äôt even know him personally... it just hit me really hard. So idk why i‚Äôm feeling this way, it‚Äôs also the same feeling i get when my favorite show comes to an end, and i feel lost and stuck, yk 

but yeah thanks for listening!! any advice would be helpful"
I can't believe there's a normal world with happy and optimistic people out there,30,mldecs,9,It doesn't feel real. All I'm capable of is extreme escapism. Every little confrontation with something out my isolated hermit life is disturbing me. Life's a nuisance. It's like waiting for death. 50 more years to go for avarage life expectancy. Each day is an eternity of  in itself.
adderall,3,mla1t2,6,"for people struggling, I had mild dissociation  with really bad brain fog and I didn't realize it was dissociation  until I spoke with my therapist. I was prescribed  Adderall for my extreme fatigue and fog and it gets rid of everything and i can function. you need to be diagnosed with adhd though. I know it's hard for some to get doctors to take dissociation seriously so honestly lie about adhd if you don't have it. it's your body. you know how you feel, you know what might work and might not. but again, Adderall changed my life completely. I'm not afraid of mornings or being alone anymore."

Dissociation or Something Else,2,ml3b8j,2,"I had an interesting experience the other day. Im not sure whether this is a dissociation or something different entirely. Any advice is appreciated. So I was just sitting around in my living room, avoiding doing work and I zoned out for what I thought was a few minutes, maybe 5 tops, similar to daydream but nothing really focused on you know. However when I look at my phone again I realize that almost 2 hours have gone by. I have absolutely no recollection of this two hours,  and I know I wasn't asleep. I came back to in the same exact position that I was initially in, so it is unlikely that anything occurred during that period. There was no trigger for this, at least that I am aware of.  For reference this isn't the first time something like this has happened, I used to occasionally have mild dissociations when driving to and from school and work when I was younger, along with mild dissociation due to gender dysphoria. So what I'm asking is this a type of dissociation or rather something different. I am just looking for a springboard idea of sorts, a place to start to research and learn. Thanks!"

"I feel like i‚Äôm going crazy, someone please help me",9,ml2hn8,9,"Two months ago I had an extremely bad trip after smoking very strong weed with my boyfriend (I‚Äôm not a weed smoker) 10 minutes after that I didn‚Äôt feel like myself and I was saying and doing things I would never normally say and I didn‚Äôt even
feel real for two weeks after that. 

I was fine until I failed my driving exam, something I‚Äôve been waiting forever to take because of covid and had high hopes for and ever since then I believe that I‚Äôve been experiencing dissociation/depersonalization, the best way I can explain it is I‚Äôve almost convinced myself that everyone is an actor or is fake and that I‚Äôm fake and my mind just feels clouded. Some days all I can do is cry because this feeling isn‚Äôt me, Is it normal to have this feeling for so long? Is this a mental illness? Can this lead to a serious mental illness like schizophrenia?

Other mental health problems?,11,ml0zx7,7,I feel like dissociating or obsessing/thinking about it 24/7 is making me over obsess of me thinking i might get other mental health problems
Confused?,2,ml07ow,2,"I dont know if this is a symptom of dissociation but whats starting to bother me is that it feels like there‚Äôs something like a viel separating me from the world, and like i can feel my tongue at times and i am self aware of what my body is feeling n its rlly weird.

Emotions while dissociating,1,mkz1tw,2,"I feel light headed and dizzy. I feel my emotions i find things funny and what not i just dont feel real thats the thing.

I feel like there are different people inside me? Please help?,7,mkyy5h,9,"Today, I was in the shower, I looked at my body, and I just dissociated the fuck out. Happens from time to time. My head was in a fog, I felt completely numb. When I felt a little bit more clear, I felt..younger? Like I felt like a child. Later, I had dinner with my parents, and I (?) was acting totally strangely. I physically felt smaller, more tiny, and I pretty much acted like a child. All the while I was thinking *""Who the hell is this?? Why are you so weird???""* Now I think I'm back. A while ago I was getting ready to sleep, and then suddenly I felt very overjoyed, and I felt like my name was Steven, even though that was not my name. I also felt like a different gender.

This is not the first time something like this happened. I remember I was having another dissociation episode a while ago and I heard two people(?) arguing inside my head. Also, when I was being verbally abused, I felt like a totally different person. This other character would come inside my head, and basically try to protect me. They (?) would think **""I have to protect (my name), this is my purpose. I have to make sure that (my name) is safe.""** After the threat was over, I would sorta feel like myself again. All I know that this person is older, and probably female. Not sure though.

Who am I? Am I even myself? What is this? Please somebody help me"

Random onset dissociation ??,1,mkoipk,2,"I see that the majority of dissociation can be attributed to some sort of serious trauma. I personally have no serious trauma, and about 3 months ago I developed some pretty bad dissociation very randomly. I have had issues with anxiety in the past, although it was mostly social anxiety, and I was on meds for it for about a year, but I‚Äôve been off those for  4 years now and I‚Äôve been able to cope quite well. I‚Äôve been trying to live a healthy lifestyle with the hope that this would go away, but it hasn‚Äôt yet, and I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience with some sort of unexplained dissociation.

Unsure if I‚Äôm experiencing dissociation,2,mkn1i7,3,"hi all, i‚Äôve struggled with severe mental health issues since i (24f) was 13 years old but have had anxiety for as long as i can remember. a couple weeks ago my therapist asked if i‚Äôve ever experienced dissociation but i didn‚Äôt really know what it was after she described it but i said no. but yesterday i think i might have experienced it but am not sure...i woke up already depressed and anxious. things just didn‚Äôt feel that real when i tried to go about my day. i couldn‚Äôt concentrate on doing work and looking at my phone was a lot. i don‚Äôt know how to describe how it felt to be honest. my head felt full and kind of hazy. the world around me felt strange when i tried to ground myself outside. do you think this was me dissociating? it lasted pretty much entire day. and no worries i will tell my therapist about it when i talk to her later this week"

Can I get some help?,2,mkfbgd,4,"Pretty sure this is the right place to post and just warning there is slight mention of self harm...

This is like the only way I can explain it. It‚Äôs kinda like when you look at an optical illusion for a while then look at a wall and it moves and shifts but like make it the rest of your vision and everything moves, kinda like being high which I feel like I‚Äôm not very entitled to say cause I‚Äôve been high once and didn‚Äôt have a good experience. I feel like I‚Äôm watching my world shift from and inch or two behind my normal view of sight and everything is a little more blurry than it should be. 
I could be sitting in one spot and everything starts shift up and I feel like I‚Äôm moving down but I‚Äôm not physically moving and nothing feels real.

This also happens sometimes throughout the day when I‚Äôm just walking, or in school or anything like that and time is just gone. I‚Äôm in class at 8 or 9 and all of a sudden I‚Äôm already at lunch and ready to leave. Like I realize I went through the first few hours and I can sort of recognize what happened and have certain memories of that part of the day but it‚Äôs all one big blur. 

I‚Äôve been trying to focus on not self harming and I‚Äôm trying really hard not to and I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough unless I do it and there‚Äôs my other post, I feel inadequate, or something idk but I was just laying down scrolling through Reddit and everything was not real, well it was but it didn‚Äôt feel like it, it felt like for a second like I was high again but having nothing in my system and I was on the verge of having a panic attack. 

I felt shifted back from my normal vision, it wasn‚Äôt exactly tunnel vision but it definitely didn‚Äôt feel right. I could only focus on my breath and realized I had started breathing heavily and everything was moving sort of laggy and slow compared to normal. It‚Äôs the first time this has actually kind of scared me into thinking nothing is real and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I‚Äôve told my mom about it and she says I don‚Äôt have enough trauma for my brain to resort to dissociating and splitting from reality and she says I‚Äôm sleep deprived, vitamin deficient and maybe it‚Äôs just my way of living.. but I‚Äôve only started really experiencing it big time in the last 9-10 months and my memory has gone to shit and everything is almost constantly shifting and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Could someone possibly give some advice other than go see a doctor or therapist cause right now that‚Äôs not an option...?"
How do you know you have trauma if you don't remember it?,16,mkeqew,12,"If a person forgets about their trauma, how to they know they were abused? How do you know you were abused if you don't remember any specific events?"
My story/venting.,3,mk9qh0,1,I've been dissociated now for 3 years.  I've had childhood trauma where I was abused by my father for 7 years non stop almost every day verbally and sometimes physically threatened and yelled at and insulted day in and day out. I've always had anxiety but 3 years ago I was put into a situation with someone from my school when i was in high school. And it reminded me of how i felt when I was with my dad but I felt powerless to fight back or do anything because I felt embarrassed. And since then I've been dissociated. Dissociated non stop for 3 years. I cant even remember really when I was last happy. I've been to 6 different therapists with no luck. It hasn't helped me. At this point I dont really know what to do and I wonder if Ill ever be happy again.

Dealing with amnesia,7,mj7yc0,9,"Good day! 

I am struggling with dissociation since my teen years due to childhood and adolescence trauma.
What bothers me the most is the dissociation leading to chronic amnesia.

Examples like me telling me friends the same news twice on separate events because I forgot I already told them. I forget whether I have eaten today. 

When I'm going through very stressful times (like I do now, I'm learning for my a levels) I even forget what I did each day and struggle to remember what I taught myself.

Now, here's my question: How do you deal with the amnesia that comes with dissociation? 

Should I be writing down everything I do and reread it? Should I just let it be and accept it?

Is it gonna get worse? What if I struggle to remember very important life events?
 Can I restore my lost memories? 

Thank you in advance!"
Apparently I‚Äôve been Dissociating at work and didn‚Äôt even know it,4,mj7mun,6,"So I started a new job at a specialty coffee business and this isn‚Äôt my first time working in a fast paced environment. 

This is my second coffee gig but my first post-ish pandemic. 

I‚Äôve been navigating the stress to the best of my ability but my manager pointed out something to me that I found concerning:

Sometimes I stand for long periods of time doing nothing. And I have no recollection of doing so. 

I‚Äôm familiar with dissociation. I‚Äôve done it before, but I‚Äôve never blacked out so hard it affected my work performance. 

In result I‚Äôve decided to leave in good faith with the company to go to a more intensive therapy, but I‚Äôm terrified because I‚Äôve never experienced this deep of a dissociation unless I‚Äôm literally being berated/yelled at. 

Does anyone completely black out like this? Apparently it‚Äôs debilitating my work ethic and it scares the shit out of me."
Tips for helping physical dissociation?,2,mj4yuh,5,"I‚Äôve tried many different meds, I try rubbing my arms and light scratching, 54321 grounding method, deep breathing exercises, pushing down on my feet, etc.. but my body loves to physically dissociate (being unable to feel my body and my mind feels miles away)... I‚Äôm starting a new job next week and I‚Äôm nervous lol. Therapist said to keep trying those methods and maybe it‚Äôll go away??

Second time dissociation,4,mj40bm,1,"Hey, one year ago i got out of a dissociation through hard working (on my feelings and identity....) but i hadn‚Äôt had enough time to heal completely and a couple of months ago university started. i wasn‚Äôt ready... because of the sudden stress and pressure i dissociated so much that i forgot most of my old dissociations and can‚Äôt work on my past anymore bc everything is so foreign to me. It‚Äôs so much stronger and different compared to the first time dissociating

Can anyone relate? I really don‚Äôt know what to do now..."

Being a better partner while having a dissociation disorder,3,miyaej,3,"I'm currently with someone that I consider is my very best friend and the love of my life. I'm very happy and lucky to have him in my life but I know how hard it can be with myself sometimes or how tough it can be when I go through episodes or recover from them. I accept how I am and he does too because he's amazing, but how can I really ensure that I'm not letting my disorder control some aspects of how I deal with things or my relationship? 

Recently I've really focused on how I deal with problems or situations. It's very easy for me to shutdown and I recognize that it very much affects other people around me even if it's not my intention. It gets very hard to speak or have linear thoughts or recognize social cues when I dissociate but I am working on it. I know communication is a big answer for so many things and i don't want to be unfair to my significant other and just shut down because it isn't fair to him. I've been working on just trying really hard to open myself up and ask questions or talk things out when things get hard (something I really struggled with, sometimes he would have to even ask for me to say anything because speaking up was so hard) and I can say that I recognize improvement on this behalf ever since then. I love him with all of my heart and I just really want to be better and be the best that I can be so I can truly make him as happy as he makes me and so I can just be the best version of myself. I want to make sure that my actions reflect my intentions even if it's hard to speak out sometimes, he just deserves the best.

This is one of my main problems but I really want to and is actively working on this but I don't want to lose hindsight of progress. Do you guys have any tips on how you ensure that you're really seeing the big picture in your relationship and on how you try to progress from having a dissociation disorder for yourself? Or how do you guys deal with dissociation in your personal relationships/friendships to where you can make sure your partner gets the love that they deserve? Thank you for reading and any tips would help!"

Forgetting I've told people things...feeling out of it etc,5,miv00n,1,"Hi, I'm 21 and I have a lot of experience with dissociating...especially ever since covid started it seems to have gotten worse. Anyway I'm in therapy and essentially it's seen as my coping mechanism when things make me anxious and what not. 

Usually i experience this unsettling feeling where everything outside of me feels off and almost like everything is glitching if that makes sense? Often it's very subtle and grounding techniques can get my mind off it but occasionally it becomes very prominent and takes over me and I begin to panic.

For the last I would say 2 weeks I started noticing subtly that I don't feel like anything that has happened actually happened, which again I'm often used to, but it's been for a prolonged period and I'm finding that I cannot connect with things and events that happened the day before seem like they happened ages ago.

Another thing I've been noticing is forgetfulness, I will tell someone something and they would tell me I've told them before but I would have absolutely no recollection of doing so which is weird? I've also been much more tired recently but this could do with the fact I've been on 3 different antibiotics in the last 3 weeks for a persistent uti.

I guess I'm wondering if I should be worried?"
Clinical dissociation from working long hours on computer?,4,mitiw6,2,"I work really crazy hours in front of a computer, sometimes 100+ hours per week, mostly programming. I basically work Elon Musk hours (but unfortunately without the billionaire wage).

Lately I've been feeling extremely dissociated, sometimes so intensely it fills me with panic. I look at my arms and body, and it's like I'm looking at a different person. I feel mentally detached, like I'm on autopilot or my conscious mind is somewhere else. I feel like I'm on low-level psychedelic drugs, just not in a fun way. I keep reminding myself that if something was truly broken with my head I wouldn't be such a productive software engineer. People who are dying can't do super high-level cognitive tasks.

Obviously getting away from the computer would help, but my job is super demanding and it's not realistic for me to cut my workload. I'm making a lot of money and I'm responsible for a lot of other people's jobs, I can't just stop working like this for probably at least another 12 months.

Is there anything I can do to come back to reality a little? Some kind of medication or exercises?"
How to recognize when you‚Äôre beginning to dissociate.,13,misznj,2,"I have trouble with hard conversations or talking about my trauma. I want to help both my partner and I have the tools to recognize an oncoming episode of dissociation. 

I recognize that when I start floating away, no actual problems are getting solved. I want to be able to problem solve rationally, without getting overwhelmed and feeling like a basket case. 

I feel like grounding and coming back to reality after it‚Äôs already happened is one thing. But I want to be proactive with nipping these episodes in the bud beforehand. 

My partner doesn‚Äôt recognize when my eyes are glazing over and I‚Äôve gone quiet. He‚Äôs a Chatty Cathy, and will keep talking. It‚Äôs not intentional, and I know he feels bad, and doesn‚Äôt want to make it worse. I think it would help to figure out how to communicate when he‚Äôs lost me. How can I help both myself, and him recognize that oncoming state of overwhelm to slow it down and handle it gently? 

What methods do you guys use? What are some things that have and haven‚Äôt worked for you?"
Some work coping skills?,2,mir6xl,0,"So I want to ask people who would understand how I'm feeling. I started my first job, I'm 19, I've worked places before but only as a volunteer because I couldn't commit. I got my new job and it makes me dissociate all day long. I'm getting bullied there by some of the other girls, my family tells me to tell them off but I'm not even present to be able to do anything. On top of that when I get home I go crazy with impulsive behaviors like drinking, cutting, yelling at people for nothing. I decided to post because it's the weekend and I got my check and I was thinking about buying cocaine. Idk why I'm behaving like this at a time in my life I have been most productive. I am, by all means, ""happier"" than I have been in a long long time. I love this job. I love what I do and it could not be a better fit for me. Maybe it's because of my first 2 weeks, less friend interaction, or maybe it's because I have to re associate at the end of the day when I'm already tired. I've been working closing so when I get home I am exhausted but wanna have fun. Maybe I'm ranting for no reason, I just want to know how to go to work and stay me and how to enjoy being where I am when I'm there."
I think I made my nephew dissociate - did I react in a bad way?,10,miqmov,4,"He is 4 years old and said the word ""bitch"" and I told him in a calm and warm tone that it's not a nice word and that people feel offended by it but that it's ok that he didn't know the meaning of the word. He was so ashamed by this, that he wouldn't look me in the eyes and when I called his name he didn't react. I took him in my arms and apologized, but he was like a lifeless doll, said no word, no eye contact, tears rolling down his cheeks. I held him in my arms and then I told him that it was my fault for being insensitive and that I didn't want to shame him and so on... I thought that leaving him alone in this situation as for ""giving him space"" would just make him stuffing it down and forgetting it, so I stayed sitting next to him and just ""being there"" with him. After a while he went out for some minutes, came back and we went on playing..
I don't know if this really was dissociation, but I felt so sad for him, it was awfull. It reminded me so much of myself. I think I know how he was feeling: worthless, unworthy of forgiveness and love, abandonable.
I don't know if I reacted in a bad way. Should I have given him space?"
Help please,8,mikjct,4,"Starting early in march i had a depersonalization episode and i kept having them for no reason at all maybe because of relationship stress, but now since im not stressing over relationships i feel im lost and dont know what to do with life.

Harming myself?,14,mik4g4,3,"The more i look into dissociating the more i feel lost, is me obsessing over dissociating causing me to dissociate more and can it be harmful long term"
Is this dissociation?,19,mi4pvp,3,"When you live your life on autopilot and with depression (for me also pure-O OCD), then after a few years something suddenly ‚Äúwakes you up‚Äù to what your life has come to.

How it isn‚Äôt what you wanted at all, you didn‚Äôt take the time to focus on what your heart truly desires, you settled for less, you hung out with completely wrong people, you made many wrong decisions, and you didn‚Äôt care enough to go on the right path, and now it‚Äôs too late.

It‚Äôs like you see ruins after a war, but now you can‚Äôt do anything about it. All because you weren‚Äôt ever completely present in the moment to notice the unfullfillment inside you, and you didn‚Äôt take care of yourself.

And because everything suddenly feels so strange, you feel disconnected with reality, and prefer to escape it as much as possible, with excessive daydreaming and internet use over many hours of the day.

I mean, I was always kind of a loner, but I always kinda routinely ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù myself with watching old videos from Youtubers every few months, and I kinda got some insight on what has happened since the time i last watched them, and that was how I got ‚Äúguidance‚Äù on my life (and what I should do next) from my ‚Äúpast‚Äù self..?

Got diagnosed with DID and am overwhelmed,7,mi3guy,11,Did testing for dissociative identity disorder today and met the criteria for a diagnosis. I‚Äôm very confused as I‚Äôve always thought of people with did much like the movies but my therapists said people can have it more subtly and be more high functioning. I don‚Äôt feel like I have multiple personalities but I do have a lot of blackouts and memory loss from disassociation so who knows how I act when I can‚Äôt remember. I‚Äôm a little fearful of this diagnosis and what it may mean about my brain and how things have gotten. I thought this was all just severe dissociation but knowing something else may be at play is very frightening
Does anyone take SSRIs?,12,mhtwhs,32,"Ive been prescripted setraline (zoloft) for depression, anxiety etc and mood swings. i did inform the doctor i dissociate daily (im always flicking in and out, for longer periods when im tired or in social situations) but he didnt ask any questions about it and didnt mention it at all. just said he recommends i go on medication. im really really worried about taking SSRIs for many of the potential side effects and fear of the unknown, but im wondering how it could or if it will impact the dissociating at all? positively or negatively?? anyone else? currently not recieving therapy either which is another reason im so worried of starting the medication, without further support"

Dissociation Episode in Airport Today,6,mhlevv,8,"So it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve been around a huge crowd of people since COVID really took a huge toll on everything. Alongside my dissociative disorder, I have extreme, EXTREME anxiety. I had been nervous about getting on a plane, but mostly nervous about going through the airport. TSA, long lines and so many people coming and going from all over the world gives me a tad bit of anxiety. Take in mind, I also was traveling alone through the airport today and that might‚Äôve contributed to the huge episode I had while waiting to board my plane. 

First arriving to the airport, I start to experience some uneasiness. Mostly some slight shaking of my hands and feeling a bit nervous going through TSA. I just start to notice all the people there and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how ‚Äú all I need to do is board the plane, and I‚Äôll be OK.‚Äù I started to notice something was off with my brain when I got past TSA. I was on the underground bus sitting down waiting for my stop when all of a sudden, I started feeling so strange. The bus was kind of shifting on the floor very subtlety and it threw me off but I eventually shrugged off the weird feelings I was having, I got up... And I walked off the bus. 

As I‚Äôm approaching the boarding area for my flight, I noticed I was an entire hour early. A surge of panic started jolting through my body and my brain. I felt very disconnected from the world around me. As if, I was a strange entity invading the space around me. I felt so far away from people mentally. I ended up going on and out of the bathroom, 5 different times before the flight left. It got so bad, I thought I was going to have to ask someone for medical attention. My heart was pounding out of my chest, light headed, very very dehydrated and really disoriented. I tried to throw up in the bathroom, for the uneasiness was so disturbing, I felt physically sick. I was hyper away of myself being nervous and felt as if it was so bad, I was making others alarmed around me. I tried tapping exercises in the bathroom stall before going back out to sit and waiting for my plane, but it seemed like a endless feeling of dread and a peculiar sense that consumed my mind. 
 
‚ÄúWill this feeling ever go away?‚Äù 

I couldn‚Äôt think a single, positive thought as I drifted off in to this disturbing mind space. On top of things, my phone was on low battery. I called my boyfriend and managed to get words out and talk about what I was going through. Hearing a familiar voice sometimes helps with the dissociative episodes but I felt so far gone. 

I found a charging outlet and convinced myself to get through whatever was happening. All I could think about was wanting to just pass out and not exist anymore. It was so scary feeling so out of my own body in a room full of so many people I did not know. 

As a side note; I took some CBD oil thinking it would calm me down but it did the exact opposite. I‚Äôm not sure if the oil only worded my situation or it just didn‚Äôt cure my anxiety this time. Either way, I plan on staying away from CBD oil and I‚Äôm going to try to avoid traveling by myself. 

As far as dissociation, it is a very real and scary thing when you‚Äôre by yourself and no one is there to assure you of anything. Does anyone else‚Äôs dissociation co-sign with their anxiety attacks? I feel as if they happen for me at the same time, just making my experiences worst overall."
"Experiencing something weird, not sure if dissociation and could use advice",4,mhj3b5,7,"I‚Äôve been experiencing a sensation recently where I will be on my phone typing, playing a game, scrolling etc and all of a sudden I will stop recognizing my hands. It feels like they‚Äôre typing and moving completely independent of my brain and I don‚Äôt even recognize them as a part of my body. it isn‚Äôt like I actually forget they‚Äôre my hands, I consciously know that they both belong on my body and that they are mine. its more like I just am suddenly not involved in their activity and they appear to be foreign and unattached to my existence.

I am naturally a very anxious person. my mental health has taken a harsh hit over the past year, and new anxiety symptoms have been showing up in my everyday life. is this an experience that could be tied to some form of dissociation/dissociative disorder? I also am pretty sure I have undiagnosed attention deficit disorder, so my focus and attention are sometimes less in my control as well. does any of this sound similar to anyone else‚Äôs experiences? should I be worried?"
psychiatrist made me feel like i have no hope,23,mhfxo3,7,"im not sure if psychiatrist is the right word but whoever can prescribe pills/diagnose is who im talking about, anyway awhile back maybe 2/3 months ago i had an appointment with her for the forst time because my therapist thought it might be helpful to get medication and a proper diagnosis. she seemed really sweet but once i mentioned dissociation it seemed like she didnt really care, i eventually ended up being diagnosed with ptsd and given zoloft but it dodnt work and i stopped on my own accord because i felt helpless. i keep thinking anout it all and it feels uncurable. and its So hard to find anyone that specializes in dissociation disorders and when u do they r booked up for months. i feel so stuck. :( just a rant :("

Visual remnants of DPDR,10,mha2wb,6,So I‚Äôve had to deal with DPDR for about 2 years now. I believe the main cause of it for me was marijuana but I‚Äôm not too sure. Over the last year I‚Äôve quite weed and have worked on improving my thoughts to combat my dissociation. However there is one symptom that I don‚Äôt know how to deal with. The best way I can explain it is my vision always seems a layer away from reality and I‚Äôm separated a bit. I no longer feel actually distanced from reality and things don‚Äôt look weird anymore to me. But I still have a visual distance that I don‚Äôt know how to go about fixing. Would trying to ignore it and act like I don‚Äôt have it fix it? Or should I be more aware of it? Any help is greatly appreciated
Has anyone else felt this before.,25,mgu9ir,11,"Do you ever feel so impossibly empty, that you aren't sure where anything starts or where it ends? Like you're floating at the bottom of the sea, or walking through pitch-black darkness? The thoughts in my head, are they mine? The things I say, do really I mean them, or am I saying things out of social expectation?

I had a psychotic break four years ago after a traumatic event. Lost a substantial amount of memories, probably won't ever get most of them back. The memories I do remember, they feel... reconstructed. As though they were something that happened to someone else.

I don't recognize myself, because all I see in the mirror is a face and a body that has never really felt like mine.

I thought I'd adjusted as well as I could. Some days harder than others, and all that. I though I was moving on and making my peace with all of it. Engaging in all the right things like work, hobbies, and so on. Even through 2020, I managed quite well.

Until I couldn't do it anymore. Something I only ever seem to realise in retrospect.

Lately I feel like an impostor stuck inside a stranger's skin again. It feels like some VR game gone horribly wrong. I don't know why that feeling came back. I haven't felt it in a long time.

Everything has spread out too far and nothing feels real. My emotions aren't mine. I just...watch this body feel them, in some strangely removed sense. I cannot focus on anything. I have to work so much harder at being ""present"" when I'm really somehow a million miles away.

That's the thing about the emptiness, isn't it. The distance from everything is welcome, until the distance *is* everything, and whatever existed before feels like it's gone.

Not really sure what the point of writing this is. Wondering if anyone can relate maybe."
does anyone else get hit with reality?,26,mge9vi,8,"it seems to me to sort of be the opposite of disassociation. at random moments i‚Äôll just be hit with the fact that i am alive i go to school i live with my family i exist i can feel and see and hear and touch things. it‚Äôs really uncomfortable when it hits especially if i‚Äôm in the middle of doing something. it can also mean i think fuck what if life isn‚Äôt real, what if this is all a dream or a joke or some other big scary thing. i‚Äôve talked to other people about it but i‚Äôve never heard of anyone else experiencing it. i couldn‚Äôt even put it into words to google it. please let me know if you experience it/ know if it‚Äôs normal"

Losing my taste with dissociation,0,mg8u4x,2,"I have DID, because it is genetic within my family and my sister also heavilyI recently have acquired this new ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù in which I can‚Äôt really taste when i dissociate. It‚Äôs a weird thing, I‚Äôm not really sure what triggers it. But I will be eating something (usually my favorite foods, bagels and baklava and my favorite iced coffee) and they seem to have a lack of taste and I can still feel the texture of the food but the taste of it is barely there and I if I think too much about the fact that I can‚Äôt taste, it gets to a point where there is no taste at all. I‚Äôm not sure what triggers it but I am fully aware of when it happens. And it freaks me out that I can‚Äôt enjoy my favorite foods anymore. Maybe because it is too ‚Äúexciting‚Äù or overwhelming that I can‚Äôt handle it? I don‚Äôt know.. let me know if this happens to anyone who suffers from DID. Thanks y‚Äôall üôÇ"
"Rarely dissociated for years, now I get an episode at least once every 1-2 weeks",3,mg7kxv,4,"Is it common to go years rarely having dissociative episodes only to suddenly get them constantly? I would only get them if I was extremely stressed on rare occasions, but after recently pulling up possible flashbacks, I'm getting them all the time. I don't even think these flashbacks are real memories (they're memories related to preschool, but I loved preschool and never was scared to go, so I don't believe these are genuine flashbacks) but my brain seems to be treating them as genuine. So I'm having lots of episodes where I feel very detached from my body and reality, I have waves of intense emotion where I really want to bawl my eyes out before snapping back to an emotionless state, and I feel like my body is a robot. Sometimes I think of what might be flashbacks and I curl up violently and try to cry. These episodes last for hours and will sometimes continue even after I wake up from an episode.
Is this something that is common or is what I'm experiencing not dissociation and something else entirely? Google results says that's what dissociating is but I have so much doubt towards what I'm experiencing. Trying to get a therapist but with the pandemic going in, it's hard to get anyone right now, so I've just been feeling lost and confused for the last several months."
I love it,4,mg7j0p,3,Does anyone else kinda love dissociation? And dissociating. It helps me escape the real world. I wish I could never leave the feeling honestly.
I'm curious if anyone has had a medical explanation for their symptoms.,5,mfweic,1,"I've been hit by this junk pretty hard for a little while now. The onset was so rapid and ""unprovoked"" that I'm wondering if there might be a physiological element to what's happening. I know certain issues specifically in the temporal lobe can cause DRDP symptoms. I even read an interesting paper relating symptoms to vestibular dysfunction (aka vertigo). I'm hanging in there, but the persistence and timing of this just doesn't seem to fit a psychological explanation (although, I'd take a psych-cause over a brain tumor, epilepsy or stroke damage any day)."

"Can the ADA help, if dissociation makes my job impossible?",11,mfrgpw,1,"So I've been dissociated to various degrees for most of my life, but now I've reached the point (working at home during the pandemic has contributed mightily to this) where my job has just about gotten too hard for me to do anymore. I've been pondering retiring to a simple life in Mexico. But I was wondering if there was any chance I could leverage my condition (with formal diagnosis) to get my boss to structure my job in such a way that it's sustainable. The ADA includes mental health conditions, and employers are supposed to make reasonable accommodations, but I'm wondering just how much leverage it could give me. I'd be willing to take a cut in pay and job title, commensurate with whatever duties I have post-restructuring."
It‚Äôs a start,11,mff20j,5,"So we have had validation from a psychotherapist that we aren‚Äôt faking and that what we are experiencing is real and is okay since we have been working on internal communication 

We have periods in which their is denial and blockage of switches which appears to cause headaches or migraines. So We really want to be open with them but still struggling with the reality of it despite the fact that more than one mental health person has now commented 

We‚Äôre waiting for a psychiatrist appointment now and on top of all that we believe that we are on the autistic spectrum, so that‚Äôs fun 

And so much dissociation lately too and don‚Äôt even know if we mad about it either

how to live w/ dissociation?,23,mf5l5r,6,"So the past 2 or so months my dissociation has gotten a considerable amount worse and i still haven‚Äôt learned to live with it ig? Sometimes i feel like i‚Äôm not myself in my head or there are two different people in my head, it‚Äôs kind of distressing. I‚Äôve talked to medical professionals and they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs only dissociation but how do i live with it without panicking myself every other hour? for instance i‚Äôll be sitting and i just think hmmm having a body is weird, my voice sounds weird, or the worst what if life isn‚Äôt real. It‚Äôs hard to get these thoughts to go away and they‚Äôre very unsettling. In other word how do i stop questioning everything, how do i stop believing i my dissociation (ie. life is a simulation, not being real) Help would be greatly appreciated"

Long-term dissociation and Getting worse (years),26,mewk9l,6,I feel like I'm.. Degrading fast and hard. Its been bad for years but the stress and anxiety and the covid-ity of the world and my personal life makes it so much worse.

Possible DID?,10,mevv8x,5,"Anyone with DID or knowledge of it I was wondering what you think? So I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs been going on but on top of my dpdr I‚Äôve been experiencing odd things. I researched and DID came up but I‚Äôm not sure it fits because I don‚Äôt feel I have alters with formed identities. Instead it‚Äôs subtle changes in my identity that do not feel like my usual self, emotions and memories that do not fit with what I am doing, and sometimes I‚Äôll just have a feeling like I‚Äôm a different age or even gender and do things that cause me to question why I would say or do that. I still identify this as me but at the same time it‚Äôs confusing.

Edited to add that I have running conversations in my head all the time that I feel almost left out of or like they are kind of far away if that makes sense. Nothing bad or scary just stuff that doesn‚Äôt fit with what I‚Äôm doing which I‚Äôve always just ignored even though it can be distracting."
Question,2,meqay5,2,I have not been getting enough sleep lately and I feel a little bit out of place and I forget stuff easy and I feel like I‚Äôm not always 100% in the world and I also have ocd and anxiety is it normal to become dissociated when these things combine or just on there own?
Anyone else ever aware enough that you talk during dissociation?,33,meilck,15,I've been dealing with dissociation over the last several weeks as a response to being fired from my job. Has anyone else ever experienced having a conversation while you are dissociating? It's strange because I feel like I'm lucid but I also feel like I'm not. Sometimes I try to speak and no words come out but sometimes I talk but I feel like I'm literally in no control of what I'm saying because I have no control and feel like I'm just watching myself do all this.
"Fear of ""my"" reflection?",29,medarb,3,"Hey guys, it's my first post here. After being treated and medicated for depression and anxiety, I'm not seeing any improvement in my symptoms. They used to be mild but now they are getting to a point where they affect my life.

I don't know if it's dissociation, I don't really know what this is actually, but I can't see my reflection. I mean, I can perceive the image in the surface but I don't see anyone. Not even myself. I know it is me but I don't see me. I covered my Room's mirror and I avoid seeing me in other reflective surfaces. It terrifies me for some reason to the point I flinch and have to look away. 

What is happening to me? What can I do?"
Dissociative Seizures,4,me9xip,0,"I was diagnosed around 6 years ago with dissociative seizures (and honestly never understood what these or dissociation in general was until recently, I‚Äôve only recently realised that I have huge chunks of my life missing, and that these black outs and ‚Äòweird feelings‚Äô were cause by dissociation - which I still can‚Äôt quite wrap my head around) and while looking into it, I couldn‚Äôt find many people who have this issue. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people describing their experiences with DP/DR, DID, OSDD etc, but not dissociative seizures and I was just wondering if anyone had similar issues and had any advice on how to handle them?

Can I get some help from y‚Äôall?,5,me8wpz,2,"I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this is me even dissociating but my anxiety and stress has gone up quite a bit in the last little while and I‚Äôm constantly out of it. Today in particular I ‚Äúzone out‚Äù but when I do the world shifts. It‚Äôs weird for me to explain and I feel stupid talking about it.

This is like the only way I can explain it. It‚Äôs kinda like when you look at an optical illusion for a while then look at a wall and it moves and shifts but like make it the rest of your vision and everything moves, kinda like being high which I feel like I‚Äôm not very entitled to say cause I‚Äôve been high once and didn‚Äôt have a good experience. I feel like I‚Äôm watching my world shift from and inch or two behind my normal view of sight and everything is a little more blurry than it should be. 
I could be sitting in one spot and everything starts shift up and I feel like I‚Äôm moving down but I‚Äôm not physically moving and nothing feels real.

This also happens sometimes throughout the day when I‚Äôm just walking, or in school or anything like that and time is just gone. I‚Äôm in class at 8 or 9 and all of a sudden I‚Äôm already at lunch and ready to leave. Like I realize I went through the first few hours and I can sort of recognize what happened and have certain memories of that part of the day but it‚Äôs all one big blur. 

Sometimes I don‚Äôt feel real either, actually scratch that, most of the time I don‚Äôt feel real but today, like I said, was pretty bad, and I lifted up my left arm and my vision went wonky, stuff was moving, my view of sight went back a couple inches like I was watching a movie on a big screen and my arm didn‚Äôt feel like mine, it was light and airy and moved fast and had not a lot of control like it had fallen asleep without the pins and needles.

Sorry I feel really dumb saying all this and have no clue if this is the right place to post to get any sort of info and help back. And thanks if you took your time to read this. Sorry"

The Deep and Michelle - what my disassociation looks like to me,2,mdyeuy,0,"I used to think it was normal for people to set their dreams. I get in to bed choose a vision or scenario and press play. Its the same every time: a dream about me wading in clear still water with no top and no bottom. I think i‚Äôm drowning but i‚Äôm not panicking or gasping for air - its all very calm. Funnily, I actually think this is/was me ideating suicide or death. 

The second is me dreaming about a character I watched on TV when I was 14. Sometimes I am her. Sometimes we are together. Kind of like an imaginary friend but less interactive - more watching things play out in the right order. But it‚Äôs this intrusive obsession that cuts in to my life because I take several naps a day to press play and see these two visions - deep waters or Michelle. 

I want to think or dream of other things sometimes but these two bring me so much peace and comfort from my anxiety and internal criticism. Now, I‚Äôm in therapy so I‚Äôm learning not to judge my actions either way but we‚Äôve gotten to the point of talking about my disassociation and I freeze up and insist we talk about something else. In one session I just cried in silence for the whole thing. I know these dreams are not my only disassociation symptoms. I probably have a dozen triggers and symptoms that I don‚Äôt even know of. I‚Äôm sure not every one is watching harry potter and drag race on repeat since lockdown started like some kind of gay wizard hermit. üòÇ"

Has anyone ever tried plant medicine for dissociation?,8,md5nul,18,"Lately I've been getting really fed up with not being able to think, feeling out of body all the time and not cognitively aware of my surroundings and have had a terrible memory.

I recently have discovered a bunch of testimonials on YouTube about plant medicine. Particularly Ayuhasca. And I know any substance like that gets an automatic resistance from a lot of people, but I've been doing a lot of research and what I've found is that it seems to have the ability to heal deep seeded trauma. I've been looking at a center in Costa Rica called Rythmia and it's the world's first medically licensed plant medicine sanctuary where they have trained doctors and staff leading you through a week of Ayuhasca ceremonies that supposedly 93% of people have life changing events. 

I was wondering if anyone here has tried such a thing. What your experience was and did it help at all with dissociation?

Thank you for your time."

Tips to prevent dissociation during an interview?,7,mch6ab,5,"I started getting panic attacks again in December and was put on 40mg Propranolol 3 x a day.

Wth??,2,mbythj,4,"This is my first Reddit post, but I feel like I need help and advice. So my reasoning for posting under this community is not to undermine, stereotype, or put out misinformation. It is more for my own mental help. 

Okay so about a year in a half ago I realized I started having amnesia episodes. I think what made me first realize is when I would be driving. I would start at one destination and either black out and come back to being there in a matter of seconds, or come back and realize that I‚Äôm completely lost and have no clue where the hell i am. There were multiple scary times where it‚Äôs happened and I‚Äôve had break downs or panic attacks, because it‚Äôs a scary situation to be put in. At that time I weighed my options and after a while longer of these episodes happening I cut out driving. This was a very hard decision with me being in my prime time and just getting my license. Although I told my parent about my situationist was brushed off, and became a very sensitive topic for me. They would say things like ‚Äúwhy have your license if you‚Äôre never able to drive‚Äù and although I know it wasn‚Äôt meant to be hurtful it, made me feel so useless. Jump ahead a bit and what made me really realize something was wrong is when I was at college. My first two weeks there, I thought I was adjusting pretty well. With covid going on, being away from my family, and some shit not working out how it was suppose to. My mom would call me everyday, and I would get up and go to class, call my friends all normal shit. Well I guess subconsciously I wasn‚Äôt okay. On one particular day, I remember mom calling me and asking if I was okay and just saying that I seemed off. Once again I assured her that I was fine, everything was going great and I was super happy and excited to be there. Well a bit after that call is when things started to change. I started to become a bit chaotic and reckless, which is nothing like how I normally am. I attempted to shave my eyebrows and face with a razor I think? I say I think for the fact I can‚Äôt fully remember what the object was. Another thing about that day is I changed my clothing about 3-4 times. And each time would change back to what I was originally wearing Bc who tf agreed to what I was doing??? Everything is somewhat of a blur honestly. Once again another jump in the story, I don‚Äôt remember why or how but I remember being on my bed with my computer. I suddenly started to feel really ill. I got a really bad migraine and started to feel super nauseous. I remember saying ‚Äúdamn keliana, you didn‚Äôt drink enough water‚Äù and arguing with myself that I didn‚Äôt feel thirsty and felt no need to actually get up and get some. However I didn‚Äôt win that argument, I remember getting off my bed, and when my foot touched the floor it was like I jumped into an entire new universe. It was like I was seeing everything from a new perspective that I couldn‚Äôt recognize. I couldn‚Äôt remember my name, where I was, who I was, how I got there. This obviously brought on an entire break down. I remember having this feeling like I could see, but that I was also blindish if that makes sense. I remember touching everything around me and going ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay calm down, your keliana. Your feeling sick, you need water, this is your dorm room, you just feeling sick. Grab your water bottle and fill it up‚Äù mind you all these conversations are going on in my mind. And at the time aren‚Äôt really a different distinct voice, just sounds like myself. Which has always been normal for me. I‚Äôve talked to myself for as long as I can remember. I don‚Äôt remember a time where I didn‚Äôt talk to myself. I had this huge window in my room that I so fucking loved. It was such a beautiful spot to just sit down on the ledge and look out at. But suddenly I was to terrified for the curtains to even be open. I had this weird Idea that Someone across in the other building was planning on sniping me. I shut the blinds and crawled on the floor for the rest of the time I was there. I did start to feel a bit better later, but it was such a scary and odd experience. Since I couldn‚Äôt get my guinea pig up to the dorm with me as my support animal, and the process was taking so long After that me and my parents agreed that I should come back home. I don‚Äôt think my mom understood how deeply it was even after that until she witnessed it first hand. One day once again everything was fine I was in the car with my mom and siblings. We had just come back from shopping and it was a good day for me. While in the car though I suddenly got the feeling again. I started to feel pressure right on my head, and started to get nauseous and the paranoia set in. I do t remember a lot, but I remember my mom asking me questions and from what I though, I thought I answered them right. Turns out I didn‚Äôt , not my name , my birthday, where I was going, who I was going to pick up. When my mom finally did calm me down I remember just being so irritated. So many words were trying to come out my mouth at once that nothing was making sense, and I was becoming so irritated that I think I even said ‚Äúomg shut up‚Äù and my mom said to calm down and some other stuff I can‚Äôt remember. *small side note, my mom has dealt with similar things with my grandmother who was professionally diagnosed with did* so she told me some grounding techniques. Another thing is the difference in perception of reality. I was abused from a very young age until 12 when my mom finally got custody of us. There would be times where I would tell my mom a story and everything is wrong or not close to the truth. Like I remember living with my dad when I was in kindergarten and us having such a happy loving life, and him making me blueberry pancakes. I remember it so vividly that it can‚Äôt be fake. Yet I never lived with my dad fully at that age. I stayed with my mom. Yet I don‚Äôt ever remember staying with my mom until she got custody of us. I remember living with my dad was hell. The shit he put us through was horrible. And I remember crying all time in my room on the floor petting my head saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay keliana, it‚Äôll get better, one day you‚Äôll see mommy‚Äù at this time I was in 3rd grade and was already having suicidal thoughts. The only thing that kept me is the thought of leaving my younger brother with my father. I was his mother at the time. I made breakfast for him, woke him up for school, helped him with school work, took him to school and picked him up. I made sure that although I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to but myself, he always had someone to protect him. That was my goal, my job if you can understand that. Anyways idek how I got to this subject. I remember when I first started realizing that I was ‚Äúweird‚Äù was when I was 12 and my mom got me back. I would have these moment where I wasn‚Äôt myself, or everything seemed fake or like a game. I randomly started talking in third person. It just seemed normal. I would always respond like ‚Äúkeliana wants.... keliana said.... kelianas hungry.......‚Äù I remember my step dad saying that it was weird and he definitely didn‚Äôt mean it in a detrimental way but that‚Äôs how I took it. I began correcting myself and working really hard to not seem weird. I threw away all my stuffed animals and began to just talk to myself more in my head. I regressed and became once again dependent on myself. This started a long list of mental problems, from eating disorders to depression and suicidal thoughts and actions. Recently now that I am of legal age and can legally smoke things have once again changed up. Whenever I feel a ‚Äúswitch‚Äù it‚Äôs more  amplified. I remember very traumatic things that I shouldn‚Äôt remember. But it‚Äôs not all bad. Sometimes it‚Äôs good and I‚Äôm happy, and remember amazing memories. One specific time after coming down from a high I found myself typing in my notes. *THIS IS COPPIED DIRECTLY FROM MY NOTES THAT DAY* 

‚ÄúIf someone don‚Äôt answer this damn phone 

I‚Äôm good I‚Äôm grounded, moved to Yari on the couch
 
She said your loud

Teenaged huh uh josh

Some old man screaming at me like in a movie zhbdjdjsudbe being disowned. People holding me back. Him screaming you can‚Äôt do that, stop her. And people in the background holding him back trying to calm him down

Bitch turned my notes app off

They won‚Äôt stop fucking arguing

Like I‚Äôm trying to act normal

Hurry before they start yelling again‚Äù

This is the first time that it was like I was there there with them, I could see them and hear distinct differences in voices. I remember the guy yelling at them to stop me, and other people holding him down. And my cocky ass saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs my fucking life,my phone. If I want to type and write this out you can‚Äôt stop me‚Äù.  Another time which is more recent. I was laying in bed. Not asleep fully but not fully awake either. And I suddenly had the need to use the bathroom. And I was like ‚Äúfuck that I‚Äôm not getting up‚Äù and a little girl saying she had to use the bathroom too, and another women saying at since I had to go I might as well take her too. And I remember saying ‚ÄúI do t even want to get up to go myself, someone else take her‚Äù and the argument continued. Like five minutes later I got hit in the gut and could jo longer deny that I had to go. I remember sitting up and going ‚Äúfuckkkkk fine I‚Äôll take her‚Äù and I remember when I opened my eyes I was like no. Did I just fucking imagine that shit? Did I just hear all that shit in my mind. I did have to go to the bathroom though so I didn‚Äôt think to much on it. Recently everyone‚Äôs been kind of silent and it‚Äôs been good, but scary and sad as well. I think maybe it‚Äôs because I criticized myself and them so much. Continuously telling myself to stop faking shit. Because that‚Äôs what I feel like I‚Äôm doing. Faking. But I also feel like it‚Äôs to intricate to much details for me to remember to fake. I thought maybe I hurt there feelings and that‚Äôs why they are silent. I still get random conversations or thoughts, or find out that I bought some shit I know I don‚Äôt remember buying. I did apologize though, I said that I would try to make an effort in being more understanding and reasonable. And also start asking for permission. Which someone decided to get another piercing without asking and you wouldn‚Äôt understand the shock when I woke up the next morning to find it. Either way I think I‚Äôm trying to cope better. I remember I made a ‚Äújoke‚Äù when out with a friend I hadn‚Äôt been out with in a while. It instantly hit my gut when I said it. I made the joke ‚Äúit would be my fucking luck keylin comes out‚Äù or something similar. And i remember a lang in my chest as soon as the words came out. And instantly apologized. Well I didn‚Äôt apologize in my head Bc I was so shocked I accidentally said it out loud. And my friend was asking who I was apologizing to. And told her enough but not the full truth. Also the reason I don‚Äôt know if this is real that I‚Äôm talking about is because I don‚Äôt have names for everyone. The guy who yells at me and we argue a lot I don‚Äôt have a name for. But I love him, he‚Äôs so caring and although we argue a lot because of how stubborn I can be I wouldn‚Äôt trade him, because he also comforts and prefects me so much. And he‚Äôs the one I hear most of the time. Telling me I should eat, drink take this, do this. Idk I love him. There‚Äôs another guys who is around my age, his name is josh. I don‚Äôt know much about him other then we get into trouble together and hype each other up to much. He was hyping me up the day when the guy was yelling at me. Like ‚Äúyea it‚Äôs her life‚Äù yards yada. There‚Äôs any. And idk if it‚Äôs a guy or girl. I have always told people I would change my name to Amy since I was as young as 7. Everyone thought it was Bc my aunt name was Amy. But it always had a deeper meaning. I would make all my sims characters named Amy as the main character. Which would be a girl, but i have pictures of me dressed up in real life as a guy at that time. Then there‚Äôs keylin. Keylin is for sure a ‚Äúmacho man‚Äù and he even just now said to remove the quotes from Macho manüòÇ he started about 4 years ago. It‚Äôs a spin off from my own name, and I hope that if I ever have a son to also name him that. Anyways this is so fucking long and Idek where I was going with this anyways. Last point I want to say is that when I ‚Äúswitch‚Äù it‚Äôs not always a bad or full black out experience. Sometimes it‚Äôs a full blackout, where next morning hopefully I can figure out what the hell i did before. Sometimes it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm coherent and there enough to respondish. Like I‚Äôm more just observing and watching, but can still put in whatever I want to say. Other times is where I‚Äôm not fully black out but I‚Äôm also not fully there. It‚Äôs just a roll of dice in which I‚Äôm gonna get. Also I know people have very distinct voices when switch and speaking out loud, but it‚Äôs hard for me to distinguish. Sometimes it hits me and others around me, and we are like where tf did that voice come from, but it‚Äôs also hard Bc I‚Äôve always had a passion for languages and accents. So am I just picking up what I‚Äôve heard and am repeating it???? Idk but if anyone has any answer please let me know. I know I should talk to a therapist, but I dont have therapist money right now. Please don‚Äôt be mean when responding, when I come back to look at this later after I make a note I don‚Äôt want to fall into anything dark as many things are easily triggering. Which I also know why post it. At this point it‚Äôs just be nice‚ù§Ô∏è if anyone has anything they want me to go deeper into let me know and I‚Äôll try to as soon as I can. I hope this is easy to understand, all love K‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è"
Am I faking it?,2,mby8ch,1,"I can't find anyone else who has similar symptoms to me anywhere and I don't know what's happening. I've been to a therapist and she says I have depersonalization and dissociation disorder but they don't really fit to what's happening. And I definitely don't have DID because I just don't have the trauma for that. Don't get me wrong, my life has been shitty enough for plenty of trauma but. You know. 

I often dissociate and begin to believe I am someone else. 1 of them is a character from a book series I've been writing. 1 is a child with no preexisting character. And what really gives me pause is that 2 of them are existing fictional characters. Anime characters. Which is fucking cringe, I know. I hate it too. 

I still retain memory from when someone else is in control, which I see memory loss is a main symptom of dissociative disorders. 

When it is someone else, I often mistake the people around me for people in their universes. When the illusion is broken and they realize that their loved ones aren't with them, they often panic and cry ect. My boyfriend had been putting up with one of them and pretending to be his boyfriend and whenever he'd remember that his friend didn't exist he'd break down and would yell. However for the most part they all seem aware of the fact that they only exist in my own brain (which gives them quite the crisis). 

They all have their own tastes in things however none are too far off of my own desires and opinions which leads me to believe this is completely my own doing. One of the anime characters that ""lives in my brain"" is very loud and rude and physically aggressive. While I am MUCH more so of all of those things, I'm not even nearly close to the level of aggression he possesses. 

I don't know. I don't know what's going on with me. Do you think this is a big placebo effect that I've tricked myself into believing is real? 

Tl;dr: I don't have did. But it sure feels like I do lmao."
I feel like I‚Äôm co-conscious with someone else,30,mbwvzr,17,"Does anyone else experience this? I feel a presence of someone else but never to the point where they‚Äôre completely taking over. To my knowledge, I don‚Äôt have DID, but it worries me regardless since I‚Äôm not sure exactly why it happens but it only seems to happen when I‚Äôm dissociated. Any one have any pointers?"
Remembering my life,21,mbj509,1,"Tw for a lot of things. 
There are a lot of things I feel I can't tell people because they'll think I'm lying. What has caused me to dissociate my whole life is having to suck it up and hide who I am. It's not like I don't want to tell everybody my trauma I just feel like I was never allowed to. I'm not allowed to feel anything ever. I feel like I've never been allowed to to the point it doesn't feel like it even really happened. Society does not allow an open conversation about trauma and assumes you don't want to talk about it. Maybe I do.
I was so sick as a child I almost died, I had an autoimmune issue and it caused inflammation that probably damaged my brain. 
My mom had dangerous men (johns) at my house often. 
My mom was in a coma from a car accident when I was 6. 
My mom did hard drugs. 
My father rejected me due to me being born with too brown skin, although a paternity test proved he was the father.
I was abused by my grandparents physically and mentally. 
I was abused by a friend sexually, and felt guilty my entire life for asking for it to happen again for 3 years. 
I was severely bullied in school. 
I chose to be in an abusive relationship because it was comfortable. 
I'm choosing now to address these. I don't have to ""get over myself"" I'm allowed to be sad, upset, and angry that these things happened. I'm allowed to feel every emotion at once about my childhood. This was years upon years of daily trauma. I refuse to wear something pretty and smile just because that is how someone is supposed to act. I'm allowed to be me. If you want to tell something you are frustrated you had to hide you don't have to worry, you don't have to. You're allowed to be upset."
I‚Äôve been dissociating on and off for almost a week,3,mbione,0,Currently right now I am grounding techniques aren‚Äôt working and it‚Äôs horrifying. When I go into therapy it gets worse. I‚Äôm having medication issues so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing it. I feel dizzy too does anyone have any tips ? I‚Äôm also diagnosed with ptsd for reference
clinging to reality (its a long one),3,mbd9ui,0,"So i dont have really anybody to talk to about all this. I never really posted in reddit before, but this seems like the right place to post this. (correct me plz if im wrong) Anyway Ive always kinda been struggling with anxiety especially health anxiety since late teens. Well of course with all the Covid stuff going on things have gotten significantly worse. Well to keep things short i ended up getting covid and suffer from PTSD now. Ive went to the doctor afterwards and they said i was good to go back to work. But in my mind i was convinced my heart was damaged and i would never be the same. I later had a total mental collapse (panic attack at work) and had to give up my rank at work which i was in management. I ended up having to settle for a lesser job which i still get by so its not terrible. Other than a little damage to my pride and a snicker here and there by choice associates. So now im stuck in this anxiety phase and cycle of feeling like im getting better, and then completely collapsing wash and repeat. But now i feel like i been having this sensation of going outside of time. Its hard to describe but it seems like time is either sped up or im just forgetting things (spacing out). Like i can see things from a different camera angle. I can see myself from celing sometimes. i can see from a birds eye view of the sun setting and moon rising rapidly over and over again. But then SNAP im back. I come back to my senses and trying to realise wtf just happned. I realise they im aware of what im doing. Going to work, talking to people, eating, etc etc. But i dont feel like any of its real or matters. I find myself in a daze until my anxiety brings me back to my senses. Just to torture me about how im going to die, or whatever my mind is trying to convince me of that day. So im either completely out of it and im just on auto pilot. Or im in a panicked state like im in right now trying to convince im real and im going to be okay. Im not going to lie i wrote this not just to get advice but just incase something was to happen to me. Im not sure how much longer i can go on living like this. I been planning and plotting on how to ""wrap things up"". But im always to afraid to do anything when comes time too. I just want to be normal i just want things to go back how they used to be. Ever sinced this Covid nightmare started and the world went to shit. I try to sympathize and know im not the only one suffering. But its hard to relate when no one is talking to you and your doing everything alone. I dont really know what im asking for in advice. But just anything would just about do. I noticed i dont like consecutive sunny days because it seems to trigger it more. I dont know i think like it seems anything in repetitive behaviour or repetitive surroundings makes it worse. Please if anybody is going through anything similar. I am more than happy to talk about it and go through some functions with you. Thank you for reading my long story."
Are u ok?,4,mb8g9y,2,
Yikes...,2,mb6ssg,2,"So, almost a year ago in May 2020, I got in a car crash. I was too much in my head while I was driving and I hit a motorcyclist. He lived, though he was injured, and I left the incident plagued with guilt and trauma. Earlier tonight, I got an email from the lawyer from my insurance company about whether or not we would do a settlement or litigation etc. Soon after reading it, I dissociated HARD. At first, I was just kind of detatched. Then I got pulled into the part of my brain where I put trauma memories. I call it ""The No-No Room"". While I was in there, my victim proceeded to beat me up. He was punching me, kicking me, and throwing me around the room. I was on call with a friend of mine and I was able to use his voice as a way back, but I can still feel my victim trying to pull me back so that he can continue getting  revenge."
I took adderall and so far it has changed everything.,59,mb66vn,18,"Again, I only just took it for the first time an hour or so ago, but my intrusive thoughts are gone. My dissociation is gone. I feel real, I feel okay. I feel happy. I feel safe, and my thoughts are so normal and just.. calm. I have no more bad thoughts, I feel good."
Dissociated badly tonight.,7,mb3omq,2,"I went out to eat tonight at a beautiful sake restaurant in Clearwater FL. I sat while waiting for my food and all of sudden I just stopped moving. It felt like everything around me slowed down. A very slow tempo music played into my head, the way it thumped in my head started to literally drive me crazy‚Ä¶ I felt like I was in a depressed game after someone is going through withdrawal. I couldn‚Äôt snap out if it for a good few minutes. The room starts to expand on me. I have never ever went through this before and it absolutely petrified me."
Is this dissociation?,4,mb2m99,5,I feel like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm here and constantly questioning reality. I feel like nothing is real and every happy moment I have is meaningless because I‚Äôll be dead one day. I question why I‚Äôm alive and why this world was even created. What‚Äôs the point in all of this? I feel uneasy thinking I need to actually breathe in order to survive and require oxygen. The thought of being a floating ball in space makes me feel very uneasy too. I just don‚Äôt enjoy things anymore and I‚Äôm a lot more frightened of things than I I used to be and just so much more aware of being alive. Any ideas as to what this is? Dissociation is the closest thing I could come to
"Do you keep losing your train of thought easily? This is a sign your body is perceiving a threat. When you develop social anxiety, your fear of being judged becomes so overwhelming that your body takes over and blanks out your mind. Here is a video that explains this further and how to overcome it!",19,mawsfn,1,
Feeling like I‚Äôm in two places at once,5,manj9q,1,"
Hi, 
Does anybody else ever experience feeling like you‚Äôre somewhere else? Almost like you‚Äôre living in a depressing movie sometimes? Like things just feel like you‚Äôre not where you are... like you can ground yourself back to where you are but it feels like you‚Äôre in a movie or like you‚Äôre somewhere else? 
Also lately when I think of a certain place ( a town near mine that I went to school in and have a lot of friends in, and I do my shopping there) it‚Äôs like in my brain I perceive it differently then how it actually is there. Idk if it‚Äôs depersonalization or disassociation but when I THINK of the place, it feels different and distorted then how it actually is when I go there"
is this dissociation?,4,mal1rg,1,"i don't think i can even explain this but i'll do my best.

for a while now i've had somewhat severe anxiety, and due to that i've started developing depression again after recovering completely from middle school (im 17f). then, i think it started a few months ago, i began becoming hyper aware of life and myself. like everyone has moments like that from time to time but it was scary and intense and eventually became constant for me. i couldn't do or feel anything without asking why. i couldn't look out over a beautiful horizon with trees and wildlife without thinking about how strange it truly is and i feel alienated. it's like that feeling you get thinking about what alien worlds might be like, but it's my own. concepts such as trees or bodies make me feel uncomfortable. eventually, after it got so bad, i finally forced myself to come to terms with this world. i told myself it's my world, i belong here, it's not alien at all. i made a post here during that time and i got the same advice i found elsewhere: ignore it and it'll eventually pass. 

now, it's slightly different. it's so hard to explain. it's like a constant, numb discomfort. anytime i experience anything like passion or happiness, i simultaneously have this feeling of ""it's worthless, it's nothing, it doesn't make sense"". sitting in a room i feel strangely aware that it is a room, a concrete square on a patch of earth. of course. this is true, but when i was more mentally stable, these things were just.. normal. if someone were to tell me that clothes are weird because it's a piece of fabric that covers your human meat body id be like ""uh yeah lol?"". 

and that's the other thing. now, if i look into any other time of my life, future or past, it feels inescapable. for some reason it seems to cloud all my memories or dreams in a false perception that i didn't have. it's like i can't possibly believe that there's a way i was alive and thinking without being so uncomfortable in my reality. and when looking to my future, it feels like i'll never be able to heal. i believe i can heal from anxiety and depression, but somehow it's so hard to believe i can ever look at this universe the same way again. it feels like i was transported to an alien world where the concepts the human mind can understand are gone and replaced with a different, supposedly normal one. 

even this long text post i feel does no justice to how i feel. i feel unsatisfied with my description, but it's the best i can do. i should also mention i'm christian, and this also plays a role in my discomfort. i somehow feel this is only normal to god and that the universe is only designed this way because he's creative. i just can't feel normal. when i've talked to people about how our universe is so finely tuned it can't possibly be random, i've gotten the response ""it just seems normal because you've grown up this way. if the universe was any way else, that too would seek perfect"" a few times. the way i feel is like the opposite of that. i know i should feel this is all normal, that things like oceans, trees, social interactions, i shouldn't be critical of their existence.

i also have a strange issue with doing things not *everyone* else does. like it's hard to listen to music i don't think is popular, or play a game that not everyone knows about. it's hard to explain but basically whenever i see a video with a  low view count or a game lobby that's mostly empty, it gives me anxiety and a weird feeling.

i feel like there's more i want to say, but i don't know what. i just want this to end and for me to never know this feeling ever again, but i'm scared that's impossible. and please don't just say ""get professional help"". i can't right now. the best i can do is use free resources online and i have a couple friends who are there for me, but they don't truly understand"
How I conceptualise my personality/dissociation,6,mak5bw,0,"It's the lack of internal feeling, will(power), agency, evaluation of the situation, non-passivity, awareness, and coherent narrative to the point where I seriously like don't even understand that I'm a real human being (trauma, sigh) because I wasn't treated like one in the past. Just a small human outline to scream *at*. 

Maybe it would be better if I was not just screamed at like a mental punching bag but I was just communicated with *by* yelling HAHAHA. because what I mean by being screamed *at* like I was an inanimate object or animal is that communication was only one way and not two ways as a feedback loop that occurs when one is yelling but also communicating with a child. I think that this is one of the core causes of my dissociative personality, which is having no two way relationships in my entire life, ever. Friends at school, yes, but no one who I ever developed and shared a personal and ongoing history that involved the core of my being in. No one to really think back to and nobody who I can always call and reminisce with. Nobody who really knows or knew Me, no childhood friend or aunty or cousin or siblings. Not sure if there's anybody I could ever actually say I have been close to. Strange how I only realise this now, that I've never cared for anybody outside of myself (sounds slightly worse than it is, I'm not sure how to word it to make it seem like I'm not a sociopath ahahah), even though I've had a few relationships before. What I mean is I care like I care for my friends, but ""*I* love you and care about *you*"" is a foreign concept to me. 

Narrativeless. In my later years I would not reflect, I'd just do things for 100% of the time I was awake. 

Maybe not for much longer though. I am remembering some things from the past where I had a friendship where we would hang out a lot but I would never say we were actually close. ...But I think that in an alternate universe, we could have been. 
I am not sure how I feel about him. ...Shit. I don't know at all anymore. 

I seriously forgot I existed as a human being in other people's eyes and shit. Lol. I guess human relationships are where one develops a sense of self but ehh..."
I fucked up. I was already gone before I realised it.,37,majfnx,19,"I just left everything. I took 4 outfits, way too many socks, a bunch of jumpers, 3 pairs of shoes, one can of deodorant, a book, my bible, my chargers, my phone, wallet and keys, my tablet, 2 pillows, a blanket, a pencil case with various stationary, a small notebook, my TTRPG Dice and Rolling Tray, whatever was in my car already, a laundry basket (holding all my clothes and stuff) and a leather satchel (holding everything else).

Why did I do that? I've left so many friends behind. My family were in a panic, I let them all down. There's still work to be done on my house. I left a bunch of stuff at my sisters place. I could barely talk to my mum on the phone Sunday morning. I've only told one friend I've even left. I was suppose to meet a bunch of my mates at the pub Saturday night. They were there for me. They were gonna have a open pit roast lunch next Saturday. How do I even tell them I'm gone.

I'm 500kms away. I only had a week until I left anyway. I'm lucky I already had a job lined up. I had 120 bucks, most of it got eaten on the drive down in fuel. An old bloke from church has put me up for a few days, and my mum is going to get me a hotel room for a little after that. I slept in my car the first night. 

I can't explain to them why I left. I don't even know how to face the ones I let down. I've never felt such shame before in my life. Even typing this feels surreal, like I'm just along for the ride. I'm switching between deep feelings of guilt and sorrow; and a detached view where my only thought is ""why does it matter, they only miss you now youre gone"".

My mum said I need to go to a hospital, but I don't know how a hospital is going to fix me, I'm not injured, I'm not even diagnosed. I can't afford food, let alone therapy. My rational brain says that thus we the right decision but made at the wrong time. My irrational brain has all the controls and I'm lucky I was able to get up for work this morning.

I'm sorry if this isn't the place, but I needed to put it somewhere to make it real and if anyone knows how I could confront the friends I left in the dark, that'd be a huge help."
I am not dissociative but i need some clarification on whether my friend is or not,1,madufh,0,"My friend messaged me this evening that she‚Äôs been having these episode sheets she suddenly forgets who she is or where she is or what she‚Äôs doing for periods of time, along with feeling like she‚Äôs not really here sometimes and that in those moments she feels like she isn‚Äôt in control of her own body. (she describes it as fog as well.) we did some research together and we‚Äôre wondering if she could be dissociative? this has apparently been happening for a while but she‚Äôs been scared to tell anyone since she didn‚Äôt wanna be perceived as crazy. I just wanted to know if she could try to get diagnosed with having dissociation or if these are all coincidences. i‚Äôll try my best to answer any addition questions in the comments, although if i don‚Äôt respond for a while it‚Äôs because i‚Äôve accidentally fallen asleep (it‚Äôs almost midnight where i live but i want answers for the sake of my friend)"
Something I've been wondering about,1,mad5mg,0,"So I've realized something recently. It's been on my mind because it has a lot to do with my dissociation, I think at least. Does anyone ever feel anxious and feel like they are constantly out of place, even when they're at home? Especially when you move homes? Like, does dissociation get worse or even better with moving? Because I remember the last time I moved, it was to escape something, and my mind never really acknowledged that I was out of all that, I think. And at that time I was 11. Now, fast forward, I'm 16 and about to move again. But this is the first time in my entire life that I will be moving for good reasons, like they're are a lot of positives to this move. The only concerns I have are about my dissociation. This house that I currently reside in, it has never been a home to me and I am just now realizing that. I hate coming home to this house, or trailer rather, and opt to go to my grandmother's when I can to get away. I have gone through countless reality loops at this house, to the point to where it almost feels that I have three or four different personalities. Does anyone else ever get this? Please tell me. But my main question is, is there a chance that this move might bring me out of this rut that I have been in since I was 11? I mean, my dissociation has been going on way longer than age 11, but it kinda took its big debute at that time. You know? So is it possible that moving again, for a better reason and a better future, could lessen my symptoms? I am going to also be starting a new school next year, which scares me because I never feel right with switching schools and I always have trouble with the new type of work setting and people, and this always worsens my symptoms. But could this better situation improve that too? Any commentary would be greatly appreciated."
I can‚Äôt stop thinking about leaving everyone I know and starting a new life in another country,8,maayhd,2,"Only problem is I don‚Äôt have the means to. But I want to so bad. When I dissociate really bad I just want to get in my car and drive until I run out of fuel, then make a new life wherever I stop. I don‚Äôt care where it is. I just want to be in a new place where no one knows me and I‚Äôll pretty much be dead to those I did know. I want a clean slate. The thought of continuing my life now makes me sick. Does anyone else go through this when they dissociate?"
Does anyone experience like a sort of meta-dissociation?,10,maa7wx,4,"Does anyone else feel like their perception of life is like super meta to the point where you feel disconnected from reality? Like on the one hand there's my trauma and I think it has a lot to do with feeling like I'm a monster. But at the same time, I am sick and tired of feeling this way and don't want to believe this about myself. It's like I'm aware that I'm not supposed to believe this but at the same time I believe it.

It feels like I need to say the correct things to my therapist to release the emotions to be free from this hell, but at the same time I am aware of what I'm doing and then I don't feel any emotions because I'm like thinking one step ahead of myself. It's so weird and it freaks me out and makes me think I've lost my mind and will never recover.

I didn't used to think this way. I wasn't even aware of what happened to me until I was in college and took mushrooms and saw myself and realized I was really messed up. Until then I had been in denial and didn't even know, I just knew something was wrong but never told anyone. Then afterwards, after I realized what was wrong, it's like I felt like if I told someone everything then I would be free. But it wasn't like genuinely me telling them, it was just knowing that if I did it then I would feel better. I am struggling to describe it and yes I know it sounds fucking crazy. I am worried that when I took the mushrooms, maybe it fucked me up or something even more because now not only do I feel like shit because of the trauma, but I also am existing in this meta universe where I am constantly trying to escape from this mental prison but at the same time, I am aware of what I'm doing and that makes my efforts to escape not work because it isn't organic or it isn't how life is supposed to work.

Just today I was talking to my mom about this stuff and as I was saying something I felt a surge of emotion and started to cry, but right as I started to cry I became aware of it and the emotion completely died because I was aware that I wanted to cry to be free and then it's like the sadness completely went away and I was just thinking about what happened. It's like I'm watching myself and my thoughts and am detached from reality and my emotions completely.

Does anyone else deal with this? I don't know how to make sense of it. It scares me and gives me a fuck ton of anxiety because it makes me feel psychotic and hopeless. Like not only do I have trauma but I have this meta dissociation that honestly seems way scarier and impossible to overcome. Even as I type this, a part of me feels like if I can somehow express these thoughts and feelings, I will be freed from them. It's like I can't trust myself or something. I just don't understand."
Should I be concerned/seek help?,4,ma990b,1,
I had a bad dissociated episode yesterday and now I can‚Äôt remember anything the day before,17,ma8qbm,1,"So yesterday I felt super out of it, I had been for a couple days, I think since Thursday. Now feeling back to normal, I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt remember it like it was me. I can‚Äôt connect to what happened, but when I was in the moment I felt super .. horrible, and now I feel like that wasn‚Äôt even me functioning my body. Like it was another person. So strange. I felt like nothing meant anything to me, my stimulus check hit and I wasn‚Äôt excited like I normal would‚Äôve been, I went shopping and didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything. Weird.. any ideas?"
What is this? Anxiety? Depression? Dissociation? Psychosis?,3,m9y160,0,"Fair warning- it‚Äôs going to be a longer post because I feel the need to explain when it started and anything that might help. If anything needs to be explained upon, pls let me know and I‚Äôll try my best.

As a child I would feel like a video game character. I vividly remember walking out of a restaurant at the wee age of 5 and kicking rocks. When all of a sudden I got hit with this feeling of being controlled, like I wasn‚Äôt in control of my own body. Like I was a character in a shorty arcade game. In my naivety I looked up at my dad and asked if he ever felt this before and if it was normal. He chuckled and said it was. Looking back I think it was to prevent me from freaking out further. From then on I vaguely remember feeling this again every so often, but I was young and didn‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

Flash forward a decade and high school is kicking my ass. I haven‚Äôt felt like a character in maybe a year(?) and I‚Äôm focusing on classes. This is when my underlying anxiety surfaces. I‚Äôm ‚Äúspacing out‚Äù more, I‚Äôm jittery, and all of the anxiety after effects. I think it‚Äôs time to point out that my whole family has suffered with minute anxiety, usually this is shown by a shaky leg or just spacing out. Though I don‚Äôt think spacing out is anything to do with anxiety but it‚Äôs VERY apparent in my family. It‚Äôs when I started dealing with depression that I started to feel detached. Not in the angsty ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to me‚Äù detachment but I felt out of place in my body. I would also go mute in these ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù, needing to control something in life. I also seemed to feel, smell, and hear everything. It was a total sensory overload, which lead to me feeling alienated even more. I would feel my mind draw away, I would get dizzy then run on autopilot.

Now I‚Äôm 20 and I‚Äôve been medicated for G.A.D and it‚Äôs... ok. I don‚Äôt get overloaded anymore and I can almost go the whole day without spacing out and feeling detached from my body. Some days are better than others, the latter of which leaves me in a foggy-dizzy state where I feel like I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs life or I‚Äôm in a simulation. Normally these are tied with a brief anxiety spell, either from slight ptsd or something that just made me nervous. I also have a playlist consisted of songs that tend to trigger this otherworldly feeling. To either escape or to remind myself to not listen to them, I can‚Äôt really recall why I made it.

In the past I just assumed it was from my depression making me feel numb but as I‚Äôm going through this community I‚Äôm... conflicted now. I have never had the ‚Äúout of body‚Äù experience before or have had any memory loss (that I know of). Are these the worst it can get? Or are they the normal things that you have to have?? Honestly I just want to know how to explain to people what it happening to me. I haven‚Äôt had a straight answer about what my mind is doing for around 2 years, and even then it was a ‚Äúeh, maybe these will help??‚Äù."
I feel like the people are like aliens and soooo weird is that dpdr?,19,m9y0rr,2,
I will look at a picture of myself from high school and literally say ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt even feel like me‚Äù,31,m9rsls,3,Does this sound like dissociation?
I don't have a core self/vent,3,m9osxy,2,"Some people think I'm autistic but I don't think I am. I think I was treated like a lot less than a dog emotionally when I was younger. Maybe something like a pack horse or easily scared rabbit that one scares for their own satisfaction until they're tired of doing so. 

I believe something went fundamentally wrong at ""birth"", that being, early childhood per se- I had a vision of myself in a pot induced semi psychotic period as having a rotting fetus inside of me, waiting for its real mum and dad to come, but they never did, so it's just always been rotting in there (I'm 20 now.) Also a strong feeling on acid that I've been in the 'waiting room' of life for, like, forever now. I know I never individuated. Haven't yet, at least. 

My object relations are really fucked because of this, I'm basically truly an emotional orphan. Idk what I've been doing these past 20 years lmao. Well, being passive I guess. I feel like a child emotionally and for some weird ass reason, I'm only realising now that like, other people exist and that I exist and am alone. I'm very egocentric and lack true agency and psychological aloneness at this current point in time. 

So every past self feels like a different entity. I don't remember or understand these entities when I try and look back on them now. They are strangers to me and thus I am a stranger to myself. I've never been properly loved so now I just feel like a floating entity who lives in the conceptual realm. 

I spend my time simulating conversations in my head with people that I know. I don't think that this is normal. 

I hope that neurofeedback and EMDR helps. Man, at times I feel so peaceful. But I have never, never really been in a real emotional human relationship. I just am, like, here. And I always have been. Not separate from the environment. Mm... The sky is pale blue and foggy today. Peace at last. 

Not really. The rare times I do feel alone, I feel like I have been given a death sentence by my parents to be cast out in a horrible place where unlike other shitty families, *I could not do anything about it.* The powerlessness conceptually haunts me to this day and it still awes me that I was once (at birth I guess) truly happy and trusting and open to this world. 

It feels like nothing is really real except this current moment. Thanks, foggy numbness, I guess. But I feel I started to ignore reality because being a real person and entity in other people's minds is just too much for me to handle. I don't even know how to feel about the fact my body is... Eugh. Completely in the complete mind of another (sigh) I wish I could just delete off this oh my god I just want to hide from this forever and ever and ever it feels so disgusting and intrusive goodbye I am gone idc abt my persona and how I appear to others nothing is real I'm not real. That was the first time I started to dissociate for sort of real instead of just emotionally numbing my tears and sadness because of easy to understand trauma like yelling. : )

But I am. 

By definition, there's nothing worth it coming out for from this fog, right, and that's why I'm not rly coming out. I feel safe. I feel safe and I would feel remorse for the things I've done in the past that have hurt my friends and be a better person. But I don't want to do it because the friends I've hurt won't ever be able to fill the void. I want to be here and own my fkn self and be ALIVE of my own accord and as a debate independent being who isn't attached to her parents or family whatsoever. Just me. And be free from all I want to let go of (I think psilocybin in a few months will help me do this.) And then fall in love with life all over again and be reborn into a place where I always wanted to be. A safe place, that is. I don't know if this universe is really safe and that it has a plan. But at least I'll be in control as adults are, and not under the jurisdiction of the people that I used to live with (I live alone now). I guess friends make me happy but now is not the time yet. Sigh..."
Is it possible to dissociate from more recent trauma?,2,m9ogva,8,"When I dissociate is either random or because something triggering from my childhood trauma came up. But is it possible to dissociate because of more recent trauma?, when I dissociate I get quite bad memory blocks. It‚Äôs kinda like the trauma gets repressed temporarily well I‚Äôm dissociating, I thought this could only happen from childhood trauma or old trauma? Is it possible then for more recent trauma to be blocked out too? I won‚Äôt go into detail but its been almost half a year since more recent trauma happened and Iv noticed I tend to dissociate when it comes to mind and I can‚Äôt remember what happened at all. I thought it was strange since it was recent, Iv only recently found out from my therapist that Iv be dissociating so I don‚Äôt know a whole lot, sorry if this kinda dumb question lol."
"So I don't know how ""I"" talk",11,m9n2uw,3,"something I've always struggled with is deciding how I talk, and while I've been at high suspicion of identity-altering dissociative disorder(s), I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, though it can definitely be connected to my lack of cohesion in terms of a personality or sense of identity.

let me explain. the only constant in my verbal expression is my diction; my vocab, how I form sentences, pacing, grammar and the like. the only thing that I have trouble with is consistently pronouncing words and expressing in that sort of way. sometimes I have a twang, other times a british/russian crumple of the tongue, and other times a very nasal sound, and more.

what's your experience with this? what did it turn out to be? how can I find my way of speaking, integrate the rest, or stop changing my voice all the time without noticing?

thanks!"
Dissociating when its totally dark?,3,m9mu1n,0,"First off I'm not really sure if this is dissociation, but basically for me it kinda feels like hitting your funny bone but in the brain. There's just this kinda sudden snap and everything goes numb. Sometimes I even get this kind warmish tingle down my body. It feels like I'm living more in the current moment because my memories are turned off and eyes and ears are more sensitive to my surroundings.

I think my first time feeling disconnected was around 4th grade. I just kinda remember waking up one day and feeling like my personally was slowing changing. That caused me to have panic attacks which kinda turned to depersonalization or dissociation episodes. Also during that time I would basically force myself to dissociate because I was so nervous about feeling like I was going insane that I would sit there and think really hard about going insane, and by thinking about it I would start to dissociate.

It feels exactly like you're pulling an all nighter and half way through your brain decides its had enough and flicks off the switch. Then again maybe that's not a normal sleep deprivation feeling and maybe that's just me depersonalizing from lack of sleep idk.

But I noticed I get this feeling whenever I'm at like at concerts, theaters, circuses, fireworks events, or sports events. Generally I feel fine but once they turn off the lights my eyes go all dilated and I suddenly get really anxious and sensitive to all the loud surrounding music and flashing lights, and then my brain kinda shuts down and everything goes muted and numb. It usually doesn't happen if there is decent lighting though.

Sometimes I dissociate for no reason like if I'm playing video games or watching tv. Sometimes I dissociate because I imagine that I'm about to dissociate and then actually start dissociating.

All my dissociation episodes only last about an hour or 2.

But yeah, does this sound like dissociation/depersonalization and is anyone else triggered by dark places?"
please tell me what this is,5,m9m6mq,1,"i don‚Äôt know what this is or if it‚Äôs even dissociation but i feel like i‚Äôm living in a memory everything i see seems so familiar and i get a kind of nostalgia from it, and i get emotional from smells of things and things that happen to me. it feels like i‚Äôve lived it before, i cant explain. it‚Äôs freaking me out."

Does anyone else listen to song and dissociate?,3,m8sbax,1,I listen to music and sometimes a song will come one that will trigger an intense bout of dissociation. I can't listen to it so I skip it. I was wondering about anyone else? Who has had this happen to them?
i‚Äôve never experienced ‚Äúout of body‚Äù dissociation ‚Äî am i still valid?,10,m8r1lw,3,"hey, kind of a dumb question but i‚Äôm in need of some answers.


i am constantly in some state of dissociation, or at least detachment from the world around me, but every time i‚Äôve looked into dissociation, i‚Äôve read examples about ‚Äúout of body‚Äù type experiences that i do not have. it makes me wonder if since i don‚Äôt, my ‚Äòdissociation‚Äô is invalid?


my other symptoms are: i space out a lot, have empty pockets in memory, struggle to acknowledge worldly consequences, have identity issues, and never feel a part of this world. i don‚Äôt believe i live in a simulation, but it feels something like one; i often have to remind myself i‚Äôm not a character in a game or movie and other people aren‚Äôt emotionless NPCs. otherwise, i do stupid things under the guise that there will be no consequences. i also am nearly incapable of practicing mindfulness, and cannot meditate. i am never present.

Please give me advice,5,m8p04c,2,"Hi! I developed dissociation from many different things but one that sticks with me is a bad weed high.  It was terrifying and I can't ever smoke again, I can't even drink because the idea of being under the influence haunts me and im terrified ill feel what I felt that night. When I get anxiety or dissociate, sometimes I feel like im somehow still high from that night (it was in the winter or fall or something I don't remember my brain blocked it out) and ill feel like im forever still high I guess when I get anxiety. I also developed severe health anxiety and anxiety in general from it. I wish I could go back to that night and just not smoke. It gave me SO many problems that I feel like are irreversible. I've had so much anxiety that it terrifies me to leave my bed and my house and its becoming a huge issue. I dissociate when I leave my house and I feel like im going to pass out and have a panic attack when I leave my bed. not to mention, im turning 18 in a month and I really rather not have this so young. I just want to go out with my friends and drink and do fun things but I feel like im stuck in the bed and I will absolutely never ever be under the influence ever again. That sucks. Does anyone know how I can snap out of this? Please give me some advice, thank you

TLDR: Ive been dissociating pretty bad today. Please tell me ways I can snap out of this, its really scary"
"Thanks to therapy, I finally stopped dissociating all the time as a primary coping mechanism. I am mourning the loss of the years I don't remember.",103,m8l8l8,10,"I'm not well-educated on dissociating as a whole so please forgive me if I don't use the correct language to describe my experience. I'm eager to learn more. This is mainly a ramble but I'm really interested in talking to other people who've had a similar experience with dissociating.

I started dissociating about 10 years ago after an extreme trauma as a teen and... basically never stopped until 6 months ago.

I assume it's normal to live within a spectrum of dissociation because that was my entire adult life until recently. I had the severe ""stares at a wall for a week but it feels like 20 minutes"" after major triggers but for the most part I was functional in every way except emotional. I never felt my negative emotions. The few memories of therapy are being asked ""why are you crying, gryff? What do you feel right now?"" I'd honestly shrug and say ""I feel fine, I don't know why I'm crying."" I spent years experiencing the physiological actions of grief and trauma without ever connecting to it emotionally, and most of the time I wouldn't remember my session the next time I went in for therapy.

I spent 12 months in a residential treatment center for trauma disorders and I barely remember it. A whole year of my life that my brain never bothered hitting 'record' on.

I started seeing a new therapist after moving across the country a couple of years ago and she's the first person I remember using the word dissociating to describe what I was going through. We spent literal years working on it, most of which I don't remember but I know we must have because I don't do it much anymore. I haven't dissociated for longer than a day since October, which is huge for me. I was so out of touch with it that I didn't even *notice* I wasn't dissociating from big emotions anymore until she pointed it out to me.

I spent the last fucking decade thinking I have a bad memory, that I'm just naturally the most forgetful twenty-something on the planet, but the last 6 months have totally changed my view of myself. I remember shit now. I remember being upset, I can identify why I'm crying for the first time in a damn *decade*.

I'm starting to feel grief for all the years I don't remember. College, first jobs, first girlfriends. Deaths. I used to think I wasn't bothered by death, but now the grief of those losses is seeping into me for the first time. Most of them have been dead for years - I can finally feel the sadness and loss those people deserved. 

So many memories, at best, hidden in heavy fog. I'm so glad to be back in my body but I feel such immense grief for those lost years, along with all those heavy emotions my brain was keeping at bay. I was raped 3 years ago and really felt my grief around it for the first time last night. I've cried when talking about it before but yesterday was the first time I could identify *why*. I'm simultaneously grieving for all the shit I couldn't before, and also feeling grief for sleepwalking through my entire young adult life.

Has anyone else come out the other side of dissociating and felt this way?"
BPD & Dissociation,5,m8j689,1,"Hi,
I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder with my most severe symptoms being anxiety and depression. I am used to having moments of dissociation that typically only last anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or two at most, and with these moments of dissociation I usually can pinpoint my trigger - either while I‚Äôm dissociating or when I come to. Yesterday I started dissociating while grocery shopping, I figured the environment of being in public around a bunch of strangers trigger a dissociation. However, when I got to the car and started driving home I noticed I was still dissociating, it was quite scary actually. I felt like I was outside my body watching myself drive home, it was almost as if my body was working on auto pilot and nothing was going on in my mind. This ensued panic but I was driving so my survival instincts kicked in and I was able to drive home. I tried tapping my forehead, tapping my shoulders alternatively, changing the temperature drastically (these are the best techniques for grounding for me personally my therapist and I have decided) and nothing would snap me out of my dissociative state. I thought maybe good night‚Äôs sleep would help snap me out of it but I woke up feeling the same. I feel like my vision is distorted - as if I‚Äôm looking through a tunnel - and my body feels heavy. It‚Äôs kind of scaring me mostly because I‚Äôve never been in a dissociative state this long. Had anyone else had this experience? Or can someone who experiences extreme dissociation give me some tips on how I could maybe work on this? TIA üò™"
Imagine crossing two young girls while overhearing one say to the other: 'What kind of human is that?',20,m8gljx,7,"I'm used to alienation for some years and I thought it would get better for a while but this is scary. Children really have a sense to spot abnormal humans at a glimpse. There's no purer truth than the words of a naive and unbiased child spoken due to honest curiosity. Yeah, what kind of a human am I? Why can't I fit in? Why can't I relate to people around me? I don't know, but people notice. I like to believe they don't but these words from that girl broke this delusion. I'm isolated too much and don't have a job. This place never felt right."
I‚Äôm still confused by the whole thing,3,m8c01u,5,Ok so I‚Äôve struggled with this for a while where I‚Äôll constantly have these weird feelings. Whenever I talk to someone they‚Äôre like ‚Äúare u dissociating?‚Äù The thing is idk I don‚Äôt know much about it. I have anxiety and depression and I take medicine for it and it started before I took medicine but I guess it subsided but now it kinda just last longer. I have a doctors appointment coming up and I want to know what u should ask my doctor. Like questions so I don‚Äôt trip or my own tongue and give up. If a doctor could do anything about it. Idk I just want some advice for when I see my doctor because I just want answers.
Can you be dissociated from your own culture? Or is just disdain/self hate? Is it even dissociation and part of you? Or is it just a narrative you tell yourself to feel special? Like some kind of narcissism?,3,m81e0j,2,"Non-western folks probably experience this and want to associate with the western lifestyle and thinking, and have some kind of hatred towards own culture. I'm not sure."
A couple things I found that may help with dissociation,0,m7yx2b,4,"1. Chain chokers, the weight and tightness around the neck feels as though it grounds me from the sensation and whenever I bend my neck back, I feel it tightens which helps keep me in the moment.
2. Balisong flipping with a live blade. This may be helpful due to adrenaline and the sensation of it bouncing against knuckles, not only may it help with dissociation but it also creates a hobby.

From my personal experience these things do not completely remove the dissociative state, however it may lessen it. For example, I choose to wear a chain choker nearly all day because without it I feel as though my mind is truly floating away from dissociation.

Edit: A couple other things that may help is having a window open and having a *real* neon sign."
Is this dissociation?,8,m7yrna,5,"I‚Äôm not really familiar with dissociation, and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what dissociating is:
So basically whenever I have fights with my parents or my Dad decides to randomly yell at me, my body starts to get like numb? It feels like it‚Äôs not there anymore and then everything starts spinning and I don‚Äôt really feel like myself anymore.(Also sorry I‚Äôm case anything sounded weird, English isn‚Äôt my first language)"
Addicted to escapism,48,m7x61w,10,"So, I'm addicted to the need too escape into a fictional world. Sometimes it's through movies and books but often times I don't even need that. I can just sit for hours and spend time in my own head. That's how I start my day, do during the day, in the evening and at night. 
People ask me, what I do in my free time and I say: ""nothing"" and literally mean it. I don't need to do anything else, then internally disepear in my own fantasy world.
If I don't do that, I become very irritated and stressed. It's my way to relief all the stress.

Lately I've been trying to break the habit. Because, as anyone can probably figure, if you only live your life throug fictional characters you don't have much of your own life. It's like and drug addiction. The highs are high.
I love and know the characters, their journey, their feelings. I feel every high they feel. If they win a war in the story, I feel like I've just won a war. If they lose someone dear to them, I feel like I lost someone dear to me. This escapism gave me some of the most heartwarming moments in my life. 
But the lows are low.
I can't focus in anything else, then my dream world. When I drive my car, am at work, during a conversation. I constantly zone into my fantasy world. I live my real world life, but I never feel, like I'm really there.

I know it's ruining my life, but it's so hard to let go. It's my safe space, that only I can control. But in reality I know, that I'm giving up my real life, for absolutely nothing.

Did anyone experience something similar? And does anyone have any advice, how to get free if this addiction?"

Thanks in advance."
is this dissociation?,5,m7f2nj,11,"Little heads up, my english isn't the best! 

I've had this feeling since I can remember. When I was younger it would only last a few minutes or hours, I didn't mind it. But the more I grew up the more this feeling/sensation lingered for longer and longer, sometime months (It's been a month and half since my last ""relapse"" and I've been feeling like that since)

Let me describe how I feel, because I'm quite unsure about the nomenclature. I've always called it dissociation because it sounded right but maybe it's not that. 

I feel like I'm watching a first person POV movie, everything feels simulated and fake. Everything that I do/say isn't really ""me"", it's more of a facade or reflexes. I do things because I know I should do those things, not really because I want to do them. My 'real' self is just confused or even absent. I feel completely detached from others and my feelings. I just feel extremely empty, pure abyss. Emotions and life feel absolutely absurd and nonsensical.
This feeling comes and goes without any obvious triggers (or maybe I haven't been attentive enough) but I know that weed makes it way way worse. If I smoke, I feel like my body isn't actually mine and I have to talk to myself using 'you' to do basic task. I had a psychotic episode the first time I got high + two other times. 

anyway, it's a bit lengthy but is this dissociation? 
I haven't been to the doctors in years/talked about my mental health issues with anyone who could diagnose me, so I don't have a diagnostic

Sometimes when it‚Äôs worse I‚Äôll end up in different places without remembering moving. I‚Äôve like come back in?? to myself during the middle of a sentence and it felt like interrupting myself. 

Have been trying to get some information on this because I‚Äôm not sure it it‚Äôs normal or not, but can‚Äôt really find anything in the way to explain it. Does this happen to anyone ?"
Maladaptive Daydreaming and thoughts of sex.,14,m79bjv,12,"Hello everyone. I‚Äôm a 36 year old woman with derealization, living vicariously through fantasies that I make in my head or what they call ‚Äúmaladaptive daydreaming.‚Äù For a while now all I really enjoy thinking about is sex. I suppose I have a human need for intimacy and love at the moment that I can‚Äôt fulfill so I escape to those fantasies which don‚Äôt even really involve me since I think about other characters and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù how they would feel. I try to read, but these thoughts are so powerful, they give my brain such a rush that I can‚Äôt focus on much else. I tried writing but the words don‚Äôt come. I hate going from numb to terrified and anxious to absorbed in these thoughts. Am I so lonely I‚Äôd rather live in my head? Can good things still happen in real life? I do wonder... Anyone here knows how to kill your libido forever? Or have you felt like this?"
I live alternate lives rather than face my own,38,m6p2cv,5,"I‚Äôm a 24-year-old writer. I‚Äôm on disability due to my diagnoses, of which there are several. I have dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization and derealization disorder, all stemming from a combination of horrific bullying and my mother‚Äôs sudden death when I was 15, along with the subsequent abusive relationship that developed with my father because of her passing. 

What this means for my daily life is I am 100% dissociated from the moment I wake till I go to sleep. 

I do not work. I have in the past but find it impossible now. I don‚Äôt drive. 

To cope I have constructed fantasy simulations of my life in my mind. Lives where I‚Äôm a famous game developer, screenwriter, playwright, author, actor ‚Äî you name it. When I watch new films or tv shows, I immediately integrate them into a personal canon by pretending I‚Äôm the director/artist responsible for making it, and I‚Äôm showcasing my completed masterpiece to a group of adoring friends. When I read famous novels I pretend I‚Äôm the author. 

This alternate reality is the only space where I‚Äôm not panicked and frightened and depressed, because the reality is ‚Äî I‚Äôm not any of that. Not successful, not wealthy, deeply unhappy. From the viewpoint of wider society I‚Äôm probably just a welfare bum. Nobody notices me. My attempts to make a career, make friends, get into grad school ‚Äî all of those have failed. I‚Äôm invisible. So the fantasy world is the best place for me. 

Just wondering if anyone else does this. I‚Äôve done it since I was a child, and at times the fiction feels more real than reality."
Anyone else have something like this when dissociating?,6,m6o26k,3,"So, something I've managed to take note of for my therapist is when I dissociate I genuinely feel like I can't see in front of me. I've had dreams exactly like this, like best way I can describe is turning on a light switch and it doesn't work, or having a light on but nothing is lit up. It feels weird to just walk around."
Does anyone else‚Äôs eyes get sensitive while starting to dissociate?,5,m6jbhk,4,"Whenever I feel myself slipping into the void, 9/10 times it‚Äôs accompanied by my eyes getting really red, pupils becoming pinpoint, and sensitivity to light. Otherwise I don‚Äôt have any other physical indicators. I‚Äôve struggled with dissociation for about 7 years now and this sign really only started about a year ago."
I can't stop talking to someone who isn't there.,20,m6gc5x,14,"For a few months and especially in the past two weeks, I have been having conversations someone who I am (sexually) attracted to. I don't hear voices or actually see the person, but I look at a pictures of him a lot. I am 22, still live w/ family, have no job (can't find one and probably couldn't do it anyway) and am in college. I spend most of my days alone, isolated from my family, and fearful of leaving the house because of how I look and feel. For the past 7 years I have been socially isolated (and dissociated much of that time) and I have never formed emotional bonds to people (not even my parents). So naturally, I crave love and connection and have for years (but am disgusted w/ myself obviously). 

I talk to this person most of the day, sometimes looking in the mirror thinking I am talking to him while looking at myself. I do my makeup daily even when I don't need to to try and feel more attractive when I am talking to him. I am basically like [this lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uES3lA9OU), but usually less intense lol.  When I go to bed, I imagine him next to me. I don't think it's erotomania because I don't believe he likes me at all. I can pretend I am talking to him for hours, sometimes all night. I barely remember anything from the past two weeks. I have a therapist who does not help and I am on 30 mg of parnate a day. My depression is much worse since this has worsened, and I find myself exhausted everyday just wanting to be in bed or distracted. I feel like I am losing my mind. Talking to him has made me feel better sometimes, and I feel like it is the closest I can get to practicing talking to people since my social brain pretty much stopped developing at 15 when I starting isolating. Sometimes I laugh out loud, which I haven't done in years. But I feel so ashamed and weird. I just want to be normal, but I don't want to face reality, and I never really have and don't think I actually can. Does anyone know what to do?

Thanks for reading. Sorry for the long post."
I just made a thing,2,m6exn8,0,I can‚Äôt post a pic now but I had to write a note to myself since I still feel dissociated. But I wrote something in two different thought sets so I feel better In a few hours and maybe my format might help a few people. I just might not remember this later that‚Äôs why I have to post this now. Sorry guysüò£
Split,4,m62j49,0,"Surrealism hits me like a blow. 
Rarely as today do I experience 
the difference between being 
and being-in-itself so clearly. 
Detached, outside. 
Only a rigid shell. 
I walk and stand at the same point. 
My spirit looks down from above. 

I should experience shock, 
should fear,
tremble and despair. 
A cold shiver, 
or an overwhelming heat. 
I should flee or I should fight. 

But what I experience is the cold 
air wrapping itself around the back of my head, 
my spirit leaving my body. 
Rising towards nothing and fading away.  
I see the chest rising and falling. 
Open but expressionless eyes. 
Silenced thoughts. 
An empty shell. 
Detached. 
Split. 

Like a zip, the individual separated 
parts fall to the ground, 
collapsing in on themselves, 
without the hold of its supporting pillar. 
They do not form a whole, 
so, they are broken. 

Strange voices at my ear, 
but I hear nothing. 
Sounds in the far distance. 
Eyes mist up with black. 
Where arms had been, 
I float in empty space. 
Only the dark angels with me 
in the maelstrom of darkness. 
I am not afraid, 
I am drawn down into nothingness, 
I lose myself in eternal silence. 
Peaceful, 
silent, 
detached, 
split.

I feel like i‚Äôm living in plane mode and nothing feels real and i don‚Äôt know what to do,7,m62clu,1,"I feel like i‚Äôm not the one controlling my body and i spent most of my days living inside my head (if that makes sense) and feeling like my sorroundings aren‚Äôt real and it completely freaks me out because i can‚Äôt pay atention nor enjoy anything, and sometimes i even get claustrophobic¬ø? Because i feel like i‚Äôm trapped inside my brain, i don‚Äôt know what to do and it freaks me out"
Does anyone have moments where objects look very small and their distance is completely distorted?,45,m5z1ne,16,"It's happened to me a few times, mostly with houses. They end up shrinking and expanding in size both vertically and horizontally. And the distance between them and I seems to oscillate as well. Sometimes I almost feel like I could reach out and grab them as if they were miniatures.

Have any of you ever experienced this? Is this dissociation? Typically when I dissociate I have a more out-of-body kind of experience and I don't necessarily feel that way when this happens. Mostly nauseas if anything. I'm leaning more towards it being a hallucination."
Experience with Naltrexone?,1,m5whco,7,"Hello I‚Äôm new here. 
I struggle with anxiety and depression, and disassociation the past few months. My therapists thinks this MAY have been caused or triggered from smoking weed. I‚Äôm talking with a psychiatrist about naltrexone, but I haven‚Äôt started it yet. Does anybody here have any experience with it for mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and more specifically disassociation/ Derealization/ depersonalization? I just want to feel better, everything‚Äôs been agonizing."
How do u know if you have disassociation or multiple personalities?,12,m5s6bi,4,"Hi, I‚Äôm so sorry for using this term. I know it‚Äôs no longer called multiple personality disorder, I just feel like this is how most people know it and understand it. How do u know if you just have disassociation and derealization vs multiple personality disorder? I‚Äôve been disassociating for so long it‚Äôs scary, it‚Äôs been almost 2 months. I started Zoloft but it‚Äôs not really working and my therapist doesn‚Äôt know much about disassociation."
Acute State of Dissociation,9,m5eoej,13,"What helps you best in an acute state (depersonalisation, derealisation) of dissociation? I have made the experience that I don‚Äôt really get out of this state well myself, I usually need help for that (therapist, a friend who know what‚Äôs going on). I‚Äôve already tried out some skills from DBT. Have you found other possibilities for you?"
this is probably good?,3,m5ar5a,0,"So I got in touch with       m e n t a l    h e a l t h    s e r v i c e s    and now I'm pretty sure I've got the Beepadeep (BPD) ill probably tell the psychiatrist   


So basically WHY   
is my body so weird.

It's like, I'm autosexual so I sometimes love it but then  
I sometimes look at my hands and disassociate while the music I was listening to becomes background white noise and then BOOm

self image issues   


why"
DP/DR and Sex,5,m56che,4,"Does anybody else feel a disconnection from sexual feelings? I've been in a healthy relationship for 3 years,  he's incredibly amazing,  respectful and hot as hell. I am 100% sexually attracted to him. Now,  this is where it might get tmi for some people but: I know when I'm horny. I have the thoughts and it excites me,  but I feel like it's dulled compared to other people? Like. I don't have an urge to do anything more, i really couldn't care less if we have sex or not in that moment and usually I opt to not do anything,  but ofc if he starts doing stuff to me (consensually ofc) ill go along with it and it all eventually works out. I think it might have something to do with the body mind disconnect but I really have no idea and just wanted to know if anyone can somewhat relate to this? I know some people with ptsd become hypersexual, that's definitely not the case for me,  i also don't have sexual trauma. Also super sorry if this is confusing so:

 Tl;dr I can get mentally horny but I also rarely proceed to do anything sexual. I have a theory its my dissociation but it could be unrelated. I wanted to know if anyone gets this."
Anyone have horrifying dissociation but lately it‚Äôs good?,23,m54vhu,3,"Ok, I was diagnosed with depersonalization. And all day since I woke up I am really amazed. My beverages are already where I want them. I‚Äôm constantly delighted and feeling on top of things. It‚Äôs a relief because I think ok I gotta bring this cup here or put this away. 

And I walk over and the cups already there on the coffee table as I wanted to place it. Idk if it‚Äôs a side effect of this new antipsychotic. I always panicked when I‚Äôd dissociate full blown horror and anxiety sometimes for hours on end or 30 mins. But I space out so deep and so far.. ha .. key words. I‚Äôm overjoyed by these small surprises. I just now see why people use drugs to feel this. 

My brain just does it. Ole trauma from childhood and up. It‚Äôs a new skill I‚Äôve acquired I‚Äôm giggling. Anyone else experience? Or what other types.. idk
if starting this new antipsychotic and having hyperthyroid recently . Is allowing me to not suffer when I dissociate. Curious what you all think, and your experiences."
Can I still have dissociation?,8,m505h6,3,"I don‚Äôt have any trauma. At least that I know of I guess. I had a very normal childhood, good parents, good family. Nothing has happened to me as a teen or young adult (I‚Äôm 24F) that would be traumatizing. 
The only thing about me that maybe has to do with anything is that I‚Äôm extremely anxious. I have been all my life. Like even with I was very young. For example I would cry all day at school till I was probably 6 or 7 because I was so anxious. I also think I had mild OCD as a kid because I used to have to tap my wall so many time before I went to bed or I thought my family would die. I had a few things like that I would do.

Anyways. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a dissociative disorder. Usually I get this feeling like nothing is real. Like I can‚Äôt be positive I‚Äôm actually experiencing life. I think  ‚Äúwhat if this is just a dream and I haven‚Äôt woken up‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm dead and I‚Äôm not actually here.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how to explain it really. I even have faint memories as a kid of telling my parents ‚Äúdo you ever feel like nothing is real?‚Äù But I also think like ‚Äúwhat if I just made those memories up?‚Äù I feel like I can‚Äôt trust anything. I am a nanny and sometimes when I leave I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwait did the parents actually come home or did I just think they did and I left the kids alone.‚Äù Stuff like that. I plan on going to a therapist soon as I know this all probably isn‚Äôt normal. So if anyone says ‚Äúyou should see a therapist‚Äù trust me I know I‚Äôm working on it haha. Still I‚Äôm mostly just wondering if that is a dissociative disorder or maybe just something else and if I can have a dissociative disorder without having any trauma in my life?"
Have I been Dissociating for Years,3,m4rt6k,1,"So, I just posted about this situation in another subreddit but I want to ask a different question about it here. For the past 2-4 years (my concept of time is horrible) I‚Äôve found myself unable to talk about anything I care about, or to seemingly even have thoughts that aren‚Äôt self depreciating. This has put a serious strain on my relationship. Recently I‚Äôve discovered I have dissociative issues and likely OSDD. When I discovered them I realized I had been in a state of dissociation for months, but I don‚Äôt remember when this was. That said, I also find myself unable to remember things, even if they just happened, and it‚Äôs like my life is disappearing behind me. But then the things I do remember are the same as what I‚Äôm experiencing now. It‚Äôs hard to do anything productive. Lately it seems to just be getting worse as the world around me feels unreal and I find myself staring at nothing and thinking nothing more often than I find myself not. So, is it possible that I‚Äôve been in a near constant state of dissociation for possibly 3+ years, possibly longer? If so, any advice?"
I dissociate 99% of the time due to childhood trauma and I get physically sick when I come out of it. Coping methods?,24,m4p79u,6,
Anyone else feel different types of dissociation?,18,m4isbl,5,"‚ÄúDissociation is a break in how your mind handles information. You may feel disconnected from your thoughts, feelings, memories, and surroundings. It can affect your sense of identity and your perception of time.‚Äù

Does anyone else dissociate in different ways each time? Like depending on what caused it, I might have a few different symptoms in each episode. My therapist says I have BPD traits so some of this falls into that criteria also.

Right now I just feel empty. Removed from reality. It‚Äôs especially bad when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm either emotionally numb (most of the time), or my emotions are dialed to 90-100%. Like I‚Äôm running on autopilot.

Whenever a bad thought enters my head and I start ruminating (usually about an ex), my vision gets blurry and my eyes suddenly feel heavy. It‚Äôs almost instant. Sometimes I‚Äôm asking myself, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù Other times, I‚Äôm just completely absent. Then there‚Äôs times where my vision doesn‚Äôt blur at all, I just feel floaty yet heavy and I feel a little removed from my senses. Touch feels weird and distant. Watching my hands or looking at myself feels off. Like I know they‚Äôre mine but it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm using them when they move. Movements kind of look like animation with some of the frames removed so it‚Äôs ‚Äúoff.‚Äù

When I have panic attacks I think I also feel a type of dissociation. I feel a lot of the same symptoms, yet everything around me feels ‚Äúhyper-real‚Äù and scary. And sometimes dissociation makes me anxious, but other times it‚Äôs just numbness.

Is this dissociation with some spells of derealization thrown in? Is that why they feel different?"
dissociation from weed,6,m458lo,13,"i‚Äôm about a month ago i got really really high for like the first time, i had a bad trip and now a month later i still feel dissociated and i relived my bad trip twice after i was completely sober. has this happened to anyone else? will it go away? i feel like i‚Äôm going crazy. i recently got drunk and that made it 100 times worse. please help me."
hi,1,m40wja,2,"Ever since October 2020, I have had this weird feeling that my surroundings aren't real and that nothing that I do really matters. It is often a bad feeling because I used to be so hyper aware of my surroundings and I used to remember everything that I do. Now life simply feels like one blob that I can never seem to escape no matter what I do about it. I had thought that my dissociation was triggered by my job (Starbucks) where I had started working back in October. However, the company provides me with 20 free therapy sessions and I have been using them. I talked to my therapist about this feeling and she said its a response to the guilt and shame I feel. I felt a little bit better in January of 2021 when I had transferred locations and had less stress to deal with. It flared back up in February of 2021 because I stopped going to college because I graduated. It sucks because I have no motivation to do anything because I am like why does it matter. I also used to love my job but it honestly feels so insufferable to go. It has also been harder to text my friends or even talk to them for that matter. I also feel the same way with my partner and my parents, I love them so much but I feel so detached from them as well as my emotions. To note, I have tried everything. I meditate in the mornings, do yoga, read, try to decrease my screen time, and I have also do things that interest me. It all leaves me feeling the same way"
Seriously have 0 idea who I am right now and it‚Äôs freaking me out. Any advice?,26,m3xw6a,18,I‚Äôm like too anxious to ground. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve never felt this strange
DAE do this? Big TW!!,1,m3rr2f,1,"Sometimes I‚Äôm just stuck sitting somewhere staring into space/my hands. But I‚Äôll go on autopilot sometimes when I dissociate hard. I.e. if I‚Äôm driving my mind tells me I NEED to get where I‚Äôm going and can *usually* get there no problem even if I have no memory of it. Well there‚Äôs been a few times when before dissociating I‚Äôm in a bad mindset and think I need to self harm, so that‚Äôs exactly what happens. It‚Äôs so scary to come back and see blood and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. Am I alone in this?"
Dissociative issues.,2,m3rq2k,1,"What are some ways to control/deal with dissociation? I was diagnosed with D.I.D a couple of years ago and experience very very heavy dissociation during everyday life/ esp when experiencing intimacy/sex. I immediately experience crazy Anxiety & feel myself drift off.my mind wanders like crazy and sometimes I feel extremely small,scared confused like a child.i often end up being really bad at sex becus I am completely off.i don't realize how bad it is until after.I am unable to focus or connect with my S.O becus I am so out of it. Eye contact is extremely hard and makes me uncomfortable or I just end up giving dead eyes. I am a survivor of sexual tramua and in therapy but i haven't allowed myself to start digging those things up yet."
What's the point?,10,m3pl30,2,"I don't even know if this is the right place to post this but I don't even know what state I'm in and I'm don't see the point of even being alive anymore. It feels like I'm viewing my life through backwards binoculars, if that even makes sense. My family, friends, and coworkers feel foreign and not real. I don't feel real. I so badly want to be dead even though I already feel dead. It's hard to explain. This has been going on for months now and I can't take it anymore. I have a plan that I will carry out as soon as certain things are in place. Knowing that this is life and how it's always going to be, I don't want to be apart of it anymore."
idk if this applies,4,m3o9es,1,"I have no idea what's going on really but nothing feels quite right? some days have different/ unique flavors to them, today being one of them, but in the now i just have a persistent dull headache and everything feels off but like my brain is also denying that anything is wrong, its frustrating... I keep having to unfurrow my eyebrows and everything just feels... off. the flavor of day is still here so at least its not totally unreal but still. idk about how real i myself feel but that's another story.. i guess i want some kind of reassurance? or something. i just want to be able to get stuff done but im pretty sure its getting worse as i type this?  


anyways, all y'all are valid and thanks for reading my bullshit haha"
Is this Dissociation or DPDR?,3,m3nz4j,0,"Hello everyone, so ever since August or September I have had very bad OCD/Health anxiety. I never felt dissociate in that period

I started taking Lamictal for a mood disorder in January and stopped taking it soon after because of side effects. I had terrible withdrawal symptoms and that's when I started feeling dissociated ever since.

My symptoms: Feel a little dizzy and like in a blur/movie when I go out. Also when I'm watching a film or play a game with dialogue, it feels a little hard to concentrate on the picture and what they are saying. Also speaking is a but of a challenge, words get in the way.

Is this common with dissociation or DPDR? I was also diagnosed with ADD, don't know if I'm just more aware of it now"
Nothing..,20,m3mrcp,5,"I have no desire to do anything anymore, my sex drive is non-existent and my boyfriend is probably getting frustrated by now. I've been dissociating for a year and a half/2 years, I don't know the time just meshes together. I know I have to stop, I've got the banks looking for me, my phone's been shut off, car's about to be repossessed.. Nothing seems real anymore, when I do feel anything it's waves of panic that are quickly swallowed away as I slip back into the safety of nothingness. I don't know what I'm doing and I need help.."
What helps you to snap back to reality?,4,m3fagq,3,"I've been feeling dissociation for quite a while now (a few months maybe?) and I honestly don't know how to make it go away. I've tried mind fulness, but that doesn't seem to help a lot. Either I drift into thoughts or it just doesn't help much. I don't know what causes it either. I doubt it is caused by a traumatic event, as I have a great family, and was not experiencing anything too traumatic in my family or outside it. I doubt it is caused by self hate, as I have a high self esteem and happy to be who I am. I suspect that depression is what causing it. Two years ago I went through an identity crisis and fell into depression, that's when I started having dissociation. It passed when the crisis was over and I got out of this depression. Now, because of the virus, my country is constantly in lockdown, which means that I have to stay home all the time and learn from my computer. Because of it I'm depressed again, and I think that this is what causing the dissociation to come back.

&#x200B;

I have found out that listening to music, podcasts, watching movies, or reading books helps me to get out of the dissociation. but instead of anchoring to reality, my consciousness anchors itself to what I'm listening to/watching. Although this helps in the short term, when I have to go back to reality the dissociation comes back. It is as though reality doesn't serve as an anchor to my mind anymore, and so I feel as though being halfway into nothingness.

&#x200B;

If you have any information on how to deal with it better I'll be glad to hear it! :)"

Dissociation or am I stupid,2,m2kt54,3,Hi! Soo for the past year or so I have been having a really hard time keeping a train of thought. This happens mostly when I‚Äôm at work (Starbucks). A coworker will say something to me and my brain just totally blanks out and I have no idea what they said. Or someone will ask me about what position I worked yesterday and I don‚Äôt know because all of my days blur together. One time I was having such a hard time keeping a train of thought I asked someone else to count out change for a $100 because my brain just felt like it was NOT working. I still am a highly functioning employee 95% of the time as I do everything on auto pilot mode. I feel really stupid and my coworkers make a lot of jokes about me never knowing what‚Äôs going on. I was wondering if I am actually stupid or if these are examples of dissociation? Brain fog? Maybe important to note that I am on Effexor right now and noticed it‚Äôs made my dissociation worse. I was just wondering if these are also little symptoms of dissociation.
Memories of dissociation as a child,18,m2hj6j,4,"I have dissociated most through my tween years until now and I just remembered this time when I was 10 or 11, that I was sitting on a bench at night and looking at a tree and the children‚Äôs playground around it. And suddenly it felt so unreal. It‚Äôs like the scene is in a movie and I can still see that image even now. I can remember I was talking a walk with my mom and she told me my dad needs to move to another city for his work."

I say the most hurtful things to my partners and after 7 years and a child together I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I constantly feel like running from my relationship and I struggle and feel like I don‚Äôt even deserve my son at times. My fianc√© is of the mindset that he might as well keep things in storage because who knows when I‚Äôll flip out and tell him to leave. I know I‚Äôve hurt him so bad and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I want to make things right but I feel like it‚Äôs too late. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be truly happy in a relationship. There‚Äôs always this part of me that wants to run and hide and push people away. I put on this act at work like I‚Äôm fine and I‚Äôm really not. I don‚Äôt know how to fix my negative thoughts. How to push them away and bury them so I don‚Äôt hurt the people I love.
Which way of therapy/psychotherapy you practice and recommend,3,m20r5p,5,"Hey everyone,

So far I haven't had much success with psychotherapies(I guess majority was gestalt and any sort of ""talk"" therapy. I have had appointments with psychiatrist too

Most of the time diagnosed with depression, anxiety, latest psychiatrist even prescribed me concerta with possible attention issues that I guess stems from early age trauma and some bullying that induced tremendous amount of shame, guilt, anger for not intervening when anyone tried to hurt me

I will have my first (successful) somatic experience soon, had one that was complete failure and got some contact for a body psychotherapist and she also had a degree for EMDR

My issues as mentioned are possible early age trauma(a few years ago I have been told that my mother left our family couple of times) that induced big amount of trust issues, insecurities(in relationships), attachment issues, abandonment issues

What do you think of my plan for helping myself out? Any other psychology path?

Thanks!"
Please help,16,m1yn9n,12,"My boyfriend figured out some stuff I didn't tell him about from my past , I told him that I don't remember and its true I don't but after he told me what he knew it started coming back to me , he doesn't understand that I was lying and dissociated my whole life because I knew no one would accept me for who I am because I did horrible things, I cheated a lot , I used to steel money from my friends, I have been sexualizing myself when I was young and I used my cousin when she was a child as well , I know I have been sexualy abused as a child I just don't remember who or how and all of this ruined me so much and I started forgetting everything about my life and I started a new one with him.
But he wants to know all about my past and I know he will leave if he knew all of this horrible things , its like this was another person , she was so dumb and naive , I can't make peace with the old version of myself and I don't know if I will ever be able to.
I feel like I have been dissociated my whole life and I have no memories and I refuse to remember."
Forgetting how to interact,42,m1ndal,10,"Do you guys ever forget how to have a conversation or interact with people when you're going through dissociation?

Expecting to fall through the ground or walls?,9,m1mahp,1,"Sometimes I feel like I'm about to fall through the ground or phase through the walls. I try to push against the walls, but that hasn't worked. Sometimes I daydream about falling while I feel this. What is this?"
Not being able to recognize familiar places?,3,m1j8p7,1,"I‚Äôve recently been having these experiences and I‚Äôm not sure if this is dissociation or something different? basically I am just going about my day and suddenly I dont recognize where I am. It spans from ‚Äúwhere the fuck am i?‚Äù to ‚Äúokay this looks a bit like what i remember but something is terribly off‚Äù. it feels like this usually happens when driving (on the same roads ive been driving on for the past 6 years of my life lol) and it can be fucking terrifying. 

for reference, i am diagnosed with ptsd and do have other experiences with dissociation in my past however this all just feels different?? additionally i would say i havent exhibited any other ptsd symptoms in the past year or so. i‚Äôve tried looking up others account of situation like this but keep only finding sources on agnosia however given my history of trauma/diagnosis i feel like dissociation is the logical answer 

tdlr: am i dissociating or going crazy because I keep losing my ability to recognize the world around me?"
Dissociation During School,4,m1fqyf,4,I have a huge issue with dissociating during a particular class. Its gotten to the point where sometimes I dont remember if I even went to class later in the day. The teacher terrifies me and I know that that's why I'm dissociating. I currently have a D in the class and I just cant retain any information from it no matter how much I study. I just want to pass. Does anyone have any tips?
Hands felt unreal,7,m1com3,1,I was holding my phone on my desk just barely and I started feeling like my hands were sliding down and sinking into the desk. I've had depersonalization and other dissociative issues frequently but this was the first time I felt this. Is this just an extreme form of depersonaliztion? Or was i having a delusion/hallucination? I did some grounding and talked myself through it but it kind of freaked me out.

Tobacco,8,m0d3v5,15,"2018- ish i got my first dp / dissociation super scary and i used to smoke cigarettes that time and I really don‚Äôt remember how and then i quit smoking. And I really don‚Äôt remember how much later my dp was gone i should‚Äôve kept track really. Around april 2020 i started to smoke again. I know im an idiot. Just cigarettes no week no alcohol. I drank alcohol like maybe once a month or even once every other month. Anyway fast forward February 2021 i suddenly got my dp back with dissociation dizziness and heavy head and i hate this so much. Im thinking about quitting cigarettes again, but idk would it help or not. Does anyone find that quitting tobacco made them heal faster ?"

What I Whilst High Off of LSD and weed but barely feeling either,5,m08c9e,0,"To me my life is so significant.

Yet to others it's nothing special. They all have their own lives to focus on.

If you saw things from my way maybe you'd understand, maybe if I saw things from your way I'd understand.

I've come to realise no one sees it right, just the best they let themselves see. If you ignore random thoughts they go away, but if you let them hold onto you they can change your whole perception of existence.

&#x200B;

At points I've told myself this is part of growing up, the realisations I've made, but then I remembered that people have lived far beyond me without these thoughts.

&#x200B;

This is something I have to face. Maybe this doesn't have to go completely, I just can't live afraid. I can't live afraid of my own perception.

Disassociation?,14,m02qan,2,"I have been having a very difficult time the past few months, i would rather not go into specifics because its not just one thing, its a lot, but there was a moment when i was at a cafe and it all got so much, like it was the most excruciatingly horrible and painful mind state ive ever felt, i put my head down between my arms, then when i lifted my head, i felt nothing at all, not one thing, good nor bad, nothing whatsoever, i was still aware of all that was happening, i just felt immense tranquility, or maybe it was that to feel nothing compared to what i did feel like was perceived as such. 

Either way i just dont know, ive not been diagnosed with anything, ive never spoken about my mental health to a doctor or whatnot, and it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault, i just dealt with things wrong and they piled up too high against me to cause me to be pushed to that point where whatever happened, happened. 

I believe its something i phase in and out of, there are moments that slice right through it and i feel truly bs and full of despair, but i can also have a lot of fun and look forward to things as usual, its just that every so often when things look bad, it kicks in, almost like its like my mind tying to protect me or something, who knows.

It is so severe that i have heard my friend speak about his suicide attempt and felt nothing, the first instance happened before he did so, and ive felt it many times throughout the past few months. It‚Äôs something i feel stupidly grateful for, even if thats really bad, atleast it gives me some time to recover my will and when it wears off or whatever i feel ready to take on things until it gets too much again. 

Sorry for rambling so much but i just wondered what someone may have thought, i also apologies if its all offer the place, my thoughts are kind of scattered at the moment. 

Have a nice rest of the day."
To whoever recovered,2,lzp8v6,1,"To whoever recovered how long it took you to recover and what is your number 1 tip in recovering.

What the fuck is even going on.,2,lzk0ks,0,"A couple hours ago I was reading and I came back out of the dissociation. The last time this happened was about a year ago and it lasted for a few days. I don't even get phased by it anymore. I'll probably sink back into the dissociation and there's probably nothing I can do about it. I have been this way for like 13 years now. I have no idea why it's like this.

When I'm dissociated I literally feel like my thoughts are just running and I'm just miserable and feel weird. It is so painful to be dissociated but it's literally all I know. The sad part is that there is literally nothing I can do to get out. When I'm dissociated that's all I think about--how do I get out how do I get out? I think about it 24/7 I can't even help myself. I just think about healing and coming back to myself. I try mediations, constantly trying to tell myself how I was a good kid, positive affirmations up the ass, etc but nothing really does anything I just feel a little bit better than when I feel like I hate myself. 

I have no fucking clue what is going on with me. It's like terrifying but I feel totally numb to it. It's like it doesn't even phase me because it's all I know."
Bad night,1,lziudc,0,"I had a pretty unstable childhood but the only constant light in my life was my grandma. She raised me most of the time while my mom was out ‚Äúfiguring herself out‚Äù & putting men before me & my other siblings. Siblings that went off to live with their other fathers. My own dad having nothing to do with me. 

I‚Äôve used dissociation to get through most of my life. However it‚Äôs been pretty consistent and relentless since the age of 16 when I had some pretty traumatic life events. I‚Äôm now 25 and just came out of the craziest years of my life. I had a mental breakdown, found out I was pregnant in the hospital trying to admit myself, lost my job due to COVID, moved back to my childhood home (grandma moved up north with my aunt)  and right before I was about to deliver my grandma died suddenly. 
I was able to get through all of it the same way I have my whole life and that‚Äôs to shut it off. I‚Äôve shut this whole year out. 

I was having a pretty good day. In awe of my beautiful 3 month old son. I actually felt happy and clear. Then I looked up and seen the house I grew up in with my grandma and it didn‚Äôt seem foreign to me. I ‚Äúfelt‚Äù all of those memories. Then it hit me... I‚Äôm never going to see that beautiful woman anymore. I‚Äôll never just be able to sit and talk to her again. I couldn‚Äôt handle it.

That‚Äôs when I realized I‚Äôll never be able to get out of this until I process a lot of things. Things that I‚Äôm honestly not ready to feel."

Does this count as dissociation?,6,lzd5h8,10,"For reference I am diagnosed with PTSD, Bipolar, ADHD, and Fibromyalgia. I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúdissociation‚Äù brought up in all those spaces but I‚Äôve never known if it applies to me.

I lay in bed on my phone for hours just mindlessly scrolling through Reddit and Pinterest. It‚Äôs an escape from the world and I do it way too much. A lot of times when I‚Äôm doing it I lose track of time for sometimes up to like 8 hours and I have no idea what I‚Äôve read or looked at.

I disassociate every time I get into the drivers seat and have nearly caused accidents. I understand the rules of the road but I disassociate the whole time I‚Äôm driving and as soon as I leave my car everything feels fine again within about 20 minutes. Does this happen to anyone else?

Confusing reality,4,lz28ez,2,"Sometimes I get very scared. Cause I feel like I'm not real.

"I feel like I can't focus, and I'm withdrawn into my mind? Is it dissociation?",13,lz1i3u,0,"Not sure if this is where tonpost this, tried adhd and they pointed me here,

In the last 2 years it feels like I've lost my ability to focus on something, I feel like I'm just mindlessly going through life, almost like I'm zoned out 24/7. I try to physically focus my eyes on something and I can't. Is it dissociation? I feel like I can still function fine, drive, work, etc. I also have some memory problems, I can't remember at all what I did at work yesterday. The biggest thing it affects that I've noticed, is playing the piano. I use to play a lot, almost went to college, but took a 2 year gap and I'm trying to re-learn it, but I can't get myself to focus on the music anymore no matter how much I try.

Is there any focusing excercises that I can do to help this?

Dissociation has ruined my (21M) sense of time and it makes it hard to take care of myself sometimes.,10,lyv58m,4,"I just feel like my sense of time has completely gone out the window. Sometimes 5 minutes will feel like 3 hours and sometimes an 8 hours feels like half an hour. Also sometimes I‚Äôll get home from work or being out and it‚Äôll feel like the whole thing just didn‚Äôt happen.

I don‚Äôt know what the point of this post is, but its so frustrating to feel like I‚Äôm losing whole days to being out of it. On days where it‚Äôs particularly bad, it feels like I literally don‚Äôt have enough time in the day to do anything other than lie in bed. 

I just wanna know if I‚Äôm alone in this feeling."

My psycologist told I am making it all up,1,ly8uc5,3,I asked him that i was able to relate many things that dissociative and ptsd patients say.but he don't think I am fitnfor that category.whatever it's not the importance in focusing diagnosis but treatment.a customized on like my psycologist said try to take methods from many books that work and don't just over felt on diagnosis about a paricular book.he told me it helps but sometimes it may feel stressfull also..
This is INSANE,53,ly4l2q,14,"I (20F) lived in a state of derealization for as long as I can remember. About five months ago, after a big and very weird road trip alone across the entire US, I started to come out of it. 

Everything feels SO REAL now. Space looks different, trees are beautiful and dimensional and familiar rooms feel like new spaces. Everything I saw used to seem two dimensional. I‚Äôm so cognizant now of other people‚Äôs separate life experiences... it‚Äôs hard to explain, but before, it was almost like people didn‚Äôt exist when they weren‚Äôt around me. Life was like a movie, there just wasn‚Äôt anything else to the story besides what the camera captured.

I can look in people‚Äôs eyes now. Empathy has a whole new meaning. I can communicate more effectively, advocate for myself and my needs, and be so much more authentic with others. 

I am also horrified. My childhood, my teenage years... I never felt the weight of so much of that. My first love, the joys of family, losses, accomplishments, mistakes. It‚Äôs horrifying how far away my brain put me.

I thought I would share this here in case anyone could relate or had similar stories, or in case this might help anyone. Because coming out of this is beautiful, but it‚Äôs also messy and very VERY scary. I simply can‚Äôt believe we all exist on this big beautiful and messed up world.

In the beginning of this journey through DR, it was just moments of clarity or presence. I could sense something was changing. But it took a lot of faith to believe this emergence actually might be happening and that I wasn‚Äôt just imagining it. And every day now, I feel more and more grounded, more and more present, and more terrifyingly alive in a continuous nature.



Much love to all of you in this community! Brains are whack, and I‚Äôm grateful to know through this community that I am not alone, even if I‚Äôm the only one piloting this particular brain."
Can dissociation be a blessing?,5,lxwz4v,1,.
Comfort place/headspace,3,lxw4zd,0,"This is kind of a weird question but I'm just now finding out that not everyone has this, but does anyone here have a place they go to in their head when they're completely dissociated/having a really hard time mentally? mine is a perfect recreation of my childhood home and I can ""go"" there only when my brain really needs to (these are the only ways to describe it that make sense). Sometimes there are other people there that I know aren't real people in my life, but they're very comforting. When I'm really upset I can kind of hear them arguing about who has to ""put me to bed"" but nothing else really comes from that. I see a psychiatrist regularly and we talk about my dissociation a lot but I'm wondering if anyone else has this?"
Dissociation?,5,lxr45s,0,"I think it all started the first time I tried acid and then took my first dab during the trip which after that had a bad trip and noticed whenever I would smoke weed after that I was very sensitive to it and it became more psychedelic, before that I didn‚Äôt really have a limit I could smoke as much as I wanted even tho I hadn‚Äôt smoked that much prior. This was about 4 years ago so I can‚Äôt really remember if I felt like I was feeling the things I‚Äôm feeling now but I‚Äôm pretty sure after that nothing was really the same, I continued to smoke tho and tried shrooms too eventually which was a great trip and ended up taking acid and shrooms and good bit more in smaller doses as time went on but where I‚Äôm at now I think I‚Äôm constantly disassociating just now learning about this stuff so don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what it is but I think it is I just don‚Äôt really feel here my memory is terrible and just articulating my thoughts is difficult and I just kinda feel like a zombie on autopilot a lot of the time and usually when that‚Äôs happening I‚Äôm deep in my thoughts ruminating on existential things or just stuff that stresses me out or random shit, most of the time tho im neither in the present moment or with those thoughts tho I‚Äôm just kinda there I‚Äôm not really aware of my thoughts or my surroundings also I‚Äôve had a lot of anxiety and stress at points where it was almost all day everyday and I hear that can cause derealization as well and that would happen before I took acid that first time. I was never feeling like nothing feels real and all that until I think about and realize nothing really does seem real a lot of time that doesn‚Äôt really cause me to panic or any of this I‚Äôm usually pretty apathetic about it and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm thinking everything is fake either it‚Äôs just kinda bland and idk why but this stuff is starting to really bother me and I do sometimes get very emotional about it maybe they could be called panic attacks I‚Äôm not sure. It feels like my brain just needs a refresh but I don‚Äôt know how to get to feeling normal again, from what I‚Äôve read the root of derealization is anxiety so if you get rid of that it goes with and I do still get anxious sometimes but it‚Äôs definetly not like when it was bad and I feel I‚Äôm constantly in a state of derealization it doesn‚Äôt really come in episodes if anything I have brief moments where I kinda feel more here and I‚Äôm confused about that cause I‚Äôm not constantly feeling anxious at least that I can tell but Ik I do stress a lot about what I‚Äôm going to do I‚Äôm 18 and feel like I‚Äôm supposed to have more figured out about what I‚Äôm doing with my life, I know I want to enjoy it so I really want to fix this derealization thing which I‚Äôm guessing just may be a combination of trauma, drugs, stress/anxiety. I think when I am able to make an effort to feel present I feel a little more here so I‚Äôve just been trying to make an effort to do that as often as I can and meditating and trying to excersise as often as I can, also I feel like socializing helps when I have good interactions but that‚Äôs difficult cause that‚Äôs where I feel the most anxious is in social situations and I feel I just completely suck at socialization now so it‚Äôs hard to have those good interactions that make me feel good. I am seeing a therapist and I‚Äôm going to see if she can help with this as well but do you guys have any tips?"
Could this be dissociation,1,lxp2xu,0,"I change all of a sudden like I‚Äôm someone else

Hi people! So basically I‚Äôve been experiencing something really weird, one moment I feel calm normal and all sane, then all of a sudden I become so sad, and rage so hard at everything like I‚Äôm talking bashing things and smashing things, and everything I do for the rest of the stay feels like I‚Äôm just another person; and the scary part is everything I do for the rest of the day is blurry as if I‚Äôm dreaming and not actually living it, and the next day I don‚Äôt even remember much from after the anger. During these periods I feel suicidal and depressed asf, and also enraged too, right now I literally feel normal like I don‚Äôt feel sad or anything, but all of a sudden I stop being normal. One trigger is when I‚Äôm cocky, I literally take on a new personality, and I go into the zone and forget what even just happened, and when I calm down I feel foggy and weak. And another trigger is when something pisses me off even in the slightest, I go beserk and forget everything, the only thing that stops it is going to sleep and waking up, or just suddenly snapping out of it. One more thing I want to add right now, when I feel normal, I want to do many things such as go for a run or workout, but when I go enraged I forget that it even exists I turn my sights on random things that make no sense. Sorry if I‚Äôm waffling around, but I don‚Äôt even realise this while I‚Äôm in that state like I FOR SOME REASON believe my life is always like this always bad and I have this disgusting feeling in my chest/stomach feeling like it‚Äôs always been like this, but for example rn I don‚Äôt feel like it.

If anyone can help tell me what is going on because I‚Äôm scared for my health and safety, I think I made another post yesterday about some problem with a girl; I was in that state I was saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having suicidal thoughts‚Äù but right now I don‚Äôt feel like trash or anything I feel normal almost like I don‚Äôt remember ever even thinking that???

If anyone can offer me advice and how I can get help I will be greatly appreciated!

How do you tell the difference between anxiety and disassociation/derealization?,3,lxmurv,1,"
To start off, I likely have OCD and am being treated w 5mg Lexapro. I used to have religious OCD when younger but I became non religious and no longer felt that way. I now go to a catholic school because my parents wanted me to and it‚Äôs a good school.

Fast forward to this morning 

We have something called 7:17 liturgy on thursdays which is optional, but if your club is hosting you have to attend. I‚Äôm in NHS and we were hosting this time 

I‚Äôve been in church thousands of times even while being non-binary, gay, autistic, so many alienating things but I‚Äôm usually able to stomach it and get through it with mild annoyance that I have to take time out of my day for this. But today was different 

I haven‚Äôt been relatively anxious since starting my medication, and religious stuff usually doesn‚Äôt make me feel like... this.

When I was there, it started as mild annoyance at some bible contradictions, nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle but.. as time went on, as I noticed everyone singing in sync, everyone so happy and comfortable, everyone else was right where they were supposed to be it seemed. Everyone knew I wasn‚Äôt religious but I couldn‚Äôt ignore the subtle side-stares of my teachers and classmates as they realized I wasn‚Äôt singing/praying. One of the youth ministers gave me a hymn book halfway through because I didn‚Äôt grab one because I‚Äôm not religious, even though I refused it and,... I‚Äôve just never been so aware that something about me is wrong.

It felt... unnatural, how in sync everyone else was, how normal this was to them and wrong how scared I was, how choked I felt, how I felt like I was harboring some dark, slimy, inky black evil mass inside of me working it‚Äôs way through my veins. Five minutes before the bell rung I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and I ran out, and once I got out of the room I could breathe again, even though there should have been no issue breathing before 

In my first class everything still felt wrong. Not just me but.. everything. Touching my head long enough to fix my hair felt sinful. Everything I looked around at felt wrong somehow even though I knew these rooms. The items inside and the people inside felt fake. 

I know the objects around me in this room are what they are, and if I touch them I will feel them and they will behave according to their properties. I know that. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs a cover for something. That hell is lying underneath. The room I‚Äôm really in must be different. I don‚Äôt know how much it differs from the one I‚Äôm in, maybe it‚Äôs barely a noticeable difference. But it can‚Äôt be this one. I feel like it can‚Äôt be.

What am I experiencing??? Is this just super charged catholic guilt or more?"

Age regression during dissociation spiral? Has anyone else experienced this?,13,lxbsgi,3,"I‚Äôm pretty new to identifying my experiences as dissociation (both me and my therapist aren‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs the right label), so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong on anything.    


A couple months ago I went down a pretty severe dissociation spiral, to the point I couldn‚Äòt emotionally recognize my family or friends at all.  It was terrifying being in cars and hanging around with them.  Felt very much unlike myself, nothing felt real, you know the drill.  I was desperate to find an answer as to why this was happening so much more severely (and much longer) than usual, and that‚Äôs when I found out most people don‚Äòt dissociate or have ‚Äúweird days‚Äù at all, or avoid certain songs because it‚Äôll make their brain ‚Äúweird‚Äù.

Naturally I was concerned, so I looked into why this might be happening.  The answers the internet gave me only freaked me out more, with all that ‚Äúchildhood trauma‚Äú stuff, and especially the idea that I might have DID (don‚Äôt know why that came up before dpdr, but it is what it is).  Of course this only made everything worse.

I don‚Äôt know if I manifested this out of paranoia or if age regression is just a common thing among people who dissociate, but eventually one night I suddenly felt as if I was a child (I use the pronoun ‚Äúhe‚Äù for him but for some reason in the moment it felt important for my brain to note he was androgynous).  I was immediately gripped with an extremely strong terror and started hitting myself and freaking out until it stopped.  I think it then happened again a week or so later, but my memory is really bad (especially from around that time) so I‚Äôm not sure.  I still am very avoidant to hug pillows or stuffed animals, because I felt that was what brought ‚Äúhim‚Äù out initially, even though ‚Äúhe‚Äù hasn‚Äôt been a problem in months now.  Aside from my own overthinking, of course.

I‚Äôd really like other people‚Äôs feedback about this, as my therapist doesn‚Äôt seem to have any clue for the time being and is just focusing on stuff she can handle (anxiety, depression, you know).  Is this normal for people who dissociate?  Did I just manifest this out of paranoia?  Does anyone else relate to this?  Feel free to ask me any questions if you need."

Recently my 76-year-old uncle was diagnosed with dementia (nobody will confirm this currently) Friday he packed his car, the dog, a bunch of guns and drove his car off the road and into a ravine. It doesn't seem to be a suicide attempt but he has no memory around the incident, or what led up to it, he is very confused at this point and is aggressive. His sisters are all very concerned about getting information yet do very little else. He has adult children and they are involved at this point but don't seem to be getting professional help for him. My question stems from is it possible for a family group to all use dissociation as a coping mechanism? The family has dealt with years of abuse and hidden trauma with substance abuse, sexual abuse coupled with devout catholicism. (so minimizing your feelings or pain is considered normal) They are all waiting for him to snap out of it and are scared that somehow they will ""catch"" what he has. My mother told me directly ""I'm glad it's not my family"" I told her it's your brother, how is it not your family. They end up feeling helpless or do a lot of head shaking or give it up to the lord sort of behavior. Is it possible this is a coping mechanism of an entire set of siblings? Any insight would be appreciated."
How to help my(24M) girlfriend (20F) deal with her dissociative disorder?,3,lwzsxf,1,"My girlfriend and I have both been diagnosed as depressed by a psychiatrist quite a while ago. 

I used to have dissociative symptoms when I was taking antidepressants and smoking weed at the same time. However I feel completely in touch with reality now.

She's on antidepressants and takes therapy some times.

How do I support her or help her out?"
Does anyone feel like there‚Äôs no point doing anything?,46,lwvtty,3,"That title looks depressing, I don‚Äôt mean it in that way. What I mean is, that personally for me, my dissociation causes me to have very foggy memories, usually not knowing when something happened, if it‚Äôs a new event or old event, whether it actually happened at all, or just causes me straight up amnesia. What I‚Äôm saying is, I feel like there‚Äôs no point in going and doing memorable things, because I‚Äôm not going to remember them. I guess it reminds me to just ‚Äúlive in the moment‚Äù a little bit, but sometimes I would like to look back on my life‚Äôs accomplishments.
Thankfully, my way of coping with this is taking pictures of everything, I mean everything, so that even if I can‚Äôt fully remember what happened. I still have the footage with me, it helps a lot."
Missing out on life,3,lwrsd2,4,"I‚Äôm dissociating and hallucinating. I was supposed to meet friends I haven‚Äôt seen in 8 years today. But I have been missing hours and seeing things and hearing people that aren‚Äôt here. 

I hate this so much. I can‚Äôt even tell my psychiatrist because if I do he will send a letter to my university saying I‚Äôm not fit to continue my education. 

I‚Äôm so tired. I can‚Äôt lose my education, I really can‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs so fucking embarrassing to tell my friends I couldn‚Äôt make it because I‚Äôm hallucinating and I‚Äôm occasionally not me. I miss them and I want to see them but I can‚Äôt risk hurting them

In a relationship and confused by dissociation.,12,lwqt1k,5,"My relationship with my girlfriend is great on paper, we're both kind to each other and make one another laugh, but frequently I don't really feel much towards her while other times I feel a lot. I'm having a hard time figuring out if that's dissociation or something relating to our relationship and how I really feel. Are there any ways to distinguish the two?"
Is this dissociation? Please help.,5,lwjfae,2,"I go through times where I feel nothing.  I‚Äôm just numb.  I don‚Äôt know how to get out of it, I‚Äôm not really sure how it comes about.  I hate it.  I‚Äôm ok one of those ‚Äúphases‚Äù now.  I think.  I look at my wonderful boyfriend who I love very much, but feel nothing.  I feel like he‚Äôs a stranger.  I don‚Äôt recognize him when I‚Äôm staring at him, but I know I love him and he‚Äôs my boyfriend. 

I‚Äôve had a pretty traumatic life, but also not as traumatic as other people have had it, so I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a reason this could be happening.  
I was almost kidnapped/raped about 6-7 times as a child.  I was locked in rooms and forced to watch porn and be touched inappropriately by people many years older than me, though I was never actually raped. 

Also, a home that felt unsafe.  A loving home, but everyone always fought each other and I would hide and cry in my closets as a kid.  I don‚Äôt know if this is helpful, but can anyone tell me what‚Äôs going on?  My family doesn‚Äôt believe in therapy, so I don‚Äôt know about going to a therapist.  I struggle with anxiety, maybe depression too? I don‚Äôt know about that part for sure.  Is it related to anxiety?  I feel hopeless."
"Is this dissociation, depersonalization, or something else? And how do I stop it?",2,lwanfg,4,"Tldr: I think keep dissociating but I don't know the cause or how to stop it when it's happening. Please give advice because it's messing up my school work

I don't know how to describe it, mainly because I can only remember doing it, not the actual experience. Usually I sort of zone out one minute, and I'm back to normal the next. Sometimes I can catch myself slipping or I can snap out of it. For example I had to take multiple breaks from writing this because it kept happening while I was trying to explain.

The confusing part is that whenever I read about it, the results always say that there's a reason, when for me my mind just randomly goes blank. (Or perhaps there's a reason which I can't remember?) 

I'm asking here because I want to figure out how to stop it from happening when I genuinely need to focus (eg: during a lesson) but I can't go see a psychiatrist or therapist about it. Is there a way I can ground myself? (Other than using the 5-4-3-2-1 method because it doesn't help much.)

"Does anyone else experience something like this ( Sudden Paralysis, no muscle tension but mentally functioning)",17,lw9zl8,21,"So I've been to several doctors and because of my history of dissociative disorders they all think what I'm going through is dissociation. However it doesn't really feel like it and I wanted to see if anyone has similar experiences or an opinion whether it's really dissociation or not.

For some years already I have sudden phases (between a few minutes and two hours) where I am unable to move. I lose my muscle tension, fall down and cannot move anything except for my eyes. My mind doesn't feel affected at all though. I recognise everything going on around me and can respond without delay (I communicate to my partner through eye movements - up/down is yes and left/right is no). My thoughts are clear and my emotions feel normal. I personally don't feel any signs of dissociation that I would usually have when dissociating. In general my level of dissociation is not very high anymore and for me it doesn't feel like it's strong enough to cause such heavy symptoms.

If anyone could say something about this I'd be so thankful. None of my doctors could really tell me what it is and I'm desperate because it heavily affects my day to day life. Thank you so much."

When I look in the mirror something doesn't feel right. I don't know how to explain it. When I talk I feel like my voice sounds really weird and not right. I see other people and I see them--like their soul in a way. When I see myself, I don't see a soul. I don't know what I see. It feels like the white noise static when a TV gets no reception.

I know I have negative emotions. Otherwise I wouldn't even worry or care about any of this. I have trouble connecting to other people and I feel shitty about that. I feel lonely a lot.

I‚Äôve had this random calm feeling happen to me a few times. But basically out of no where my ear started ringing (this doesn‚Äôt always happen).

I feel like my eyes are naturally kind of drooping and my body and mind is in a calm state. I was just pacing around my room really frustrated by the way my mom has treated me in the past and I was getting worked up about it.

my arms feel gone . This happens when I smoke weed (but I didn‚Äôt smoke weed)- I look down and am surprised by the fact that I have hands and arms and a body

At first my body just felt lighter

It‚Äôs kind of like if I feel something in my harm I have look over at where I feel it

And I feel like my body may somewhat be moving faster than I Realize. It‚Äôs like I think about moving my hands to itch my arm or something and than I realize I‚Äôm doing it but I feel like my body didn‚Äôt choose to like it normally does. Most of my movements rn feel like that."

sometimes I think that all the anxiety and panic I felt before it evolved into dissociation was just me begging to be comforted and my body fucking crying out for what it needed and I never got it so I just tapped out, like the fucking chemicals in my brain got weary and took the hint and gave up. It was better to just believe none of it was even real. 

and I just I don't know I'm 19 I feel too young to be this hurt in this way, I had to grow up too fast and sort out my shit all by myself and I pretend I'm fine but I'm not I'm so untethered I just want someone to say yeah me too"

"I tried to kill the presences in my head, now I can't feel them.",5,ltlsxy,7,"So basically for a week I thought I got diagnosed with DID. I thought it made perfect sense for the voices and dissociation. So I talked to them, held meetings with them, talked about fronting times, and generally had a great time.

Then I found out I misread my diagnosis and it actually said it was trying to rule out DID.

In a fit of rage, I tried to kill them all. The voices, I mean. The presences in my head. After all, they're not real people, what is the harm of it? Why should I entertain a delusion?

But now they're missing, and I am mentally torn about this. I feel so incomplete and hollow without them.

I miss them so much, and I want them back. But I don't know how to go about getting them back.

Do I get myself into as much of a dissociative state as I can? Do I listen to the kind of songs I thought would trigger them to come forward?

I don't know how to handle this. Usually I'd post this in the DID subreddit but I don't want to disappoint everyone or make it seem like I'm trying to copy a them or mock them or something.

I don't know what to do."

I went to the hospital to do blood tests. Had a bit low vitamin D and b12 not very low just a bit and im taking pills and drops plus omega 3 daily . I went to the ENT to take medication for my dizziness ive been taking betaserc and i think yes its a bit helping the dizziness and unbalance. I went to the neurologist and did an mri she told me no tumor nothing just empty sella and she told me its not very serious and has nothing to do with dizziness and all that. She wrote me PAXERA 10mg its an SSRI first 5 days 5mg then i take 10 mg at night. When i had dpd 2 years ago i was prescribed ‚Äúbrintlex and dogmatil‚Äù and i took them for i guess only 2 weeks and i couldnt they didnt help me at all. And i am trying to avoid any thing that would ruing my brain i am scared to take anything more that would me me dizzy again and feel more shitty. Has anyone taken this medication ‚Äúpaxera‚Äù and if it has helped or not ? I still didnt buy cuz i told the dr ill try not to take it.  She said you can try and wait if it didnt go away take it. 
I go out sometimes and try to enjoy everything but im always on edge and panicky and i feel very uncomfortable with everything. 

I have sometimes high blood pressure and i used to take blood pressure medication daily but 3 weeks ago i stopped it the cardiologist gave me ‚ÄúBELOC‚Äù and he said only take it for emergencies and when you blood pressure is high

For around two years I've had an almost constant feeling like I'm not really me and there's a separation between me and the real world (almost like I'm watching a film or am from an inner perspective). It ranges from mild to a 'drunk' feeling where I simply cannot think, speak cohesivly or manage in social situations. 

I went to the doctors a few months after it started and he suggested it may be depression; I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and low mood for a while now so he put me on a list for CBT and I was having bimonthly check ins for around a year.


I'm a fairly introverted person (I have a tight knit group of great friends but I don't really feel comfortable showing emotion around other people) but Ever since lockdown started I've just constantly been 'out of it' and have been getting extreme moodswings. One minute I may be completely ecstatic and I will just be overwhelmed by this urge to cry the next.

I have never been officially diagnosed with dissociation or a DD so I was just wondering how my experiences compared to your's. I feel like someone just watching a film or like I am behind my own eyes- just watching but not participating in what is happening.

Sorry for the long post but I have had quite a bit to drink and just needed to splurge- any replies will be appreciated."

After my sister died by suicide I had a really hard time managing. I ended up in the Psych Unit 33 times, had 8 attempts, was in every other kind of program. During all of that my Mom was told that I would never go to college, have a job, live on my own, drive a car, or contribute to society in any meaningful way. After getting a ton of help I now have not been in the hospital in almost 4 years and haven't had an attempt in 5. I do all of the things I was told I never would and I speak about my story with organizations through out the US and I'm hoping by doing this documentary I can share with even more people."
Does anyone play Dungeons and Dragons? Do you dissociate a lot during sessions?,6,lpfubu,2,"So I play D&D with a group from uni and I think I have been dissociating a lot during sessions and some of my mates have noticed the same problem with themselves. None of us have any idea why D&D seems to be a situation that's easy to dissociate in. It seems worse when doing it online without cameras so I can't see the other players (I struggle with auditory info anyway, and when I dissociate I can't really process what people are saying, sometimes even if I am concentrating really hard but idk if that's relevant). I think anxiety over playing is relevant but I don't think it's the main cause.

Anyone else experienced this kind of thing when playing a tabletop RPGs?

Anyone have any idea what might make D&D an easy situation to dissociate in?"
Ways to prevent dissociation?,1,lpcnuh,1,"Basically, I‚Äôve gotten really close to having an ongoing dissociative episode (idk what else to call it, and I‚Äôm really sorry if that name counts as self-diagnosis) multiple times this week and just the other day I suddenly didn‚Äôt recognize my mom. On top of that, I‚Äôve been having trouble with hallucinations, though I doubt this is the subreddit to find help for that. Bottom line is, I‚Äôm terrified y‚Äôall. Is there  anything I can do so I can rest easy knowing I won‚Äôt fall into that state?"
I'm finally feeling grounded again.,6,lpa2ld,0,"For the past few months (ever since school started, really), I've been feeling so detached from everything I do. It was like I wasn't even there to witness my own life. Everything was moving around me and I was frozen for so long. 

Today I finally started to feel normal again. I don't know how it happened; I was just listening to some music from last summer and suddenly something in my head just clicked: O*h, I'm here. This is real.* And it was magical. 

I can't explain it, but it doesn't feel like I'm all that distant anymore. 

It gets better, guys. I promise."
How do I stop dissociating in conversations?,7,lp8h2w,11,"Whenever my boyfriend and I and talking through something or trying to work things out, I can't help my mind wandering off. I can be looking him straight in the eyes, and want to pay attention so bad. But my mind just starts racing about the first point he brought up. Sorry if that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.. it's hard trying to describe it. But it makes him feel like I don't respect him or what he says, but I do. He's the most important person in my life."

New here and I‚Äôm grieving,12,lp0pa2,7,"I‚Äôve had disso. All my life. I just started taking Ambilfy for disso (1 month) and 3 days ago all my voices stopped. 

I called them my peanut gallery. Some were mean and nasty but other‚Äôs were my best friends. I‚Äôm going through a break up and I need the advice, love and inspiration I got from the good ones. That advice you can only get from someone who has been watching every move and knowing every thought you‚Äôve ever had. 

It‚Äôs nice to not hear the nasty ones but I‚Äôm so lonely. I know they were all me. I know I have it in me somewhere but it was so good to hear ‚Äúanother‚Äù voice. It‚Äôs just so quiet and boring now. 

I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around it all. 

Anyone in recovery and wanna give me some advice?"
i‚Äôve been disassociated for the past month,3,lopk0z,3,"i used to get disassociated after experiencing lots of anxiety or anxiety attacks but it would fade within thirty minutes. i got disassociated after smoking but only during intoxication, about a month ago i became extremely disassociated  and ever since then i‚Äôve been waking up derealized and going to bed derealized. i‚Äôve reached out to therapy but they‚Äôre very booked up rn and i can‚Äôt talk to one nearly as often as i need to. i feel terribly numb and helpless none of my surroundings feel real. i cant see my friends anymore because i‚Äôm just so derealized i have to put in so much effort to even keep up a conversation and i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. part of me wants to admit myself into a hospital so i wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with this alone but am i just thinking irrationally? do i keep with meeting w a therapist once every ten days, i‚Äôm tired of feeling so helpless if anyone has had a smiler experience i would love to hear how you got through it.

How do I stop feeling like a thought process of the brain and start feeling like a human again?,14,loja6c,4,"Quarantine has destroyed me mentally and I'm an anxious, depressed, and paranoid individual. Over the last several months I've been feeling more and more disconnected to the point where I feel like just a thing in my brain. A metaphor: My brain and all its processes and thoughts are a ship, and I am just the wind observing and guiding the ship in directions across an infinite ocean. The ocean is reality. I feel like I'm an observer pushing my mental processes in directions instead of being a human. I feel like I'm observing this crazily complex replicating biological machine controlled by a brain. 

I also don't recognize myself in the mirror or who I am. I really feel like an amalgamation of a constant stream of thoughts trimmed up for what's important. I feel like a creation my brain created. My arms feel like tentacle-like appendages protruding from me to grab at things and shove them into my mouth be chewed up. I feel like an animal in a world where lifeforms consume other lifeforms. Everything replicates just to die or be destroyed either by itself or by another replication machine in this ruthless and hopelessly anarchic reality. 

I listen to music and feel like I'm not hearing music, I feel like I'm perceiving stimulus in my brain that my brain makes sense of and gathers it all up and creates the stream of consciousness. Me.

In short, I don't connect with myself. I am just a bundle of thoughts and processes my brain deems most important to my survival.

 How do I start feeling like a human and not a crazy weird pattern recognition machine controlling a body with the sole purpose of surviving?"
Does anyone have the problem where when they‚Äôre dissociating everything they say is backwards or jumbled together?,7,loj06d,21,"Some times when i‚Äôm dissociating I will say things opposite of what they are for instance I‚Äôll be doing something and if someone asks what i‚Äôm doing somehow the word not gets said before I say what i‚Äôm doing,also if I didn‚Äôt or am not going to do something I sometimes say I am,i‚Äôm not sure if that makes any sense at all but also at times when i‚Äôm speaking in sentences the first part of each word gets mixed with another word in the sentence or phrase and make words that don‚Äôt exist for instance instead of ‚Äúgood by‚Äù,I say ‚Äúbood guy‚Äù,or if i‚Äôm trying to say ‚Äúyea I just did that‚Äù I say ‚Äúyea I dust jid that‚Äù.i‚Äôm not sure if this is part of dissociating or if I have problems other than just dissociating,it seems to only happen when i‚Äôm really stressed out and thinking about a lot and dissociate at the same time.any input on this would be appreciated."

How to stop dissociating in sexual situations?,6,logu43,8,"Mostly when I dissociate, it‚Äôs because a very important moment is happening and I cope with that by losing touch with reality and just letting myself dissociate. 
And I haven‚Äôt recognized I‚Äôve started dissociating since around six months ago, but I think my first instance might‚Äôve been a few years ago. Basically me and my ex-boyfriend were hanging out and I was really desperate to let him get back together with me, so I kind of let them touch me in any way I wanted, even though at that point I wasn‚Äôt really sexually attracted to him anymore, but I was really young and I thought I needed him to stay in my life. Even though I didn‚Äôt really want him to touch me sexually, I still let him, and I think to cope with that I dissociated and I can‚Äôt remember it very well and it pains me to remember.
That happened in sophomore year of high school and I‚Äôm a freshman in college now. Ever since then, I haven‚Äôt done anything romantic or sexual (maybe a couple relationships but we never got to the point of being very physical) and this weekend I‚Äôm supposed to go ‚Äúhorror movie and chill‚Äù with a guy at my college. 
He‚Äôs very attractive and I‚Äôm pretty excited, but I‚Äôm also very desensitized and don‚Äôt really care about many things anymore, especially sex. So I‚Äôm worried that I will become bored or I won‚Äôt like it as much as I thought I would and I will dissociate to cope with the disappointment or maybe just ambivalence. I‚Äôm trying to keep my standards low to help myself and I‚Äôm also trying to let myself leave if I‚Äôm not feeling it, but even if everything does go well, I just cannot see a scenario where I do not dissociate while having sex.
My question is, how can I stop dissociating while having sex? Are there any techniques y‚Äôall do? When I normally dissociate, I just look at my birthmarks or I feel something, but that‚Äôs just to convince myself that I‚Äôm real. I don‚Äôt think that would help that much, so I would love some tips! I‚Äôm very scared, but I can‚Äôt think of any time when I would be more ready than I am right now."
Psych ward??,2,lodtqg,6,"okay so I been diagnosed with major depression, social anxiety disorder, anxiety anxiety. Pretty sure I have bipolar disorder but I don‚Äôt self diagnose and it‚Äôs quite hard for me to talk to my psychiatrist. I can only really express my feelings through writing to random strangers. I don‚Äôt really trust anyone. I have felt dissociation for about a year and a half now , maybe two. It is scary but I try to stay so strong but it‚Äôs hard living like this. 
It feels like there‚Äôs a brick wall between me and my brain?? If that makes sense. 
I‚Äôm scared to go to a psych ward but I know I need to fix myself. 
It‚Äôs scary though. The world doesn‚Äôt stop because I‚Äôm severely depressed and suicidal. 
am I gonna be homeless when I get out? what is my job gonna say? 
I never in a million years ever seen me being so suicidal. 
It‚Äôs me vs me everyday, not me against the world. 
Me vs my thoughts. 
I‚Äôm 21 and I look the happiest but I am dying inside hoping someone notices. 
I‚Äôm a so pretty and the only thing that looks depressing about me is my eyes, I‚Äôm hoping someone outside notices I‚Äôm screaming for help in my head.

"I have been experiencing, for months now, what I feel is dissociation, but I don‚Äôt know and I can‚Äôt see a therapist anytime soon.",7,lod932,1,"I (19f) serve in the army. I have had many mental health issues and when I was younger I was very deep in depression for a couple years. Suicide ideation, not feeling anything, that sort of thing. 

The problem is usually army therapists are for short term issues that need taking care of. Not really long term psychological ‚Äútreatments‚Äù, to put it one way. And I don‚Äôt have the time, nor means, nor money to find a therapist outside of the army, so I‚Äôm left wondering.

Every time I go home after the army I look forward to it so much. The first day is usually fine, but the rest of the time I find myself ‚Äúdissociating‚Äù like hell. For me, it feels like nothing is real. Like I‚Äôm completely disconnected from my body and the outside world and I‚Äôm kinda stuck in my mind. At the moment everything feels fuzzy and it only stops when I go back to the army, to my base. Nothing I‚Äôve tried helps. Sometimes when I‚Äôm out of the house it lessens but as long as I‚Äôm in and around my house I am dissociating. Only thing that seems to help is getting drunk which is a really unhealthy way to cope, so I try not to, but on days I get really desperate to feel something, I drink. 

I think maybe I dissociate only at my house because of past trauma. My parents can be pretty manipulative and I have nightmares about it pretty often. But I don‚Äôt know for sure. 

Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? Or am I just going crazy lmao."
What are triggers for disassociation?,3,lo91eb,5,"I don‚Äôt wanna self diagnose myself but I‚Äôve experienced similar to things that have been described in this sub and it‚Äôs been happening to me for months and usually takes months to occur again, it was like something that I believe to be dissociation, it felt like I was watching my body operate and then I‚Äôd realize that I didn‚Äôt do it myself.

Does anyone not believe they dissociate unless theyre actively dissociating?,5,lo43fq,2,"When im not dissociating, a part of me doesnt believe that i ever dissociated. I know I do, but i dont always believe it. 

I know that i dissociate based on confirmations from 2 different mental health professionals and when i dissociate i actively make a note of it. When im at home, its an out-loud verbal note ""oh look, dissociation..."" and when im not at home, i tend to make a written note in my phones notepad if the episode is worth noting. It's nothing more than a casual observation, im not actively holding my breath for it.

The only reason that i know for a solid fact that i dissociated is because of the notes that i made, and the confirmation from my therapists

Any advice for dissociative fugue?,13,lndfae,13,"
f, 19
Ive heard that dissociative fugue is when a person suddenly forgets his past life and associations due to a traumatic event or stress and have the urge to wandere usually far from home for a couple of months or years. (Also: If the person already started a new life it can happens that he suddenly remembers his past life again and forgets the years he lived his ‚Äönew/fake life‚Äò.)
This is exactly how I feel like right now... for months already.
Does anyone know if hypnosis can bring your old associations back? Or do they just come automatically?

Im just trying to find a way to bring my old associations back. 
In my case it was mostly due to lots of stress from university."
Does anyone do this too?,16,ln2u3r,8,"It feels like I play these cognitive games with myself. I think when I started feeling emotionally overwhelmed I thought I could fix my problems in my own head since I had no one to talk to about it. I thought I could trick myself into forgetting things, pretending like things didn't affect me, denying things, tricking myself into being a certain way, etc.

I'm 26 now and I'm still dissociated. I don't know how to stop being dissociated. I feel like I do it to myself somehow but I don't understand how. I have been this way for so long I don't know how to stop. It always feels like I'm somehow controlling myself or something. Like a part of me is controlling myself and I can't describe it. I don't trust myself on some level it really is confusing and scary.

All I know is I don't want to be dissociated anymore. I want to feel like the old me again. I try meditating and all these somatic/being in the moment exercises but nothing works. As I'm doing it I'm constantly thinking that ""If I do this, I'll be cured"" but then another part of me thinks ""Stop thinking that because you're stopping it from happening"" I sound crazy.

Even when I talk to my therapist I feel like I'm only telling them things because that ""will cure me"" not because I actually want to. It makes no sense to me. I think I basically constructed this complex/thing in my head when I was younger and overwhelmed and now I feel like I can't break out of it. I don't know how.

I research about dissociation/trauma all the time. I keep reading about acceptance and all this bullshit. Like if I accepted that I was dissociated and miserable I wouldn't even be searching for this shit. Then it's like do I accept that I can't accept? Do I accept that I can't accept that I can't accept? And so on. It gets so meta and confusing. Life makes no sense anymore and I don't know how to go back to the old me where it was simple and I didn't have these crazy thoughts. I feel trapped by these existential/confusing thought loops. I just want to break free from the dissociation. I want to be me again. Can anyone relate or help?"
Lil help here?,5,lmx5uu,0,
Am I going through a long period of dissociation or is it just depression,4,lms4f0,5,"Wow ok hi so I just spent about an hour and a half typing a background story and context for the situation I‚Äôm currently dealing with in which I poured my heart out and expressed all of my pent up thoughts from the past 3 years of my life and I accidentally reloaded the page and deleted it all. Honestly at this point there‚Äôs nothing I can do but I don‚Äôt have the energy to type a whole paragraph up again so I‚Äôm just going to give a short summary. So I‚Äôm a freshman in high school (F,15) and I‚Äôve been struggling with several various mental illnesses for a few years now including depression, anxiety, and ADD. I also have a pretty terrible relationship with my parents and I really want to get out of my house but that‚Äôs a story for another time. So I‚Äôve been dealing with stress and depression from covid, my virtual classes for school, and my parents. Honestly I thought things were getting a bit better but on Friday I had a random anxiety attack and a small identity crisis. I went to bed expecting to be better in the morning but I wasn‚Äôt, and five days later I‚Äôm still in this situation. My symptoms include: -Loss of interest for all of my hobbies -Loss of goals and aspirations -Loss of emotion -Mild short term memory loss (nothing severe) -Loss of feelings of certain places and memories

I feel basic emotions, like I laugh when my friend tells me a joke, but not on a deeper level which is alarming because I always try to stay in tune with my deeper emotions but I just stopped having them since Friday. I‚Äôve lost all interest in all of my hobbies including drawing which is particularly alarming considering drawing has been something I‚Äôve enjoyed for years and has helped me get through a lot. I talked to a psychologist I‚Äôve been seeing (who I don‚Äôt particularly like but my mom wants me to keep working with her anyway because my doctor recommended her) and she said that‚Äôs it‚Äôs just depression and I should try to get outside more and journal. She thinks it could also be diet related because I went vegan a month ago. My mom also said it‚Äôs just depression and she doesn‚Äôt want me to see a psychiatrist even though I really want to because I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I‚Äôve done research and to me it seems like it could be a long episode of dissociation but I‚Äôm not sure. I bought this up to both of them but they both dismissed that as being too intense a diagnosis for what I‚Äôm going through. My two best friends have been helping me as much as possible and I appreciate them so much for being there for me but they can only do so much to help. At some point I need professional help. I‚Äôve never posted on reddit before but at this point no adult that is supposed to be helping me will listen to my concerns and I guess this is my last attempt at getting help, or at least some direction as to what I‚Äôm going through. I really don‚Äôt know what to do at this point and I want to go back to how I was before this. If any of you have any idea of what could be going on with me I would really appreciate your input, and to anyone who takes the time out of their day to read this and maybe give me some advice, thank you, you have no idea how much it helps."
"Problem : When I see my psy, I feel okay so I have nothing to say",8,lmqura,3,"Hello !

I have a problem that always followed me since I'm a child... I have a hard time talking about how I feel down/bad/depress when I see my psy.
Because, when I see them I don't feel sad, I feel good or okay. 

And when she say "" hello, how are you since the last time we talked?"" I'm always going to say ""I'm good!"" :') 
Because That's how I feel on the moment... I just can't connect with this past me who felt sad and talk in her name, you know :/ 
And it never happen that I'm in a crisis when I see my psy ... So they know there is a problem, because I'm 24h/24 in DPDR, but they never see how or why I'm not feeling well and I can't explain correctly ._.

Do you have some advice for me?

What is the difference between Dissociation and Absence seizure?,2,lmkyzk,2,"
Can someone here describe the difference between the two. 

I think I have experienced both in different occasions in the past.

I would like to add that I suspect having ADHD. I  daydream all the time. there are times when people talk to me but I don‚Äôt hear a word they say. 

I would also like to point out something weird I experience sometimes. it feels like I‚Äôm being hypnotized, as if someone possessed my mind but I can‚Äôt move I just freeze and my eyes gets fixed on one object and if someone talks to me I repeat the word they say very slowly but I don‚Äôt answer them. It‚Äôs like when someone gets hypnotized in TV shows. it only lasts a few seconds though.

I‚Äôm very confused about my symptoms.
I was never diagnosed with ADHD by a professional. But I think I have it.
High chance I have PTSD/ or CPTSD too. past two years were hell to me. flashbacks, agoraphobia, severe depression ... etc"
Is dissociation a result of trauma? ...most of the time?,2,lmdq8y,0,"Hi all,

I've done some light research on dissociation since I started having episodes about 4 years ago. Most of the stuff I read directly associates dissociation with trauma. What are all your thoughts on this? Do some of you have dissociative episodes with no (known) history of trauma? Pardon my ignorance- I've never talked to someone who regularly experiences these episodes so I'm hoping to learn more. 

FYI- when my episodes started, I was in a depression and in a toxic relationship-maybe that was some form of trauma? (also unsure what qualifies as trauma...)

Look forward to responses. 

Thanks"
Sounds about right,182,lmcnpy,2,
I'm not sure what or how I got this. But Im genuinely starting to believe the friends I made online aren't real.,5,lm8yva,4,"Apologies if this isn't the correct subreddit. This is just a vent. 

I've only really talked to people online, I never had much interaction in person friend wise. At most it's just been over discord or the phone, or even texting often. Over the past few weeks I've just been having what I think is some sortve panic, and isolating myself from chatting online because I don't believe that anyone I'm chatting to is real at this point. It feels like I'm just using one of those ai bots to talk to someone, or at most someone out of pity being forced to talk to me, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I don't feel in my own body anymore, I don't feel like I can snap back in. I have no emotion or thought towards typing this right now and I don't know why anymore. Just the constant idea of being in a false reality is stuck in my head all day. I want to stop talking to them but I don't know why I can't. It just feels like this endless cycle of talking, then stopping, then going back, repeating multiple times."
this is a new one ‚Äì dissociating because of art,16,lm6s67,2,"I just watched some online interactive theatre stuff. And I enjoyed it, but the comedian was playing with reality a little bit. Well, a lot.

And ooohhh man. I'm fine, I'm okay, I've gotten better at knowing how to handle feeling spaced out, anxious and disoriented. I trust that I'll be fine eventually, if not today or tomorrow, in a week at least. But it's a lot. And it's impressive. I don't remember art ever triggering my dissociation this bad ‚Äì Get Out and Midsommar weren't great for my brain, but this is something else.

I'm going to hope and assume no one knows what I'm referring to, because it was so brilliantly done and I wouldn't want to spoil it. But basically, I was made to feel I was also watching other people watch this comedian. We were in a kind of big zoom thing together. Zoom/skype/facetime stuff already cause me to dissociate more, so I try to avoid it. But I love this comedian and the pandemic is boring. So I was prepared for *some* dissociation. I watched other people, and how they laughed, sometimes didn't at all, or walked away, made tea, hugged their dog. For about two hours. It was fascinating and made me feel less alone, which was much needed. I was even made to feel I had talked to someone, one on one.

In the end, it turned out, all of those people had prerecorded their stuff. No one could see me, I could see no one. The idea was to show the audience how isolated and lonely we are, during covid.

Great, cool, very creative, genuinely pretty brillianty done. But when I closed my lapotp, nothing felt real and now my derealization is so, so bad. There's also just the fact that I really didn't need to be reminded of how incredibly lonely I am. Being isolated triggers my dissociation as well. Besides that, it's just very depressing. These feelings aren't enjoyable or fascinating for me. It just sucks and it scares me.

And I feel a bit weird about someone making such depressing art in such a difficult time. Especially when you're a comedian, oof.

I laughed and applauded when it ended but am close to tears now. It makes me feel like there should be a warning, but maybe that's completely ridiculous. You might as well give a sunset or anywhere loud or bright a warning. This is just not what I needed, am I'm going to try to find something hopeful and grounding to read or watch now.

Just needed to vent about it to people who get it."

Texting vs Speaking?,9,llo9vm,2,"Does anyone else find it easier to text while they're dissociating instead of actually talking out loud?

Did anyone start disassociating after being given a drug?,1,llnlod,4,"*dissociating

Back in mid-September, I was given Fentanyl and Midazolam by my gastroenterologist as sedation and pain management for an upper endoscopy. About two months later, I had my first major dissociative episode. I was wondering if anyone thinks they could be connected, because Fentanyl is similar to Heroin, which has effects on brain chemistry for about 30 years after using it. From what I remember, being in the haze of Fentanyl kind of reminded me of dissociation in a way."
Dissociative episode tonight,1,lljogb,0,"Cw/tw: intense dissociation, emotional unavailability, family emotional neglect

Had a relatively good day mental health wise. Husband starts playing with 5 year old we co-parent on the bed, all fun and games. However, the moment they started, I immediately starting seriously dissociating. Still am right now (not as strong but definetly still there).

I think what triggered it was just the fact that I'm adopted (abandoned 2 days after I was born, not adopted until about 9 months old) and the family I was adopted into was just genuinely emotionally.... Not there. The 2 were having fun rolling around and playing on the bed and I just was there, somewhat reclined, looking like I was zoning out but dissociating hard. Why was this such a trigger for me üò≠"
"feeling absolutely nothing for weeks or maybe even months, anyone?",28,llanzo,22,"My best friend recently went through a bad breakup, they had attempted suicide, and they now feel basically nothing. 

They don't feel sad, they don't feel happy, they don't feel joy, and they don't feel love. They no longer love me (or anyone) and it's kinda devastating. 

I asked around in r/BPD and I was told it could be a form of dissociation. 

Does anyone know more about this? what is it called, and how do you support someone who's currently going through it. How long does it last, and how can you help someone going through it to start feeling better? How do you avoid annoying them? Resources would be very appreciated too."
Help?,1,ll7gcx,5,"I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here can help, or if anyone will even see this. My boyfriend (16), told me last night that he hasn‚Äôt felt real for two weeks.

We‚Äôve dealt with minor episodes like this, but not completely. I understand it‚Äôs a trauma response, but me, and even my mom have little to no experience or information on what‚Äôs going on. He cant seem to feel real again and I don‚Äôt know how to help. Do any of you have any tips on this? Anything?

I had a huge insight this week,14,ll0p7w,1,"So first off, I‚Äôve never made a post on reddit before (!!!) so I hope I do this right? 
But it‚Äôs about 3 am where I live right now and I‚Äôm coming off of about 6 ish months of a combination of mania, depression and dissociation. Like really hard dissociation, sometimes my vision even gets really blurry. I‚Äôve been in therapy for over ten years, working through some really hard grief, emotional neglect, chronic depression and (although I didn‚Äôt know till I spent 6 weeks living alone during quarantine) dissociation issues. I finally found some tools to help get out of that, earlier this summer, before I went home to where pretty much all of my trauma happened. (I moved like 3000 miles away from my hometown, but visit sometimes cause my nieces are SO CUTE). I finally had enough mental energy, reconnection with my support network and time to take those recovery/grounding steps this week and I just woke up to a flood of some really, really amazing positive memories I forgot about (classic memory loss, smh). 
Im really grateful for all the posts on this sub cause they give me hope and insight and laughs and good vibes even when it‚Äôs hard. I know I‚Äôll probably dissociate in the future, cause I can‚Äôt control what triggers me but I also know I‚Äôm glad I can go to places like this, to my fave music, to some key people in my life (finally) to find the way out.
Keep going, I‚Äôm thinking good things for you, there are ways to get through it and get out."
Im confused,3,lkx39j,2,Made a throw away. Ive had an extremely stressful week at work and i feel so overwhelmed. I have a history with depression btw. So i woke up this morning and i felt like i was looking at a random person in my mirror. Forward to about an hour ago i was on the brink of a panic attack and it feels like my body just shut off. I feel like I‚Äôm in a dream state and that nothing is real. I feel like I‚Äôm floating and that the things i did today happened years ago. I feel like im dead. Im just so confused as to whats happening if anyone knows what is happening please let me know. Thanks
Dissociation and Adderall,15,lkstnz,5,"I dissociate in all degrees, from a day totally blank in the face and unable to remember anything moment to moment, to impulsive dissociation where I become erratic, dangerous, a flight risk.
Recently I began taking Adderall. I had never even considered taking it, but after a traumatic, emotional break I had been unable to focus. Unable to stay in my own body.
I am in between doctor appointments and waiting for a refill and I have been in a constant state of dissociation. I realize now as I look back on my days with Adderall (low dose) I was present. Calm and present.
I don‚Äôt want to have to depend on a drug like Adderall, but it has changed my life. I haven‚Äôt felt alive in over three years now.
Should I be worried? Am I getting myself into trouble using this drug to keep present? Can any of you relate?"
"have been in a dissociative state for days, just don‚Äôt want to feel alone..",7,lkq2o9,3,"hi there everyone :) 
I am 23F, and about five days ago I took an antibiotic for a small infection that I probably didn‚Äôt even need, and since then, as my title suggests, I have been in a dissociative state. I assume, that it either may have interacted with my bipolar medication (lithium), or the more likely scenario, taking it was a trigger for me due to a very very bad experience I had at the end of 2019. either way, I‚Äôve not had a dissociative episode this long before and it‚Äôs quite scary. it‚Äôs not so bad that it‚Äôs debilitating and I can‚Äôt go about my life, but it‚Äôs so taxing and I‚Äôm always quite aware of it. I am doing all the usual grounding exercises and making sure I am taking extra steps to take care of myself and asking for help when I need it etc, etc. but I‚Äôm sure you can all relate, it is still quite scary. I can‚Äôt help but have thoughts like ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm actually going crazy, what if something else is wrong with me and I‚Äôm not just bipolar, what if it isn‚Äôt even dissociation and I have lithium toxicity or something else terrible happening with my body‚Äù etc. sometimes the worst part about dissociation is that of course you feel so disconnected from everything, and by extension it leaves you feeling so alone, like you are the only one this has ever happened to or is happening to. so, I just wanted to come on here and vent, my support network tries their hardest to understand but it‚Äôs one of those things you simply can‚Äôt wrap your head around unless you‚Äôve experienced it and sometimes it makes me feel even more ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù trying to explain it to them. if you have any advice or kind words for me of course I would love to hear them, or perhaps you are going through or have been through a similar situation, I would also love to hear your story, otherwise, I am just here to vent.

Does media (films/shows/books/etc) trigger feelings of dissociation for you all?,3,lkm3nh,0,"I used to think it didn't. But after (unintentionally) watching several things about living in a simulation I've been left in this eerie detached state of mind for the past few days. But this type of 'media-triggered' sensation feels different from what normal 'dissociation' feels like, in a way I can't quite describe. Part of the difference is that it's not as bad of an experience I guess because there's this clear external cause of it, it makes me not as bothered.

Anyone else get this way or feel varying 'types' of dissociation depending on whether it is set off by something external (whether media or any drug or anything like that or life events) versus when it just happens spontaneously/ caused by something internal?"
Dissociated During Job Interview,10,lkh5xp,1,"Five days ago and one of the worse job interviews I've experienced. Two things occurred that triggered me and I dissociated. 1) The interviewer had told me on the phone she was going to interview me along with the owner. When I was called back into the back office the woman proceeds to introduce the owner to me and then tells me he's her father. So a family owned business and I wasn't prepared. There's a whole dynamic there I wish I had been aware of before the interview. 2) The owner proceeds to tell me his employees are treated like ""family"" and the office is their ""home."" These words ""family,"" and ""home"" are huge negative triggers to me. I then found myself detaching from the present and became lost in a fog. I didn't get the job and feel it may have been for the best in the long run. 

This is yet another learned experience I'll chalk up to help prepare me for future interviews. I felt like it was a set-up, the whole family business situation and having it withheld from me until we were face to face. I wish this would get easier."
"Oh brother, today was rough.",3,lk8jb3,0,"Alright, so, where to begin?

So today I was working. Yeah, I worked on Valentine's day, in a cafe, where Sundays are usually our busiest days. So already I was really feeling the heat.

Basically, while I was at work I was dissociating. My body was so sluggish and when I walked I would develop a limp for a few seconds. The room seemed like it was spinning for a minute, and I raised my hands in the air to try and, well, ""put me back in my body"", or whatever.

And then it got worse when I was at Sunday School today. My Dad was teaching, but when he realized that he wasn't getting the attention he wanted, asked what was the point of it all and went through each of my siblings for answers. It caused me to dissociate more, and I eventually went into the bathroom. I huddled into a ball and I was shaking. It was super difficult to get up.

The lesson began to be heated and an argument was ensuing, so I decided to pack it up and go to my room to avoid getting a worse case of dissociation. But then I heard the fighting going on downstairs, and so I decided to hide in my closet until it was over, while listening to music to drown the screaming out. One of my particular favorites is this Triage at Dawn cover:  [Half-Life 2 - Triage at Dawn Guitar Cover ft. Barry King - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb3XkWJeI0Q). I had a voice act up that helped me calm down and just walked through the process of breathing and finding some headspace.

It calmed down, but I basically stayed in my closet for about an hour. I also skipped lunch today and I was going to eat a PB&J to satisfy me until I could eat something, but then Sunday school happened and then the fighting, so I just had some Snickers. Not the healthiest choice, but whatever, I did manage to have something resembling a meal later.

It seems to be on Sundays when I get dissociated, and voices acting up. I don't know if it's the stress of it being the busiest day of the week or if it's because of religion, but...well, I don't really know what my triggers are, and I feel like there could be a lot of things.

Thank you for reading this far."

I think I‚Äôve been completely dissociating for this whole day?,16,lk0ulq,3,"I don‚Äôt dissociate normally and I‚Äôve never been this bad before. I can still talk (sorta) and do things but I feel really disconnected from my body and surroundings. I haven‚Äôt been able to do my work today (school coursework) because it‚Äôs been so severe, just like sitting on the floor and being trapped in my own head staring at nothing

There hasn‚Äôt even been anything to cause any of this and I‚Äôve tried to sleep it off but it just stays, it feels like I don‚Äôt even exist and my body isn‚Äôt real, I don‚Äôt even know if I can still bleed?? My co-ordination isn‚Äôt terrible but everything is taking me a lot longer and I know that I can‚Äôt do certain (intricate) things like sewing or writing at the moment.

Just looking for any advice from people who know more about it?? I don‚Äôt drink nor use drugs (apart from my prescribed medication which has never had this effect on me in the years I‚Äôve been using it) so I‚Äôm just a little weirded out, I just want to be back on the ground y‚Äôknow"
Smoking till I loose my mind I think,2,ljyi6k,1,"Right now, all I can do is wait, and work internally on my constent DPDR

I have to wait to get my unemployment money, althought I should not even get it as I'm not even looking for a job as I just can't work at all since I got into hospital because I wanted to die, so in bonus it stress because I know I might get caught one day... But I need to pay the roof over my head, I need to eat and protect myself from the cold... And there is no other money help I could get as I need a psychological evaluation to have a medical money help *flip a table* *zen*

Then I have to wait that my debt are all paid

And then, maybe, I will get to see a psychologist good for me and then maybe I will get better, will be able to work, endure the stress and not live in the fear to live in the street.

And my problem seem to get worse...
I have strange dreams. They aren't nightmare, they don't scare me nor wake me up... They just leave a strange feeling during the day. Like a disturbing feeling. Like a bad taste. Like something strange. They started 2 months ago, and now I even sweat in my sleep. I'm not even hot. Usually I would wake up because I feel hot. But now I wake up because my body is all wet and it's inconfortable and I get very cold.
They don't understand arround me... They say it's nightmare, just try to not think about them and they will go away. The more you stress about it, the more it will be a problem.
Yes a concede. But they should try to not mind a very sour or shitty taste in their mouth.

Plus, I have problem to eat now, since December. My psychiatrist told me it didnt seem to be problematic as I didnt loose a lot of weight in a small time... Fine I concede. But when I told her that I had problem to eat I was only able to eat pancake ! Anything else would make my body react, I would feel sick and want to throw up just looking or smelling them ! Mind you, I looooove food ! Really. And I dont have problem with my weight either far from I know... But it's like if out of no where some food started to become poop. But it may change day to day ! One day an apple is a poop, but the other it's an apple.
So it was only pancake for me as my taste for them didnt seem to change. But then what happen when you always, always eat the same thing ? You may start to feel sick about it. Yep.
So no more pancake for me ! 
I'm starving
I'm hungry 
It hurt
But I do eat, here and there, what is able to come inside.
Exemple: day 1. 1/2 eggs sandwich, 3 chicken wings and some fries.
Day  2. pudding, pudding, some blueberry, small portion of lasagna
Etc.
But I often feel sick, eating became problematic
And I still feel Hungry, even if I just ate something.

And ofcourse, since 2 years now (I think) üéâüéâüéâ
I have DPDR, well not fully diagnosed, my psychiatrist say  I do have DPDR symptoms...

So mh... Yeah. I'm tired. 
I don't want to die nor hurt myself, don't worry I'm not looking to do that...

But I will be smoking till all my mind is gone, for what is still there"
I could *really* use advice,7,lji1gf,3,"Long story short, I am seeking a diagnosis but I am positive that I am on the autism spectrum. This realization came out of nowhere for me two days ago after extensive research. It was a bit of a ‚Äúlightbulb moment‚Äù in my life. I thought I was fine with it, I spent all day yesterday with a friend. But this morning I woke up and, I‚Äôll do my best to describe this, but it felt like waking up in somebody else‚Äôs body. I spent the entire day in a state of laying motionless as if I‚Äôm asleep but just laying there with no thoughts. It felt as if everything around me was a dream and I was absolutely *not* myself at all. I would have moments where I would get up briefly to do something small and it just feels like my entire head is full of fog and everything is hazy. Everything just feels extremely wrong and I haven‚Äôt been able to pull myself out of it. I feel slightly okay now but the fog is still there and I don‚Äôt entirely feel like myself. Nothing like this has EVER happened to me before in my life. It feels like the moment I realized the autism spectrum thing (I promise there‚Äôs no way I don‚Äôt have it, just not diagnosed yet) I haven‚Äôt been myself since that moment. It‚Äôs just been a never ending hazy, dreamy, trance-like existence. If this makes any sense at all, I would love some advice or thoughts because I am honestly freaking out- as much as I can be at the moment."
"Helpppppp, confused, traumatized, need support",2,ljdndj,3,"Brain stops functioning after a paragraph or two of text

So...I was in a dissociative fugue for 12 years, completely convinced I was a baby and that my words didn‚Äôt come from me but other sources and you can see how that would regress me and pull back my development by A LOT. Anyway, since I‚Äôve come out of it....I was always a writer and able to write, but it took slow spurts to get my thoughts and my words flowing more and more and more but when I wasn‚Äôt writing, I lost that and I also lost my train of thought. It has been a struggle to write even more than a few paragraphs without losing my train of thought or not wanting to write any further. I have considered getting some brain tests to see if there may be some long-term damage and extra issues going on here. Has anyone dealt with something similar? Thanks, because it‚Äôs really frustrating to get my words or thoughts out when I feel like my brain begins deflating when it‚Äôs running on what I call ‚Äúcortisol‚Äù fumes for so long."
Parenting feelings,1,ljaeov,1,"Tw/cw: parent-child bonding, parenthood, co-parenting, feeling numb

When it came to parenthood I always thought id be really physically affectionate and what not but I started co parenting a 5 year old and when they wanna cuddle up I'll let them.... But emotionally and psychologically I feel dead/numb/void. It's taken me kind of aback because mentally I thought if I were ever to be a mom, I'd be 100% into it.

I dunno if this is a side effect of my chronic dissociation or some other thing going on mentally with me. Physically, I don't really want biological children because I have a bad medical history and I wouldn't want to pass it onto biological children.

Gave any other moms felt like this? How do you work through it? It feels like psychologically something is broken and I should be feeling tender feelings... But I just don't. I've been co-parenting this child for almost a year now so it's not like it's brand new. 

I feel like theres a syndrome name for this phenomena but I can't remember it (not post partuem depression) where the mom never develops what we'd consider a ""typical"" bond with a child. 

I'm really scared to bring this up with my husband (who also co parents the child), partially because I see him giggle/laugh/bond with the child and I'm like... I want that, but I literally feel dead/numb/void inside even when I fully try that."
Is there a correlation between dissociation and headaches?,15,lj82ar,6,"I haven‚Äôt hit my head on anything but I‚Äôve been dissociating since yesterday (I think anyway.

Before I first dissociated yesterday I started having a headache and have been having headaches and dissociation on and off since, also pain at the top of the back of my neck.

How to deal with the strong urge to flee/escape/start a new life?,9,limgq0,2,"19, f

About 3 months ago I started to feel extremely weak and helpless like a baby/child due to strong dissociative states (derealisation, depersonalisation, freeze, disconnected from body and emotions) caused by lots of stress (moving to another city, university). Since then this ‚Äöchild‚Äò part of me is telling me every day to just start a new life in another country. But this would also include to forget about my whole identity, dreams, past life and leave all of my friends and family behind. Rationally I do know that its morally not good to do that but still I want to....

Did anyone had a similar problem before? Any advice? I wish I wouldn‚Äôt want to start a completely new life."
Is this dissociation?,11,lim7tf,4,"So i‚Äôve been having these weird feelings since sept 2020 up until now, and it‚Äôs me becoming really aware of everything and my surroundings, it makes me zoom out of my body and observe the earth floating in the universe within my head.

Also, i could be staring or just quickly look at something and it would start moving like lava or enlarging then becoming small as if it‚Äôs pulsating. For example, my curtains would look like the effect you get after you stopped driving for a while and stare at the road, this also happens to my body but as if you could feel that visual effect occurring to your body.

I usually get this feeling when i‚Äôm laying or closing my eyes as if i‚Äôm not my body but zooming through air. And i can now do this body thing on command too even if i‚Äôm just walking somewhere. Before this used to feel really calming and nice, but now i get anxious to sleep as it gets bad at night since the feeling occurs most when i‚Äôm laying or closing my eyes, it makes me afraid i‚Äôd drift into sleep paralysis again. (this has happened twice before)

Additionally if i went outside sometimes everything feels out of place like the trees would make no sense to me because of the way they looked, it‚Äôs really hard to explain what i see or feel in that moment, it‚Äôs just nothing makes sense and i struggle to comprehend reality. 

Recently i thought my family came from a different reality it lasted for a few hours, although now it‚Äôs fine. But the way they were acting freaked me out as i got really scared that they were gonna hurt me. It made me heavily uncomfortable as i thought i shifted to another dimension/reality.

I‚Äôve seen people talk about how they look at their hands and don‚Äôt feel connected to themselves this has happened to me a few times, although i‚Äôm just wondering if what i‚Äôve described is part of dissociation as i‚Äôve never seen anyone talk about it before and when i explain to people they usually laugh it off or ignore it, adding to the sense that they too aren‚Äôt real.

i‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety i‚Äôm wondering maybe these two illnesses can induce this feeling."
Idk what I‚Äôm going through,1,li76j1,1,"I‚Äôve had these issues for a while now that I never understood. I brought it up multiple times and people kept asking me if I‚Äôm dissociating. I obviously denied it because idk what that means honestly. I thought dissociation meant like when u actually see yourself like fully out of body. Although I‚Äôve had that feeling idk why I thought it was literal, idek if it is or not. I just want to know what it is I feel. I feel like i have no control over what I think or do or say. I feel like me and the people around me aren‚Äôt real. After a bad day when I‚Äôm filled with anxiety and depression or when I‚Äôm triggered. I would sort of blur out everything and go on random tangents but in my head I‚Äôm like what am I doing. It‚Äôs calmed down because I‚Äôm on medication which limited it but this is the first time it happening again. I‚Äôve seen a video of someone from my past and it gave me so much anxiety and I felt like I was doing it again. I‚Äôm sorry for a better description but I felt like I was going crazy. If someone could give me a bit of insight i would love it. Thank you."

Reminder: You have the strength you need inside you,0,li4873,1,
There ain't room for the two of us here- New voices in my head,14,li2ox5,22,"I was just wondering if I can find anyone with a similar experience who has been going through this longer to get some pointers... I have (so far) 7 different voices in my head that are related to me in some sort of way (they don't necessarily look like me either, and there is one male when i am female).

I was in bed one morning last week and all of a sudden this voice says ""Hi, can I come out? I don't want to scare you"" and like out struts this teenage girl in my head. She told me she hasn't came out sooner because she knew she would scare me pantless (which is true). Later that day another person appeared and another one that night. The next day two more came out. The next day one more came out. two days later a man appeared. 4 of the 7 have names. 3 of the 7 are nonverbal. 6 female, 1 male. Varying ages from 4ish to 40ish.

I don't hear them audibly- they are definitely just in my head and talk in my thoughts. In this week I have realized 4 are different versions of me (2 past, 1 current/recent past, 1 current/future), 1 represents anger, and two are unknown and make me feel frightened/uncomfortable. They are largely positive, my therapist and I are incredibly grateful.

Naturally of course I freak out and reached out to my therapist and psychiatrist and then hoarded myself away all weekend because I had no clue what was happening. But now, I am coming to terms with it moreso and generally like the ones that are strong and talking. We have a good time together.

Do you guys have any tips on handling these guys? so far they aren't making me do anything, i just feel very strongly (one threw a fit when the psychiatrist prescribed a medicine to make them ""go away"", that was our first fight). What are some terms that you refer to them as? I don't like calling them ""parts"" or ""people"" or ""alters"". Related, do you have a term that you call all of you together? I've heard ""system"" but don't like that either. Have you told anyone? How have they reacted?

Thanks, I promise I'm not crazy. This is how I'm coping apparently from a recent trauma."
Dissociating due to burnout - Can anyone relate? Feeling alone.,2,lhwybk,6,"I don't even really have the energy to be typing this, so sorry if it doesn't make sense. But I've been very burnt out at work for the past idk how long, which is causing bouts of what my therapist believes to be dissociation, more specifically I would say depersonalization. I'm not myself. I don't feel like myself. And I'm very unhappy. I'm on the verge of tears a lot, and yet I also zone out a lot and have no emotion. I'm angry a lot and not my bubbly self. As I am typing this, I'm sitting at work, after hours because 1. I don't want to interact with other humans who are also leaving the building (I'm normally an extrovert) and 2. I feel like I'm a bag of bricks who just doesn't want to move. I'm so mentally drained that I just want to sit here and not move. I'm scared and just wondering if anyone can relate. I'm afraid if this continues, it will lead to a mental breakdown. I don't see a lot on dissociation due to burnout from work and I'm just wondering if anyone else out there understands."
Good coping techniques for when dissociating??,11,lhtje7,8,
Dissociation for months that I‚Äôm pretty sure was caused by a bad first experience with weed,10,lhhbi2,11,"About 6 months ago I tried weed for the first time. I must not have been inhaling properly because it didn‚Äôt do anything. So I tried again a couple days later and accidentally smoked way too much. 

I felt like I was stuck in a single second that was looping over and over and started to have a panic attack, which I‚Äôve never had before. While this was happening I would tell myself that it‚Äôs not real I‚Äôm just high. But right after telling myself that I would forget immediately and tell myself it again then remember a few seconds later that I just tried to tell myself that, causing more panic because it made the time loop feel even more real.

I think this went on for about 30 minutes. Now, about 6 months later I still don‚Äôt feel right. I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs dissociation. When it‚Äôs worst someone might be talking to me and I‚Äôll be feel completely out of reality and super confused for a second. Like who the hell is talking right now. Completely disconnected from my surroundings. It seems the only way I can avoid this is by distracting myself. If I have a chance to be in my own thoughts, even if I‚Äôm just slightly uninterested in what someone is talking to me about, I‚Äôll feel like this.

It‚Äôs definitely not gotten better since then, it probably has gotten worse tbh. I mean I was talking to my mom about something earlier and when I responded I just got totally weirded out by my own voice and felt like I was in third person for a sec. Has anyone else experienced this as a result of a bad high with weed? Is there anything I can do about it?

Also a side question. I recently learned about kava. Anyone who may have experience with it have you noticed any interactions (good or bad) between it and dissociation? I want to try it for other reasons but I‚Äôm just curious."
What causes dissociation anxiety,4,lh8x7k,8,"Does anyone know exactly what causes dissociation anxiety,it seems I‚Äôve had it since I was young but it continues to get worse the older I get.is it an effect from always being around people with multiple personality disorders or narcissism?also is quiting drugs supposed to intensify it?"
Vaping & Dissociation/Anxiety,1,lh5hsi,6,hey guys. i am very desperate here lol. so i have never had anxiety but i started vaping maybe about three years ago and the last year i got more heavy on it. my anxiety also has started about a year ago. i am literally scared to go out with friends and really leave my house because i am nervous of the panic attacks and dissociation. i actually just walked my dog and i suddenly felt so dissociated it felt like everything around me was not real and i felt like i lost myself if that makes sense. i am still vaping today and i want to know if anyone else could relate and if i quit will it help reduce or cut out these symptoms? i want to live normally again.
Marijuana and dissociation,34,lgwk39,15,"Throughout my entire life I have struggled with various forms of anxiety. I used to have a panic disorder but now I mainly struggle with dissociation. I have gotten way too high in the past which triggered dissociative episodes but I have also had some really good high experiences where I felt euphoric, connected and focused. This range of experiences all happened before I got my medical marijuana card and I wasn't quite sure which strains I was getting I just knew some made me feel great and some made me dissociate (quantity of consumption didn't make much of a difference).

I have my medical marijuana card now and can experiment with strains but I have no clue what I'm looking for. People have recommended indicas but I have found myself to dissociate quickly when indicas make me zone out. With dissociation comes panic. 

High sativas keep me focused but sometimes cause panic from over thinking which then causes dissociation. Argh, can't seem to win here. 

I think I will be looking for a hybrid? I want a mild body high, feelings of euphoria WITHOUT tuning out to the world. I want to know what's going on but perceive what's going on in a very positive way if that makes sense. I want my life to feel better without being so uncomfortably aware that I'm tuned out and stoned.

Has anyone else gone through this? I am looking for strain recommendations preferably with low to medium THC levels and medium CBD levels."
Unexpected changes caused episode,1,lgny91,0,"My grocery store rearranged the shelves to be horizontal instead of vertical from the front door.
Getting to the end of the aisle and not seeing what I‚Äôm expecting has triggered me every time I‚Äôve been the last month or so. Immediate dissociation and ending in a panic attack. I‚Äôve never had an episode triggered by something like this.

Anyone else ever experienced this?"
How do you know if you're you?,15,lgmzqh,16,"I had a pretty bad dissociative episode about a month ago and I thought it would go away, but after a therapist appointment I decided maybe I should bring this up here.

So I was in the shower when I realized that I didn't know who I was. I didn't know if I was still...well, let's say my name is Vegas. I didn't know if I was Vegas. It was like he had receded into my mind and suddenly I was left to take care of his body, and had the responsibilities he had, or that I had gotten him into. I didn't know if I was actually Vegas, or if I had just been trained to respond to the name Vegas, and that the real Vegas was in here, somewhere, but just didn't want to come out. And maybe he hadn't come out for years.

It took me about two days to feel like I was back to normal again. I honestly still cannot say if I am Vegas or not, but I still put down this body's name on all of my forms and stuff. So, I guess I'm him now? I don't really know who I am. I feel like I'm a completely different person sometimes.

Well, from that I discovered a new voice in my head. Combined with another one I found the week after, that makes a total of three voices, or more rather presences, in my head. It like I'm flying an airplane, with me as the pilot, one of the voices as my co-pilot, and everyone else is in coach. I try to talk about this with my therapist, but he keeps telling me that I'm trying to describe DID to him. I can't have DID, because nothing that traumatic happened to me. I think? I don't know, every time I try to access any potential memories about it I am met with a big door. And, frankly, I don't know if it's something I want to go through. I mean, it was agonizing when my therapist read all of my texts I sent him when I was not feeling good (possibly dissociated, I don't know), as they didn't really sound like something I would send him.

Anyway, enough about my rant. My question is, how do you know if you're you? What do you do if you don't know your name or you feel like you're someone else?"
"hate dissociating, doing it now",7,lghrzz,1,"i have bpd and past traumas so maybe that‚Äôs why i experience dissociation, but i hate it so much. i feel like the world is surreal rn and i don‚Äôt exist on the same wavelength as everyone else. i feel detached from my body and myself. i‚Äôm feeling this probably because i got zero sleep last night, i know it‚Äôs tended to happen to me in the past on sleepless nights (other times too but frequently on the day after i don‚Äôt sleep all night) and i hate it i just want it to be over. i just wanna go to sleep but it‚Äôs so hard to sleep during the day and i‚Äôll mess up my sleep schedule. i just hate this feeling."
Feeling Stuck,3,lghlc0,1,"Hi all,

I've been in treatment for over a year now after leaving a number of abusive relationships. I've spent much of that time alone, both by choice and by circumstance. I'm beginning to feel stuck. Part of what's keeping me stuck is the persistent worry that I need to protect other people from me because I'm: a narcissist, borderline, abusive, etc. These worries seem to emerge as a way for me to dissociate--their obsessive nature and relentless attacks on my person leave me feeling in a daze and disconnected from my body and environment. My therapist has been reassuring and patient--she reassures me often of my empathy, my listening skills, and inherent goodness. She doesn't see patterns of abuse or narcissism. What I'm wondering is: have others experienced this kind of ongoing, obsessional rumination post-abusive relationship? And for *this freaking long*? I hear a voice in my head demanding I keep doing self-help research to get to the bottom of this question (obsession/compulsion). I also engage in a lot of self-blame. I'm not ""better"" yet because I sleep in too late, or because I'm not being honest about my feelings, or because I watch too much TV and smoke too much weed, or because I'm not thoughtful enough... I'm sure many of you are familiar with that internal dialogue. 

This leads to my biggest worry: that I'll never see my way out of this maze. In the course of healing, I've discovered over a dozen people of different ages and genders that live within me, and my thinking is that each part needs to learn the same lessons around self-compassion/healing as the others in order to heal. It just feels maddening sometimes, this stuckness I can't seem to get out of. It makes me feel hopeless at times, and that feeling insists I remain isolated. I suppose I'm writing this to pierce through the isolation, even a little, to see... who's out there. I do eventually want connection with others. I don't know if now is the right time. Have others been through something similar? Do folks have an idea of what made them feel ready to return to the world of the living after healing their wounds? Do you never feel ready and just... do it anyway?"

Any advice or similar experiences with cptsd/ dissociation/ burnout?,3,lgdb9b,3,"female, 19

I suffer from a strong Depersonalisation and Derealisation for about 3 months now due to a burnout (and CPTSD). 

About my childhood-
When I was 12 my mother had cancer and depression and my father moved out (my parents got divorced). I had to take care of my mother alone and started to dissociate because I also suffered emotionally with her. This and other factors led to codependency (shame, feel responsible for others, perfectionism, have no boundaries...). Emotionally I felt like 12 until the age of 18. Then I had a breakdown due to other stress factors and a couple weeks later all of the sudden I started to ‚Äöage‚Äò really fast (don‚Äôt feel responsible for others, confident, high self-respect) like I missed out the years as a teenager to properly age emotionally. Almost one year I only focused on my identity and emotions.
I felt really strong, happy and ready to move out and study at the university. But 2 weeks after I already started to study really hard I completely could leave my old sad life behind me. Because of the high motivation for studying and fast, extreme change of my environmental (moving to a big city) I had sth like a Brun out. I think it was just bad timing. Also I had no ‚Äöpressure‚Äò anymore to have a strong identity because all I did was taking online classes and being alone in my room (due to corona).

From there on I couldn‚Äôt do or feel anything. I couldn‚Äôt move, talk, concentrate, it was like my whole life was gone. My right forehead hurt so much as if my Neurons in my frontal cortex of my brain loses energy. All of my associations were gone (I didn‚Äôt even know what a hand, a lamp, love, a family,.....is). I forget what I did or thought one second ago. Can‚Äôt recognise myself in the mirror. No understanding for time. I almost accidentally burned myself in the shower because I couldn‚Äôt feel anything/ didn‚Äôt noticed.
All I wanted was having my identity back.
Id be scared of anything (loud sudden noises, humans,..)

My first thought that came to my mind was ‚Äölet‚Äôs move to another country, leave your whole life (family, friends, school, dreams) behind you and just become a cashier to have enough money to survive‚Äò
I didn‚Äôt had any needs, desires or feelings. I live in a fake reality in a world with no rules or moral.
Every day I had dizzy spell/ collapse and sleep the whole day. In these moments I felt maximum fear, helplessness, shock/ freeze for hours sometimes.
I had flashbacks and it was as if I lived in the past.

Every day it gets worse
Every morning I forget another thing from my life when I was happy (family, dreams)

After a couple of weeks I happened to function pretty well when I talk to my friends like nothing happened but sometimes I don‚Äôt even know why I would meet my friends because I don‚Äôt have any emotional connections to them anymore.

I already tried so many things...confrontation talking, Emdr, imagination, meditation, yoga, acupuncture, talking with friends, 
And I do have a therapist and a doctor but talking doesn‚Äôt help and talking and explaining is already so exhausting.

Every hour I feel like another person. I cannot acquire new knowledge/facts/behaviour...anything. It‚Äôs like my (aging) process has stopped has stopped.

I really can‚Äôt think of anything that could help me to get my ‚Äöold‚Äò associations and need/will for self-realisation/-fulfilment back. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt have any reasons to do pretty much any thing. I only eat because I happened to be a human who needs a certain amount of food and I only stop eating because my stomach hurts so much that I can‚Äôt walk anymore... I don‚Äôt feel full.

Now I function so well that I don‚Äôt even have a reason to go back to my normal life anymore.
And I have a good friend, Food, time, a bed... no social? pressure which is a bad thing

My biggest problem is that the dissociation is so ‚Äöunnecessary‚Äò. It was all due to the timing. I left my childhood behind me when I was already studying really hard. After one year of focusing on my emotions and identity I only focused on Physics and maths.
and I had no social pressure/ confrontation because I only had online lessons and was alone in a big city.

I‚Äòve heard that people who often dissociated as a child easily dissociate again due to overwhelming emotions because the brain is so used to it. In my case it was the stress from university and high motivation and leaving my childhood behind me.

Also I live more and more my fake reality because I suppress/ push away/ forget another thing the next morning. Now I don‚Äôt even have fear or sadness or flashbacks.
Emdr worked from session to session less. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I do I more and more lose the connection to the time/ emotions/ thinking before my burnout.

Did anyone have similar problems or have ideas/ experiences with other treatments? Id be so thankful!
Hypnosis maybe? But I heard hypnosis can help to remember forgotten traumas and that‚Äôs not my case..
MDMA also doesn‚Äôt sound like the right treatment to me... or does anybody think differently?

(I am not fluent in English. Please understand if i made mistakes....)"
My coping mechanism is probably unhealthy,8,lg8m0v,4,I developed symptoms a couple years ago and my solution is caffeine and thc. I put infused coconut oil in my morning coffee if I‚Äôm dissociating or feel like I‚Äôm going to. So far it‚Äôs worked a charm but I hate the feeling of dependency on it.
How does this apply to dissociation?,2,lg5m3x,0,
Is this dissociating?,4,lg11ed,3,"I remember when I was younger - around 7 or 8, I was in the back of the car and it was dark, I still remember exactly where I was. I began to feel as though I was nothing, I felt like I was a star and nothing mattered. As if I was sort of ‚Äòfloating in space‚Äô, I didn‚Äôt feel human. It happened a few times after that but I have never experienced this again - I am 21 now. It was not scary, it was peaceful. Was this dissociation?"
EMDR,1,lfxycw,2,has anyone here tried EMDR therapy? i‚Äôve been doing some research about it and it‚Äôs a way people have gotten rid of their dissociative disorder. i keep reading how life changing it is and it‚Äôs giving me some hope. i‚Äôve been in a dissociative state since summer of 2019 and i just want to get this over with
Found a way to keep things normal,24,lfrlqr,4,"I‚Äôm sure someone‚Äôs had this idea before, sorry if it‚Äôs a repost. 

I‚Äôve written down instructions for when I dissociate. Through therapy I‚Äôve begun to understand what each dissociative state is supposed to function as

So I‚Äôve written down rules and procedures to make dissociation less disruptive 

Me, being the main ‚Äúperson‚Äù, I‚Äôve worked with my therapist to identify the dangers, or the ways my dissociative states function. 

Writing down a guide book really helps, especially when you come back. You can check if the dissociative state followed the rules or if something else happened

So far I‚Äôve been able to go to school, get my work done, and understand what happens when I‚Äôm not present 

I highly recommend writing a set of rules, or having one notebook to write down the events that happen when you‚Äôre you, and when you‚Äôre not you"
Grounding? Flow? Mindfulness? Meditation?,13,lfhr58,5,"I'll repost something here that I originally put in the Meditation reddit. But the answers there disappointed me.

What the title says. I find it difficult to get a grip on the terminology around mindfulness. Everybody says dissociation is bad, OK. We practice mindfulness in order to be more aware, and dissociation is the opposite of being dissociated. But then people say humans are the most happy when they are in a ""flow"" state, like, when they are coding or chopping wood or painting with all their heart, and that seems to me far away from mindfulness, too - hyperfocused attention.

So, physiologically, I don't really understand the difference in what's happening in each of these states :("
"I can't tell if I need glasses, or if I'm just dissociating all the time",51,lewgwp,11,"Whenever I leave the house, things far away seem blurry. Whenever I enter stores, I always dissociate and feel just trapped inside my body. Like im watching everything around me on a TV. And I can't concentrate on anything. I zone out of conversations. Does anyone else feel this way?"
Attachment Theory,4,letczc,3,"The idea of ""attachment theory"" is popular in dissociation groups and some mental health groups but I think it's important that the idea of ""attachment theory"" is founded on questionable science at its best.

Has anyone else here ever....,6,leotdx,1,"Do any of you guys randomly feel VERY in tune with your surroundings, as if you've made it through the clouds of day to day. Only to come to the conclusion that this newfound feeling is very scary and frightening, combined with the fact that you are somewhat unsure where you are and what you're doing there? Not to mention this happens in only a matter of half a minute for me personally.

Curious what you guys think or if anyone else experiences this at all"
Is what I am currently going through disassociation?,6,lemn5s,6,"  I genuinely think I am incapable of feelings (for now) and when I feel, I block it out(?). I feel robotic every single day, even if I am energised and the... whatever I feel... isn't as bad as when I am triggered by something and disassociate. It's kinda mild(?)
When I socialise with people online, I feel more robotic and unreal, but irl? I kind of feel present but also, not 100%. I donno if this is actually disassociation"
When I was a...,19,lemfxc,3,"I recently remembered something about my childhood. Sometimes, I would look at my hands and wonder if I was real. I would poke myself but I wouldn‚Äôt feel it. This one time I poked myself so hard, I started to bleed, but I felt nothing. I was just numb and felt out of place. I always felt dizzy whenever that happened. I‚Äôve started feeling this way again. I always seem to zone out and forget what I was doing. I was wondering if anyone else felt this way??"
"Physical inability to speak at times, body not responding to input",14,lej5l1,6,"Sometimes I'll really want to say something but my body just.. won't respond. I can say something else but if I try to return to vocalizing the given thought my body just won't respond. Same thing happens while texting, it's like I physically freeze up and can't press the send button no matter how much I want to. It's generally around more emotionally sensitive things or in regards to making certain decisions, it feels frustrating when the moment passes and I end up not being able to say what I wanted to. 

Does anyone else get this and know how to deal with it or communicate effectively when it happens? I should note that there's no internal debate happening over whether I should say/send something or uncertainty of if I should say it, I'll 100% want to but feel a complete lack of control over myself"
"I can be an asshole when I‚Äôm dissociating, and when I come to, I hate myself. How can I begin to apologize?",11,lefwi9,7,"Moreso, I hate the kind of person I see myself as, as others do. It got pretty bad throughout most of 2020 being laid off early into the pandemic. A little off topic here ‚Äî I smoked marijuana for a while to do two things: 1) Mask my dissociation under the guise of being high, and 2) learn to control my feelings during that time. It definitely acted as a mood-leveler; it helped me approach situations with others more thoughtfully, with more empathy, and I can confidently say I‚Äôve retained some of my own self-coaching while under the influence. One downside however, was that I did unfortunately become dependent on it for its usefulness in mediating arguments ‚Äî something I wished to avoid when picking it up for having avoided the prescribed Xanax and the like. I couldn‚Äôt go hours (much less days) without smoking.

Sorry for that. Getting back on topic...

As I haven‚Äôt smoked in over 2 months now, I‚Äôm finding dissociation harder to cope with; arguments occur more frequently and often it‚Äôs not until it‚Äôs too late that I realize I‚Äôve hurt someone. How can I begin to explain the whirlwind/haziness of this disorder and prove that I‚Äôm not cognizent, that I hate myself during these periods just as much as they do?"
Does it sound like I‚Äôm dissociating?,10,le2clr,15,"I have a hard time telling if my experience is actual dissociation or not, so I‚Äôll just describe what I do and maybe y‚Äôall can help me. 
So a few things. I space out a lot and kind of do stuff on autopilot, like I‚Äôll be playing a game or something and I‚Äôll realize that I‚Äôm not really consciously focusing on what I‚Äôm doing and just kinda doing it automatically. I do this with talking too, I regularly trail off into nowhere when I‚Äôm talking because, idk I guess I‚Äôm not really paying attention to the things I‚Äôm saying and I‚Äôm not 100% ‚Äúthere‚Äù if that makes sense. People will ask me things and I‚Äôll give an automatic response, like yes or no, but then I‚Äôll realize that that‚Äôs the wrong answer and correct myself. I‚Äôm also super forgetful, and I regularly forget whether I‚Äôve done things or not, and I assume maybe I spaced out when I was doing it and can‚Äôt remember what happened or something."
How to dissociate?,2,le12iu,7,Not that I don't know but I'm just curious how it happens and how do you know it happened
Is this Dissociation? Can anybody tell what is this?,2,ldytk2,2," 

It all started Monday, when my cat accidentally scratched my hand while I was washing her, it's a pretty shallow cut but it bled a little, I washed it off afterwards and put some alcohol into it.

After that, I started panicking that I might have Rabies, and I started being paranoid about it, for hours and hours, I researched things about rabies, and even though the data contradicts what I am thinking what I have, I just can't stop worrying and be anxious about it.

I became more aware of my body sensations, especially my saliva inside my mouth, and I swallow a lot and thinking I am experiencing salavation, which is a rabies symptom, even though it's just my anxiety.

After that 2 days of being paranoid about rabies, my anxiety subsided, after learning that even though my cat is still unvaccinated, she is not showing any symptoms for a month now and I've been scratched by her several times last month and my sister too nothing happened, so I am pretty sure the cat doesn't have rabies.

After that I worried that I might have tetanus, but then the anxiety subsided quickly.

I've been diagnosed with depression and OCD but currently, I'm not getting any treatment right now because of COVID regulations here in my country.

That night, while I am watching a YouTube video, I felt sleepy, I think it's caused by depression, and slept after that, when I woke up, I felt weird, I felt numb, like I don't feel depressed, stressed, anxious, happy, sad, anything, I feel numb emotionally.

I noticed that I don't feel that tired too, even I've done something really energy demanding, I can feel physical sensations, but emotions, there's just nothingness, even music feels nothing to me now.

I can still laugh, but I feel nothing, I don't now what's causing this.

I feel a vague mild aching on the rear left side of my head, and it can be prompted by me swallowing saliva, but sometimes it appears and then goes away and comes back again. And it's a little harder for me to think now.

I've been like this for 2 days now, I am pretty worried it might be some kind of nerve damage or brain damage whatsoever, can't go to the doctor right now because of COVID, I need to wait 1 month more for me to be able to get help, anyone felt like this before, anyone have a clue what's the culprit of this or whatever this is?"
Woah?? Advice or any opinions?,3,ldt6rs,5,"I had a really bizarre experience tonight that just freaked me out. I've been struggling with dissociation for a while now and its been getting more difficult to manage as of recent. Things have been incredibly stressful and I've been having to relay a lot of trauma back to my therapist ( being current as well past issues ).  What happened kind of scared me and now I'm just on edge about things, I have a therapist and I'm not going to go off self diagnosing and making assumptions of what I possibly might have but has anybody else experienced just feeling as if you just were observing from over your own shoulder as you just begin to go off and do things? It was weird, it felt like I genuinely wasn't in control but at the same time was, I just really didn't feel like I was there and was just watching somebody else do things I was supposed to be doing. But at the same time I felt like I was that person even though they definitely weren't behaving or thinking like me? I apologize for the format and possible incoherent ramblings, I'm just exhausted and confused. I'll probably delete this after a bit if I look back to it and see that I just sound ridiculous"

Saw a psychiatrist, she said it was only anxiety! Wow, I have had a hard time coming to terms with this.... I‚Äôm on a really good antidepressant now and in therapy. I‚Äôm glad that I found this community, but I‚Äôm hoping some people could clear things up or give me some reassurance to make sure I‚Äôm not actually having psychosis.

When I get panic attacks, it‚Äôs like I sink back into my head, like everything around me is kinda... warped? Not real?

I wish my panic attacks were just the classic heart attack fear, but mine is losing my mind... it happens about once a day and ranges from manageable to ‚Äúomg I am definitely going psychotic‚Äù

Looking for advice and/or a buddy <3,2,lbhuol,1,"Hello my foggy friends,

I became aware about 4 months ago about my dissociation. I am undiagnosed as of right now (finally going to a psychiatrist soon though, yay!!) so I am not aware of how split my mind really is but I have found 3 people in my head so far, although I can sense more, and communicated at least a little with each of them.

My therapist has been encouraging me to communicate more with my parts, but I have difficulty reaching them sometimes and I have a lot of amnesia when it comes to my inner world and anything else happening in my head.
She makes it sound so easy, like just close your eyes and imagine them and they will appear and you can talk to them, but it doesn't always work like that for me and it's making me feel like I'm faking...

I was wondering if anyone would be willing to give me tips on starting out with internal communication? As far as I know, my parts only take over my body in times of extreme stress and mostly stay in my mind or act through passive influence so external communication won't do much.

I guess I'm just hoping to connect with someone who has been through similar stuff who can give me advice that I cannot find online (I've been searching...) and share experiences with :) 

DM me if you'd like to talk   ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£üíï"
So I need to ask something,3,lbf1g6,3,"I‚Äôm not diagnosed, but I figure this might be a good place to find out whether or not I should probably go see someone? 

Every once and a while, maybe five or six times a week, I feel distanced. For hours at a time. It‚Äôs a strange feeling. Like if I was watching my eyes doing the things I do. 

So I‚Äôm expected to operate heavy machinery at my job, and I‚Äôve never gotten into an incident where someone gets hurt. But should I be worried? Like I think about it in the moment, how I feel the way I feel, and I feel reckless. 

I feel like there‚Äôs no consequences to what I‚Äôm doing, like it‚Äôs all some kind of game. 

So if anyone has any words to help me out here, that would be much appreciated."

"Disoriented, needing help",1,lapdbk,12,"I'm breaking down. I'm at a stressful point in my life right now and it's not been good for me. I've had these moments where I go from crying to fine within a second, the emotion feeling stuck in the back, no longer feeling like mine, the thoughts associated with it feel quiet and hard to make out. I've had that for as long as I remember, but recently it's gotten so much worse. I go from panicked, to calm, to having a flashback, to just being frustrated, all after just a moment of zoning out. When there's this rapid cycling, nothing around me feels like mine, my memories don't feel like mine, and I get partial amnesia between these parts, enough that I'd not be able to speak to any of the thoughts or feelings if I hadn't been journaling some of them as it all happened.

Had a bit of a swap just then so separating this out, bit calmer now though I can see that won't last. I'm not going to continue with the smaller details given venting isn't what I want to do here (despite that being exactly what I was just doing, I guess) but I'm still pretty confused and disoriented about all this.

Anyone know  what might be going on? Or how to have this stop? I have a therapy appointment later in the week but this has been keeping me from a lot of important things.  


Edit: The panicked part wanted to mention how reading back over any of the other part's feelings also doesn't feel like it's something that came from them. Realizing myself how weird it is that I'm referring to these separately from myself, I don't think I'd have done that in the past when it's been an issue but it's just so pervasive atm? idk"
Anyone Else?,4,lanuzv,3,"Howdy! I've noticed a few behaviors in myself during instances over the past few days, and I just wanted to see if anyone experiences these too:

&#x200B;

1) During periods of ""going past the limit"" emotionally, I think of therapy and attempt to talk myself into finding a therapist again. During my spirals of thoughts, I'll imagine a therapy talk session between myself and my inner-voice with my inner voice as the therapist, until I eventually calm down and don't think I need therapy afterwards. (I can't seem to talk myself into therapy; one voice really wants/needs it, and the other refuses to believe it)

&#x200B;

2) Also during periods of ""going past the limit"" emotionally, or during dissociative periods, my mind will play me music. This is usually my current repeat-song, and stays in my head until I calm down. 

&#x200B;

Comment if you experience either of the above, or similar :)

"First time posting, not sure if what I‚Äôm experiencing is dissociation or what. Helpful feedback encouraged :)",13,lajwji,2,"So here we go, all throughout my life I‚Äôve occasionally experienced very strong surges of what I now know is dissociation, specifically derealization I‚Äôd say, but also very strongly depersonalization. It wasn‚Äôt something that would happen very often, but it was prevalent. When it happened it always felt very uneasy and also very depressed, but not sad depressed, it just felt very empty and unreal. I guess the feeling was similar to being in the middle of nowhere all alone and having your stomach dropping.

 A specific incident I remember very clearly was when I was visiting my brother. He lived near a rec center so we went to the pool there and would swim, sit in the sauna, ETC. it was always a very good experience and I always had a ton of fun and I wasn‚Äôt stressed or anxious about anything. And all I remember was the second we left I got a super strong feeling of dissociation, I barely even remembered where I was and such and I tried my best to explain it but I couldn‚Äôt, and I still really can‚Äôt, the best explanation that I have is that it feels like I‚Äôm in a dream.

So this hasn‚Äôt been an issue ever really and it was just something that occasionally happened but recently it‚Äôs been happening more often. Like weeks at a time, I have recently started smoking weed, so I‚Äôm pretty positive that has something to do with it, but I only experience this once I‚Äôm sober, so I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it. It‚Äôs not interfering with my daily life too bad except for mild discomfort and unease, but i guess it does worry me a little bit. 

I‚Äôm not really looking for a cure or anything, I just kinda wanted to put this out here and get some input on to what this may be, and sort of get it off my chest. Any input or comment is appreciated, thanks."
First Derealization Episode?,12,la9o8e,1,"I'm sorry if I misuse terms, this is all new to me.

I have PTSD, panic and generalized anxiety disorders.  I'm no stranger to dissociation but last week something different happened, and I am honestly terrified.

I've been really stressed lately, I won't bore you with the details, but I was driving home and it hit me like a ton of bricks -- nothing was real, and I was completely separated from control of my body.  I kept driving as normal, but on the inside I was horrified (compounded by the fact that I had my dog in the car with me, who is my pride and joy).  Thankfully we were close to home and we arrived safely just via muscle memory, I guess.  As I drove up my long driveway I wondered where we were and why we were there (I've lived here over a year).

Then came another issue: I had no idea how to get out of the car.  It didn't occur to me that I could just open the door and get out; I have no idea how long I spent just sitting there in a haze with my dog whining to get out.

Finally, through the haze I gained some sense of control and very slowly opened the door, let my dog out and went inside.  I sat inside for a long time too, wrestling and trying to figure out what had happened and why; once I became more myself I was terrified that it might happen again and cried just from the memory of it. 

Perhaps the scariest thing: I resolved not to drive until I was more myself, scared that in my derealization or whatever it was I could hurt myself or someone else with my car.  I argued this with myself, remembering that I was going to go ride my horse later that afternoon so I should go.  I didn't *hear* the voice physically so much as hear it like you hear an internal monologue, but something said, ""why would you care? There's nothing particularly special about horses.  Forget about them."" And my entire life I've been devoted to horses, this is very much 100% not me. (Yes, horsegirl that's me)

Since then I've been very dissociated.

This is all very, very disturbing for me.  My panic attacks already make it difficult for me to lead a normal life and hold down any kind of work, but if this is going to be more regular for me I don't know what I'll do.  Am I safe when I have these episodes? Please, if anyone can offer words of comfort I'm really worried."

Depersonalization Success Story & DPDR Success Story: How Jay Has Won Social Anxiety & Depersonalization,2,l997np,0,"Seeing that so many people talk about negative stuff, symptoms left and right and negative stories, here's some inspiration from someone who has actually overcome dpdr and anxiety ü•∞

Jay had dpdr/dissociation and anxiety, in particular social anxiety and derealization. After our hypnosis & coaching sessions he feels much more confident, way calmer, ""connected to planet Earth"" as he likes to say, much more clear headed, finally feeling emotions and sensations in ""real time"", feeling connected to his real emotions, being much more present end enjoying the moment, finally moving on with his life without worrying how dissociation and anxiety will interfere. üòå

Not only has he solved these core problems, but he has learned core skills in how to manage his emotions and how his mind works so he will not put himself in the same situation ever again (very powerful).

He has faced himself, and now he is here sharing his incredible transformation and change free from unnecessary overthinking, anxiety, dissociation, brain fog and stress and pursuing his passion in music and other creative interests. üòÅ

TL;DR: unsure if i actually am dissociating constantly bc IDK if having constant silence in your mind (not having any internal dialogue) is a symptom."
Nothing feels like me,7,l8ca45,6,"None of my memories feel like mine. Looking back on almost any experience that isn't actively happening in the moment feels strange and difficult to relate to, and the memories themselves are reduced to the same detail as if I was just told by someone what had happened instead of having experimented it myself. Sometimes I'll feel a small ""blip"" where I zone out for a small moment and suddenly everything I was doing moments before feels foggy and distant, like a day had passed by in a second, and I often have to reorient myself to what I was doing afterwards. I can go from a full-blown panic attack to calm and focused on self-care after one of those blips Memories feel like they rotate, I'll forget and then remember again several times over with the same information, from basic details to months or years of experiences at a time..

There's a lot more I could add on, but to keep it short-

Dissociation?,2,l826q3,1,"So last night I had this weird panic/anxiety attack where I was getting loads of shimmering lights in my field of vision. Also my hearing turned into something else. Like everything I was hearing sounded like it was coming through a 1950s radio.

inability to feel affection/bond properly because of dissociation?,21,l7brh6,2,"I've had this weird problem that I'm pretty sure is a kind of dissociation, maybe dissociative amnesia. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem.

It happens with most relationships in my life, but it's particularly bad with my s/o. A lot of the time, I feel strangely detached from him in a lot of ways. I don't feel emotion from anything he says or does. He'll be hugging/kissing me or whatever, but I feel like I'm hugging a lump of nothing, like he's not a person. Sometimes he'll be with me and I feel like he's imaginary, like he's not there at all. Most of the time when he says affectionate things like ""I love you"" they just fly over my head...they have no meaning. Often, I'll also feel like I've forgotten who he is...I don't *actually* forget, but memories feel hazy. I look at him, but I don't see anything familiar. Since I don't feel any affection or familiarity from him, I start to forget the things I like about him and why I'm with him. I also don't feel my own affection for him as strongly because he feels so unreal.

As you might imagine, this makes being in a relationship really difficult. I feel like I can't be a proper loving girlfriend this way if I can't feel affection for or from him half the time. It's like I'm a robot who can't feel affection. This is also hard in friendships and with family members, albeit to a lesser degree.

I've had this issue since I started having ptsd so it's probably from that. It's gotten worse recently, though. Anyway, I'm really curious if anyone else goes through a similar thing or has any insight into this."
I think I am almost constantly dissociated?,46,l76wqi,13,"I tried to think about the last time I felt real and normal.

"I'm slipping away, very slowly.",26,l6ksuu,13,"I think I'm just slowly losing my grip on reality and my consciousness. It's happening slowly, but it's there.

I don't know what to do about this though. It's like I'm fighting an infection I don't know how to treat. My whole sense of self is being questioned, and often I don't know what I'm doing or how my body is able to do the things it does when I'm not really focused.

I'm really scared. The fact that I have not-alters (voices that until I get a diagnosis or a doctor saying they are actually alters I will not acknowledge as people) going on in here saying a bunch of stuff and just switching between themselves in the co-pilot seat and putting thoughts in the stream of thoughts doesn't help. I don't know what they are. I don't know what's going on with me. I don't know why I'm finding them at this time of my life. I don't know if they're real or just my imagination. I don't know what's going on. I wish someone just had the answer.

My only lead is that it's dissociation, but it's not tied to a disorder yet. But I'm just scared that one day I'm going to lose complete control of myself and just be lost, watching my life go by as someone in the co-pilot seat instead of someone who should be in the pilot's seat. Or worse, I could be put in coach and not be able to see myself doing things and just black out. Completely disconnect from reality.

I don't want that to happen though, but I'm so scared. I can't really do anything concrete with my therapist until we get a diagnosis from the psychiatrist, but I don't know when that's going to happen, if it'll happen at all.

I could use some help right now. I don't think I have anyone else to turn to. I don't know if I'm dissociating or not. I probably am."
Out of Sight Out of Mind - Feel Like People Don't Exist When I'm Not with Them,17,l645qo,8,"TL;DR
People don't feel real to me when I can't physically be with them, do you experience this too? What do you do to cope?

I have only very recently identified my dissociation for what it is. It was relieving when I started therapy a couple months ago.

I have been experiencing dissociation for a few years at least, the biggest contributing factor I've identified so far is the stressful event of my mom moving. Usually, when you go to college, you leave home and home doesn't leave you. My sophomore year, my mom moved from New England to the Southwest U.S.. I was forced to give up my pets, and half the stuff we owned, and then I was effectively homeless for the rest of my undergrad program.

On her travels she was often not reachable because of cell phone signal, and she had hardly done any planning so she was sleeping at truck stops and random places along the way. I would often worry she would die or get hurt and I wouldn't have any way to know because I couldn't reach her.

I reached a point where I realized I was not actively missing/worrying about her anymore because she just didn't feel real to me. I told her this once and she got really upset, which I don't blame her. But she didn't feel real, even if we did manage to talk on the phone she was just a voice in a box, and I felt no connection to her the way I had before she left.

I've had similar feelings when I was in a long distance relationship in college, and again in my current relationship when we were separated because of quarantine.

I used to try a writing exercise where I would write down facts about my life, who I was and who was important to me and involved in my life, but it didn't really stick. I knew the information to be true but just couldn't feel the truth of it.

With therapy I have learned some grounding techniques and for me I'm a super physical/tactile person. To really engage with something I need to touch things, and smell things. I need a lot of sensory stimulation to be present fully which is obviously not possible on phone calls and when there is distance. 

My current partner who I see fairly regularly still feels less real, and he has been kind enough to leave a peace of his clothing with me to cuddle/smell to feel more connected to him.

So, after reading, I wonder if you've had a similar experience? Are there other coping mechanisms that work for you? Especially things you do in public ( I can't exactly whip out a pair of men's underwear in the middle of the grocery store üò≠).a

I'm so grateful to be able to identify this experience and to have this lovely community to be a part of :)

Stay well everyone!"
"I found a new voice today, and it was scary.",11,l5wpq6,4,"So usually with these bouts of dissociation I also get these voices, too. Well, I call them voices, they mainly communicate with thought insertion. I think. I don't know.

Anyway, today I started dissociating and I found a new voice. She was very angry. It just felt like I didn't want to be around her. She kept saying stuff that freaked me out and whenever someone else walked by she would say something mean about them. Since she's just in my head nobody hears them, but it's tiring to have to listen to her.

So I gave it a few hours and now I feel like she's receded to some other part of my mind. I knew there was something (someone?) that was responsible for the anger I felt at times and the bad thoughts directed at me, and I think I found the source. So finding her made it easier for me to identify whenever she acts up in the future, so that's one positive thing. But it was so scary finding her. I was in the thick of dissociation, and I was struggling with whether or not any of this was real. If the voices were real, if anything I was experiencing was real. It was terrible.

I feel like I'm faking it. I really, really do. I don't even know what these voices are. I don't have any kind of dissociative diagnosis yet, so I can't really say they're alters or anything, but *they feel so real for it to be fake!*

But how do I know! I could be imagining symptoms for all I know! Well, that, and I honestly can't remember anything traumatic enough for me to warrant having alters, anyway. Well, nothing I can remember, but then there's memory repression and bleh.

I don't know, sometimes I feel like I'm slipping away more and more each day. Like I'm on a mountain that's constantly being rained on and I keep slipping down. Or like I fell out of a boat and into the ocean and I'm flailing, trying to get back on board.

I don't know what's going on. I just want to get this out there to know I'm not making this up, because I feel like it's getting worse and worse as I keep going. It's also making my urges to self harm go up, too, but I haven't done anything like that yet. I don't know how many voices I'm going to find. So far I've got like three, but I don't know if that's enough for anything.

I don't want to think about this. I just want to leave the voices behind and get to work on getting a proper diagnosis. Except seeing a psychologist is more expensive than the psychiatrist I'm currently seeing, so I *have* to put up with these bouts of dissociation and voices until the doctor reaches a diagnosis (if they even hand those out) and we can start working towards something. All I need is a doctor to say ""You have X,"" and then I'll be able to get to work on treatment without feeling like I'm scaring my therapist with all of the messages I'm sending out of fear and confusion of these voices.

I need help, but it's too expensive."
I made up a grounding technique for myself after watching the Disney movie Soul that I wanted to share,8,l5u776,1,"The movie had a lot of ‚Äúthis is all you need to be happy in life‚Äù type things in it.
But I took away from it is, I need to stop being in life and start seeing in life.

Now instead of looking at what I‚Äôm saying I am seeing what I look at. Little confusing and I hope I‚Äôm wording it right but pretty much I‚Äôm paying more attention to details to the smaller every day things that‚Äôs around me, even looking at my phone and looking at the edges of it and the color. Just noticing the every day things in life again. 

I read earlier in the day that one thought about happiness is that we get to use to the every day things around us. It said think of an item that you really wanted and think how long it took for you to get tired of it. 
So tying that into the movie I think that just re-seeing all the things around you like new again can help with grounding"
Recently Discovered I have a Dissociative Disorder,3,l5qekx,6,"So as of this past year, I started having regular reoccurrences of persistent vertigo where I felt like the world was spinning and I was consciously spinning with it. I thought this feeling was triggered by over consumption of caffeine intake or drug induced from THC or adderall... I quickly stopped consuming caffeine and any other stimulates throughout the year. As I began focusing more on what I was consuming to gain some control over my psyche, my anxiety symptoms got worse and I started feeling really strange, randomly throughout parts of the day/night. Sometimes this feeling would last a couple of minutes but then it would happen for longer periods of time, like hours at a time. It would be the most bizarre sensation of feeling like I was upside down. It is very hard to describe how I felt with language but I will try my best. I would begin to just feel very strange. I was perfectly aware of my existence and the strange feeling of the world being this foreign land/place but I would be so far up in my own head thinking that I felt like some sort of alien that I couldn‚Äôt think straight. These events of feeling detached would trigger massive anxiety attacks and I would just want to run and hide under the covers of my bed. I have history of adolescent verbal abuse on top of years of benzodiazepine drug dependency. I have spoken with my therapist about it and we have come up with ways to help alleviate my dissociative symptoms when they happen. But there is really no cure for it is there?"
I feel like I'm constantly looking for dissociation symptoms vs actually having dissociation.,42,l5mu77,10,"If I don't think about dissociating then I'm good and it's like I never had it but if I have a random thought about dissociation then I start to actively look for symptoms of depersonalization/derealization. This then takes my focus off of what I'm doing and I start obsessing about it. My thoughts start getting scrambled(feel like I'm going crazy) but I can also think clearly if I wanted to. When I look in the mirror I don't feel a sense of detachment other than me obsessing over looking for the detachment feeling. When I look around everything looks real but I don't feel very present because of this obsession. I'm kind of a hypochondriac so whenever something happens I obsess about it until I find a solution, obviously with DPDR there is no ""solution"" per se so when it goes away I'm constantly thinking about it and don't really know if it comes back or if I'm just overthinking it. Does anyone else have this issue? Maybe this is OCD? I'm going to see a therapist because it's starting to get unbearable."

Dissociating back to different memories?,1,l51zbn,0,"Anyone with similar experiences? Tldr at bottom

I've taken snapshots of moments since I was small. It started with me reverently thinking ""wow, I'm going to look back on this moment and remember it"" when I was at show and tell in third grade. I then started ""saving"" these moments intentionally, cataloging them in my head. Some get lost, aren't as valued, but others I go back to regularly. One I particularly enjoy is sitting on an outcropping on a mountain side. When I was there I tried to memorize as much as possible about that moment: the wind, the chatter of hikers and their kids behind me, the feel of rock underneath me, how my back hurt from carrying my pack, how the air felt in my lungs. Every bit. I have found while the visual is important, it's the little details that pull it all together.

So, by ""go back"" to a moment, what I'm really doing is recalling all those feelings and dissociating. I've gotten to the point where it feels like those moments where you're half stuck in a dream and half awake, you're still interacting and participating with the dream but with some nigling that you're actually conscious. It feels more real sometimes but it's easy to get pulled out of it. Like, I know I'm standing there peeling onions or something, but my mind is a year and a world away in the mountains.

Sometimes I'll react to stimuli that's in my memory like it's happening in real time. I'll say things out loud, move my body, ect. ""Stop! Don't do that"" or try to stop something from falling for example. At that point it kind of shocks me out of it when I'm around other people, I get self conscious that they'll think I'm weird and try my best not to talk outloud anymore.

I have trouble with staying in reality, I really like going back and reliving moments. It's probably not the best but it definitely isn't the worst coping mechanism I could have. I can't handle normal reality so I checkout and do my own thing, but it's gotten worse over the years, to where if I'm not actively checking out of reality I get an anxiety attack. 

Anyway, anyone with similar dissociating habits where they go back to a moment of their life of their choosing?

Tldr: I memorize moments in time so I can dissociate and ""go back"" to them and it feels real enough that I react to it as if it's happening again. Do you do this too? Is it common?"
Dpdr from acid,3,l4zu3m,3,"This is my first time really sharing my story with anyone because I‚Äôve just been going through this alone since I feel like my friends/family doesn‚Äôt understand and I have no insurance to get any other help. It all started back in September when a close friend of mine at the time had offered me acid. This was the first and only time I‚Äôve taken it. When the person explained it to me she basically said it was a weed high (it clearly was nothing like that) on top of the acid tab she wanted to smoke weed in which I agreed because I trusted her, I‚Äôm aware I should‚Äôve done my own research first. Fast forward the beginning of the trip was good then for some reason when I heard auditory hallucinations it lead me to an instant panic attack I‚Äôve never had a panic attack before that but in the moment I thought I was going to die and thought I was going crazy. After that I managed to calm myself down and enjoyed the rest of the trip after that everything seemed to go back to normal until I tried to smoke weed again and had an instant panic attack just off one hit and that was the first time I really felt any dpdr but then it went away shortly after when I went for a walk and managed to calm myself down but then that‚Äôs when my health anxiety started because I was scared I have brain damage from the acid or a tumor or something. I would have panic attacks more frequently due to me worrying about my health but the dpdr didn‚Äôt go away. I went to Colorado in December and another friend of mine wanted to smoke so we did even tho I still had dpdr I tried to push through it, but then we did an edible and it instantly felt like an acid trip and I had another panic attack I felt disconnected from reality and I haven‚Äôt been the same since then. It‚Äôs been almost 2 months since I‚Äôve been sober . I‚Äôve went to the hospital numerous times and they said they couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with me. I feel like I‚Äôm dreaming when I‚Äôm awake, I feel disconnected from reality it feels like I‚Äôm living in a movie or tv show, my friends & family, I keep having existential thoughts that I never had before and what scares me the most is I don‚Äôt remember what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feels like. I just feel very uncomfortable and overwhelmed. I‚Äôm so scared that the acid changed my perception of life forever and that I‚Äôll never go back to how I was before it was just one time üòî Please any advice is greatly appreciated."

My vision became 20/20 for about 30 minutes in the 4th grade. Could it be conversion disorder?,3,l4gl84,5,"I have no idea where to post this considering the main subreddit for conversion disorder is pretty dead. Functional neurological disorder is another name for it, but I don't tend to see any real vision issues when searching it up by that term. Sorry if this is irrelevant but I have no idea where to actually get a meaningful response. I spoke about this to my therapist, but she couldn't really respond because she doesn't know anything about it.

EDIT: Nevermind, I just read the description of the sub lol.

In the 4th grade, something strange was happening. Whenever I would try to think about something, I kept on getting a ton of information from what usually occurs before thoughts. Basically, I was witnessing some kind of pre-processed brain information that I couldn't really make sense of. Even though it seems meaningless to me, for some reason I started to think that I could fix my vision. I couldn't really get an actual grasp on why I thought this and it was extremely frustrating. I was extremely confused about how to even do anything because I didn't understand my lower level mental functions. This still happens today, but if I'm functioning well I can ignore it.

One time, when the teacher was calling on the students to read what was on the board, she asked me to read a few sentences. I couldn't actually see what was on the board, so I started panicking. By panicking, I mean I was crying and hyperventilating. I was able to convert this panic into concentration and in some way I was able to fix my vision. I'm not sure exactly how I did it, but I'm guessing that I ended up interacting with pre-processed brain information in some meaningful way. There was a tiny little blip that I think that I noticed where I kind of understood what was going on but in a very vague, mostly unconscious way.

While I was crying, there were these distortions in my vision. I can't tell if it was just my brain or if it was due to the water in my eyes or both. After they cleared up, I could see in 20/20 and I was so fucking relieved. I read the board out loud and class went on. I had anxiety/panic attacks every week where I would end up crying and hyperventilating so it was seen as pretty normal.

After that happened, I told myself to ALWAYS remember this. I kept on telling myself that this literally happened. I kept on telling myself that this weird sort of excessive introspection CAN actually be accurate and to never listen to anyone who tells me otherwise. I would take note of any possible alterations I made when remembering this memory when I first noticed/learned that it happened. I realize that it could have been a dream, but I've never had a dream that is completely realistic. Everything is telling me that this memory happened in real life.

If anyone knows of any similar stories or any information at all, then please let me know. If anyone knows if it's technically possible for the water from my tears to distort the vision in such a way to make it 20/20 for me, then please let me know. Even if that is possible, I doubt that it would be able to hold for 30 minutes or that it would happen right when I'm trying to alter pre-processed visual information in order to see properly.

Thanks!"

Do you think I have dissociation?,2,l4c4v2,5,"Recently I've been experiencing this thing every once in a while where I'm looking at a person and they eventually start looking strange/unhuman to me. Their face doesn't even look like a face anymore. It just looks like these things put together and I don't clearly identify what I am looking at as a human. They're just unrecognizable figures to me. One time my friend's arms started looking like ""things"" instead of ""arms"" (if that makes sense). This has only happened to me a few times and they were in the course of a week or two. However, a few months ago I had a similar experience where I woke up in the middle of the night and everything felt and looked foreign to me and when I would focus on an object it would start to float.

Intense episode... thoughts?,2,l40ig0,3,"(TW if you don‚Äôt like reading descriptions of mental health scenarios)

I had a fairly intense dissociative episode the other day... more intense than I can remember experiencing so far. But there are a couple of factors that make me wonder if maybe it was simply a physical issue with mental side effects... If that doesn‚Äôt make sense, it will in a moment.

I had been looking at houses to rent with a friend for most of the morning. Before meeting up with them I had some coffee, then we got coffee together, so I was decently caffeinated. I hadn‚Äôt eaten prior to either coffee. During the house hunt my anxiety was proving to be an obstacle. Likely brought on by the caffeine, but legitimate nonetheless given the struggle we were having with finding a house. On my drive home my dissociation hit hard. I felt completely removed from myself to the point of needing to strain to focus on driving safely. When I got home, I had to continuously reality check my surroundings and remind myself I was alone in my own apartment. (This part I think was a result of maintaining social normalcy all morning in front of my friend. But I‚Äôve never experienced it to this intensity before.)

I could talk myself in circles about this, but that‚Äôs pretty much the extent of my episode. Do you guys think I was just over caffeinated and underfed? Or is this a new development in my dissociation that I need to keep tabs on? This was the very first time it‚Äôs ever affected my ability to function. 

Thanks for reading."

"Veteran at Dissociation, started with DID at 10, got into NMDA antags later in life -- OPINIONS?",1,l3hpmq,0," Hi all,

After extensive abuse of a huge array of known, and unknown RC dissociatives, I'm looking for other peoples' subjective experiences on it Dissociatives in general. Also a HEAVY benzo user for over half a decade now.

\--

I was predisposed to schizophrenia, and I'm sure using DXM and Disso's made helped develop that with more of a personality

I started my journey with alcohol, nicotine, weed, but DXM is what led me down ""the rabbit hole"", so to speak.

I'm incredibly lucky, and have minimal PHYSICAL side effects from disso abuse; bladder and brain issues, but more psychological than physiological-- I have GI issues, nausea, and sinus issues that I'm sure correlate with DXM abuse for GI, and K for sinus/cramping issues respectively. :

I've noticed, the ""Magic"" is often talked about regarding NMDA antags, and freq. of use, and frankly, I'm starting to believe the ""Magic"", is just your brain experiencing dissociation, along with psychedelia, for as long as the dissociation is ""magical"" to the user itself.

if its dxm or a psych-disso combo, many people have their first experiences are with an NDMA antag, combined with psychedelic properties (EG- dxm! or S+ K for UK bastards). For the first time, similar to how you notice more and more patterns with things like LSD and tryptamines, you notice the ""magic"" of the void and the ""all is one, and one is all concept"", is introduced. It's similar to how you feel the love and introspection with certain compounds, for many people, dxm not excluded, the most impactfully the first time

Fast forward 10 years, I only use Memantine and Nitrous now, as all perceived ""magic"" is gone, aside from MEDICINAL Memantine, and RECREATIONAL nitrous, to help me with serious delusions (eg. If I'm having an illogical conclusion form from an illogical source, a cartridge or two can help me ""step back"" to try and reassess my thoughts in a more logical way--

Memantine, from 2.5-50mg daily, given I keep a consistent blood level of the substance in me, I have an almost immediate improvement in symptoms that have not been cured by SSRIs, SNRIS, MSs', TCAs, Atypical antipsychotics, etc.

The only way it seems I'm able to live a life with ""less weird shit goin on"", to put it simply, I've realized the medication is an NDMA antagonist, the same type of drug that exacerbated my symptoms in the first place, just in a different setting (not using .5-3.5g of k/rcs or 300-700mgs of dxm daily, but instead, using the longest acting and shortest acting NMDA antag I could find, with either very short recreational duration, or primarily medicinal-- eg. 100 whippits p/month and 10mg Memantine average daily = +++++++ in functionality. +++++ feeling better ++++++ Quality of life, vs K/PXc/Rcs. which = ----- functionality BUT even though i was FEELING better++++++, my quality of life was-neg---)

From my research, It seems that low NMDA receptor activity seems to be an exacerbator of schizophrenia, but at the same time is the only actual class of drugs that works when treatment resistant depression like bipolar/schizo/OCD doesn't cut it.

By this logic, HARMING myself slightly in the long term due when my NMDA receptors are blocked with a moderate votage affinity substance, not something that will get me high as shit,like K, I'll generally get more things done. HOWEVER, if I try other forms of anti depressants, INCLUDING CBT, Physical Therapy, DBT, etc, and they don't work, is the best solution to a longer life.

It seems after extensive research in non physiological causes and treatments of dementia and schizophrenia, I've found both the cure, and the curse. I know that every time I antagonize my NMDA receptors, I make my illness worse, but at the same time, its the only way to progress in a way where I won't just rot and die. Any older heads with Dissociative experience and extra input would be appreciated. I don't expect to ""solve"" the answer to SPD/BPD/DID, but I wanted to contribute my experience reports, as there aren't many people in 25-35 age range that use Memantine.

It's primarily prescribed to patients with Alzheimer's, but the effectiveness in people with either an excess or deficiency regarding their NMDA receptors may find relief from this, where nothing else did. I'm trying to get off benzos and stay on Memantine, but I've been on gabaERGICS for so long, and the damage I've done to my receptors is yet to be determined, but I feel either NMDA antags/ antichol / d2 uptake inhibitors give you a sense of ""wellbeing"" and perceived increased cognition, but ultimately, is probably making the disease worse, IF YOU ARE NOT UNDER 65.

Since this med was prescribed for the elderly, long term efficacy is going to be hard to gauge, but I firmly believe that the solution for many mental problems are microdosing the problem... I recognized patterns too much, which led to an anxiety disorder, which led to many more dissociative identity disorder related symptoms, yet ironically, the only thing that's provided me any relief, is probably harming me in the long term.

Then, the question is, are THERE PLANS TO REFINE MEMANTINE for a younger audience, maybe with no COL properties, to see if NDMA, plus a perceived dopamine uptake could help TRD. Just a few thoughts, PLEASE PLEASE CORRECT ME IF YOU SEE MISTAKES OR INFORM ME IF IM MISINFORMED. I WANT TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, AND BEING DIRECT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THAT"
Anybody else feel like this,1,l3ef2e,1,i feel like im forcefully strapped to a seat and forced to watch my own life happen
Difficulty speaking when dissociating?,3,l3a59j,5,"Hi,

as a disclaimer: I am not sure if what I am experiencing is actually dissociation, since it hasn't been diagnosed, but a lot of the symptoms fit and I just wanted to check if anyone else experiences this or if I am going crazy.

A few months ago I was diagnosed with a panic disorder and I have been struggling with pretty strong panic attacks and self harm for more than six months. Before that, I also had some attacks, but a lot less frequent.

During the past four or five years I have often had situations where I don't recognise myself and get scared of looking at myself in the mirror, almost expecting the person in the mirror to attack me. I also go through phases of feellng like me, then suddenly seeing everything from an outsiders perspective and feeling like I'm floating. It feels like these different states of mind don't fit into one personality, so I don't have a cohesive sense of self. These are symptoms of dissociation that I think are pretty common.

But I also experience things that I have so far never heard anybody talking about

In some situations I feel really exhausted all of sudden, to the point where I feel like I could pass out any second. I am not able to think in coherent sentences and it feels like I lose the control over the muscles in my jaw and face. It is similar to the feeling of taking a long nap in the middle of the day and then waking up not knowing where you are and what time it is. The difference is that it feels like my body is about to give in, everything is cloudy and it feels like I haven't slept in days. I can't really say that I feel or think anything in these moments, it's just very exhausting to focus on conversation and to not space out completely. I could imagine that this is what being drunk is like or being about to have a stroke. I am often not aware of my feelings in these moments and it can happen that I notice hours later that I actually really need to use the bathroom or feel like I am starving. This can be accompanied by sudden pain in the face, head, neck and back. Sometimes I also notice that I forget what I am doing or I come back to my sense of self and don't know why I am doing what I'm doing or why I am going in a certain direction.

Another thing that I experience is quite a contrary sensation. I have episodes of being hyper-alert and having this looming sense that something really dangerous is about to happen. It's like I get sucked out of myself and my sensd of reality and I am scared of things or people around me. This can mean having a sudden feeling of being trapped, watching myself doing things and talking, but not actually having a connection to it. It can also mean that I suddenly fear that a person in the room might have the intention of killing me, raping me or at least manipulating me. 

Often I will zone out and have this weird feeling of being in a dream, or of not knowing what reality should feel like. At the same time, I know that there is something wrong with my perception. Time seems to be warped and I sometimes forget fragments of interactions.

I am not sure if any of this makes sense and there are a lot of other strange things that I experience that would be too much for this post. It might be important to mention that I have had some traumatic experiences when it comes to sexual abuse and I am in the process of uncovering more of my trauma.

I just wanted to know if this fits into the experience of dissociation, especially the part of feeling like I lose control over my ability to speak and think straight.

Thanks :)"

Anyone else just goes about their day and then they suddenly realize that they have no idea who they are?,69,l2f7el,10,"Last week I had a pretty big dissociative episode that lasted a couple of days. In fact, it was the episode that got my psychiatrist to add a note of it on my medical record, and the voices that came back with it may have helped to take it more seriously.

Anyway, now that I'm officially on the watch for any other dissociative experiences and keeping a record of them, I'm finding that it is helpful in certain situations. Good for giving it to medical professionals, and maybe just to find a group of people who can help me understand this relatively new concept.

Anyway, to the topic of this discussion.

I can't remember what exactly triggered it, but I know that I suddenly didn't feel like I was me. My name didn't mean anything to me anymore. It felt weird saying it. It was like it didn't belong to me. It was someone else's name, but it didn't really feel like my name. Looking at my reflection also was kind of weird, but not too terribly. My vision tends to drift away from my whole face and just focuses on my hair or maybe just the blood vessels in my eyes.

Anyway, I digress. I started to panic because I didn't know what was going on that made me unsure of who I was. My brain kept trying to give me a new name, but I kept rejecting it thinking that it was crazy that maybe I wasn't the person who owns this body and that I was just visiting, or that I didn't have a name to begin with and everyone just called me by the body's name.

This made me pretty insecure about myself. I've already got gaping holes in my memory, so I have no idea who I really am or what kind of person I am compared to back then. What if maybe I'm not the one who owns this body? What if I'm not who I thought I was, but a different person impersonating someone else. I was given this name and that's the only thing I knew, but for the first time in a while it didn't feel like mine.

It took me a few days, but now I'm back to normal and am no longer questioning my name or identity. Saying my name out loud didn't feel weird, and looking in the mirror wasn't so bad. I feel like I got through a difficult time, but made it out okay in the end. Granted, I still don't remember much of my past, but I'm glad the thing I do know of a certainty from it, my name, is intact. For the time being, anyway.

To note, I have not been formally diagnosed with any kind of dissociative disorder yet. My therapist says that it's just linked to anxiety, but my psychiatrist said that they were going to do further reading on dissociative disorders to see if any apply. I think. She didn't say that to me personally, but she wrote it down in my medical records, so we'll see what we find in the next few months.

This dissociative episode was noted in my log.

Thank you for reading."
I need some advice,1,l2ev7g,2,"Hi, this is my first reddit post. I mainly got on here because I knew there were people who would have experienced at least some of the things I've been experiencing. This post will be kinda long, fair warning. I've been doing some research about different forms of dissociation, and honestly, it feels like I have it all. Right now, I'm currently in a ""confused/scared"" phase. I hope someone can help me find out what's actually going on.

So as far as I can remember, I've felt weird. I was about 5 or 6, and didn't think much of it because I was just a kid. I felt sort of in a dream, or asleep. I'd be in the car and think, ""Is any of this real? Am I in a singular universe where God is testing me? All these people are here to test me?"" But I just shook it off and carried on. Now, school had always been a priority for me. I don't know why, it just has. And right around 5-6th grade, I experienced something WAY out of there. It was second semester of 5th grade, I has gotten accepted to a magnet school for middle school, I had just recently moved to get away from a bad situation, a family member had just passed, and I guess I just didn't really think about it. I'm not completely sure why I let things get to me when they've already passed, but I do. Anyway, I suddenly felt like I was above something, like instead of feeling ""rough"", I felt like I was higher than the people around me. It felt thin almost, and with school being a priority, I used this as a way to feel smart, like I was smarter than those around me. Also, I had constantly been picked on in elementary for various things and felt insecure, so this was probably a coping mechanism in disguise. Anyway, I decided that I didn't/couldn't fit in at a magnet school after attending two of them within the first six weeks, and settled for my local middle school, which was also in a different district then my elementary school, so the environment was still new. But this feeling happened in 5th grade, and I was still remembering who I was as a 5th grader, not as a whole. But then middle school arrived, I had this ""high"" complex, I was in the school I had gotten accepted to, and I was smacked in the face, mentally. Maybe it's because of the way my brain communicated with me in 5th grade, but as soon as 6th grade rolled by, I let this ""light"" feeling take over, and I was also having conflicting and intrusive thoughts. Thoughts about a great grandfather who had passed 6 years before, and I somehow morphed that into, ""I'm just now realizing he's gone."", but I remember that I was 6 years old when he died, so maybe this was my brain trying to wake me up? This is where I need somebody's help/opinion. Is because in 6th grade, I had all the thoughts that still plague my head, but I don't have the ""light"" feeling anymore and I desperately don't want to act like how I did. Instead, now, it just feels like I'm either just not there, dazed, or in a fantasy. I also believe I have Fantasy Prone Personality because since childhood, and throughout middle school, I was BIG on making myself the protagonist or love interest. I think this was used to make myself feel better about I situation I had no control over in reality/ didn't want to be there. But if anyone has ever felt what I've been feeling for the past 10-11 years, please reply. Thank you."
would you consider this dissociation?,3,l2bf5e,3,"Okay, Hi, I'm 13, male I was recommended this subreddit because a person thought what I was experiencing could be dissociation of some kind. here's what I said in the post  because I don't want to rewrite the whole thing and I do a good job describing what i went through

 ""  but I need to know this- I tried to get this answered so many times but I never did and i was thinking maybe this is a ND thing? So, I was venting to my friend on discord and I was extremely mentally stressed: i couldn't let out any of it like usual because my parents would hear me crying and question me- so i was reading somthing they said and then I kind of daydreamed for a bit and then I was like "" you're real "" In my head and then i completely forgot who i was for a split second and started being like "" No, Nooo! "" at realizing im living in this situation as I slowly remembered who I was- starting with basic things like my age and name it felt really slow but i was in a matter of a few seconds. I think at the time my brain felt tingly when this happened- after I fully remembered who I was I felt kinda slow and then afterwards I had some serious foggy brain and felt super tired and after the brain fog and feeling slow it hurt but I wasnt as stressed anymore. The only way I can describe this is my brain manually restarting like a computer so I don't have a heart attack or something. "" 

 Does anyone know anything about this or what this could be if it's not dissocation? Please answer this asap because It's been really stressing out for a good portion of my life because I never got answers and always felt weird about it.  Can any of you guys relate to this?"
head shaking during dissociation,1,l2amgd,0,"So i have dissociation and derealization problems and i've noticed whenever i see this certain type of image (the image type is like think of nostalgia core but with those black shaky marks like a photos been ruined, maybe a blacked out figure and some random eyes with no face) my head start to shake, well, better word is tremble and it triggers me. could this be linked to my dissociation?"
Treatment for dissociation that doesn't involve IFS?,1,l2abe5,2,"I've been diagnosed with OSDD and am experiencing a lot of detrimental dissociation. I spend so much time out of it that I'm finding it hard to function and achieve my goals.

However, I've previously had horrible experiences with internal family systems. Basically thinking myself as a system, ""listening to my parts"" and having compassion for ""them"" was basically what cause this dissociation to run rampant in the first place. It basically increased my dissociation and I lost weeks-months of my time just ""out of it"" and getting nothing done. I It only made the anxieties, sleepiness, forgetfulness stronger. So I've decided to stay far away.

Does anyone know of any methods that don't involve IFS?"
Talking to the core,16,l1zbfg,4,"I had some internal communiations with insiders and what I revealed was there is heavy trauma going inside and I don't even feel it.I am so sad that I can't feel my own feelings.That I vant care for my core parts.that I cent even hug them,The front is not at all aware of what's happening inside like when I stay at home and respect only then I understand what's actually happening.while I am trying so hard to beat the help out of my enemies in the outside world the core part is crying inside and saying ""don't do that"".it was so afraid that it knows how a situation become dangerous and how to avoid them .I don't know but there is a large compartmentalization between my own selves"
Dissociation and Insomnia,13,l1w9kd,3,"Anybody else with insomnia who's dissociation worsen things?

What is the longest dissociative episode you've experienced?,10,l0spo1,10,"Hi everyone.  Im new to this sub but not new to dissociation.  I think I've had a very severe bout of dissocation thats basically lasted half a year.  Everything went away, it felt like my personality was erased and the world wasn't real anymore and so aren't any of the people in it.  I think I'm starting to come out of it but after all thats happened, after having every single part of me change and things that once felt second nature and very familiar to me feel distant and unfamiliar... I dont know I'm having trouble even believing myself when I feel like I've had a connection again.  I have trouble letting go of the trauma.  


Have any of you experiencing something like this after a very long lasting dissociative episode?  If you have, did familiarity ever come back completely and you get back into flow again?  How long was your longest episode?    


Thanks for responding those of you that do.  It helps me a lot to hear from people who have experienced this."
Derealization/depersonalization disorder is ruining my life,41,l0sjfg,16,"Hi. I would just like to vent or maybe seek some advice from people who are dealing with this because I'm going through a really rough patch in my mental health and I don't know if I can carry on like this.
I've been having pretty severe episodes of dpdr for the last 4-5 months following a really bad experience with cannabis edinles. It seems as from that time it just keeps getting worse and worse. I do get a few weeks where I barely have any symptoms to days where I cannot get out of bed.
I really want to talk about my symptoms, maybe someone can relate and reassure me because i feel so alone in this. These days I've been getting bouts of  extreme derealization and dissociation which leads me to have extreme panic attacks (I have a panic disorder). During them I completely lose my sense of self, can't even feel my body, everything and everyone feels flat and unreal. But the worst of it is always feeling like nothing really exists and never actually existed, including the world around me and myself. My memories feel fake, detached and I just keep having an intense fear that everything will just disappear or that I'm stuck feeling like this until the day I die. That's why I'm feeling so suicidal because the only escape from feeling like this is sleeping for hours on end during the day. I feel so alone in this. I don't know what to do, I am going to therapy, but everything feels so unreal that it becomes hard to tell that it's helping or not."
Dead Names,8,l0i947,2,"I have been seeing my dead name so much recently and it‚Äôs sending me into loops. 

Someone on reddit with the name followed me, there‚Äôs people in the news with the same name. Hell, I was invited to a subreddit who‚Äôs About Me page seemed like it was written by my BIO mom whom I haven‚Äôt talked to in years. 

It sends me on these Truman Show loops, like who is trying to get my attention and why. Why the dead name. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just more popular now but it‚Äôs become too consistent within recent days. 

The name reminds me of the times before I had myself. I feel lost when reminded of what and who I was. So detached. But accepting and understanding of everything that has led up to this. 

So, who‚Äôs trying to reach me."
I'm scared Please help,1,l0dq1t,5,Is having a terrible headache normal almost every night? Do I have a brain tumor?
Is this dissociation? advice please,1,l0cosh,3,"Hello all! So Im not sure if the symptoms I've experienced on and off are dissociation. My therapist hasn't really given me an answer and she just says its ""brain fog"" induced by anxiety. I have severe generalized anxiety and health anxiety, im not sure if its important. Im gonna try to vocalize how I feel and then will someone let me know if they think this is dissociation or just something else please? I like to understand and know what Im feeling that's why im asking.

So on and off for years, usually when Im under extreme stress I feel like I'm high...like I've smoked weed and I feel detached and just not really in reality. Sometimes I feel like I don't even look like myself and its very strange. I feel just like high... and detached from the world around me. When I've had this it lasts for like a month or two and the subsides. I feel spacey and sometimes things don't look real, like I'll be outside and something just seems off about how the world looks. There's just something off about how the world looks, I don't know how to explain it but its off. It's a lack of focus and like a weird quiet in my brain. Sometimes my vision is involved and it feels like shaky. 

From everyone's own experiences does this sound like dissociation or anxiety induced dissociation? I'm really not sure and im not getting answers from a professional."
Does anyone else experience this?,2,l086iz,1,"I'll get to the point - does anyone else start to dissociate (or at the very least feel like they're about to) whenever they hear fan theories for any media along the lines of ""It was all a dream"" or ""The whole story was just the characters playing pretend""? Even if it's just people talking about fictional characters it makes me feel like it's applying to my life too, which is kind of ridiculous. I dunno, does this happen to anyone else?"
Dissociating a lot suddenly?,1,l0711e,2,"Hey everyone. I‚Äôve had episodes of dissociation before in the past, but normally it‚Äôs only been for a little bit every so often.

Can menstruation worsen dissociation/depersonalization?,11,l03x8x,7,"Hi, I've been dealing with dpdr for about 3 months now and I've noticed that it really worsens before, after or during menstruation. I've had some mental health problems worsen during PMS before I developed really bad dpdr. So I'm wondering, does anyone else experience this? Every month it's like it gets somewhat better during the middle of my cycle and then suddenly gets worse during my period again."
First time in a while,5,kzz24f,1,"Last night starting at around 7:30pm I did nothing but stare at the ceiling in bed until I fell asleep at around 4am, and even then I kept waking up. I did get some sleep before that time thankfully, maybe a couple hours broken up between 8 and midnight, I don‚Äôt really know, but for the most part it was just staring, not doing or thinking of anything at all. Time went by so quickly I hardly noticed when midnight became 3am, I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt shake myself out of it. It hasn‚Äôt gotten this bad in so long I almost forgot it‚Äôs something that can happen, feeling completely separate from my body. I didn‚Äôt eat all day because I couldn‚Äôt even connect to that hungry feeling even though I knew I had to be starving. I forgot how much I hate this feeling, or lack of feeling.

Still feeling a little off but I‚Äôm writing this to just remind myself that this is still something I deal with sometimes and to remind myself to try my best not to let myself get past the point of no return, because once I lay down when I feel this way I just can‚Äôt get back up. I feel so pathetic and so stupid and so sad at myself but I just want today to be better. I have to just be better."
How do I know if I‚Äôve processed an emotionally stressful event or I‚Äôm just dissociated from it?,21,kzx5xi,10,"I‚Äôve had dissociation for years, made worse my a medication I take. I feel more dissociated this year than I did this time last year. Something quite distressing happened last year in July, it induced a lot of feelings of shame and rejection, (and the incident layered on previous flashbacks). I felt myself dissociating while all those horrible emotions were coming up. I feel less able to cry now, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because this incident increased my dissociation or I‚Äôm less able to cry because I‚Äôve processed more emotions."
A funny story about disociation to lighten your mood,12,kzsl48,1,"Driving really triggers my disociation, like many people I've read about in this subreddit. I suppose it's inherently a stressor? Even if you've been driving for years? Anyway, I get this double vision when looking at this old lady on the side path but there's something wrong with the disociation because each illusion is wearing slightly different clothes. And that's when I realised they were twins! I've never seen identical twins in older people before! Same hair cut, same clothes, just different colours. So trippy üòÇ So that's my somewhat funny story to lighten the mood of this subreddit! Have you had a not-disociation moment that cracked you up?"

My reflection is creeping me out again too, it feels like a seperate person

Im reliving what happend a few months ago, slowely getting worse before i fade away all over again. I dont want to slip away but it just feels so confortable

Night in the Woods and Dissociation,3,kzdswa,0,
How do I form a cohesive sense of self with a cohesive life timeline?,33,kzajaj,16,"This weekend I have written in my journal a summary of my life so far. I have just finished writing it and I'm crying and feel empty and hollow and I don't know why.

One thing I am finding upsetting is how disjointed my view of my life is. I feel like my life is in distinct chapters e.g. Primary School, Secondary School, University. As soon as I leave one chapter it's like I completely forget about it and I lose contact with everyone from that chapter. I feel so much grief and sadness at all the wonderful friends I just didn't stay in contact with. Right now I have no friends for the first time in my life as all my old friendships have faded away and I can't make new friends due to lockdown and working from home. Some of those friendships were intense ""best friends but more like sisters"" friendships, I don't understand how I can not have spoken to them again, I just let myself drift away from them.

My chapters are so inconsistent. I went from loud and sociable surrounded by loads of friends who didn't care about school work and would get bad grades to a science ""geek"", top of my university cohort with no friends in the space of a few years. 

My memory is so bad because of this issue where I just disregard the previous chapter. I struggled to remember the names of some of my friends at university even though I graduated just one year ago.

Does anyone have any advice?"
Confused,14,kz3awb,4,"I'm honestly not sure if what I've been feeling is dissociation or not. It's like, I feel very detached from my surroundings but also very hyper aware of my surroundings at the same time? like I can feel myself very subconsciencly aware of what's happening around me but like, I can't process it. everything feels likes it's playing in the background."

Switching and Smoking,4,kygl9u,2,"Yoooo 

So, I deal w BPD daily. Some trauma in the last couple years keeps me on the edge of disassociation and derealization. 

The people around me don‚Äôt help much. Not in the ‚Äúit‚Äôs your responsibility‚Äù way, that‚Äôs literally asking too much. But dude, not even in like a friend way. I‚Äôm just losing hope in the people around me & that‚Äôs not the way I want to make me ‚Äústronger‚Äù or whatever. 

I need a legit friend, dude. I literally just need to vent and be validated that I‚Äôm not fucking crazy. I know I‚Äôm not, but I haven‚Äôt had literally anyone to tell me otherwise. Just different bits of me trying to hold eachother together. 

It‚Äôs all petty little bs, but it can all add up and feel so damning. I just wanna smoke and dissociate freely and talk outloud about all the shit. 

So basically, I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs like a space for smoke sessions and mental instability? Lol  or should I just start a channel on Twitch or something? Is that even something that would help other people just by watching and having daily talks about? I know the outloud, unplanned talks help me work thru my shit. Maybe seeing that will help someone else? Idk man"
The glaze over your eyes,9,kyg39g,7,"Has anyone ever tried (when dissociating) looking at the glaze over your eyes? Try not to focus on the world around you, but look at the actual glaze, its almost like a vr headset, a hallucination. When you shut your eyes, youll see some sort of static changing colours and flashing. Try opening your eyes, and then looking at it. Completely changes your perception."

Or today, I had a feeling that I was in a car crash (I was not) and that I was dead imagining the world.

Started working out Trauma using workbook,2,kxxawp,2,I feel many parts of me arouse from darkness after a long time.it felt like I just entered a room and called out for names based on my knowledge and slowly gradually I was able to hear responses in the form of feelings and emotions and perceptions.I engaged in the process and supported my parts to communicate and I felt my creativity was flowing so that I understand how the organizAtion works.It was great to feel back home after a long time of adult life hurdle.I was in a very stressfull period in external sphere which greatly effects my mental health.And now i get back to the roots and promised every part everything is allrigbt and I care for the inner child or parts.I know I deny them and I sometimes hate them but I affirmed them I love them the most ...that have me some good boost.
Dissociation at school ?,5,kxwr5p,2,"Does anyone else dissociate at school, it's more of a derealization I think. I feel detached and non existent, I don't feel anything at all. I'm able to mildly concentrate. Sometimes I have anxiety attacks, I have no friends at school and this is my trigger for dissociating. I am really shy and have been diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder, the more people around me talk and have fun the more I disapear. Does anyone else know what helps, I'm writing this while feeling foggy and gone. I'm studying art by the way.

I don't know what happened to me at school before but I was ignored for most of my life, at school too. I don't know if I have any other traumas because I can't remember my past very well. 

Thanks for being able to share on this forum, it makes me feel better and more visible. 

And my head hurts less, does anyone else mildly hallucinate during dissociation, like a black paint spot on the wall can move and almost look like a bug. I've had this symptom for a year now. "
Sometimes I forget who and where I am,44,kxs3yh,15,"For example, I was watching TV with my dad.

DAE experience dissociation happening totally unannounced and unexpected?,3,kxog1h,1,"I‚Äôm not sure exactly why this happens. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because my body is so accustomed to dealing with life this way or what, but a lot of the time it seems totally unprompted.

Dating with severe/chronic depersonalisation and dissociation (TRIGGER WARNING),15,kxkfyx,0,"Hey guys. It's been a while.

My doctor recent advised me that be believed the cure to my ailments would be to get laid ('Do you have sex? Do it. It's good for you?.) I smiled and nodded, realized he meant well but knowing little of my story. (I'm no doctor, but I am not aware that intercourse cures CPTDS and DDNOS, but by this point I am open to new ideas 

My first memory ever is being molested. I was coerced into giving this guy a blowjob - nuts and all. He said I did a good job. Guess he must've been 17. He was a juvenile criminal placed at the halfway house my dad worked at. I must have been around age 2. I didn't remember this until a flashback at age 17 after a near-fatal car crash, but I digress.

I don't remember much. It's all flashback and rarely accessible currently, but I remember the smell. That smell of genitals and excitement, which I guess you would call 'the smell of sex'. It's always there. Rather obviously, bodily encounters are rare, and never really at the front of my mind.

Lets move to the more 'romantic' aspect - say dating. Where you get to know each other, flirt, maybe hold hands etc. I will admit, that from the outside it looks terrible easy. 

However, each time I try, every single layer of protection embedded in me somehow takes over, and I am unable for a second to genuinly feel intimaticy. Whevever something resembles, I either fade away or blatantly self-obstruc to eliminate the situation. As you might imagine this bring some problems to the dating department. Probably doesn't help that I'm quite literal and have a hard time decoding body language directed at me, which is really rather stressfull.

When I get a potential female (I'm one of the boring, shameful heteronormative cis-fellows (hope I get that right)) for my self, it feel's as if there's a chasm apart us. I read once that flirting is a continuous serious of question - verbal or not - where the ansnwer is always maybe. I'll admit it sounds romantic and all, and I've seen some James Bond, so I get the general idea, but it's like there's something missing - a void you can't cross. You can easily see what's happening, and part of you know what's expected, but somehow you're somehow unable to reach out and cross that barrier to the world. or Life, if one was a poet.

I'm not sure what my point is here, but it might be twofold. Do any of you ever experience this - not akwardness, but rather distance, between yourself and new partners, and (this one might be for the ladies, and is not intended to offend of stir emoting. I ask as a scholar and a gentleman to understand the mechanics involved in dating/mating.) 

If you, as a woman was approaced by a potential partner, whom showed interest in you, and with whom you share chemistry, but you didn't immediately get a sexual vibe, would you write him off immediately?  Not sure this is a dissociative question per se, but I suffer severe dissociation and I'm the one asking #lawyered"
Wearing earbuds the last few days sometimes makes me feel floaty and disoriented,3,kxk29a,1,"Hi there!

So as a background I have GAD, Adhd, and possibly ASD. I have my fair share of experience with different kinds of dissociation (maladaptive daydreaming, feeling like im not in my body and poor memory of childhood because of dissociating) So, my brain has a lot of issues with sensory input. Often I get overwhelmed when there is particularly loud or too many noises around me. This morning I am just at home, sat in the lounge room and I can hear my mum talking on the phone and the person she is talking with, my brother playing videos and commenting, my cats being cats and then various background noise. Brain isn't liking it so I put my earbuds in (galaxy buds+ for reference) they dont entirely cut out all noise but they cut out most background noise if its not right next to me and dampen all the talking a lot.

As soon as I put them in I feel a weird disconnect like I'm no longer in my body or in the real world anymore and its very confusing. Almost like I'm in another plane or like, in the spirit world from Avatar lmao. Then that bleeds into visually looking at my body it doesnt feel like mine, it's doing what I want it to but it's not mine. This started happening maybe two days ago. I take the earbuds out and I can hear all the subtle noises like the fan and my body slightly adjusting and I become grounded again. Turning on ambient mode (where the microphones input outside noises) makes it worse. It's less disorienting when i'm in my bedroom perhaps because it's my safe space and there is less noise to begin with so it isn't as jarring. It doesn't last all day just comes and goes. It's not as bad when I'm occupied by doing something with my hands and watching or listening to something. I'm not incredibly distressed by it and I'm hoping it wont stick around for long, honestly I'm just intrigued by it at this point. 

I've looked around on old google to no results so has anyone else had any similar experiences?"
Slept for almost 24 hours straight?,4,kxgmpa,3,"Yesterday, I was up very late, then slept for a few hours before having an appointment with my therapist in the morning, where I talked about my dissociative episodes for the first time. It went well, though it was a lot to process and get out, and then a couple hours after, I became extremely tired, and I slept for nearly 24 hours straight. Like, I've been depressed and just lazed in bed for long periods of time before, but this was literally deep sleep for a 24 hour period with just a two hour break during it.

Does this happen to anyone else? Confronting my dissociative episodes and having a trusted professional tell me I may have DPDR at ""best"" and DID at ""worst"" has just been a _lot_ to process, and I think it just took a lot out of me.

EDIT: I noticed that putting quotes around ""best"" and ""worst"" make it look like a direct quote from my therapist, which makes her look bad because that's kind of dumb thing to say to a patient. Those weren't her words, she did mention DPDR and DID, but I'm the one who put value judgements on them here."
anyone else have feelings of pressure in your neck/head before/during dissociation?,3,kxf5en,4,"hey everyone! i was just curious bc, while im no stranger to dissociation, ive noticed that the last few times ive dissociated, the pressure in my head always feels off?? idk how to describe it really, its kinda like being underwater but only from the neck up? or that feeling when blood rushes to your head when you are upside down for too long? im pretty sure its psychological and not a physical ailment because it's always accompanied by ""normal"" dissociative characteristics, and it goes away once i start feeling more present/calm/that overall coming down back into your body sensation. really curious to see if any of you guys have experienced something similar! thanks n sending peace n love your way!! <333"
I'm having some clarity at the moment,2,kxf05q,0,"And holy shit, I just realised I made a new friend this week. 

I had the sudden realization that the relationship could last as long as I live (very unlikely, but still vaguely possible), and that terrifies me. I don't think I've had the ability to think clearly about the future for a long time, and so this is all so strange. I'm not even sure where to start haha. 

If I'm being honest, I kinda want to go back to being unable to think about tomorrow again. This is too much pressure. My wish will probably be granted soon again anyways.

not sure what this is,10,kxcdyu,5,"Hi I am 16f and after a very bad high on 10-1-20 (I have been 100% sober since), I have changed and I don't know quite what it is. I feel like everything around me is planned in some way and that I am dissociating. I often go into states where it feels like my thoughts aren't my own and people are listening in on them, almost like my brain is a wire cage. I also have been hyper aware of everything in my life and how there are just too many coincidences. For example I will do something or say something and the exact same thing will present itself in a video or action sometimes almost instantly. Like when this guy that I have liked for a while that I never see because we have none of the same friends randomly comes to the beach Im at and we talk and he tells me he's an electrician and when I go home an hour later, my parents are watching a documentary about electricity, and they never watch documentaries. Thats just the most recent example but these have been occurring multiple times a day from ranging severity and Im to the point where I can't seem to think of things as coincidental anymore. Everything just seems too connected and I don't feel emotionally connected to anything or anyone anymore because none of it seems realign my head. I just don't know what this is and no one around me takes any of my concerns seriously"
Sertraline for dpdr questions,13,kwu6ux,9,"Hi, i'm a 19 year old experiencing derealisation which was the result of a weed induced panic attack a couple of years ago.. I have been in this state for 2 years and my therapist and psychiatrist think that I should go on sertraline, starting at 25mg and tapering up over a few months, prescribed for anxiety. I'm very conflicted on doing this. On one hand, these professionals I've spoken to seem confident that it would have a positive effect on my anxiety, and thusly my derealisation, and I've been told that unless there were any hiccups they were wanting to have me off it after 6 months. on the other hand I'm very nervous about taking any kind of meds, especially ssris, for a number of reasons. I am aware that they can have pretty severe side effects, some of which mimic the exact problems I am trying to fix, ie the emotional numbness I deal with from the dissociation. I've also heard some people online say that ssris caused either emotional numbness or murdered their sexuality which is obviously the opposite of what I want. I have a few questions for anyone with experience of sertraline and especially taking it with derealisation.

how bad do the side effects get? I've heard that you can get pretty severe physical effects as well as bad emotional ones, so was wondering how bad being on sertraline actually is, are they horrible and life ruining or just annoying?

what is the experience of being on sertraline like generally?

is there any significant risk of side effects lasting after stopping taking the medication?

does anyone have experience taking sertraline with derealisation (particularly when caused by anxiety) and what was your experience, do you think that it has a significant potential to help

sorry if this post is not allowed, feel free to remove it. If anyone has experiences with ssris other than sertraline that might be useful too :)"

Lot more present bowadays,2,kwa4iz,0,I was able to find dissociation is reduced when I started to practise how to be present.I started to find anchors around me to fixate so that I can remind m mind I am not lost or I am not emptiness.that i exist.That's why I was able to feel this.The brain's way of shutting down consiousness has largely affected my capacity to concentrate on small things without conflict.if I want to concentrate I want to switch between disocciative states.There was no communication inside.but now i am trying to connect the dots.

Some times its just some of my body parts, like I dont recognise my hands or voice, and feel they should be different like my hands should be bigger and my voice deeper. Some times I even freak out to see myself so weird and alien like. 

Also I tend to feel like life its a dream or simple not real, even if I know it is real. I usually feel like I dont belong to my enviroment, like there is some fog or something between me and the rest of the world, everything looks so distant and plain, like some painting.

I dont have a good grip on time, it just past so slow or so fast some times, some memories look so distant were they happend recently or some look so close but I dont know When they happend.
My memories looks so hasty and fuzzy, like I know it happend to me because is in my head but otherwise I would think it is a movie. It is so bad that I dont longer know the difference between remembering something and just knowing the fact that it happend.

First ever truly noticeable Dissociative episode,4,kubh7d,0,"I (15nb) struggled with some pretty mild symptoms up until today or at least I first labeled this today. There was a period of time when I entered my room and felt as if I was intruding and nothing felt as it should. I looked in the mirror and felt like I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in this body and that none of the stuff around me belonged to me. I physically avoided touching and moving stuff to not move and change what I felt wasn‚Äôt mine. There was a small part of me that was connected but about 85% of me was disconnected. I even felt as if it was a Wednesday instead of a Saturday. I managed to talk with a friend and try to explain how I felt and they helped me regain myself. But that experience was very different and new. It felt similar to paranoia except instead of fear it was more being uncomfortable with where I was and who I was. 

I just wanted to share this experience because from what I can remember this is a pretty new feeling. Feel free to comment or add whatever."
"One of ""my"" personalities wants to kill us.",2,ku8sfz,4,"I could use some advice.

**Small introduction:**

For as long as I remember, I have been consciously dealing with dissociation. Not DID but a variation where different sides to me are not integrated at all and reason in their own distinct ways. Time and existence play a bizarre role in my daily thoughts and I partially tap out out of consciousness in certain situations. I've always had a very hard time feeling things and being able to acknowledge things like physical sensations, emotions and intuition. I am capable of feeling every emotion, but I have this weird total control over it which makes it impossible for me to have any spontaneity behind my emotions. I basically choose what I feel and how I act, and I can completely turn it all around just arbitrarily from one moment to the next.

**Situation:**

I'm in my mid twenties, live alone and I feel very lonely. Not that I don't have enough social interaction, I've got great friends and I love my job, but when I get home it's just me. I've been in a few relationships but those girls felt that thing that's ""missing"" in my case. (The spontaneous bond/organic development of a relationship.) Aside from that I can't have an orgasm during sex altough there's nothing wrong physically... I didn't mind in the past but I recently realised that this is of course another symptom of this missing element of connection.

Without going into detail about the pieces of my fragmented personality, there's this one of two main ""sides"" to me that wants to stop existing. Not focussing on killing myself (although that would of course be necessary) but really wanting to decide about whether this consciousness should be or not. Feeling trapped as I would hurt many people by committing to that idea... For a long time, this one was my biggest threat that was more of an existential metaphysical way of thinking and not impulsive at all... But an ugly ""minor"" side got more prevalent recently.

**The problem:**

As a kid I've mainly been emotionally abused by my family and heavily bullied. Today I'm not an unattractive guy, I'm also very social and intelligent (IQ over 130, speaking multiple languages and proficient in a few scientific and artistic fields) but the scars from my childhood are still there, and they've heavily affected one side to me that's starting to manifest more often.

I take zoloft daily since abouth half a year now and it works great. However, whenever I forget to take it for a day, when I sleep way too little or get triggered by things related to the abuse/lonelyness in my childhood, this smaller side can come up and it's growing in importance and frequence. This side things I'm worthless, wants to stay alone because everything will fail and hurt me, and most importantly, it wants to kill me. Like practically planning it and reasoning about it. (The way of reasoning differs immensely between these ""sides"".)

When I'm in that state, I of course wonder if I should stop taking the meds and also starve myself. I'll want to end relationships with people to have peace of mind and think about hurting myself very violently all day long.

I have no clue how to go about this. I don't want to be committed to a psych ward cause that would definitely mean the end. For now I'm able to always come back from that dangerous state because I'll always realise I have to take the meds and that it's unnatural for a being to kill itself... but I feel like this grasp is getting weaker and weaker.   


Last week I drew out a play at the office, on how to successfully commit suicide using a bag around my head, asked on here how to stick a needle straight through the palm of my hand, asking on here if I should make my body disappear or be found for the closure of my loved ones, and even thought of a new way of killing myself by making myself bleed out using wide injection-needles. This went away again about two days ago and I think I can hold it off for relatively long since I can heavily influence the chances of it coming back by pausing  relationships with certain friends (although loneliness isn't great either). The thing is that I strongly suspect that when it comes back, it'll keep getting more and more severe.

**What should I do? Any tips? When does one decide that things are getting dangerous?**

(I only got diagnosed a few months back and will get to have my first appointment with a specialised psychatrist in two weeks.)

Thanks a lot.

PS: it might not be apparent from my post but I do appreciate some humour, even in the darkest situations \^\^"
Better understanding,2,ku7tr5,2,"I am in need of some advice/information.
Is one able to ""dissociate"" in a present moment. 
Example: 
'CJ is on the phone with MJ. While on the phone with MJ he is (at the same time) sending MJ threatening text messages under an alias. CJ will later explain this behavior as dissociative. CJ does not remember sending those messages to MJ'.

In this scenario, is CJs explanation of his behavior plasable?

Thank you."
"Wife having weird feelings that she couldn't describe to me, then she googled them",32,ku625m,8,"This is a really long story that I'm going to try to make brief:

My wife(37) has a brain tumor in her cerebellum, and has been fighting with it for 3 years. It started out as a low-grade benign (Grade 1), that was resected, but then it came back much more aggressively.

She had a second surgery that removed a large amount of her right cerebellum, 3 weeks of radiation. Suffered from hydrocephalus that led to a 3rd surgery to install a VP shunt. Been loaded with dexamethasone for the better part of 6 months. We then started a promising new drug that she's been taking for a month. She was basically told that if the drug works, great, but if it doesn't work the tumor would likely return in 4 - 5 months.

Well good news! Her last scan showed that the drug was working with flying colors, and is stopping the tumor in it's tracks. If it work, she can technically take the drug for the rest of her life, there is no toxicity like you'd see with other cytotoxic chemos.

For several weeks she's been complaining more about her mental symptoms then her physical symptoms. She's been through a lot, but she's never shown externally to be in any kind of emotional distress. I downplayed it for a while, telling her ""You're doing great, your symptoms are subsidding, your balance is back, you aren't so dizzy anymore.""

They have a counselor associated with the cancer practice, but she didn't really get along with her.

But even after the good scan, she mentioned that it seemed like there were 2 different universes. The one she is in, and the one that our daughter and I live in. She says that she is aware of what is going on, but doesn't feel like she's part of it. Physically, she is improving. But she is getting increasingly frustrated. She says she feels like her body and mind aren't connected. Like she's controlling a robot.

Her oncologist put her on zoloft. After taking the zoloft she had severe panic and anxiety attacks, uncharacteristic of her. They discontinued the Zoloft promptly and put her on  clonazepam. It helps with the anxiety, but her feelings of detachment are still there.

Today she was googling, and sent me a link to ""derealization"", and said ""That's it! That's me there""

This seemed like the place to ask for some advice.

This post really simplifies things, but it's hard to tell everything without writing a book on here."
Feeling odd physical sensations when dissociating intensely,20,kty3ph,3,"Today I woke up very late, which is something that makes my dissociation a lot worse. I couldn't feel myself physically being, and my vision felt foggy and objects around me felt unreal. But the weirdest bit was that there was tingling on the bridge of my nose, as if my glasses were there, but they weren't. I sometimes get the same feeling on the side of my head, like the glasses are compressing on my face, but they arent there. I've only started getting this feeling since I starting wearing glasses to help with blue light headaches. (And it becomes less noticeable/goes away when I put the glasses on.) Is this normal with dissociation, or should I be concerned?"
Cannabis use and DPDR,17,ktrdu8,16,"Background: I (20F) have been struggling with feelings of lack of presence my whole life, but in particular since I was 10 years old, when now I know a state of omnipresent derealization set in.

Through a combination of a lot of therapy work, getting myself into a healthier home environment, and I believe cannabis use, I‚Äôve started to come out of this derealization. I can‚Äôt express how crazy, amazing, and horrifying this has been (I hadn‚Äôt even heard about DPDR until late October).

From my understanding though, cannabis is thought to be a potential cause of DPDR. This has definitely been the opposite experience for me though, and the pattern of my emergence from this dissociative state really closely corresponds with a low and healthy usage.

Anyone have any thoughts on this or experience? This continues to be a wild ride and I‚Äôd love to hear some perspectives."

It hurt.
 During the first months, I was so affraid that It will be like that for a long time... Then, 1 year passed. I got more affraid...
I keep asking myself ""How much time will it last again?""
And now it's been 2 years...
It seem it will never end, or it will take some more years...
But I can't, It's not a life ...

And I don't have the time to heal

People still except from me to work, gain money, I have to pay stuff to survive and not be in street... But I can't. I'm not even able to work.
I did
During ten months I got a job ! I was happy... It was hard but Atleast I was having money to pay my roof... I endured everything... All the morning it was so hard to get out to the point I would trow up to have atleast one more day off... All the stress from my boss... Enduring the dissociation during the whole day while working...

I'm bad to exactly say how I feel, to really explain my pain...
But after these 10months, I exploded... I cried I cried, begging myself to not go, hurting myself, thinking to stop all that for good... But then I waked up my partner, asked him ""please take me to the hospital, or I will do something crazy""
Never came back to my job, just told them it was too much for me and that I was at the hospital...

I don't have a job anymore since some months...
I get a little money from the governement, but it will end soon...
Idk what I'm gonna do.
Idk what I can do.

What to do..,1,ksdjvf,0,"I have dissociation for the past years. Can't really recall how long it has been haha. I also have some episodes of derealisation between them. As I do now. 

To prevent my dissociation from getting worse I try to walk outside when I'm not totally out of it. And this seems to be working normally :) but this past weeks outside seems to be strange.. unreal.. like I'm not even experiencing it. And it makes me anxious. I think its because I've been inside a lot the past few months due to 2 heavy operations. 

But now I'm like to scared to get outside. Cause a few days ago the derealisation or the dissociation ( not sure) outside made me real scared. Cause nothing of the elements that seem to get me out of this feeling seem to help with that feelings. I mean like that I was fake and the world was fake and that everything outside seems to be like a video game..

So now I dont know whats the best decision to make.. I am kinda dissociated.. and other sensory thing don't seem to help me with this..  but im also scared to go outside. I dont want to have this confusion again.
Should I wait untill tommorow to discuss it with my therapist.. or just don't be so goddamn scared and just try to go outside where I might get in that state..

Alcohol induced dissociation,3,ks4awr,1,"I don‚Äôt know if this is just exclusive to me or not but after years of alcohol abuse I now get this severe dissociative feeling that is indescribable with my anxiety problem. My theory is that the alcohol effected my anxiety disorder in the long run. I believe this because your brains natural defense mechanism towards overwhelming anxiety is to dissociate I would often use alcohol to escape my anxiety but over years of abuse I started getting more anxious than I was before I even started drinking. after the long binges I would indulge myself in, I would be very anxious after I abruptly quit drinking. I also realized when I was under the influence of alcohol any dissociative feelings I possessed would be takin away because of the anxiety relieving qualities alcohol has due to its gaba antagonism."
Whenever I think about my last relationship I get a strong feeling like ‚ÄúI was a part of that?‚Äù,18,ks22ve,8,"Even down to the kind of person I was back then. The things I did then and even before then. I know they happened, but I don‚Äôt FEEL they happened if that makes sense."
Smoking makes me so dissiciative,1,ks1q89,0,"I don't know why but smoking acts as trigger to my dissociation and during smoking I don't have any Idea about the decisions I make I am easily manipulative and I can do anything that anyone says.Like if someone says I must go to anothe country with them so that  I will become rich I may go with them.because that much manipulative I am and also detached from reality during those time
And after when I came back to my senses after stopping smoking I feel so strange that everything appears so different unreal and I may think who is that person who did all 'this'? I definitely think smoking splits me into parts and dissociation makes me have no idea about this.I am ruminating all the time and during smoking I am unaware of this rumination like I don't know passage of time.I don't know anything at all.Stopping smoking gives me a sense of awareness about my own dissociation ."
"i had a ""dream"" that felt so real and now i feel like im dreaming and in the wrong reality",39,krzmou,15,"TLDR: as title states, i have had a dream that felt real, now i dont feel like this world is real. 

&#x200B;

ok hi im scared and feel weird. im sorry if this is jumbled or if it doesnt fit the sub. but i am suffering from bad derealization after this incident. also i apologize for how long it is, its about a dream so you know how that goes. 

&#x200B;

i had a dream today that felt like real life, sometimes i know im dreaming and i can wake myself up but this just felt like i was awake. my friends were there, until i walked out of the room and came back and they were gone. 2 people were there that i didnt know. i was like, ""oh i know what youre doing, youre going to kill me."" and the other guy said, ""oh youre so smart."" i felt dizzy and like a string or rope was being tied around my neck and i felt like i was dying. not in pain, but everything went black and i felt paralyzed (like in sleep paralysis where you feel heavy and want to move, but cant). and my only thought was, ""wow i am really dying this time, this is what death is. i wonder if there's an afterlife."" 

&#x200B;

then i ""woke up"" into another dream where i was sitting on my couch, and it turns out the ""dream"" i was having was just a video on my phone????? and i was like. weird i must have been really immersed and i got up to get dressed. but then i had the thought that it was a trick and the guy kept me alive instead and killed the other person there with us. so i knew i had to get addressed and leave. there were baby lizards on the floor (there were several baby lizards or geckos living in my house when i first moved in irl), that guided me a room in my house but no one was in there. i picked up a pair of pants that had a mouse in it and threw the mouse across the room because i got scared. then i just put the pants on as normal and went to open my door (mind you, this all felt completely real and like this was just my life). then i heard a voice say something along the lines of ""what are you doing?"" and it scared me so bad i woke up in real life this time and i swore i heard the voice irl. after that i cried and called my friend to ask her if i was in real life and she said yes, and laughed bc it happens to her (i knew she was the right one to call) and that made me feel better. 

&#x200B;

but after that i just felt weird and off all day and slept a lot (no more dreams like this). im up now and feel like there's always something behind me. i think the gist here is im mentally ill and im having really bad derealizastion in that im afraid im still in a fake reality and i feel detached. i there's also another whole problem that isnt directly related to this about my mom, but i wont talk about it here for length's sake. if you want to hear about it lmk. also if you finished this all, thank you so much i know how boring it can be to read people's dreams."
Sex urges acts as dissociative triggers,5,krn7hq,6,I don't know if someone relate but I dissociate a lot during day time and night time thinking about sex in my mind.Like I go there completely detached from what's happening around me and then stay there like a alternate place of reality.the character there ar3 probably my crushes in college and what distinguishes this from fantasy is I cant easily get out of it.It's like mind is in an autopilot mode a cannot do anything.rather than watch my mind dwell I this place and then become depressed and depressed.I feel so sad for my present state as i know that a heartbreak acted as a fuel to this dissociation.And I feel so hopeless as after working a lot in my dissociation still I am having parts of minds I don't have any Idea about.
Does dissociation prevent you from forming & maintaining relationships ?,22,krmo5s,10,"^ Not even referring to romantic in nature but even just potential friendships - any possible bond in whatever form of relationship that may be. 

Sometimes when in the moment of socializing/‚Äòbonding‚Äô with someone it‚Äôs nice and all..

But afterwards you get the feeling of .. 
‚Äú that was me who was talking to them ? ‚Äú
And a slight guilt and/or wonder of,  
well, if we never talk again ... would I feel any type of way at all ? Not even hurt because I don‚Äôt even feel like i interacted with said person ..I mean, I last talked to them a week ago... to me that‚Äôs what I already consider a lifetime ago / a past life / therefore irrelevant possibly never even existed in the first place ...

Umm.. wth is wrong with my brain ?"
not my usual dissociating .. very scary what is this??,7,kri2i8,1,"so i had an intense dissociative episode a couple days ago but i started my period the next day (PMDD) so i knew that was the reason. i‚Äôve been a little foggy since but overall okay. today was actually pretty decent. i was more productive than i have been & everything seemed fine. flash forward to like 8:30pm i just finished eating & was doing a crossword puzzle when i noticed that i was seeing the words of the clues but i wasn‚Äôt really comprehending them. the tv was on so i started watching and again realized that i was seeing the images but wasn‚Äôt really catching what was going on. i immediately noted that i felt off and decided to go to bed. (i normally don‚Äôt go to bed that early but figured i was just tired) so i got ready for bed & noticed that my head felt fuzzy & warm. i tried to lay down & immediately noticed my head & body were not on the same page. i could not control my thoughts they were going every where & some weird images & thoughts were popping up & i knew i wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep. i put on a story from the calm app but i wasn‚Äôt even able to focus on the words bc my mind was going everywhere. i felt like my body was falling asleep but my mind was not. after maybe 30 mins i got up bc i couldn‚Äôt handle it & felt the panic get to me. i have a loft bed & i could barely get down from it bc i was so uncoordinated/ stumbling & went to talk to my mom but could barely get my words out. i tried to lay down again but at soon as i did my thoughts went weird again & now i was physically panicking (trembling, racing heart etc) i tried to just focus on my breathing & do the stuff i normally do for anxiety but nothing really helped & i just feel like i have absolutely zero control over my mind & im probably not gonna get any sleep tonight. this isn‚Äôt what it feels like when i dissociate & the fact that my head physically feels off (like it‚Äôs buzzing / warm / etc) & has me really scared that‚Äôs somethings medically wrong & it‚Äôs not just mental. has anyone experienced anything like this?????? how can i help myself & sleep tonight????"
I think I dissociate?,1,krg61i,0,"Is it more of an action for self distraction or? 

I definitely binge distracting activities to ignore reality. I also often will be in this feelingless fog most of the time and wrapped up in reflective thought always focusing on solving problems that hold me back from feeling things. 

When I try to connect with my emotions and thought, I feel anxiety and generally find it easiest to just allow the passing of time rather than engage. There have been plenty of times in the past where I just tune out the world despite social expectation but I've been giving myself healthy activity and meditation and sobriety and find that even tho I'm half a person, I can still pull off being alive which is good. 

Another thing I do is try to stop thinking and be connected to the moment but that can make.me anxious as well. Not sure what to do with all of my moments so I get wrapped up in another habitual distraction. 

Would like to understand ur understanding of dissociation better plz"
"What type of dissociation is this, and has anyone else experienced anything like this?",1,krfhnq,5,"From October 2020 to November 2020 I have a huge gap in my memory with the exception of a very small period that I remember (I would be surprised if that period was longer that 10 minutes). To the best of my memory, there wasn't any trigger for this. I was a tad depressed and on guanfacine at the time though. 

The way I would describe the little that I remember is very fuzzy. I don't remember what I was doing, but I know I was having a conversation with someone. I don't remember what I said but I know in the moment I knew I didn't mean any of the things I said. It was really weird, like there were two sets of emotions in my head, one that I was feeling and one that my body (or whatever was in control of it) was feeling. Its hard to explain. I know I didn't feel in control at that moment, and I was frustrated. I couldn't get any sort of control of my body. 

The only time something like this happened was when I was a child at the peak of when traumatic things in my life were happening. That was for about a year  and I regained consciousness while I was getting ready for school. 

I attempted talking to my therapist about this but she does not actively work with those who have dissociative episodes like that. 

What kind of dissociation is this, if it even is dissociation, and has anyone experienced something similar?"
How to get out of dissociation/derealization,7,krcyv8,3,"Hey guys...

I‚Äôve seen this posted a bunch on Reddit but I really wanted to get my story out there to see if anybody has had the same thing happen to them, and if so, how they managed to cope with it/get out of it entirely.

So about a month ago right after thanksgiving I was in the car with my cousin and we were in a Chick-fil-A parking lot. I got out to throw some trash away and all of the sudden everything seemed very fake, almost as if the world itself wasn‚Äôt real or that I was dreaming. This feeling has continued into this present day, it forced me to be stuck at home as doing simple things like driving a car and going to work cause my anxiety to skyrocket. It never entirely goes away, although I‚Äôve had moments where it seems to get better only to go back to being bad.

It‚Äôs not as though I don‚Äôt remember myself or my memories, I remember them all. I know who I am, it just feels like I‚Äôm almost high and out of it. I want it to end so badly, and I‚Äôve tried a few things such as LENS therapy, talk therapy, and I even went to a doctor who prescribed me 10 MG of Prozac and atarax for anxiety. I stopped the Prozac after two days (I know I should‚Äôve told my doctor) because it made the feelings 10 times worse. Any advice helps! I just want this to end, because I miss being me!"
I want to leave but I don't know where to go,7,kr9kil,1,
Dissociating feeling like time travel?,3,kr91zg,0,"For background: I likely suffered (undiagnosed) from derealization when I was a kid. I think it stopped mostly around high school, but has started to come back in the last year, but pretty mildly. I'm also a master at dissociating from any and all uncomfortable emotions.

But I've had at least two incidents of total dissociation that I think of as kind of like time travelling or like waking up from anesthesia. They literally felt as though I jumped forward in time by a few seconds. It's like my mind has completely gone. In one of the cases when I 'came to' it bizarrely felt like I'd been gone for months. In both cases, I was only 'gone' for a few seconds in real time, if that.

Both cases involved something traumatic or scary - once when I was the butt of a sexual joke by male family members at age 11, the other when I lost control of my car when I was around 22. (It turned out fine, no one was hurt, no damage to the car).

So what were these incidents? Are they just extreme dissociation? It's been like 4 years since the driving thing and I don't think it's happened again. (There are other incidents that could be this, but I don't have as strong feelings of having travelled through time in them.)"
Feeling really sad and alone right now.,2,kr8uus,1,"I know I will likely delete this post (maybe) because I feel vunerable right now and I kinda hate it.

But anyway. My dissociation has been spiraling for the last 3 months now. When I am asleep I have nightmares, when I am awake I am either dissociated or struggling with emotional flashbacks m. Often each cause each other perpetuating the cycle.

I have started assessment for EMDR but it's the NHS and I am not sure what's happening and currently feel a long way from getting help.

I know I am getting worse. I'm dissociating most of the time, I'm miles away from everything and struggling to be human at all. I have a job and a partner, I don't want to lose these things but I am panicing now, feels like everything is slipping away and I can't stop it.

I am sad and I feel very lonely and isolated. I don't know many people IRL who dissociate as much as I do, if anyone and noone gets it. I am just own my own trying not to drown but really not doing very well. I try grounding techniques and stuff but really they just don't work. I am not losing lots of time yet but I know it can get there and I am scared. Last time I was like this atleast I had a therapist. Now I am just on my own."
What is this? :/,2,kr6mto,2,"I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just another person asking about my symptoms, but I can find anything about this on google or anything. So I have experienced most of the lower end of the dissociation spectrum. I have had time where i feel nothing and my body and feelings are numb. I have had times where my surroundings just feel fuzzy. If you add up how much I zone out per day I‚Äôm sure it adds up to hours. I have hyperrealzation moments. But what confuses me is that despite all of that most of the time I generally feel ok, yet I can not remember large portions of my life. Granted I am only 15,but I can‚Äôt remember much from 4-8 grade. I was in not ideal conditions, but I felt fine maybe a bit depressed and anxious but nothing that would cause dissociative amnesia . For a bit it stopped, but when the pandemic hit it started and now I can‚Äôt remember anything from March to now. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a loop and everyday is the same, but that‚Äôs not a symptom of dissociation that seems more like depression.  It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a constant mild state of dissociation that I can‚Äôt seem to break. I don‚Äôt want to be the person who can never recall fond memories, fun stories, or anything bc I can‚Äôt remember. Idk if this might play into this but I do have adhd, depression and anxiety. 

TL;DR: I am in a constant state of dissociation and cannot recall much of my life. But idk if it is dissociation."
Is There Such Thing As Minor Dissociation?,8,kr0cdn,2,"I was in the car with my boyfriend about a month ago and he was just talking and I was fully listening to him. Then suddenly my eyes lock onto the distance and it feels like everything zoomed out. His words became like blurred, echoing, mumbling and it may have lasted like 30 seconds before I gripped onto his arm like he was my anchor to reality and I was like ‚ÄúHey give me a second I‚Äôm dissociating‚Äù

Literally nothing triggered it, I just, felt so not in my body? Like I was only slightly out of the lines. Like if my body was an outline, imagine another copy of the outline but like half an inch to the left on top of it. Does that make sense? 

This has happened a lot in my life but I thought it was normal. I haven‚Äôt really started paying attention to it until recently.

The only time I hardcore dissociate is during a conflict / I‚Äôm being yelled at.

Does any of this make sense?"
Dissociation and Vision,3,kqxlgo,1,"&#x200B;

I am a 19-year-old male who has dissociative and psychotic symptoms and who has recently been prescribed Risperidone. I stopped taking that drug after 3 weeks though.

Long before the prescription, I have had dissociative symptoms which became worse and worse to a point where I pushed myself to visit the doctor (I can safely say that it all started when I was 13 or 14).

There is a particular symptom which I don't hear or read anybody talking about; it has to do with your vision. I remember when I was 14 I asked my sister why does the room look dull. That ""dull"" vision is really hard to describe: colours look much less intense, and there is that sort of detachment as if I am looking at something that is in another dimension, it is as if there is a layer of grey that makes everything look less bright,  it is really hard to describe but it all has to do with my vision. That ""dull vision"" becomes much less in the afternoon and is its strongest at night.

I went to a lot of eye doctors and they gave me pills that ensure that my vision is ok and nothing really changed.

Please reply if you relate or know about this certain symptom, does it have a name?"
Was I dissociating?,1,kqxis5,0,"I know you probably get these all the time so thank you for your patience. In the last few weeks, especially after talking to someone I'm close with who's a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I've realized that I likely have memories I'm not remembering. I remember a handful of small instances of cocsa and one small event with a grown up family friend. But because of other symptoms I have it seems like there's stuff I'm not remembering. 

Last night I was already not feeling good. My chronic pain was acting up and I was struggling with some suicidal intrusive thoughts. We were laying in bed and all of a sudden I thought of something (which I no longer remember what it was. I have this thing where I can temporarily make myself forget what I'm upset about to help me calm down but this time I didn't remember it later) and my anxiety spiked and I started feeling uncomfortable and restless. I felt dizzy and light headed and when I looked at my arm it didn't feel attached to me. Overall I felt really uncomfortable in my body and anxious.... 

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions and I'll try and answer. Thank you again for helping me when I know what I'm going through is nothing compared to a lot of you. üíï"
I dissociated harder than I ever have before and it frightened me.,36,kqxepk,4,"I was upset yesterday about a fight with my boyfriend. It had to do with a topic that hits me at my very core and deeply upsets me. I was trying to fold clothes to calm myself down and in the middle of folding a towel I suddenly felt my brain get bigger than my skull, my vision tunneled, and I couldn't move or talk. The bed felt like it was moving and I was trying to ask my boyfriend if there was an Earthquake but I couldn't talk. It was like my thoughts slowed down to the point of incoherency. This lasted maybe 30 seconds of me staring into the distance and then I felt like my jaw was going to explode (always my precursor to a panic attack) and it surged a painful energy from my jaw down my spine. This snapped me out of it and I instantly knew I was going to have one. I collapsed and had the worst panic attack I've had in over ten years.

I guess....I just want to know if anyone else who dissociates has experienced it like this. I don't know anyone in my life who can relate to my dissociation."
Is this it or is it something else?,1,kqx125,1,"Been a while since the last time it happened, but I figured I'm curious about if I may have found what it is on this sub. For as long as I can remember, infrequently but a couple of times per year, I get this. Being that it's so infrequent I have always had a hard time really putting a pattern on it, if there is any to find.

I could be having a conversation with my mother at her kitchen table over a coffee. Suddenly, and without warning, I feel like my awareness detatches from everything (including myself) and I look at things almost with a new set of eyes through my own. My mother looks like a complete stranger, yet I know who she is and I recognize her at the same time. It almost feels like for a split second I have no idea who she is, until an entire lifetime of experiences and memories come surging back trying to fill the feeling of being a stranger. My vision feels like it's slightly vibrating, as though two sets of eyes are competing for the same job.

Likewise, I have had experiences looking at myself in the mirror and bein aware of myself. I have tried to explain this feeling to other people who mostly say ""yeah, I can also see and be aware that it's me there"". But that's not the feeling, I can look into a mirror and see me and know that it's me. But these moments I get, I am highly *aware* of me. As though I was looking at somene else, yet at the same time know that it's my reflection.

Or as me and my SO was out walking, it felt like I was given a reality gut punch. As if hit by an invisible wave just knocked my concious outside of everything. Everything felt too real, I audibly gasped, I was aware of too much, but as a spectator inside myself. I am simultaneously aware of it while never losing grip of what was before. So I could tell my SO to give me a moment and she gets it, but she could tell I was looking at her as though I had never met her before for a second."
I‚Äôm not sure if this is considered disassociating or not.,1,kqp21r,2,"This story still bothers me. 

One time I was sleeping with a guy and during the actual act I couldn‚Äôt feel anything. Like, I couldn‚Äôt feel him touching me, I couldn‚Äôt feel the body kisses and I couldn‚Äôt feel the act itself. I remember my mind just being empty. No thoughts at all. 
We‚Äôve now been sleeping together for 2 years and that‚Äôs never happened again. 

It scares me not knowing what happened to me. 

If this information helps here it is: 
-I suffered a traumatic assault about 6 years ago
-I got out of an traumatic abusive relationship about 6 years ago
-I‚Äôve been diagnosed with GAD and PTSD"
Time and memories,1,kqoykl,3,Do other people tell you that you‚Äôre losing time and memories? I remember certain events a certain way. Down to what we were doing and the conversations we had. But this person is telling me that I‚Äôm missing conversations I don‚Äôt remember having with information I didn‚Äôt know before at all. Am I losing time and memories? Or are they trying to gaslight me to manipulate the situation into their favor? I‚Äôm very lost and confused right now and I don‚Äôt know what to trust. My brain or them. Does this happen to anyone else?
Do you experience these or could it be something else.,4,kqnztk,3,"I‚Äôm not sure if I dissociate but it‚Äôs come to my attention lately and I thought I‚Äôd look more into it. I know I have some trauma related to my dad but I‚Äôm not exactly sure what. My mom passed away recently and I‚Äôve had to live with my dad which I haven‚Äôt done since I was 9 I think ,(I‚Äôm 16 now) and some reactions have definitely resurfaced. I knew I was scared of him but honestly I don‚Äôt really know why, I can‚Äôt tell if I just have a weirdly strong grudge against him or if there‚Äôs more but I just can‚Äôt remember. He never did anything that bad, mainly emotional manipulation, but I feel like it wasn‚Äôt bad enough for me to completely forget all of it. I feel like it has to be pretty severe trauma for you to block out an entire part of you‚Äôre life, I could be wrong. 

Anyways, i cannot stop staring at things. I thought I had adhd (that might still be a possibility I‚Äôm not sure, I don‚Äôt know anything about myself and I‚Äôm bad at perceiving myself so I‚Äôm not really able to tell if I actually have symptoms or if I am faking them.) it does not happen most of the time but when I feel really disconnected, I find myself just staring at nothing for so so long and I can‚Äôt stop even if I try. It happens a lot at dinner because we eat dinner as a family, so my dads there. It is happening right now, I‚Äôm struggling to write this because I keep zoning out. 

Also when I‚Äôm disconnected I feel like I can‚Äôt feel things as much physically. I have a heated blanket. When it‚Äôs at full heat it‚Äôs usually is so hot that it burns a little bit, i rarely have it above 5 (out of 10). I can barely feel it right now and it‚Äôs at 10. 

I also get scared of myself in the mirror a lot. I made a joke about it to my friends awhile ago and they were all really confused, I didn‚Äôt know that was out of the normal. Sometimes I‚Äôm very confident in my body but sometimes I see myself in the mirror and get scared because I don‚Äôt recognize myself and it looks like someone else is standing in front of me and moving. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is a symptom at all but I figured I‚Äôd add it. I do a lot of repetitive things. I rock back and forth and fidget and I tend to listen to songs on loop especially when I‚Äôm disconnected, very hyper, or trying to block out other noise. I also go to the same park and go on the swings every day at the same time and I have for almost 4 years, even when it‚Äôs snowing. 

I have no idea which of these are dissociation signs, if any of them are, like I said I‚Äôm not very good at analyzing myself and it‚Äôs hard to compare myself to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù if I‚Äôve never experienced it before. It would help if someone could tell me if they‚Äôve experienced these things before. Sorry if the post is a little unorganized, my brain is foggy. Sorry for the long post, thank you for reading"
Hyperrealization?,52,kqc6s9,12,"So I was watching The Eric Andre show, and when the Lizzo Bird Up bit came on, something about the movement gave me a very similar, but opposite feeling to derealization. I suddenly became hyperaware, like everything around me was *too real*. I‚Äôve had it happen at parties before, usually places with big lighting difference (bright spotlights contrasted with a completely dark house in a theater). 

The feeling is super odd, my brain gets sort of fuzzy, and it feels like I can see the frames moving by in the world like in a video game. Everything seems like it‚Äôs too real, and I snap back to having to do everything really manually.

It has a lot of similarity to the raw feeling of derealization, but the specifics seem to be the exact opposite. I don‚Äôt get it.

Am I making any sense? My train of thought is more of a monkey on a unicycle, so I‚Äôm very bad at explaining. Does anyone else experience this?"
Self harm because of dissociation,5,kq51gq,2,"Has anyones self harm ever been because of dissociation?, When I look back on when I used to self harm alot of it was because I would bee feeling so dead and numb that I just wanted to feel something and so i would harm myself and use drugs, and so much of my erratic behaviour in general was for the same reason, just seeking to do crazy and dangerous things in order to feel something temporarily...now I don't do all that anymore and I feel even more empty now because that was the only way I used to express myself and feel and I haven't learnt any proper ways and strategies to heal from this, music is good but my feelings only are moved slightly from this and they are still all there under the surface waiting to explode and it's only pain and hopelessness and anger and frustration, messed up wanna get better very hard to live each day like this hey"
Does anybody else panic sometimes?,3,kq4wf3,1,"I occasionally panic about my condition,about how dissociated I am, every now and then I wake up a bit for a few seconds and just think ""wooowww wtf what have I done for the last 10 years"", it's like it wasn't me living but someone else, when I think back to past relationships I had it doesn't even seem like it existed, I recently moved several months ago and occasionally I wake up a bit and just think ""wtf I live in this city"" it is scary how I am not there and the years are floating away and it feels like I didn't even get to live them, but usually I also spaced out and numb that I don't even panic at all so it actually not to bad when I have a brief awakening even though it feels scary, I just wanna feel something, my thoughts keep going to crazy self destructive stuff in order to feel but I don't do that anymore I'm trying to get better,don't know how, I'd like to live for at least a day once in a while"
Advice? Thoughts?,3,kq4089,2,"When I was a kid, I was treated very badly by my sister and it resulted in me growing up with no self esteem.

The only reason I didn‚Äôt attempt suicide in those years is because I didn‚Äôt want to leave my doggo.

Ive searched the traits of a psychopath and sociopath and now Im confused because I still feel that I would vomit for extremely gory things.(I have a bit high tolerance) I still feel sad and cry a little bit if I read or watch scenes in movies or dramas that will really take ur soul. But in real life, lets say 60-70% of the time I feel empty. I only get emotions if Im with my fiance and in work or with friends, mostly I just show fake emotions to go along but inside my mind, Im just having a poker face feeling empty. I think my situation is disturbing. Can anybody explain something.Please help me."
Have you ever looked at a photo of yourself and was like wow is that really me? Who is that?,86,kpgo3f,8,
I feel like I‚Äôm in the Truman show,6,kpgbpk,2,Lately I have been scrolling through social media and I‚Äôve convinced myself that the people that I‚Äôm seeing (old classmates and friends) don‚Äôt actually exist and that everything im seeing has been specifically  formulated for me to see almost as if they themselves are like the ads that pop up when you talk about a certain thing??? I have no idea if any of that makes sense but I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it. Ive also been experiencing this weird sensation that often occurs when I am in the bathroom. It feels as if I am in a dream and I‚Äôm doing something that I‚Äôm not supposed to be doing but I can‚Äôt wake myself up. I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind.
everything feels like a memory,11,kpeu4x,3,i‚Äôll have days where i‚Äôm just so out of it and i feel so gone. the only way ive been able to describe it is like everything feels like a fever dream or a like memory. ive been doing a lot of mushrooms and lsd and can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs making it worse or not. i feel like all my days are just blending together into one. i just want to feel alive i wanna feel real
Posted this awhile back in r/DPDR but that this may relate to a few of you. Happy New Years guys,11,kpeo8q,5,"Read this if you think you‚Äôre going insane. Trust me, you‚Äôre not. This is a disorder within the brain and there are true paths towards recovery. First we must understand what it is we face before we can take proper steps to overcome it. Hope this helps.

I‚Äôve been dealing with DPDR for about 2 years now with a marijuana-induced panic attack serving as the trigger for the dissociation. Over the past 2 years I have learned quite a lot about the workings of my brain and due to the obsessive rumination, have spent plenty of time researching DPDR. The main thing I have found is that DPDR will not go away on its own and although your mind may be bombarded with philosophical, existential questions regarding the state of your reality, you cannot think your way out of this disorder. Trust me, I‚Äôve tried. DPDR is linked with trauma but that‚Äôs merely the surface level. DPDR has many parts and can be described both psychologically and biologically. 

Psychologically, DPDR is a chronic dissociative disorder which serves as a defense mechanism towards the burden of excess stress on the mind. This stress can root from both explicit traumatic events such as car accidents/sexual abuse or implicit trauma from the past. Even though you may want DPDR to go away, your mind thinks it is helping you by putting a barrier between you and reality (which it perceives as a threat). Now, as we go a bit deeper we must discuss attachment theory. Attachment theory has been used to further understand dissociation. Our mind has something called an attachment behavioral system which is a system within our brain which is responsible for our innate desire for comfort from our parents during infancy through childhood. An attachment style is the way an infant thinks, feels, and behaves towards the parent and is influenced by the way the parent reacts when confronted by the infant in need of emotional reassurance of security. There are 4 types of attachment however for the sake of this post, I‚Äôll speak only of the one which creates a predisposition for DPDR. That attachment style is called disorganized attachment. This attachment style occurs when the parent is either frightened of the child or appears frightening to the child which creates confusion within the child‚Äôs mind when it seeks solace from the parent. The innate desire for comfort from the parents starts to clash with the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù part of the mind which results in a disorganized attachment style. (A BIG thing to keep in mind is that the parent doesn‚Äôt always have to be purposely physically/emotionally abusing the child but may be doing so without realizing.) This attachment style then becomes internalized through something called an internal working model which is what influences how we interact with the world on an interpersonal level and affects the way we react both consciously and subconsciously to stressful situations later in life. As the disorganized attached child ages, it will begin to inhibit the attachment behavioral system by either controlling the parent/child interaction through a competitive means or a caregiving means. One uses the social ranking system which mediates the dominant/submissive roles and the other exhibits behaviors such as entertaining, comforting, or giving approval to the parent. These role-reversal behaviors will then form 4 different ego states which is how the child makes sense of the interaction with its attachment figure (parent). 

1.) The Victim Self: The parent is representative as the cause of the fear within the child 
2.) The Persecutor Self: The child believes itself to be the cause of fear within the parent 
3.) The Rescuer Self: The child believes itself to be the cause of security or comfort within the frightened parent 
4.) The Confused and Helpless Self: The child believes itself and the parent to be threatened by an unknown source of danger 

As these ego states internalize, they are used as a guideline for the way in which the child processes future situations. For those with disorganized attachment, these ego states work contradictory towards one another making stressful situations even more so as our brain struggles to make sense of them. I‚Äôm still learning more about treatment however i know that integrating these ego states within the mind is foundational towards recovery from DPDR. 

Now, onto the neurobiological view on DPDR. This isn‚Äôt necessary per se, however for those who are obsessed with finding answers like i am, this helps you understand your disorder a bit better. This is going to be a lot but it will all come together in the end, trust me. First thing you need to understand is something called the Triune Brain Model. It pretty much splits the brain into three parts. 

1.) Brain Stem (Reptilian Brain)
2.) Limbic Brain (Paleo-mammalian Brain)
3.) Neocortex (Neo-mammalian Brain) 

The Brain Stem is responsible for involuntary bodily functions like breathing, heart beat, digestion, etc. Running out of the Brain Stem is something called the Vagus Nerve which connects to a plethora of bodily organs and systems. The Vagus Nerve is split into two separate Vagul Systems. One activates/deactivates the sympathetic nervous system and the other activates/deactivates the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system controls bodily functions while the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù system is active while the parasympathetic nervous system control bodily functions during normal functioning of the body. When one is on, the other is off. This system is involuntary so that means that when the mind perceives something to be life-threatening, the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù (which I‚Äôll refer to as FoF from now on) activates whether you want it to or not. People who‚Äôve gone through emotional trauma often have trouble shutting off the sympathetic nervous system. 

Next is the Limbic System which is responsible for feeling of intense emotions and houses the Amygdala and the Hippocampus (more on those later). Finally, the Neocortex which is split into two parts. The front is responsible for logical thought and planning while the back is responsible for the perception of the world through the 5 senses. 

People with DPDR have parts of Triune Brain that have disintegrated (no longer working together) which inhibits the brain from working properly. 

The next concept you need to understand is the lateralization of brain function which is the separation of the two sides of the brain. The left side is responsible for logical and verbal functions. The right side is responsible for emotional and visceral processing on a preverbal level. 

The next parts of the brain you need to know are the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) which is used when planning or when abstract thinking is necessary and the Hippocampus which stores verbal, explicit memories such as ‚ÄúI went to my grandparents house.‚Äù Memories which you can put into a factual sentences. These two parts of the brain work together to form the DLPFC-Hippocampus Axis which serves as the core of the rational mind, often referred to as the Observer Self when speaking in context of dissociative disorders. DPDR described on a very simple level is a split between the Observer Self and the Experiencing Self. 

Next is the Orbital and Medial Prefrontal Cortex (OMPFC) which serves as the seat of social/emotional reasoning and is responsible for emotions within a social setting and feelings of empathy. This works with the Amygdala, which we‚Äôll talk about later, to help regulate emotional reasoning. 

Next is the Insula or the Insular Cortex which is a small part of the brain which we‚Äôve carried over through evolution and is responsible for any feeling felt within the body (itch, having to pee, etc) also known as interoception. It‚Äôs responsibilities also include the physiological sensations felt that are evoked by emotions. Example: feeling butterflies in your stomach when you are nervous. Located within the Insula are Spindle Neurons which allow us to engage in empathy. These neurons can also be found in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex which is involved in motivation, emotional control, reward anticipation, and emotional awareness. When you journal and bring awareness to your emotional trauma, you are activating the Anterior Cingulate and Insula which is extremely helpful towards your DPDR recovery and can help reduce psychosomatic illnesses. 

I promise we‚Äôre getting close, thanks for hanging in there with me. This next part is extremely important. 

The Amygdala is responsible for our deep emotions such as fear, anger, and lust. It‚Äôs also responsible for housing implicit, procedural memories such as the behaviors we talked about in the psychological section of this post to the process of driving a car or shooting a basketball. The Amygdala is developed within 8 months of pregnancy so that you have a functioning one as soon as you are born. However our Hippocampus doesn‚Äôt fully develop until we are around the age of 2 or 3. The Amygdala also allows us to process and react to dangerous situations using the FoF system. Remember how i said the FoF is involuntary, well, people with DPDR have an Amygdala (which is responsible for FoF) that is misfiring and hijacking the PFC (which is responsible for logical thought and reasoning) and causing the brain to perceive a constant threat which may lead to illogical thoughts or perceptions about reality. 

Finally we have the Hippocampal-Amygdaloid Axis. Both the Hippocampus and the Amygdala work in conjunction and separate from each other to help store memories in our brain. Like i said before, the Hippocampus stores explicit, verbal, factual recollections of a memory. While the Amygdala will store implicit, preverbal, emotional recollections of the same memory. One recollection being ‚ÄúI visited my grandparents house.‚Äù And the other being the feelings, both emotional and physiological, you had while you were there that you can‚Äôt quite put into words. Every memory, whether good or bad, will leave traces in both the Hippocampus and the Amygdala and both traces are used when recalling a certain memory. However like i said before, the Hippocampus does not fully develop until the ages of 2 or 3 meaning that explicit traces of a memory won‚Äôt be stored in the brain (which is why we can‚Äôt remember being a baby). But since the amygdala is functioning during that time, implicit traces will still be stored in the brain during infancy. This directly relates to attachment theory which we discussed earlier. 

Now, if a trauma is severe enough an explicit trace won‚Äôt be stored in the Hippocampus even after the ages of 2-3 due to the large amount of cortisol (stress chemical) released in the brain and the effects of that are seen in patients with PTSD who hit the ground instinctively when a car backfires. Not everyone with DPDR have PTSD and vice-versa. 

In summary, people with DPDR have an Amygdala which is constantly activating the FoF system due to high levels of built up stress over time and emotional trauma that has gone unprocessed. 

The recovery for DPDR is based in finding ways to integrate the explicit memories of the Hippocampus, the emotional memory section of the Amygdala, and the emotional reasoning of the Orbital and Medial Prefrontal Cortex so that we can begin to process the emotional traumas that we have locked away within our brains because we had no one to turn to as we grew and developed over the years due to a disorganized attachment style. 

I really hope this helps you better understand what it is you are going through. It took me 2 years to figure this all out and I‚Äôm still learning more about recovery as you‚Äôre reading this. I‚Äôll be sure to fill you guys in as I go along. Just know, for those going through chronic DPDR (longer than 6 months) that you‚Äôre not alone and that you‚Äôre not going insane. There have been so many times over the past few years that recovery seemed hopeless due to the small amounts of information on the surface level of the internet and my mind has drifted to suicide or some other form of escape from the reality I‚Äôm forced to observe but cannot experience. If any of you are going through this, chasing a reality you once lived, one of normalcy, please contact me directly if you have any questions or just want to talk. We‚Äôre gonna get through this."
spent so much money on ACNH & i can‚Äôt even play it anymore,3,kpc947,1,sorry for 2 posts in a row but i just got a switch for christmas & i bought animal crossing new horizons a couple days ago. i‚Äôve been playing it everyday because i was really excited & have wanted it since it came out (ive been playing pocket camp religiously just waiting for the day i could get it). but after having an episode today i realized that playing it is what caused it .... (i know playing for multiple hours a day is also my fault & i should‚Äôve limited my screen time more) but like why can‚Äôt i just be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and enjoy a video game without completely losing my grip on reality because of it. now i‚Äôm scared to even play it anymore because of this association so i‚Äôve basically ruined this expensive game i‚Äôve wanted for so long for myself...why is my brain like this.
Very annoying dissociation,3,kpasna,2,"Hello guys. I'm going through a real pickle. A few months ago I had a panic attack. Luckily I believe it is only because I was going through a shit ton of stress with college and my new adult life. I was immediately put on Zoloft and since then Ive gotten a ton better. Unfortunately, one of the lingering effects of my attack I keep having is dissociation. Before I got over it but it has come back at full force. Now I'm starting to wonder how reality came to be, where we just suddenly came from, what happens after we die, if there is another state of reality that could exist, and the list can go on. 

I currently have GAD and some slight depression but I'm trying to get a hold on that.

I'm just afraid this is gonna be like that forever and/or I'm just afraid to reality ending or something bad happening to it. Also I'm just afraid that I could be going insane or something.

Any tips or thoughts?"
so tired .. what is this ?,2,kp9obz,4,i was okay all day and now it‚Äôs like i don‚Äôt fully recognize anything. like i know i‚Äôm in my house but mentally it doesn‚Äôt feel like the same place ? i actually don‚Äôt even know where i am mentally i just get these weird thoughts that feel like past dreams i‚Äôve had or something and then i get the feeling i get before i have a panic attack. it‚Äôs so frustrating bc i don‚Äôt ever know what triggers it but i just don‚Äôt want to be in this place it‚Äôs like i can‚Äôt trust my own mind
has anyone else created a traumatic alternative/imaginary life since childhood?,28,kp5l9m,9,"I'm not sure where the right place to post this is but it's the community I've found that is that can be the closest described to what I've experienced.  I have started to feel uncomfortable by the fact that I still am expanding and building on this same alternative life in my head since childhood and was wondering if anyone else has done this? I think for me what is a bit, not shameful, but unsettling is that I have had a happy childhood and adulthood but this alternate life is quite tragic. 

Ever since I was a kid, I developed an alternative life, in which I am the central character. This life is a product of several interests of mine from royalty to travel to whatever. But as the protagonist I go through or bare witness to several traumatic experiences and I often find that I have long conversations with imaginary or often real life people (that I have never met, but have added to my imaginary world) about these events, where I reason out my feelings and thoughts on them. In this life I have a different name, position/status, that don't really bare resemblance to me in reality. 

Also this isn't a fantasy world like Narnia, but rather very much the real world - but I am a made up character in it. It has no effect on my normal life and I find it easy to switch back and forth between my reality and this made up one in my head. I have played at this character since I was probably 10 or so and am now in my mid 20s. I have no other imaginary worlds or anything like that - but this one alternate life has been the one consistent imaginary reality of mine for so long. It's mostly for entertainment but since this alternative life is way more challenging and traumatic than my own I find it unsettling that i do it. I certainly never want to experience the trauma I've created in this alternative life in my own real life, so I can't understand for the life of me if this is okay?"

Does anyone dissociate while doing routine activities?,29,koy8d5,2,I often find myself dissociating when brushing my teeth or washing my hands and end up doing it for 10+ minutes. My therapist is trying to help me with this. Does this happen to anyone else?

New Year‚Äôs Eve was the 4 year anniversary of the last time I did a psychedelic.,17,kofk49,6,"Last night I was thrown into the most terrible flashback trip and dissociated to the point of feeling I was not inside my body, feeling like I was dead. It lasted 7 minutes of panicking hallucinating flashback trip then I just stayed dissociated for hours, I was so out of it I was falling asleep every time I closed my eyes at work and my Schizoaffective disorder symptoms went crazy, I heard singing and clear voices talking to me, at one point I heard a child‚Äôs voice beckoning me inside a giant machine at work, and felt like I was being tormented by ghosts all night. 

This shit is terrifying and I hate my brain and I wish I never messed with any drugs."
Loss of thought,11,koalv0,2,"This symptom started to become most evident in therapy. I can handle being detached from the real world when I'm isolated from everyone and no one talks to me. I can pretend I am functional to people who don't give a shit about me. But in therapy, when I am asked to talk about myself and my life, I start to lose my thoughts. Honestly, it freaks me out sometimes. 

I start to feel like I'm floating, like I'm drunk. Just, confused as hell. My therapist will ask me ""What are you thinking about right now?"" and I will be like ""I don't know. Nothing"". Because I really *have no thoughts*. I check out. It's really getting in the way of therapy. I am desperate to make some progress, discuss about my past, my feelings, but I am so muted. I can't just force my thoughts into my mind. They are BLOCKED. I feel stuck, and frustrated with myself."

Drinking while dissociating,1,ko3ny1,3,Quick question: Can I drink while dissociating?
Allergies as medical trauma,11,knso6j,4,"I have constant allergic rhinitis( mostly nasal complaints) causing by mites at a high degree from very early childhood and cant get out of it by classic antihistamines like Levmont etc. i have tried sublingual immunotheraphy prior age 10(am 23 now)which didnt work either. Afterwarda, I came to a point which I didnt care its existence anymore, dropped out any kind of treatment completely and lived with it as it was the way I was born. Recently, I have started disaociation theraphy but nothing came feom it since I am even unable to talk with the therapist about my complaints but keep asking wuestions like will I be okay etc. and he prescribed me with seroquel hoping I will get over this panic/ paralyzed state and will start talking soon. Since then, I‚Äôm almost always asleep. 

Today, ehen I was waking up, I realised my serious nasal blockage and that I couldnt breath via my nose ever and reseaeched sleep apnea which can be caused by allergies apparently. Then I have read some articles indicating the relationship between allergies and poor mental health. Since then I am thinking if it is possible that when I was dissociating the fact that I have allergies, would it be possible that I have dissociated myself entirely? What are your opinions as allergies might be the cause of some kind of a medical trauma?"
Doubting someone's existence,6,kngr7g,6,"Just wondering if anyone else doubts the existence of people in their life. 

My friend and I recently cut off contact with each other. We fuelled each other's mental illness and ended up being too destructive together. It just wasn't going to work anymore and we had to cut off contact abruptly after a major fight. 

I have a constant need to destroy any proof of our relationship because he triggers so much of my worst episodes. At my worst, the combination of my dissociative amnesia, fabricated memories and psychosis makes me sometimes doubt he existed entirely. 

Intuitively, I know he's real (through proof like pictures and others in my life that know him) but the thought of me being capable of fabricating a whole person I've known for five years always brings on dissociative episodes. Losing touch with reality for so long makes me question the existence of a lot of things, but it's always primarily centred around him. 

That's kind of been my experience if anyone has ever went through anything similar."
Am I the only one who appreciates this sometimes?,2,knc56u,1,"I used to have anxiety when I spoke, because I was afraid to stutter or mispronounce a word.  Standard stuff, but now I can just sort of mute it.  I just stuff it down and speak anyways, without actively...or consciously caring.  It‚Äôs super neat, but I do come off as spacey or high.   This isn‚Äôt even bad, because it sort of fits my entire persona.  People think I‚Äôm a spacey hippie or a stoner, which is only awful at job interviews.  Also, not sure if it completely correlates, but I‚Äôm pretty damn objective.  I can see the pros and the cons of just about anything because I just don‚Äôt know how I feel or what I want enough to be too biased.

Otherwise, yeah it sucks that I can‚Äôt read on command and my memory isn‚Äôt amazing. Sometimes the disassociation to anxiety ratio is unbalanced and I‚Äôm in a spaced out and panicky state. Also, I‚Äôm very indecisive.  


All I‚Äôm saying is that there are two sides to every coin."
Dissociation Feels Like Sleepwalking While Awake,6,kn7fjd,0,"I‚Äôve been really trying to focus on staying present/working through my trauma and there are moments where I literally feel like I‚Äôm waking up into my life...I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it, but it‚Äôs almost as if I was sleepwalking and then all of a sudden find myself here...and for a moment I can see everything very clearly, almost from a distance...and then I lose it again....

Which is frustrating because I really like my life...I‚Äôve worked hard at getting to a safe place and I don‚Äôt want to just float through it...

I don‚Äôt want to fog out and have my life disappear on me...if that makes sense....

is there anything you guys can recommend that worked for you...but in some minor details...I know meditation helps me a lot, but I also have ADHD so it‚Äôs tricky for me to do it as part of my routine rather than in the moment, like when I‚Äôm feeling anxious..."

Scared of dissociating,2,kn4kc8,0,"Ever since I was very young, I would dissociate frequently. It never bothered me and I would sometimes trigger it intentionally when I was stressed. However, I've recently become phobic about dissociation to such an extent that I can't sit in class, enter stores or walk down the street. I become overwhelmed and as soon as I begin to detach from reality, I panic so hard that I can barely walk. My life has become extremely limited.

The Reaper missed me by a few seconds,2,kn4joi,0,"    I was out of the house to get groceries so there‚Äôs this traffic crossing we have to take after a few other junctions. I was in a dissociative state (a combination of depersonalisation and derealisation ) but my sister doesn‚Äôt know about my condition. My family doesn‚Äôt know.

    So as I was crossing the road with my sister yesterday when the light was green for the pedestrians when a car drove past at blinding speed and narrowly took me out of if it weren‚Äôt for my sister‚Äôs fast agility and speed.

       Thanks sis for saving my life. Sorry you always have to be the one looking out for me. I hope to repay you someday.

"Emotionally detached, how to make friends and cope during coronavirus?",2,kn1ojv,1,"Ok so first off sorry for any typos and grammar or lack of it I'm on my phone using voice input as I'm basically impaired.

I'm in England and yeah I'm struggling with the lock down because normally I can just get to a meetup.com group Andover I'm usually very quiet and struggle to socialise you know it's better than nothing but with lock downs meetup.com is only doing online 9 9zoo meetings and like I say I still go with physical social interaction so yeah I don't think I could cope well with zoom calls.

So any advice on how to cope question mark I know that's a broad invade question but I'm really not coping well so literally any advice would be appreciated. Like I say I struggle socially but during normal times I can just about get by by being in a group on meetup.com man in out and there at least even if I don't talk much. Because yeah I struggle to know what to say to people care about them at all all I do care about some people such as family and my best friend my only friend and, but I can talk to them more you know because they get me at least a lot more than the average person.

So yeah any tips on how to cope better or make friends online anything like that would be much appreciated thanks in advance :) .

also I know I haven't gone into too much specifics on yes Pacific things on how my mental health issues affect me socially but I didn't want this post to get too long but she's got any questions feel free to ask."

Something is different...
wtf happened???? Am I dissociating still or did it stop briefly???
What‚Äôs wrong with me???
My words I‚Äôm typing...
They‚Äôre like...idk how to explain it...
Blurry???
Fuck I think I‚Äôm doing it again?? Idk 
It‚Äôs so hard to type that word.
Disassociating??? Ughhhhhhghh
So much anxiety I hate this 
I waved my hand in front of my face and it‚Äôs lagging again. I‚Äôve started dissociating again. My hand when I stopped dissociating was normal. Crap. 
Glitch in the matrix hahahahahahahah no
God I‚Äôm like hyper aware of every sound????
Wtf
I‚Äôm still dissociating but I guess not as hard as before. But it definitely stopped for a bit.
Weird.
Idk what‚Äôs wrong with me.
Too much stress this past year maybe? Maybe...idk.
Everything seems so new...like I haven‚Äôt been here for the past two weeks or however long I‚Äôve been here???
I‚Äôm like touching everything and I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs real???
Idk how else to explain it...
Has anyone else gone through this?"

"first post, have been dissociating for years.& my therapists have never been super helpful",15,km94xd,2,(disclaimer: i‚Äôm not sure of the differences between dissociation / derealization / depersonalization so i‚Äôm not sure which i experience) i first started dissociating after a major family death my senior year of high school (which also sent me into a major existential crisis that lasted for over a year & was continually triggering) for the next year my episodes never lasted more than a few hours but they were super intense like i would be sitting in my bedroom & would have no idea where i was. the year after that (i was in a really unhealthy relationship that left me constantly anxious & triggered) my episodes got longer & i think at one point lasted months (i also got super paranoid at one point but i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a dissociation thing ?) over the last year ive had three major episodes that lasted a really long time & i have pretty much no idea what to do about it. ive brought it up to different therapists ive had and they‚Äôve all basically just told me to do breathing exercises & stuff i already do for my anxiety which i haven‚Äôt found super helpful. (they also never really explained it much to me & most of what i know has come from my own research) i‚Äôve tried different grounding techniques & obviously there‚Äôs no magic fix but i just don‚Äôt have any sort of plan or coping mechanisms in place & the anxiety that comes from the fear of having an episode is awful.
Driving and dissociation,11,km80lc,7,"Hi dissocia-dudes (idk, y'all are dissocia-dudes now)! Just wanted to do a quick ""can someone else relate?"" post.
So I am getting my license, and have noticed that driving is just so strange. I constantly am checking the speed indicator because I know I might forget that I might speed. I almost (and got dangerously close a couple times) got in several crashes because I didn't react to what my parents were literally yelling to do. Feels like you have to work twice as hard to pay attention, especially when you (probably) have ADHD like me (ah, mental illness. Fun times, eh).
Isn't it all so weird???"

I‚Äôm sick of this,27,klzafx,2,"My dissociation has gotten out of control due to constant stress and trauma this year. It‚Äôs to the point where it‚Äôll happen pretty much once a day at least. I‚Äôm obviously ‚Äòout of it‚Äô when it happens to me, to the point where I won‚Äôt remotely act like myself because I just won‚Äôt snap back and focus. Honestly its been exhausting enough as is, but what‚Äôs kinda worse is knowing how people view me when I get like this. It hurts when I come home at night, go over my day and realize how many people treated me like I was dumb or childish. It would be nice to chalk it up as anxiety or something but I honestly don‚Äôt even have minor anxiety. It really is just multiple people making it a point to be rude to me because I‚Äôm ‚Äòdumb‚Äô‚Äî strangers, friends, coworkers, etc all treating me different, acting like I‚Äôm high, or even suggesting that I should ‚Äòget checked‚Äô for random mental disorders I know I don‚Äôt have. I try to explain sometimes but I know people don‚Äôt really get it. It‚Äôs so frustrating and honestly just hurts especially when people I care about and respect just talk down to me. Honestly I used to be a very outgoing and happy go lucky person before it got bad. Now I‚Äôm starting to just hate being around anyone because I know they aren‚Äôt seeing ‚Äòme‚Äô.

So, lately I‚Äôve been feeling really... Weird.

Realizations,2,klqlq0,1,"I turned forty this year and I have realized so much about myself. One being that I have been dissociating for as far back as I can remember, which is middle school, since I have few memories from before that point. I seriously started therapy this year, which is moving along well. I have mentioned to my T that I dissociate, just not to the frequency. I had a major trauma happen a few years ago and some more ‚Äúminor‚Äù traumas since then (which feel way worse as I am still in active trauma mode). I dissociate on a daily basis. Thing is, I‚Äôm totally unsure as to how frequent before and the intensity before this point. I know it sounds terrible that I‚Äôm unsure of the past, but it is what it is. I guess I‚Äôm hoping for some type of encouragement or advice on how to approach this subject in a way that reduces the fear factor for me."

I need advice.,13,kllwsi,9,"I feel like reality is broken. I don‚Äôt even know if this is entirely a dissociation thing, but this is the closest place I could think of putting it. 

So, I‚Äôm 19, my life hasn‚Äôt by any means been awful, but it also hasn‚Äôt been particularly pretty. Ive had a lot of pretty traumatic experiences. My dad was always pretty mentally abusive to me and for the most part caused the majority of my dissociation, along with the death of my cat. I‚Äôve also had numerous suicide attempts, one of them being especially traumatic. 

From around late middle school to high school, I‚Äôve always felt very different from everyone else. I don‚Äôt mean different as in I‚Äôm quirky or unique, but more so in that I just.. didn‚Äôt get it. I didn‚Äôt understand how everyone could be so caught up with such meaningless things. Everything just seemed so basic and uninteresting. I felt like I was just missing some vital key part of being a human. In the more recent years, since I left school, I‚Äôve been realizing a lot of really weird stuff about life that I really don‚Äôt know how to put into words here. Sometimes it just feels like I don‚Äôt know how to assign meaning to things. Everything just kind of.. breaks. Screens become meaningless pixels of light, trees and the beauty of nature turns into organisms just trying to survive. Nothing feels right.


It feels like I don‚Äôt know how to act normal when I‚Äôm alone, like I just never know what to do. Sometimes I‚Äôll just sit somewhere doing nothing but watching the time go by. 

Of course, this isn‚Äôt a constant thing, and I do generally enjoy life, despite me being fairly suicidal. But when it rains, it pours. It‚Äôs like this switch in my brain just turns off and everything just stops.

Picture it like this: your in a party, there‚Äôs flashing lights, people dancing, loud music. But then suddenly, everything just stops. The lights shut off, everyone‚Äôs gone, there‚Äôs no music, no color. It‚Äôs just you in a big empty room. There‚Äôs no emotion, no meaning, nothing. Of course in reality everything is still happening around you, but to you, it just feels like nothing. It feels like your seeing something your not supposed to see, like something behind the scenes of reality itself. This is what it feels like for me.


Adding onto this, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs entirely related but I‚Äôve always felt very uncomfortable looking into my own eyes. Like, it feels like whenever I stare directly into my eyes, I don‚Äôt see anything looking back at me, it feels like I‚Äôm looking at an empty vessel. 

I‚Äôve never really been able to get a good grasp on personal identity in general honestly.. but as I said, that could be unrelated.

Anyways, that‚Äôs really all I can say in terms of explaining my mind. If you actually read this far, then I appreciate you taking the time out of your life to take interest in some random stranger on the internet."

Am I dissociating?,22,kl4e3d,8,"Hi, I'm new to this subreddit.

I (21F) notice that a lot of the times throughout the day I'm simply not present.

Non-panicky Dissociation,13,kkm7l4,8,"Does anyone else have episodes without panic? Whenever I find myself in one, I‚Äôm fairly numb. Sometimes I‚Äôm more depressed than anything else, sometimes it‚Äôs a bit painful... but I‚Äôve never panicked like so many people have described in other posts.

REAL SUCCESS STORY - How Max Has Won 10+ Yrs Of DPDR in 2 Sessions [INTERVIEW],1,kkl6eh,0,"How good does it feel to hug a person you love and FEEL their body, warmth and feel connected with them? To just be present and here with the people you love without drifting off? To laugh and FEEL it's YOU laughing not a robot? For Max that dream has become reality. üòç

He had dissociation and anxiety, more specifically: brain fog, dreamy feeling, a constant 24/7 dissociation ""for no reason"", along with a certain sense of guilt for being happy and enjoying oneself and an overall feeling that the world is unsafe no matter who you are and what you do and achieve.

Despite he done many years of research, read self-improvement books, worked with doctors and therapists, changed diets, used pills and supplements, he still didn't get to the core of dissociation and anxiety.

Like most of my students, he thought ""everything is okay"", I don't have traumas, my past is okay, etc. which of course adds to the frustration in trying to solve a problem that seems to happen ""for no reason"". üòÆ

Being focused, energetic, motivated, excited, feeling emotions, being present, feeling connected, feeling himself - these are some of the improvements that he has noticed in our collaboration (2 sessions total + a few quick follow ups).

So how did we do this? We did this with hypnosis and with my unique understanding of how the mind works knowing what the REAL problem is and what the REAL solution is (not what you think is the problem and what you think is the solution). üíØ

Max #1 piece of advice: You are focused on the symptoms and try to fix them. That's not the real problem!

Enjoy!

Spending all this time alone in lockdown is making me dissociate so much,33,kkk3d3,4,"My (22F) dissociation is sometimes triggered by emotions like anxiety and anger but it only lasts a short time when that happens. 

Being alone for prolonged periods of time can make me dissociate for weeks on end and I was doing really well with keeping it under control for a while but since lockdown started that has completely gone out of the window. I feel really strange all the time, I have no sense of time and I can barely feel anything either physically or emotionally.

My dissociation is getting out of hand & I want to find ways I can keep it under control.,17,kke2bj,4,"Hi there- I (17 F) am new to this board. I have been dealing with DD - more specifically depersonalization/derealization - for about as long as I can remember. It has gotten progressively worse within the past 2 1/2 years and is only getting more and more terrible. It first started with the weird ‚Äúout of body, perspective‚Äù type deal when zoning out & then got to the point were I would feel high (not in a good way) without ingesting any drugs. I have a terrible memory and cannot remember nearly anything from the past year that has happened to me and I am assuming that is my DD to blame.

Anyways, more recently I have noticed my DD is starting to mess with my vision. As im talking to someone their face gets all warped, or it looks like my depth goes out in my vision (say person was standing in the middle of the room & the depth perception goes out on me, said person looks like they are up against the wall when they in fact are not). Looking in the mirror makes my face warp, and things look like theyre warping behind me. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this DD or am I mistaking it for something else? How do I make this stop?"

Lately, I have been suffering from not being able to understand what's happening in my head. I find myself unable to concentrate in my studies nor in my daily life. I don't know... I think it's maybe due to all the problems happening and people not believing that I am living with a mental desease. I found out that I have more Evil alters in my system and they keep on doing things that make it hard for me to live my life normally. Not to mention that I constantly hear all the alters' voices at once. I find it hard to live a normal life. I really need help. I need advice in this. It's getting dangerous.

Also, if someone can explain what is happening to me I would be grateful.

Ps: I found it hard to finish this post as well because of all the noise in my head."

No clear cause?,2,kiy7th,1,"TW: suicidal thoughts

Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone else has either experienced or knows about this? I‚Äôve been experiencing a lot of dissociation symptoms constantly for the last few years. I feel super disconnected from reality, like I‚Äôm viewing my life but not actually living it. Nothing external feels real, everything seems plastic. I have a really hard time understanding that other people and animals are real, living things. My memory is really bad and my past experiences don‚Äôt feel like they really happened. I don‚Äôt really have a good sense of self, I look at my body and don‚Äôt feel that it‚Äôs my own, I study my hands and feet and limbs or reflection and none seem like they are mine. I feel like my personality is never really the same and changes daily based on some set of aesthetics i somewhat relate to. Basically, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a real person and everything external doesn‚Äôt seem real either. I‚Äôm aware of the fact I feel like this and want to break out of it but I haven‚Äôt been able to.  

I see a therapist and psychiatrist, I have depression and anxiety. I‚Äôve started working with my therapist in sorting this out. Mindfulness practices have helped a bit. The thing that‚Äôs hard to figure out is why I have this. I know a lot of people that experience dissociation develop it after abuse or a traumatic event. I haven‚Äôt had any of that in my life. I had a normal upbringing with a supportive family that loves me. My therapist has even told me I don‚Äôt really fit the traditional mold for someone with dissociation. The only things we‚Äôve been able to come up with is that I used to have constant suicidal thoughts for a long period of time and just really constant depression, and maybe my brain decided to use dissociation as a coping mechanism to escape these thoughts a bit? Other thing is I‚Äôm super type A and high strung so even when I‚Äôm done with work for a day, I‚Äôm constantly thinking about what else I have to do or edits I can make to a project and never really relax. 

Anyways, long winded way of asking had anyone else experienced dissociation with no really clear cause? It‚Äôs frustrating and I hate living like this, but I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve made some progress."

Religious Trauma?,5,kiik15,3,"I‚Äôve been in an almost constant state of derealization/depersonalization for around a year and a half. Probably longer. I‚Äôm not actually sure though, as because of this my memory is absolute shit and I have a hard time remembering everything from doctor‚Äôs appointments to where I set down my phone. 

I‚Äôve been trying to think on what might have caused this to happen, I have pretty bad anxiety and thought that might have been the cause since I don‚Äôt remember going through anything traumatic. Then I saw someone describe trauma as anything the takes away someone‚Äôs sense of safety. 

This set the gears turning and after a bit of research I came to the conclusion that I‚Äôd been subject to some form of religious abuse, or at least major anxiety stemming from religion. A great deal of my anxiety is because of existential thinking and the thought of ‚Äúwhat comes after‚Äù, and as a person who was raised Christian and also LGBT+ I have a constant lurking fear of being damned to torture in hell for eternity. These trains of thought can and will lead to full blown panic attacks. 

The overall point of this post is to ask if anyone has been through something similar, or if this is a plausible explanation for why I dissociate. I‚Äôm going to see a therapist in a few weeks but I‚Äôd like to know what you guys think."

Obsessive fear of dissociating,4,ki3v3k,3,"Year and a half ago I had a dissociative episode that lasted a full month. I know that sounds crazy but that‚Äôs what happened. It was triggered over essentially nothing but its led to me having a strong fear about it ever happening again. Everything that happened to me leading up to the episode and during the episode I‚Äôm afraid of. For example I was super into anime and was watching anime when the episode came on (it started as a fuckton of anxiety that turned into dissociation.) Now I don‚Äôt watch any anime anymore, ever, because it vaguely reminds me of being dissociated, and that‚Äôs enough that I can‚Äôt risk it anymore. Pok√©mon Sw/Sh got announced while I was dissociating. My best friend bought me the game for Christmas, and I couldn‚Äôt even play it for 20 minutes without panicking over my fear of dissociating. My friend asks why I don‚Äôt play the $60 gift he bought me and i don‚Äôt know what to tell him. Any music that i‚Äôve listened to while dissociated or before is not ok anymore. If I decide in my head something has the capacity to make me dissociate, it will. It‚Äôs become this stupid vicious circle of fear and negative placebos in which my fear of dissociation itself is what causes me to dissociate. It got very bad this summer. I changed my wallpaper and dissociated for three days. That sounds stupid and fake, right?? Right?? But that happened, due to various complexities and associations I had. And I know all these things have no intrinsic problems. There was once a time all these little things I used to enjoy were normal to me. But now I‚Äôm just so afraid. I don‚Äôt want to depersonalize again. It‚Äôs the worst feeling in the entire world, and I have to hellishly wait it out. I used to try brunt forcing through it, to exposure therapy my way out of this. But that just led to more inescapable dissociation. How do I convince myself something is safe when it‚Äôs my own brain causing it to not be safe?

I‚Äôm typing this post right now because I just very slightly am out of it after ‚Äúwatching‚Äù Princess Mononoke with a friend for his birthday. He‚Äôs my best friend, and I wanted nothing more but for him to be happy, so I watched it, not even watching it really but just browsing the web and occasionally checking on the movie to respond appropriately. And now that Im slightly out of it I can‚Äôt do anything else for the rest of the night. Because, it could cause just the slightest amount of new association and I can‚Äôt let that happen. It‚Äôs too risky. Just the slightest amount of ‚Äúout of it‚Äù is too much. I recently got accepted to an inpatient care thing that‚Äôs supposed to be for people with anxiety and OCD. I don‚Äôt have OCD afaik, but I guess this neurotic fear is close enough to it. But im afraid. I don‚Äôt think my insurance will cover it and I worry it won‚Äôt fix anything.

Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this. I don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm looking for. Advice? Someone to relate? i don‚Äôt know. if you got this far, thank you for reading."
Can trauma come from within?,29,ki2fsb,6,"I have had bad mental health for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve always had persecutory voices in my head that seem very real and graphic intrusive thoughts. I also recall having overwhelming emotions, constant anxiety and panic attacks since I was a child.

Is it possible the presence of bad mental health could have traumatised me? 

Now, as an adult, I have all the symptoms of trauma but I feel like I‚Äôve been this way for a long time. A lot of my mental health is centred around traumatising myself (or so it feels) with involuntary thoughts and images. I am just wondering if trauma can also come from within / if you can traumatise yourself?"
Why do I dissociate more at night?,6,khvhou,4,"I don‚Äôt often dissociate during the day, but at night I frequently find myself feeling as if nothing is real, being hyper-aware of sensations/ my body in relation to space, etc. I have anxiety, depression, and OCD but I do not have any dissociative disorder (as far as I am aware) or PTSD. As a kid, I would sometimes feel like I was dreaming and would get very anxious about it, but I didn‚Äôt get it very often throughout my life. Now at 19 I am experiencing dissociation more often, and again, mostly at night. Anyone know why? I will try and get an appointment to talk to my therapist about this because it is not enjoyable haha. Thanks"

This is why I love dissociation.,16,khhsp4,3,"My mind. My sweet beautiful mind can make up some far out ideas that I have begun to believe during the mids of dissociative episodes. 

Hear me out. 

Everything has a nature in and of itself. There are polar reactions, like simple magnetic attraction in every atom and molecular structure that our world is composed of. Simple factual chemistry where our beautiful sense of love is just a chemical reaction. What I love about science is that it shows us the fundamental building blocks of our very being. I love to pair science by complimenting it with the stories that occultists preach - mind over matter, and old teachings, how the bible says that forgiveness is freedom... Mind, body and spirit. Our awareness, our will and the physical realm.

My mind extends to the very bottoms of my fingers tips and that's where I realise that everything I touch and feel, it is my mind interacting with this strange set and array of compounds around me, causing motion and all of a sudden I'm understanding physics in a new way. My depression lead me to cope through dissociation and dissociation has taken me from a world that had only one insight, to a world where everything is so weird and bizarre, magical... A place where suddenly magic is real.  Our minds are tied to our bodies, there's no detachment from that. No matter if you travel on the astral plane, you will always have your soul return to your body, unless of course you were to be on the verge of death. I don't understand why my consciousness HAS to be tied to being a bloody human but what I do realise is that every damn one of us has a consciousness, no matter how big or small. People with disabilities of the most misunderstood or ""low intelligence"", animals, plants, everything in this cosmos breathes. Everything in this cosmos is interacting with the atoms beside it. We are ALL stuck here. INSIDE. 

So instead of suicide, I travel further down my minds realisation's of this strange place, instead of exploring the outer parts of me such as using my brain electricity to turn on a light bulb, I use my third eye to make all those sparkly colours when I shut my eyes turn into beautiful meditative imagery and psychedelic artworks. In this dark space of the mind I suddenly find my body floating like a stereo typical hippie floating during mediatation and all of a sudden my body is alseep, rested and my mind is awake and free, to do anything I wish. 

And this is when I can leave my body. This is where I meet beings of other places. This is where I cope with being stuck inside of myself. I am not sure if I will ever be able to answer why I, or we, or anybody or anything has to exist like this, but at least I've made it bearable. 

&#x200B;

IF you're watching yourself like a TV, you've just got to change the channel. Raise your frequency, but stay grounded. There's some very important reason we are who we are. Your mind is beautiful, you are art in and of itself, you are radical, capricious and you the fundamental of creation.

Any body out there vibing with this ?"
Looking for advice,1,khbfwx,6,"Im not sure if my experiences count as disassociation so I'd like to know if abyone else has had similar experiences before getting more serious help. Starting in high-school sometimes I'd driving home and I can't remember anything other the getting in then out of the car. Now in college sometimes I completely blank people around me out. Someone could be walking in my direction and for a second or two its like no one is there and I only see the background. I also occasionally get this really weird, lost sort of feeling like im supposed to be remembering/doing something important but I can't for the life of me remember what it was. One last thing is most if not all of my memories feel like a tv show or movie. Like each memory is its own episode and everyone in them including me is just a character. The feeling was at its worst this past summer, cause on some days it felt like life in general was fake, almost like a simulation. Thanks for any and all help."
The Glass Wall (a story of dissociation),5,kh6hvv,8,"I sit with my friends, playing video games at home. Laughing, talking, arguing. All in good fun. But, suddenly, everything felt far away. I can't connect with my friends, and everything I am doing is no longer my actions, but the actions of my body. It is moving, talking, and acting just like me.

But it isn't. It can't be. I'm in here. I'm in my head. Watching it happen. It feels as though there is some sort of wall between me and them. A glass wall, keeping me from controlling myself or my body from what it is doing. I yell, I scream, but all to no avail. I just watch my body move and talk without any input from me.

Logically, I know I'm the one moving my body, and I am the one talking. But it doesn't feel like it, or seem like it. This wall keeps me from coming forward and being in the moment with myself. I begin to question if I was ever actually in control or if this wall was always here.

Then, as suddenly as it was there, it disappears. I'm in control again. I'm the one talking. I am moving and walking and being me. Another episode, come and gone.

And I never look forward to the next one."
Has anyone found relief from anti-anxiety medications?,1,kh35z5,1,"I‚Äôve suffered from DPDR for a little over a year and half, after a bad episode with an edible.  Since then, its been a struggle but I had been MOSTLY okay, able to function, socialize, feel excited about things.  Since April, my anxiety has gotten way worse and I‚Äôve got a lot of depression thrown into the mix.  The past few weeks I‚Äôve been on the verge of panic a lot and have been dissociating constantly.  It was terrible last night, when driving to a cabin to stay the night (only 1.5-2 hours away from my home and family) and started panicking because I was far from home and dissociated hard from myself and the people in the car‚Äîa year ago I roadtripped across the country and was fine and happy!  Anyways, I feel that although my dissociation sucks and comes randomly, it was controllable until my anxiety ramped up.  So I‚Äôm meeting with a psychiatrist this week to discuss going on an anti anxiety medication and depending on how that works and how it affects my depression, possibly an antidepressant as well.  Has this helped anyone?  I sort of see my dissociation as a subset of my anxiety so I hope addressing the anxiety can help control the dissociation?
Edit: never been on any psych meds, have had mild-moderate anxiety for years (generally very high functioning but a few times a year my anxiety gets very bad and hinders my ability to function, occasional panic attacks, a couple depressive and dissociative episodes a year for about 1.5 years (generally depressive episodes lasted a day and dissociative ones 1-3 weeks until the past couple months it‚Äôs constant)"
Relatable,242,kgzo0l,4,
possible dissociation ?,2,kgpoah,1,"i have severe brain fog, and have always ""turned my brain off"" frequently since my POTS got worse around puberty. 

by ""turn my brain off"" i mean i sit and stare at the floor and just don't think, i don't feel the need to, i have to force myself to have thoughts, and i don't blink and my eyes don't even start to itch or feel like they're drying out. 

i just had this weird moment a couple hours ago where i felt like i had run into jello. and i had to consciously make make an effort to think and move. i wasn't scared, or confused, nothing. i was just kinda like ""huh..."". and even then that ""huh..."" was forced. 

i told my boyfriend about it and he told me it sounds like dissociation. he's no expert by any means and i know everything's different for everyone but he dissociates, so hearing that coming from someone who knows they dissociate is a little concerning to me. 

i have POTS, as i mentioned, which also causes depression and anxiety for me. i also have OCD. also probably worth mentioning i have never experienced any trauma, aside from being ""backstabbed"" n such by ""friends"" lol

this has happened before but i never thought about it afterwards like i have been this time. i don't remember when or how it stopped, but it did. i was just building a house in the sims and i might have been listening to music but i don't remember 

any input would be greatly appreciated, thank you. i will definitely talk to my counselor about this next time i see them"
Gratitude to my body and mind,21,kgid7g,2,"I have been really down on myself recently for struggling so much with depression and dissociative symptoms. Earlier today, I explored what it was like to feel grateful that my body and mind protected me for so long to get to where I am today, to have job stability, a very kind therapist, and genuine love in my life (with a select few). I just had a moment of thanking my body and mind for doing it‚Äôs best to protect me from long forgotten trauma and it brought me to tears. 

I just don‚Äôt want to punish myself any longer for doing what I had to do (even subconsciously) to survive. 

Feeling hope can be so difficult and frightening, but I feel hopeful today."
"Saw my brain while high, tried to regain access",1,kgf8wx,1,"I was hanging out with a few friends playing pong, and had had a little cannabis sativa and caffeine earlier. I was trying to throw the ball but focus was completely foreign to me and I truly realized what that meant as I could not aim a shot. Usually I can compensate for this in the last few moments before throwing a shot, but that ability goes away quick. I was going off on them about how I don‚Äôt have access to like 90% of my brain all of the time, which includes the social parts that help me be myself and connect with them, hoping they would understand. I began trying as hard as I could to think and gain control of my brain and I felt electricity teem up my spine into the back of my head where I felt the blockage, before I knew it I was on the floor spazzing the fuck out with all my might as if I were exorcising a demon. I could‚Äôve stopped but I needed this so I kept going. It ended up being futile. I went up stairs and tried to keep going. I began the same process and it caused me to yell but it seemed like I forgot what I was trying to do and was burnt the out like I had just finished sex. I just sat there feeling kind of satiated probably from the leftover adrenaline but I was also kind of high and I sat there for 3 more hours thinking about reality and bible verses.

Should I try this again?

"I drew this for a final project this past week in my college core class, self portrait on mental illness",119,kg2mo8,5,
another lil self portrait,42,kfz466,1,
I was out of it mostly and it came back because of self exposure technique,13,kfr76l,2,"Hi there, I am 23/F and figured out I was living with constant dissociation two months ago and started theraphy afterwards. I thought that I had DID kind of a thing because of the constant negative voice with me but there was not any other thing indicating it and nothing came up about it. After a couple of sessions, one night I smoked weed because of another stressor came up and suddenly my brain revealed a memory of a traumatic incident that took place 14 years ago. All of a sudden, I sarted to re feel my body and connected to my surrondings and rverything felt different. I can say that I was reborn and my consicousness have been altered. However, then this grief period hit that I couldnt stopped thinking that I have lost those years and the only thing I was thinking was the event and thought of myself if the event didn‚Äôt take place etc. After a week or so, I wanted to try some kind of a meditative exposure theraphy by myself to get out the thoughts related to it. Then, all of it came back... I am now anle to distinguish these distinct states and I am now back stuck in the dissociation mode. I geel like I have ruined it all over again and trapped in the freeze mode because of what I did to myself. However, there is also this feeling of hypervigilance this time like an anxiety feeling that I didn‚Äôt have before. Do you have any opinions or someone went theough a similar oath. My doctor said that I shouldn‚Äôt do anything about the memory but I disnt listen to him and I am so afraid that it is irreversible."
Is this dissociation?,1,kfohs7,3,When I close my eyes I don‚Äôt know where I am or I don‚Äôt know my orientation in my room. It can be quite scary.
What should I do?,1,kfipwz,1,"When I was younger I experienced being absorbed inside my own body. It has only happened once and I was only 15 so never really talked about it. But lately there are instances where it comes back. 
I was in high school and I lived in the Philippines. 
I remember walking back from school with my friends. I was telling a joke, and out of nowhere I was absorbed inside my body in the middle of my sentence.. It had felt like I was inside a dream, I remember feeling sunken like in the movie get out. Everything was blurred and foggy. And I remember telling myself to not panic. I did not wanted to freak my friends out so I kept walking. I remember I tried speaking but the words did not make sense so my friends laughed about it because I was not making any sense at all. I tried smiling but it didn‚Äôt feel like I was there at all. All I can remember after that was hoping that i go back to my body.. the whole ordeal lasted for good 5-10 mins. It was really hard to tell how long because it had felt like I was there for a long time. I shrugged it off and never even talked about till lately. Couple of days ago I was in a friend‚Äôs house, out of nowhere i felt dizziness and it‚Äôs as it my vertigo went whacked. Then I realize it was what I felt like again. This time it had only lasted for 5 secs. Then again while I was driving a car. And then couple of mins before I wrote this...I‚Äôm starting to get worried. What should I do? Is this normal?
Also I have past trauma when I was a kid. I don‚Äôt remember any of it, but for some reason I knew it happened."
What is happening to me?,9,kfhy0a,5,"Hi there I really hope someone can help me with a new thing I experienced a few days ago. Now, I am very used to dissociating and have a few coping and grounding techniques for when this happens. I can deal with most of it somewhat effectively because I have really tried to understand and implement the things I have learned. 
However, the other day whilst getting 'intimate' which I know to be a trigger for me, something really weird happened. I wasn't stressed out and the other person is always respectful and kind. I was the one being more open and initiated the whole thing. At some point I heard myself say something like ""she's going to be so pissed"". I said it but it didn't feel like me. Then, nothing... I dont remember what happened after but I do know from what I was told. The first thing I remember was looking intently into the mirror. For a split second I was looking into the eyes of a stranger. Then I was me again. I dont want to explain anything further as it doesn't contribute to what I am trying to understand. 
Can anyone else even relate to what I went through? Is this even dissociation? I realise this is weird, even for me. I have run the gauntlet when it comes to derealization, depersonalization among others but never ever have a felt like I was totally not there. Usually I am at the very least an immobile bystander but not this time. Please be kind if you can, this is really freaking me out."
How do I know I‚Äôm dissociating?,1,kfdnex,1,"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my dark humor or dissociation. Really really bad traumatic things have happened to me and I‚Äôm able to tell the stories as if it never happened or even laugh about it. Is that normal? Is something wrong with me? 

Example: I talk about my abusive ex like it happened to someone else and not me. 

I‚Äôm sorry this is hard to explain"
time,6,kfcl0r,3,i feel like time goes by so quickly. this has to be because of dissociation right? i swear i just woke up this morning and it was 6:30 am... now it‚Äôs already 7pm. why does it go by so quickly?
What is this?,1,kf86vd,4,"So I have been on antidepressants for two months now and I think that I don't know how I feel, it's like I am trapped in something and I can't seem to find the exit, most of the time I don't even feel alive, or maybe I can't feel anything at all.

"Exit Light, Enter Night",7,kf44ue,2,"I feel like I'm falling further and further into the void. Every day seems like an eternity. My mind will go black and a millennia will pass.

I'd rather just fall into this vegetative state permanently or make it stop forever, I hate this limbo, I'm afraid it'll happen at the worst possible time like while I'm driving, or taking an exam or something.

I started writing something because I was fogged up and frustrated,1,kexgfj,2,"But now I feel better and starting to clear up, because I wrote it out.

I was just writing that I'm frustrated, I don't know what to do, and that I kind of inflicted this morning's episode on myself.

And I think I know why I did it, which I'll probably write about over on /r/CPTSD.

It's just...I don't know; ...silly? I've spent so much of my life fogged up that I don't really know how to live any other way. I'm used to it now, and I don't want to be.

I don't want to keep slogging through; hoping to figure out how to live a ""normal"" life. It's frustrating that I've lost so many years already. Where I am now took so much effort, and too much time.

I think, for now, I'm going to look into what other tools I can use to come out of an episode. Today was just lucky, and I can't keep skimming by on luck."
Tips to help survive the next week?,10,kesjjg,4,"My situation right now: mums boyfriends family is staying at my house, this weekend we are going to his families holiday party, then my nan is coming over, then we go to my family Christmas that has everyone over (more than 25 people) my dissociation is already off the charts simply because unfamiliar people are in my house, the truth is I don‚Äôt want my dissociation to be this bad during Christmas, any tips to help me at all, I‚Äôve pretty much had constant dissociation for the past 7 years but it‚Äôs so bad right now I can barely think, and help would be appreciated thank you so much."
i'm wondering if this is dissociation?,23,kefacv,5,"sometimes i kind of space out and become unaware of my surroundings, i get really confused and sometimes when i move it feels like im moving automatically, like a robot. i am aware of it but sometimes i dont try to get out of it,, as messed up as it sounds sometimes its nice to just be away from everything especially when im in situations that make me anxious. these usually last minutes to hours. is this just normal zoning out or could it be something more severe? 

ive been through quite a few traumatic experiences when i was a kid but as far as i know i have no symptoms of ptsd or anything as a result of it. if other mental illnesses could have anything to do with it, i do have anxiety and depression, but i have been suspecting recently i have been underdiagnosed. i have close family history of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."

SSRIS what is everyones experience,2,kdje4o,3,So pretty much i've had on and off dpdr for 4 years now but its become much worse this year after a break up and covid19 etc etc. I am getting very mild FND symptoms and some dissociative seizure like symptoms. I've had the tests done to rule out any formal neurological issues. I've been reccomened to go on ssris by my doctor but im worried it'll further exacerbate my dissociative symptoms. Just curious to see what everyones experiences are w meds and dissociation
Does getting drunk make it better,8,kdj64x,7,"I'm finding it hard to tell, what is your experience with it?"
"Identity disturbance, lack of a sense of self",9,kdhyd3,5,"Is this something common with dissociation, childhood trauma?, I'm trying to figure out why I am always acting as someone,it's like if I am not pretending to be someone then I feel like no-one, so I choose some character or type of person to be then this gives me enough confidence to go out of the house because I feel everyone is looking at me as this person I have become and they don't see the real me which is just a sense of pain,brokenness,smallness, invisible, nothing, disgusting etc etc, i have been doing this for many many years I will see someone in the street or on a movie and think that I want to be that so I become that in my head then externally dress and act like that and I will do that for as long as a year or as little as half hour but when this identity wears off I crash and feel non existent and am falling through space, existential crises and panic etc, then I start searching for who I can be next and can go through 20 different characters in my head in 30 minutes until I find someone to be, it can take days it weeks aswell and I just feel dead and non existent or I freak out until I am acting as someone else again, I don't know what to do I don't want to do this I want to be one person the real me whoever that is,I don't even know how to explain properly what is going on here it's just basically there is all this sensitive painful stuff trying to be hidden from the world and from me and then there is a hundred masks covering it all up....I don't even know what condition I have what is going on here, what does anyone think"
Feel like I've lost myself to the void of my mind for good,11,kdeavq,5,"I feel like I'm going insane. I constantly have some level of dissociation, and have ever since I can remember. I can very briefly get glimpses back to reality, and the majority of the time I'm able to flow with the disconnect and it doesn't consume my mind that I'm not connected. It gets to be easy to forget that I'm not connected in the first place. And albeit still not great, it's much better than right now.   


For a good month It's been all I can focus on. Anything I do I'm fully aware that I'm not connected. I'm typing this and I keep forgetting that I'm even typing because it's so easy to float off from it. My hands don't feel like mine. I'm watching the world from a hazy screen, and I'm so aware that it's a screen. And I feel so locked out from living, and it's driving me insane.   


It's affecting my relationship because I can't feel as connected to them, and I just want to curl up and cry, or even harm to at least try and ground myself to anything. I just want the floating to stop. Or at least dampen since it's not like I was connected fully to begin with.   


I'm trying to keep myself busy so I can ignore the feeling but it's incredibly difficult. My memory is so jumbled and I can't focus. It makes me start to panic and I can feel my breath quicken and It's terrifying. I know it'll pass but right now It's so hard. And makes me feel like I've finally lost myself to the void of my mind for good."
Never dissociated before and don‚Äôt know if this is what i experienced,3,kde9fq,2,i‚Äôm not entirely sure what i experienced but i‚Äôm wondering if i was dissociating. i was at target with my best friend and her friend. it felt like i was there but wasn‚Äôt almost like a foggy dream. i heard everything from far away almost like an eco and after someone said something i wasn‚Äôt even sure if it was real. like if i imagined the entire conversation. i didn‚Äôt even feel like i was controlling what i was saying. it kinda felt like i was on autopilot. this has never happened to me before and i‚Äôm wondering if this sounds like dissociating?

I have experience with mild dissociation, but this feeling of ‚Äúfalling‚Äù happens to me a lot during normal conversations and it doesn‚Äôt feel like the average dissociative episode. My vision seems to rotate and I often feel dizzy, stumble from a standing position, and get intense vertigo. I don‚Äôt think this stems from hunger, tiredness or anything else other than the general mental illnesses that I have.
Does anyone else understand this or know what I‚Äôm talking about? Is it a form of dissociation, and if not what is it called?"
I'm really scared,2,kd8ow2,1,"So basically I had panic attacks a few months ago and the panic attacks stopped but then I started developing what seemed like DPDR - it feels like it has been getting progressively worse over time. First my vision just started feeling very foggy and weak, and I was scared that I was going blind. This persisted over the following weeks, but then I started getting increasingly worsening fatigue, sleepiness, and brain fog. It started feeling like nothing was real and I was living in a simulation or something, which I know is typical of DPDR, and I was pretty sure it was just DPDR. Recently though it has been continuing to get worse, and it feels like I'm too deep into it at this point and I will never get out of this. Now it's starting to feel like I'm forgetting my family and forgetting my life - like, I know the names of my family and know they are my family, but I feel like I can hardly process or remember them if that makes sense, and I feel a sense of terror throughout my body and just feel horrible, like I'm forgetting them and developing amnesia and will never be able to remember them again. I remember that I used to watch movies with them and stuff and have a good time with them and stuff,, but I feel like I hardly remember them anymore, like the memories are really weak and I look at them and feel like I barely know them, and I try to remember them more in my head but it just feels blocked off and like I'm stuck like this. My vision is also still very messed up and I still feel extremely sleepy and fatigued all the time, it took a lot of energy to even write this. I'm just really scared what's happening to me and I'm scared I'm losing everything and losing my life and won't be able to remember my family or anything with my life again. I really just want my life back, it just feels like I've lost sense of my life and everything. Will this get better? I'm not really sure what to do right now, I'm struggling with doing pretty much anything because of my severe brain fog and what seems like severe dissociation, just feeling lost and really horrible. I don't even really know what is happening anymore, but I really just wanna have my life back."
Friends and family are important,5,kd7872,3,"I‚Äôve struggled with dissociation since I was 16(22 now), and I‚Äôve learned how to live with it, what my triggers are and what my healthy responses should be. It‚Äôs not always the case but the most important thing I‚Äôve learned for how to cope personally is to keep trying and be conscious about how to respond when I am in a depressive and dissociative state. The biggest thing I‚Äôve also learned about myself is that I need people around me (friends, family) to keep me grounded, because when I don‚Äôt talk to anyone or put an effort in that aspect of my life I ultimately feel like I am not real, while when I am consistent about having people around me it reminds me that they see me and they are real so I am also here and real. Even putting my hand on theirs or giving them a hug when it‚Äôs appropriate helped me a ton. This was extremely hard for me to accept and work on because instinctively Im a person who likes being alone and it was def not natural for me to talk about how I feel or be affectionate to those around me, but pushing that away only made my dissociative episodes that much harder. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to tell everyone you know about it because a lot of people don‚Äôt understand, but continue to have positive affirmations with yourself even while in a dissociative episode. I hope this helps anyone who reads this and just keep a constant reminder in your mind that the feeling is temporary and learn what your triggers are.

Edit: I also want to add that I know it‚Äôs all easier said than done I know how severe it can be, this is just my personal advice and experience, and maybe give a light of hope for anyone on this sub"
Grounding,3,kd0o6z,2,"I‚Äôve been trying to feel the floor and practicing deep, slow breathing for grounding but I‚Äôve been having a lot of trouble. I know exactly what‚Äôs happening as soon as I feel the warmth of my feet on my floor. I know exactly where I‚Äôm heading and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a great place to be. I‚Äôve flirted with that place so many times to see what it feels like and it felt good for the most part. But that‚Äôs all it was... flirting. It wasn‚Äôt the norm and I haven‚Äôt allowed it to become the norm. Sadly, I haven‚Äôt accepted that place as my permanent state of being. I need to figure out how to accept that place.

Did dissociation go away or did i get used to it?,36,kcujbt,18,"Well; it‚Äôs all in the title. A few weeks ago I has some really shitty intense symptoms of dissociation/depersonalization. Then at one point, I stopped fighting it, I just accepted it, and now it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much. I still don‚Äôt feel connected to reality or my body, nor do i feel fully present, but I‚Äôm wondering, has it gotten better or have i simply gotten used to it?

Struggling with dissociation,5,kcs4ad,2,"Hi, I‚Äôm 18 and am struggling with dissociation disorder. When I was 15, I smoked weed for the first time and had a somewhat traumatizing and overwhelming experience. Ever since then I have been in an altered state of mind and feel like an entirely new person. I do not have periods or episodes of dissociation. Instead, I am in a constant dissociative state and can‚Äôt seem to find a way out. I found myself smoking a few more times, and then a few more times, and then I quit. I know it was stupid of me to smoke again but I found myself caving under the pressure of others. I stopped using for about 6-8 months however my dissociation did not get any better. As the egocentric young kid I was, I thought I was the only person who ever felt this way and figured I was doomed. I would never be normal again. I took on smoking again and I now smoke consistently (few times a week) with my friends. When I smoke or drink, I put myself in a stronger and more intense feeling of dissociation than when I am sober. It can be comforting as I feel I am the one associating myself with these feelings which is why I continue (it‚Äôs also fun). I am lost and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Stoping drinking and smoking would separate me from my friends and parties where I would meet girls. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore and I don‚Äôt recognize myself in the mirror. Nobody knows this beside a few of my friends but they don‚Äôt seem to care or take me seriously. I know I‚Äôm making my friends seem like dicks but without them I don‚Äôt have anybody.  I haven‚Äôt told my parents because I think they will react the same as my friends. Probably a bad time to bring this up but I have struggled with social anxiety for most of my life and I feel the dissociation goes hand in hand with it.

Self harm & weird thoughts,5,kcr9lr,2,"I'm scared I'm going to end up hurting myself dissociating. It's happened a few times now it was really bad and I was experiencing auditory hallucinations, tunnel vision, and feeling like I was in a bubble (?), plus that everything around me was fake. It's been three times now over a period of a few months and I'm really scared because I just freaked out and self harmed very badly during one of them. I intially thought it was some type of shortish psychotic episode (things like manic depression w psychosis & schizophrenia run in the family) but my psychiatrist said it was just bad dissociation episodes. I'm still not fully convinced since it was a hundred times worse than any dissociation I've ever felt and I wasn't even aware I was disassociating like usual, I couldn't form any thoughts. My parents aren't allowing me on meds, I'm too scared to talk to friends or leave the house in fear of it happening again, I'm really freaked out, especially since both visual and auditory hallucinations are the norm for me and I feel even more trapped. Plus when I'm normally disassociating, not like during any of those episode things, that thought that nothings real or I'm the only real being keeps popping into my head and driving me to do reckless things, I'm p scared nobodies taking me seriously."
Anyone ever feel a pulsating sensation throughout your body?,6,kcqakg,2,"I‚Äôve been in a state of dpdr 24/7 for 2 years now. 

I‚Äôve started therapy a couple of months ago. My mental state has been rough lately and I‚Äôve been feeling so many emotions that I haven‚Äôt felt in years. Lately, my body does this sort of pulsating with every movement. For example, I walk a few steps and it feels like how a heart beat is but throughout the whole body.

NEED HELP: Am I dissociating?,3,kcq5u0,6,"Hi people of reddit. Sorry for weird formatting, I am on mobile. To starting this post, I am going to say this: English is not my first language, so...
This started this year and is causing some trouble to my daylife. 
My (17f) boyfriend (18m) started saying that I don't show much atention from him. I don't think that is true. But he say that he ask me something and I ignore him. But I don't hear him. I started to believe that is something different. One day, while we were at his house, I asked ""what we are gonna have for dinner?"" And he said: ""I already told you, even my mom asked you if you like guiso, and had to ask you twice till you answered. You looked at her, and after that you looked back at your phone"". I was speachless. I didn't even remember that. Or, in my own house, when something was said, I didn't heard that and ask about that, all I get is ""we were talking about that a minute ago"" And I DON'T LISTEN, OR REMEMBER. This is a problem? I am distracted? Is a possibilty dissociation?
I want to clarify: I was abused. And I don't know If this may be a sort of consequence. I read about dissociation but I can't nor want to diagnose myself. I just wanna know If is a possibilty and maybe try to get some help"
I dont understand what people mean when they say they see things like a movie or like being behind glass. Can you explain it vividly?,2,kcofii,12,I feel like to understand ill need someone to explain in much more detail then jsut sauing its like a movie
let me know?,0,kcmkve,3,"describe your dissociation. im struggling to discover whether what happens to me is dissociation. i would not like to diagnose myself, would just like to know"
"Can someone give me advice pls? (question OSDD, DID)",2,kcm9qv,1,"I have been questioning whether I have DID or OSDD or neither (or something else). My therapist has suggested the possibility of DID/ OSDD but more in a ""maybe think about this"" kind of way. I have read a lot about dissociative disorders, and while many of the symptoms resonate with me, I started to get freaked that I was making it up / appropriating the symptoms subconsciously. Being fully honest, there is a part of me that wants to be diagnosed with DID/OSDD because I feel like it would explain a lot in my life. I am heavily depressed and dealing with my MH for years, and I just want to know what's going on.  


Anyway, a few days back I decided that I must not have a dissociative disorder, and instead the voices in my head are just my levels of thought/ versions of my thoughts, the way I think or I am subconsciously making them up. Last night I got really upset and had a big panic attack/SH episode (regular occurrence for me). While I was on the floor debilitated, the voices in my head started talking to me and helping me through it saying thins like ""you are going to be ok, take your time"" ""we are going to get up when you're ready and get a glass of water/take a shower etc"" I could visualise the person behind the voice holding me and rubbing my back etc. At one point I even started talking back aloud (I do this regularly too). I wonder though if this is just because I have been thinking about systems more and know that they usually have roles etc? like only since I've read about it have I been able to locate the voices in my head, know their names and their roles etc, which has led me to think maybe I just am making it up because I know that's what it should be like? idk  


ANYWAY my question is:   


to what extent is this behaviour (eg instance above) ""normal""?  


to what extent can one parrot / mimic this behaviour unconsciously?  


if this isn't DID/OSDD, what could it be?  


Any help greatly appreciated. Thanks"
Never been this bad,14,kckg4e,3,I‚Äôve never dissociated this hard. I‚Äôve never felt this far away from my body or sanity. I feel the intense tv ambient screen filling my head. It hurts my mind to even think or try to understand. I‚Äôm frowning uncontrollably and just wanna cry and stop. I can‚Äôt comprehend reality well and I just am losing my mind it hurts so much I just need help
Quitting nicotine with a dissociative disorder...,1,kch0cn,3,"Was vaping around 160mg of nicotine a day, give or take ~20mg. So like the equivalent of 4 packs of cigs a day. 

I‚Äôve tried to stop in the past but have managed to lose my mind every time. Borderline hallucinations, paranoia, intense dissociative episodes, flu symptoms relapses with  bulimia, weird insomnia where my dreams get blended with real life. 

I‚Äôm on SSRIs finally, and this time quitting hasn‚Äôt caused a relapse with the bulimia and so far no overt hallucination shit. I‚Äôve been tapering down. But still I‚Äôm as sick as a dog and loopy. 

I guess my question is, does anyone know why this might occur, like the mechanisms behind nicotine‚Äôs effects on dissociation specifically? Or maybe this has a lot to do with how much nic I was having? Thanks!"
Does this come under Dissociation?,4,kcf551,0,"I was in the shower when this happened. I realised I was banging the back of my head against the wall, and the ache is what brought me back. 
I have no recollection of what I was thinking while this happened, I'm not sure at what point it started. 
The ache was probably the only faint feeling that I remember experiencing then- it definitely felt like something distant."
Trying to explain through art,146,kcbexa,4,
Is this dissociation or am I just noticing things?,2,kc6r7r,5,Like lately I weirdly can see my own eyelashes and my nose at times? It seems to be when im anxious. Could it actually be the opposite and be hypervigilance?
Why won‚Äôt people just read about this,2,kc0xgp,1,K is pissed at me bc the angry aggressive part came out. I have no idea what happened. He just won‚Äôt read the things I give him. I want him to understand. I am upset and hurt about what she did too. But instead I get him blaming me for something I didn‚Äôt do. I think we would have less issues if he just read the books and articles. He‚Äôs got time to read everything else. Why won‚Äôt he do it?
Homicidal urges while intense dissociation?,3,kbyrss,4,"  I‚Äôve had this problem for years where when I get too far gone due to dissociation I feel like an entirely different person and all I want to do is hurt or kill someone. I lock myself in my room when this happens because of how intense the urges are, at one point I threatened to kill my father and was about to push him down the staircase he was in front of me but luckily I punched the wall next to me instead. I‚Äôm scared of myself when I dissociate and feel as though I lose all power mentally, it feels like a possession. I honestly feel as though I have the ability to kill someone while in that state without a doubt. I‚Äôm an EXTREMELY calm and laid back person when not dissociating (practically nothing bothers me) and only want to help people. Does anyone else have homicidal urges while dissociating?

Sorry for the crappy grammar, I was dissociating heavily while typing this up."

I dissociated through a presentation and it was horrible,3,kbkn0p,1,"I gave a presentation today. I'm a grad student, so we have to give them fairly frequently. I've never been the best at presenting, but I think I gave the worst presentation of my life today. Sometimes dissociating can be nice through presentations because my nerves don't get to me as much, but that was definitely not the case today. A quarter/halfway through it, I dissociated hard. My mind went completely blank, I forgot where I was and what I was doing. I couldn't focus. I could no longer form coherent sentences. I couldn't remember a thing about the paper I was presenting on. Needless to say, I couldn't continue, but I did anyway. There were long breaks and nothing I said made sense. Words were coming out of my mouth, but I didn't know what they meant. Language, grammar, vocabulary all escaped me. I should feel so embarrassed. That was absolutely atrocious. But I don't feel anything. I have completely ceased to exist."
Sex helps me with dissociation,6,kbha2e,6,"Sooo I know it's usually more like the opposite, but 3 of the 4 times I've felt mostly present in the last few years have been either mid or immediately post sex. Mentioned this to my therapist and how I can actually feel my body when with my partner intimately and she seemed to think this made sense (he's my first truly safe person). Anyone else? No? Maybe? Why? How?"

I hate the reflections,32,kbckqb,5,"I don't see reflections as myself anymore. I haven't willingly looked at one in about 3 weeks. I don't want to remember what I look like as I've slowly forgotten the details overtime.

I hate any reminder of my normal self, any reminder that I'm just *me*. It is the most disappointing feeling to see that face staring back at me, even for a second. I completely avoid it, it never feels like me anymore. I just want that part of me gone entirely, I don't want to be myself. I don't want to be seen as myself, no one needs to know me."
i couldn't dissociate today.,2,kb5bo0,3,"usually when i feel something other than happiness i dissociate after 1 to 30 mins, but i didn't today. I'm so angry and sad and idk what to do. i got noone to talk to either, and I'm so scared this won't pass I'm shaking and i wanna break stuff I'm so angry i never learned to deal with emotions cause i usually dissociate when feel stuff, what do i do?"
Noticing myself dissociate is exhausting,10,kb2tz1,12,"I've been working on catching myself dissociating in therapy atm and I'm finding that I'm feeling even worse than usual.
Basically I'll notice I'm in the dissociative state and bring myself back to the moment many times throughout the day and doing this feels very difficult and like I'm constantly dragging myself away from the dissociation.
It's almost easier to just 'be in' the dissociation and not realise if that makes sense, when I'm aware of it it's like the dissociation loses it's purpose and am just left feeling empty and exhausted from fighting my brain all day.
Hope this makes sense to someone."
Does my condition qualify as dissociation?,1,kb0xsp,1,"I‚Äôve been going to a psychiatrist but I haven‚Äôt been getting much help knowledge wise. I just got put on some medications and he booked me for a skills based therapy in 6 months so I‚Äôm looking for a sub where I can read from others so I can learn more about my condition.

So essentially my emotions are just pretty numb. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm not myself or anything like that, although when my emotions were really numb I felt as though the people around me didn‚Äôt actually exist. Actually, when I look at old photos of my self I feel like I‚Äôm looking at a different person but that could be because of how much I‚Äôve changed. So I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm dissociated in the sense of I don‚Äôt feel the pain I should be feeling. I‚Äôm detached from 90 percent of negative feelings and couldn‚Äôt care less about anything."
College and Dissociation,1,kb0gl0,0,"Hey guys,

Honestly I was doing great in college, I always start strong then mid semester I literally disappear. I have no memory of how I lost so many weeks, and always have to play catch up. Some teachers are flexible and others aren't so my grades start with strong As then I somehow make it with a C buy trying to fix my mistakes. I don't know how you guys are tackling it, in trying to find a better grounding tool to stop me before I disappear to wherever I go but I'm hoping for some tips. I really wanna come out on top for my next semester and I don't care if medication is needed to get me there."
How did you learn you deal with dissociation?,3,kb038w,2,"CW: panic attacks, derealization, brief allusions to childhood abuse without specifics 

I have been going through trauma therapy for the past year for things that have happened in my adult life, and I am really lucky to finally be in a place that feels safe with good social support. A few months ago, I had an intense panic attack/derealization episode that I first thought was a psychotic break. I‚Äôve since learned the difference between intense dissociative experiences and psychosis. (I highly recommend the Dissociation vs Psychosis episode of the System Speaks podcast for more info on this. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm a system, but it‚Äôs a great podcast). 

But basically during the derealization episode, I realized a lot of what happened in my childhood was not the idyllic version I had kind of convinced myself I had for most of my adult life. A flood of new, very scary feeling memories came back that I had no idea about. And it felt like there were more ‚Äúin the tank‚Äù that I was not letting myself know, if that makes sense. It‚Äôs weird because at the time it felt somewhat out of my control but also still in my control. Ever since then I feel like I‚Äôm much more present, but also really struggling to figure out the true narrative of my life. It still feels like a lot is unknown. And now, the memories don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúas close‚Äù if that makes sense, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve fully processed them. It feels very confusing. I‚Äôm not sure if this is normal ptsd or if I‚Äôm splitting in a more severe way. Also my memory loss and dissociation have been more severe. Everything feels very contradictory.

Basically, I‚Äôm wondering how others have come to realize they experience dissociation. And how you‚Äôve handled it moving forward. Thanks for reading!"
Dissociation,5,kazhyb,2,"I just want some input on this 

I feel like I‚Äôve been experiencing dissociation or some type of dissociation. It started in my past relationship. My partner was VERY mentally draining and somewhat of a narcissist. She would make me feel terrible constantly. When she would make me feel these terrible ways I felt like I would completely zone out and feel very foggy headed. Like I was high almost. Towards the end of our relationship I would have these feelings everyday all day. I‚Äôm certain I was also depressed during this time. I would go throughout my days on auto pilot almost like I had no emotions or feelings. I would also feel very disconnected from my partner like I couldn‚Äôt connect to her anymore on any level or to anyone. 

Now I still experience these feelings. If I get into an argument with someone I first will feel upset then a couple minutes in I just feel numb like I can‚Äôt even focus on what the other person is saying. I also will go through weeks where I just feel like I‚Äôm coasting through my days with no emotions. Just an overwhelming feeling of emptiness to the point I can barely have a conversation. 

If anyone has ANY input I would love to hear it."

Paid Dissociation Research Opportunity (1 hour online survey!),34,kahzoo,19,"*Study is now closed*

Research opportunity about dissociation!

Hello, my name is Shae (they/them)! I am a graduate student studying clinical psychology at Towson University and I research trauma and dissociation. I am conducting an online study examining self-compassion, social support, and barriers to accessing mental health care among individuals with dissociative symptoms. Dissociative symptoms can include things like feeling detached from yourself or your surroundings, having flashbacks or intrusive memories about your trauma, or feeling like you act so differently at times, you feel as if you are different people. There is little research on dissociation, so I am hoping to highlight our experiences with dissociation through published research.

We will be compensating everyone who completes the online survey with a $15 (USD) Amazon gift card.

To participate, you must be 18 years of age or older, read English, and have dissociative symptoms. You will then take an online survey which will take approximately one hour to complete, at your own pace. After finishing the study, you will receive a $15 (USD) Amazon gift card. 

Please DM for a link to the study.

Feel free to pass along the study details to others you know with dissociative symptoms."
"Would ""They"" Ever Understand the Frags?",14,kaaqlt,0,"There are *several* riders on this bus. 

One is forever in his abusers' clutches screaming to no useful purpose. But he never gives up hope. 

One -- a little older -- has imaginary friends and all manner of elaborate scenarios about them. 

One is forever wary and vigilant, believing his *extensively* educated ""radar"" is his only real means of survival. 

One can explain it all. But who else (other than some $200-an-hour professional listener) could possibly understand? 

And one sits out in the audience watching the others on the screen, fully aware of his inability to help the first four out of their mutually mystified straight jackets.

The explainer is the topic for today. He seems to have been [conditioned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fixing-psychology/201402/explaining-behaviorism-operant-classical-conditioning), in-doctrine-ated, in[struct](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+construction+of+reality+sociology&oq=social+construction+of+reality&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0l4.7012j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)ed, [imprinted](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_3784), [socialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), habituated, and [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology)) to believe that ""if they could just understand why 'I' am fragged, they'd let 'me' off the hook for all the crazy s--t the others say and do. 

But, of course, the explainer ""knows"" better: ""The 'corrective relationship' with *another* is as pie in the sky as reincarnation and 'another chance to get it all right.'"" And wonders if the corrective relationship really *is* ultimately an ""inside job.""

If it weren't for the guy in the balcony, the explainer would chew *eternally* on his mental toenails... terrified of what all the surrogate parents and bullies and potential lovers will think when they start to ""wonder."" The guy with the popcorn *knows* it's all just a movie that ends at some point. After which the others in the theater get up and leave, never having spoken to -- or heard -- each other. *Ever*.

Wouldn't it be great if the ""detached understanding, empathy and compassion"" the popcorn muncher has for *others* was enough to give *them* room enough to let go of their terror, their protectors, and their addiction to being comprehended by someone who really mattered. They *do* chill out when they know they're seen, heard, felt and *sensed* that way. But the shadows are still out there waiting for their cues. 

Mr. Popcorn calls those moments ""flashbacks."" The others call them ""intolerably frightening,"" ""unmanageably embarrassing,"" ""extremely tiring,"" and ""invariably disappointing"" (respectively). 

Life *is* far better than it used to be when the man in the audience didn't yet exist. The body has not attempted suicide again in 18 years. The fear, the embarrassment, the fatigue, and the sorrow are all manageable now. The feelings and sensations are just there to be *felt* One More Time before the clouds break and the weather clears again.

*""The feeling is always temporary.""*

Life on life's terms."
Anyone else find waking up really hard sometimes?,7,kaaj4w,1,"I'll wake up, mildly aware that I'm on my face or side, and that my mother is standing over me and shouting because I overslept.

I sometimes try to move. It usually feels like someone's pressing down on me. Like my arms are made of lead, and my muscles of tissue paper. I'm not exaggerating, I've felt what it's like to have my limbs pinned down by bullies

And so I'll lie there, not moving. I'll try to open my eyes and blink, and resort to fighting to keep them open. Sometimes I can move slightly and my mom decides to leave me, and so I get a lot more time to get up.

But other times, she needs me to hurry for some reason. And so she tries to shake me, talk to me, and she once pulled me out of bed thinking I was faking and would catch myself, but I landed smack on my face.

It always ruins my day, and I honestly don't remember how I manage to get up at all after all that."
Dissociation through Philosophical Thought,12,ka96yj,7,"(17,M) I noticed that extremely metaphysical thought patterns began with me at the start of the quarantine era. Whether this was from stress, being bored incessantly, or the seemingly homogenous nature of each new day‚Äî I do not know, because all three were present. Perhaps they intertwine in a complex series of cause-effect and positive feedback relationships. However, as time passed, the influence these thoughts had on me personally increased rapidly. I suddenly grew an unbreakable fascination with the universe and especially space time. But things took a more disturbing turn when I thought about infinity. To be clear, I had always understood the concept of infinity, but it hit different this time when I realized that physical space as well as time was just that‚Äî Infinite. 

Nothing and simply nothing (not a single thing I have ever fathomed) had occurred more non-real to me‚Äîthe idea that something could follow a direction forever and there would still be ahead‚ÄîTime would never stop‚ÄîThese two realizations led me to the massively disturbing (practically, self-destructive) hyper-meta question: ‚Äùhow is existence a capability?‚Äú That is‚Äî‚Äúhow, conceptually, can existence occur?‚Äù

I feel it is this that marked the beginning of my chaotically abstract descent. It felt as if the definition of ‚Äòreal‚Äô became very subjective which, consequently, cursed me with a severe ‚Äúbackground anxiety.‚Äù 

Since then, I feel like I‚Äôm on a decline. I struggle more and more with paying attention in school. Motivation has fallen, and therapy doesn‚Äôt seem to be very effective. When something representing ‚Äúthe human condition‚Äù occurs, it has left me with a sort of existential pessimism. Is there hope? The Wikipedia articles I‚Äôve seen to answer this don‚Äôt read indicatively so."

Reality is triggering... triggers are reality,1,k8pzt6,0,"I don‚Äôt get triggered easily, or at least, I very rarely remember/notice being/getting triggered. As such, I am never prepared to deal with a trigger. Unfortunately, I seem to have a very long fuse. After I get triggered, I may have a small freak out or I might not, but then days later (sometimes up to a month or more) it‚Äôll come back to bite me. Hardcore repression, I know. Most triggers don‚Äôt stop there, either. Because of the repression and depression I don‚Äôt really process anything, at all. So triggers will always drag... *things*... back to the surface, now with that trigger attached to them, which means that they have even more triggers. 



Recently, I have been enjoying a particular TV show. I know TV shows are a problem for me if I binge them because I will fall into their reality, but this is one I exclusively watch with my partner, and he works all the time, so we only get to watch a couple of episodes every other night at best, so it‚Äôs controlled. I like it, it appeals to my analytical brain, it has a mystery component, so you can try to solve the problem with the clues and foreshadowing they give you along the way. Even though the subject of the show is one that I have experienced a lot in my life in a not terribly positive way, it‚Äôs been ok, there were no obvious/major triggers, until now. Tonight, the main character hallucinated the entire fucking episode, and it was done in such a backwards, upside down, scrambled eggs manner, purposefully of course, to throw off the audience, that I just about felt physically ill. You (the audience) aren‚Äôt told he is hallucinating until the very end of the episode, and they don‚Äôt even go pedal to the metal from the start. That‚Äôs almost the worst part. They started off acting like everything was normal and fine, but piece by piece things were off, wrong, illogical. You could see the cracks forming across the main characters face as he slowly realised he was going insane, and then when he finally realised, they show you just how much of the seemingly normal part at the start was still part of the hallucination. 



Now, because of this episode, I have one big bundle of *things* where there used to be two, with three new triggers slapped on top. 



I am not okay."

So I tried to stay away from reddit and all mental health talks. Amidst the locked down and virus, I was actually feeling good til the recent unfortunate event. 

I think it started around the same time when I learned about the death of one of childhood here... Usually when I have episodes of dpdr or dissociation it would only last for a few minutes to hour... Or sometimes it would last for like half a day.. now its been a week.. and no matter how many times I have experienced dissociation/dpdr the feeling is still overwhelming and scary... 

Lately I haven‚Äôt been able to express emotions, I feel like I am losing my mind, I am having vivid imagery whenever I close my eyes, having hard time sleeping, and would feel everything around me isn‚Äôt real. I really feel like I am having schizophrenic/psychosis episodes. I really don‚Äôt want to go crazy or lose my mind.. i‚Äôm scared. What shall I do? Help me please"
Has anyone's sense of smell and consequently taste notably deteriorated?,22,k803os,9,"I feel much less for years, people keep saying how something stinks and I don't feel anything. Food has lost most of its appeal so I have to furiously season and flavour everything. Doctors are useless where I live and now they don't want to deal with you with these symptoms because covid... No matter I say it's been going on for years.

As a hypochondriac, I am afraid it might be some tumour... I will try harder to get some proper screening but in the meantime, I wondered if that's normal with dissociated people. Also, a curious thing is that LSD sometimes helps me to smell and taste like I used to, so the brain centre can't be totally broken, probably just disconnected, or that's how I imagine it at least."
Dissociative seizures?,15,k7qig1,5,"I developed PTSD as a child through severe abuse. I wasn't able to get help for it until I was 19 due to people covering the majority abuse and not being allowed to talk about the bad stuff. I had a severe mental breakdown while at college. I forced to talk to a new therapist in the middle of the night by the police. I explained everything and they started getting me the help I needed. The therapist told me that based on my symptoms, I started dissociating as a young teen as well as hallucinations while I displayed classic childhood trauma symptoms which has been reconfirmed by 5 different therapist/psychologists. My full diagnosis is Dissociative PTSD (Depersonilzation and Derealization) with trauma based hallucinations, GAD and major depression. I have been through... A lot. I talk about it a lot in my post/comment history if you want details, but I don't feel like getting fully into it at this moment.

Anyways.

When I was 17, I started having these really weird symptoms. It started as just a normal dissociative attack... But my brain got super fuzzy and numb. Like, the tingling you get when your leg falls asleep but on my brain. My eyes wouldn't focus and I began stuttering. I... Just couldn't speak. Nothing past a single syllable. I got a neurologist but nothing came of it. Yet, my symptoms grew worse. 

I start off dissociating, just the typical, ""I don't recognize myself. Nothing looks real. Are these my hands."" My brain goes numb and tingly as do my fingers. My eyes won't focus. I start stuttering. My body starts getting heavier and heavier and I lose the ability to speak all together. I go into a stupor. I finally can't keep my body up anymore and I collapse. My body stiffens. I hyperventilate. I'm unable to move but my body is stiff. Other people can move me, but I can't. I go back and forth between hyperventilating and just constantly taking in air until I just gasp for air, choking. I start shaking while I just stare into space. 

It lasts... I don't know how long. But, I snap out of it when the fog is lifted off my brain. I still can't move or speak but I slowly I am able to move. Once I'm back up and I can talk, I go into a manic phase. I get super hungry and I end up acting very childish... Like... One day I started screaming and crying and throwing a fit because my sister wouldn't hand me my food... When... Normally, I wouldn't care. My brain is still fuzzy, just not like before. It wont go away until I sleep, which I'll sleep for 12+ hours.

I've spent 5 years trying to figure out why these happen. When I was in college, they would go from 1-2 a week to 3-4 times a day, 6 days a week. I ended up at the hospital so many times. I've had a lot of physical tests done and nothing came up.

This year, I came across dissociative seizures and I thought it made sense. I'm in the process of getting back into therapy... But I wanted to know, does it sound like dissociative seizures? Or something else? Does anyone else get something like this?

EDIT: I forgot to mention. In the past, very rarely, I have also would completely forget moment in time. I would just remember lifting my head up, not collapsing, just lifting my head. Then, a span of time would be gone... Normally a couple of minutes to a few hours, sometimes days. Its happened during conversations which is highly upsetting. Yet, there was once in college where I completely forgotten who I was and where I was. I was eating a candy bar and i lifted up my head. I had no idea where I was. Then I realized I didn't know who I was. I started panicking and looking around. Luckily I had my student badge on the table. I read my name over and over and studied my photo until everything clicked. I now carry my ID around my neck everywhere I go."

My body feels like its falling backwards into a hole and I feel detached from my limbs, like they're not mine. This has been getting worse lately probably due to the stress of my recent suicide attempt and generally higher anxiety worrying about my treatment plans and starting recovery. I just hate my brain why is it doing this to me!?!?!?!"
not in control,3,k6zzo9,2,"honestly, i haven't dissociated in a while, so i had thought it had gone away. but the other day, i went to pick up my sister from school and i decided to walk instead of taking the bus. the first few minutes were fine, but after a while i kept getting this feeling that i can only describe as kind of like chills but staticky?? and after that it felt like i wasn't in control of my body. usually, when i've dissociated before i just felt a bit disoriented because it felt like i wasn't in my own body. however, this time, i really felt like i wasn't in control of my body at all. real sunken place stuff. i'm not really good with words so i can't really explain it properly, but it was really scary because i haven't felt like that before, and i was somewhere i wasn't very familiar with. luckily, they only lasted a couple minutes each, but i've had episodes that have lasted days. 

as i'm typing this, i've realized a lot of episodes happen while i'm walking. i mightve just stopped dissociating for a bit because of covid and quarantine idk. i guess my scariest episode was when i was walking down a subway platform, and i didn't know if my body would just drop onto the tracks or what. to top it off it was pretty crowded that day too. i'm kinda rambling sorry, but has anyone felt that weird staticky kinda feeling? and how do you deal with episodes of dissociation? also i've seen some people say that they're in a constant state of dissociation, how do you deal with the feeling of just not being in control?"
Really struggling right now,3,k6zlkn,1,So a couple months back I had a really bad acid trip I steadily recovered and was basically ok.

It‚Äôs like all the time I‚Äôm having an existential crisis. Obviously I‚Äôm gonna recover but still it‚Äôs like when nothings wrong with me I crave drugs I think i really need a hobby.

Hey everyone,5,k6oj48,5,"I've been dissociating as long as I can remember, which isn't very long if I'm being honest. I'm pretty sure it's dissociation, as the other day I felt ""normal"" and could note the differences matched the description perfectly.

I could google this, but for some reason I prefer actually interacting with people. If you know of any good sources with the answers to my questions, could you please link it? 

What makes dissociating worse? What causes it? Is the memory loss permanent? In what way is it a bad thing? What is therapy like, and in your experiece, is it effective? What does the therapist do to help? Does it cause you to enjoy or seek pain more?

EDIT: forgot to ask, how does dissociation link in with PTSD and CPTSD?

Dissociation almost completely gone after starting Wellbutrin,3,k6e3wl,0,"Hey guys!  Title essentially says it all.  In May of this year, after a really awful break up (plus the pandemic, living alone, and working like a dog) that left me with crippling anxiety and depression, I started experiencing hardcore dissociation symptoms (mostly derealization) to the point where I was afraid to leave my apartment and/or drive. It was truly crippling and horrifying. I could only describe it as it felt as though I was in a constant dream, or watching the rest of the world like a movie. I didn‚Äôt trust myself to speak because I didn‚Äôt know whether other people would be able to hear me.

I kind of just lived and dealt with it until July, when I started experiencing panic attacks almost daily.  At that point I finally saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro.  The lexapro worked miracles for my anxiety but actually made my dissociation symptoms a LOT worse.  I complained constantly about this to my psych, who urged me to keep going with it.

After 3 months of lexapro and worsening dissociation, I switched psychs, and my new psych prescribed me 200mg generic Wellbutrin (Bupropion,100mg SR in the morning and afternoon). I kid you not, the second day I was on bupropion the dissociation symptoms completely went away. 

I have no idea why this was the case. I do know that the lexapro worked wonders for my anxiety but did nothing for my depression, whereas the Wellbutrin is tackling both. So maybe my dissociation was caused more so by depression? I do still occasionally get slight dissociation, but it‚Äôs nothing like it used to be and I can usually snap myself out of it. Whereas before, I was straight up dissociating 24/7 from May - October.

I‚Äôm also just such a happier person on Wellbutrin and have had absolutely 0 side effects. I went from hysterically crying daily to telling my dog how beautiful he is every time I walk by him.  Just wanted to share my success in case this may be helpful for someone. Dissociation is a mother fucking bitch!"

I just wanna understand i guess?,1,k6d5cn,0,"I was wondering why most of the time my dissociation is triggered when I‚Äôm focused.. idk if that sounds funny.

And then today at work . Well i forgot I was at work and panicked a bit. I tried finding any posts on here that sound familiar, I‚Äôve been told by people around me that I cannot tell when I‚Äôm in a stressful situation because that‚Äôs what my day to day consists of. Idk why I threw that in there , maybe cuz I‚Äôm in a stressful situation and i have no idea that I‚Äôm stressed? Can that be?

dissociations and seizures,3,k5y28c,4,"I went to a psychiatrist yesterday for all of this. She said i need to see a neurologist because I have a history of concussions, migraines and headaches and she said the dissociations might actually be seizures. she also mentions it might be parasomnia as well.

Dissociation reality checks?,3,k5u6ed,0,"So...a night ago I was talking to my husband, and there was a moment where I looked at him and almost started crying because he was real.

This has apparently happened a few times with other people. Does this sound like dissociation? I don‚Äôt know why I thought it was a year ago.

First day not dissociated in months,24,k5u3rc,6,"Hi guys
I guess I'm just looking to see if someone can relate?

So yesterday I had my first day in months where I was not dissociated at ALL for most of the day. And it made me realise some things about dissociation...

1. Dissociation is the main reason I do (or don't do) all the things i hate about myself. When not dissociated i get dressed properly, brush my teeth, feel full after eating, stay hydrated, don't binge eat all day, and keep the flat clean. 
2. I'm a better boyfriend when not dissociated. 
3. Dissociation DOES severely impact my quality of work and ability to stay focused at work. 

But the strangest thing for me is that there is definitely a ""negative"" to not being dissociated. I'm trans, and found that when not dissociated my dysphoria is a lot worse  and really bothers me (usually its just background noise). I also found my anxiety to be slightly higher. 

I've realised now that my dissociation IS an issue - previously just got so used to it that I accepted it as normal. Is there hope for treatment to have more days like yesterday?"

"Dissociation of some kind, but I can't figure out what?",4,k5sdqq,1,"Okay. So, for awhile now, I've been having sudden changes in my.. entire mood and self, where, I'll suddenly almost feel like I'm reliving an entirely different version of myself, except, it's not me? It's kind of like, I enter an entirely different persons mindset, except that ""mindset"" usually holds extreme vivid memories of different periods of time. I'm not me anymore when that happens. It feels like I'm a different person, in a different time of my life. I don't know how to describe this. By talking to people, I've come to think it MUST be something dissociation related. I have a friend with diagnosed DID, and they said it sounds similar to that, but I feel like that just.. can't be true? I feel sort of like I'm lying to myself. Another thing is maybe depersonalization/derealization. I just don't know, and it's honestly so frustrating.

For some more background, I'm female, 20, diagnosed PTSD, among some other stuff but I feel like that might be most relevant."
I just realized something..,34,k5hwbw,10,"With how detached from ourselves right now, when we eventually figure out how to reattach everything will feel that much better, and we will actually have a deep appreciation for it.

trying to describe how dissociation feels for me,3,k492dv,0,"i havent been feeling like myself lately. ive had these symptoms as long as i can remember (which isnt a lot) but the intensity and frequency has been may more since maybe march. i had started zoloft 50 mg and had been taking it very inconsistently, sometimes taking more than needed if i wanted a change in feeling. it was a bad time for me. 

i feel disconnected from almost everything. myself, people around me, places, emotions, school. i feel like i cant feel my body but i can? or like its in a different place than how im feeling it. my emotions feel more like a physical sensation in/on my body rather than a feeling. when im sad its like a feeling in my chest and face. like light pressure. i dont feel the same as how i used to when i‚Äôd cry. hell i can barely cry anymore without listening to music. i find it hard to even focus my eyes on things, unfocusing my eyes just feels easier. 

i‚Äôll see moving shadow figures and random things moving that arent even there, especially in the dark. ive almost tripped over nothing because i thought i saw my dog walking between my legs. it just affects everything and everywhere. i dont remember most of my day bc i spent it completely disconnecting from my surroundings. i just feel like im just in my brain. with one blink it feels like im in a new conscious mind and nothing i just did even happened. the memory is so bad. i feel like i cant remember anything. i often see things around me as 2d or that the objects around me are images on a flat plane. i have a hard time recognizing anything anymore, sometimes people. all my memories have no meaning to me. i feel nothing when i think of good memories, when i think of bad memories. i dont know what it could have stemmed from. i dont even think i remember all of my trauma i just wanna know the root. theres just static when i think about the past, the future, the present. its just all static and fog. i get really paranoid when i look at myself in the mirror. nothing even stands out its just another thing. no definition, no significance."

**Now to talk about the album and the subject matter itself**. To note: I'm not in any way shape or form trying to belittle dementia by comparing it to derealazing, but it's the only thing I have actually experienced under the umbrella of losing one's self and that is why I'm hugely referencing it. The music itself, even if I didn't get to the end of the 6 hour masterpiece is an incredibly beautiful piece of artwork really. It felt like it hit so close to home even if what they were portraying was a long life struggle the 20 minute format the video was in was the best representation in words I've ever seen describing someone lose themselves. Maybe because it was so short it hit so close since my episodes usually never last more then a few hours, even if its supposed to portray a disease that eats slowly at someone on the matter of years. Even if dementia is memory related, and I might have dug to deep here, I feel like the loss of that ones memories is directly correlated to the loss of ones self, what makes them them, the them loses itself and I believe that's why it felt to me at least like a walk I've done 100 times but this time the road was twisted to a destination that I couldn't remember, but of which I knew.

I am sorry for not being able to add more to the subject, but I greatly feel that saying more about the piece would mean much much less the intended. Even if I would want to talk more about hoe i see losing ones self in art, the piece should be let speak for itself. That is why I really recommend the video to be watched and maybe even the album been listened to in it entirety, because its worth it, it leaves you speechless the good kind of speechless and its an experience that's worth living.

&#x200B;

**My own experience with listening to the 20 minute video about the album:**

I usually listen to documentaries in the shower, the burning water hitting my skin caresses with soft spoken voices of things that otherworldly, world or so much resembling one that it switches to the other. Never had I felt the need to stop a video unless I didn't understand a sentence, but this time I needed to stop it because it felt like life flashing in front of my eyes while I was seeing dark, when all it was were my hands flickering into a void cause they felt the need to be held, while I was carelessly watching not nurturing like id usually do. The moment I stopped the video that moment my tears from the words heard before had stopped. That moment the panic settled in. That moment my hands went sporadically to scratch myself, as the me that's me when I'm not here was trying to itch the outside layer of myself off from my inner self to protect it, like a dog at an owners gravestone after the panic of loss had settled, they feeling of a knife at their neck while sobbing numbly. While the harsh finger nails were digging deep into my back and although what I was actually watching with my very eyes was a blurry representation of what was in front of me, I felt as if I was in my head or as if my brain was making me choose to also me in the back of my head. Watch myself from a 3rd person perspective in my head on a chair in a large room as large as many men greater then me had been driven mad at the thought of its size before. I was watching a horrid yet unusually calm video being played on a wall with a projector. The mini film playing was of me in the position my body had been seemingly stuck in for the time being as a young woman on a wooden stool, that made the decision to turn herself into stone, at the end resembling a Greek statue, in fear that the rodents at her feet would eat her up. The shots of the movie playing go as follows, the woman on the stool, the rodents come to her feet, she makes no change in expression. Following shots are zoomed in on each part of her body from the feet to the head. You can feel her fear as soon as you'd think the human eating mice would touch her flesh, then her feet turn into stone, what follows is a chase, a chase inside her mind, a chase of her being turned into stone while the rodents go up her petrified self, she makes no change in facial expression, but i feel her experiencing a courageous breakthrough as before her right hand is turned into sculpted marble she waves it in the air, leading to her final stone shape as an angel reaching for heaven. The movie playing then goes back to a full shot of the woman. The rodents that were on her frail body before disappear as fast as they came. They didn't puff in thin air, they didn't care what happened next their goal was defeated. With a glitch of the movie tape being played the switch from one frame to the other leads to their disappearance. The movie felt like was in slow motion, but my mind was making me watch myself watch it in a speed up manner so much that it seemed so distorted.

I am rarely able to state what happens in a derealization/disassociation mind set but this time it cut off right before amnesia kicked in. It cut off in a way making me feel complete, like if one second less or more had happened it would have all been shattered. It left me feeling complete, as if I had finally understood that I am what reality makes of myself, that is if reality even is, which I have not making that feeling even more strange yet familiar at the same time.

This YouTube rabbit hole has to have been the best one I've ever fallen in. I am deeply sorry for my lack of better words in which I didn't add much to the original, other then my experience and that is simply because during my listening of it I felt as it spoke for me.

Thank you for listening to my rant about this topic, its highly appreciated if you did get to the end, but now i have to ask you, how did it make you feel?

Do y‚Äòall dissociate more with certain people around you?,11,k3zr1o,4,I feel like when I‚Äôm with certain friends I dissociate more than with other friends. How can this happen ?
Is it dissociation?,23,k3y1o8,2,"I was pretty certain that I experience dissociation, but a conversation with a mental health nurse today has made me very confused and unsure.

I experience periods where I scroll mindlessly on my phone, not registering what I'm looking at or what is around me, just scrolling and thinking, but not knowing what I'm even thinking, time is just passing - the nurse says that this sounds more like ""avoidance"" than dissociation, which has thrown me, because I found that grounding techniques such as rolling ice cubes on my head, having a hot bath and using hot smells could 'snap' me out of it, so I'm now paranoid that I've been making the whole thing up - I know that probably makes no sense.

I also get into a 'self hatred spiral', where I am attacked by derogatory thoughts and am unable to focus on anything around me, all I can do is curl up with these thoughts and it's so difficult to get out of; I also believed this might be a form of dissociation, but now I'm not so sure.

To your knowledge, does this sound like dissociation or just avoidance?"
Has anyone dissociated for anything longer than a few days?,16,k3q038,17,"&#x200B;

My ex-partner *accidentally* drugged me and this caused me to have dissociative seizures, where I faded in and out of consciousness. tw- >!he then took advantage of me.!<

That was in march, and I'm coming on 8 months now where I've been continuously dissociating, specifically experiencing derealization. I have a therapist but I ditched him because he never talked about my dissociation when I did, and I have a new appointment on december 3. 

I've been in multiple car accidents (5/6 were with inanimate objects and 1/6 was with a guy who hit me on purpose), had 2 suicide attempts and been in and out of the hospital for some physical abuse. I'm saying this because it has severely impacted my dissociation and, I think, prolonged it.

I experience derealization due to a prolonged freeze + flop response that I've been doing since I was 10 years old. I just don't know why its gone on for this long.

 I've been doing research, after not doing so for months (I thought thinking about it more would make it worse but I've since then started DBT), and I've only read personal stories of people saying they've dissociated for at most, 4 months. 

**tldr; Most people seem to dissociate for days even? I'd like to know how much of an outlier my experience is so let me what your longest episode has been.**"
Questioning what happened here,12,k3h4sp,3,"Did anyone experience feeling like a new being in their body, hearing demeaning voices and child voices, age sliding, etc and an amnesiac barrier beforehand? And being stuck in that state for longer than you should have, though the voices and visual hallucinations ended?

And believing that you weren‚Äôt the person you were before and didn‚Äôt have the same identity
As that you 
And when you realized what it was...(me through research) your brain rewired to include the past you And their associations 

Because I had emotional amnesia, delusions that I wasn‚Äôt the same Amanda and I was a baby...i believed that my thoughts and words weren‚Äôt my own...
And obviously I split off from that consciousness     And formed new neural associations i guess But then regained my personality and all those old associations when I realized that I was the same girl"
ADHD medicine making me dissociate?,15,k3h40z,10,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve had some sort of dissociation for a pretty long time now, most probably as a result of childhood trauma. I‚Äôm not ongoing family therapy to address that trauma which of course, makes me dissociate more. For reference, as a kid I had the feeling of being in my own bubble, like if I was isolated from everyone around me, especially in crowded or school settings. I smoked weed a couple times from the age of 13 and started getting bad dissociation when I smoked, so I stopped and continued trying it a few more times but soon realized that most of the time it resulted in me dissociating, last time I smoked is September (made me see weird, kinda delayed in a way, feel isolated from the outside world, hard to move and feel like I kept waking up and drifting back to a sorta sleep while still being able to interact with my surroundings). Weed definitely triggered this sort of dissociation and I don‚Äôt plan on touching that shit again. 

Anyways, I got back on ADHD meds beginning of october (Vyvanse 20mg) and seem to be dissociating more (short periods but pretty much everyday) since i started. I made a test and stopped for a couple days this week and almost didn‚Äôt dissociate at all. I took them today and it started again. The thing is, I can‚Äôt just not take ADHD meds long term, as my grades suck in school and i have no motivation whatsoever without them. 

Anyone has similar experiences? Any other meds that didn‚Äôt do that? Stuff I can do to help it? I took an appointment with my psychiatrist about the meds but i‚Äôm curious to see if i‚Äôm alone in this and how i can help it."
Do y‚Äôall know what caused your dissociation?,5,k3gpfn,19,"I‚Äôm thinking about this a lot, when and why it started. I once consumed too much weed and had a lot of traumas happening in that time, so I think it‚Äôs a combination of everything.

How you're CREATING dissociation/dpdr by feeling in REVERSE [MIND-BLOWING],18,k0bcw4,2,"Trying to find an explanation for your emotions and understand what they mean before you feel them? üòè

The paradox is that you want to be spontaneous, quick, go with the flow, but at the same time you still want to have the control on how you feel and you get frustrated when you don't feel what ""you should feel"", you should feel more, you shouldn't feel this, it doesn't make any sense, it's not the right time etc.

Finding an explanation, cause, meaning, answer, story, justification for your feelings before you immerse yourself in them. And on the long-term you start to feel numb. You start to feel detached from yourself. And what do you do? You try to ""mentally fix it from above"". How?

By TRYING to feel, checking in, double checking, trying to so hard to feel, idealizing your old self and how much life was good back then, a constant mental effort in wanting and trying so hard to get your emotions back - and at the same time discarding spontaneous feelings when they come out of nowhere because they do not meet your logical criteria of how you're supposed to feel in this moment - and instead of just feeling without knowing why, you REACT with fear, anxiety and panic.

It's not a problem of not having emotions, it's a problem of - you guessed it - CONTROL. üëå

These are quick mental fixes from above to an unconscious problem. The answer is found not in trying so hard, but in RELEASING that control! You don't realize that you have the answer right in front of you, however uncomfortable it may be, the moment you stop trying so hard!

This constant mental effort of trying to change how you feel and editing your internal experience to another ""more pleasurable channel"" and forcing it to be different creates even more stress, overwhelm, chaos, distance with yourself. You want to be spontaneous but you're not willing to 'do' what it takes be really spontaneous: LET GO OF CONTROL.

I call this ""reverse feeling"" and it's a dissociative mechanism whereby you're putting logical prerequisites before the actual experience of the emotion.

Learn how the solution lies not in 'getting rid of it' but understanding what this mechanism is doing for you and if you really need it, keep it! No one is forcing you to get better, you can always stay where you are!

Getting used to feeling WITHOUT KNOWING WHY and BEING OK with it is one of the biggest favors you can do to yourself. Funny enough the moment you stop looking for the why, precisely when you don't care about it, that's when the answer comes to you.

How to Focus While Dissociating?,8,jzmqjb,2,"I've been dissociating for most of my life, whether it be daydreaming throughout my entire fourth grade math class or forgetting weeks or months as they pass by. Yesterday, however, it was like a reached a whole new level of disconnection from myself. My vision kept un-focusing, I couldn't read anything longer than three sentences, and my friend's voice (which I'd been hearing/talking with for about hour before this hit) basically went in one ear and out the other. It felt like any weak connection I had to my existence had been totally severed; my brain and my body were legitimately two separate entities. I've pretty much been stuck in this state since yesterday, and it's preventing me from getting any schoolwork done. I'm majorly behind in one of my classes and have a bunch of essays and assignments due tomorrow, so I need to find a way to work. 

Unfortunately, grounding myself is not something I can afford to do right now. I've never been able to deal with my emotions well, and I'm not in a safe enough space to process all of it. I've grounded myself through breathing exercises and the 5-4-3-2-1 thing before, and because of the flood of emotions that crashes onto me when I'm back in my body, I usually end up more miserable than when I started. For me, not feeling anything is the best way to deal with things for the time being. Not necessarily healthy, I know, but it's what I've got. So besides grounding, is there anything I can do to get my work done?

Again, I'm totally dissociated as I write this now, so none of this is really making any sense to me. Feel free to point out any typos/grammar mistakes/literal nonsense.

**TLDR;** Without grounding myself, what can I do to focus while being dissociated? Do you guys have any helpful techniques?"

A life of circumstances,3,jzep13,0,"I never tried to control my life and now I am living my partners life. I got by in my 7 year relationship by not minding what happens.

DAE not know what they are saying as they are saying it?,53,jzbkg3,20,"I just want to know why. In my head I keep repeating, ‚Äúit‚Äôs because you‚Äôre crazy‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou just think you‚Äôre going crazy for the drama‚Äù but even those thoughts seem not-mine. They‚Äôre in English, my second language. I find that when I have thoughts in English, they‚Äôre about what I think I‚Äôm *supposed* to think, the right response, the predictable narrative outcome. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm not crazy. I think, ‚ÄúI must be making it up for attention‚Äù, but even that thought is in English, so its source isn‚Äôt truly me. English is such a fictional language and this goes beyond English. 

I‚Äôve tried to type so many posts only to backspace. In short, my biggest fear is that I will be found out. It‚Äôs like if your friend sitting next to you was playing an online competitive game, one you barely understand, and suddenly he hands you the controller and tells you to take over while he goes do some things. When I respond to my mother and I am in the middle of a sentence, the controller is passed to me suddenly and I stop in the middle of the sentence. I don‚Äôt know what thought I was saying or what our conversation is about. But I somehow utter the words that someone put in my mouth as though awkwardly turning the gears in a wind-up toy. I slur words or mix up syllables or sounds. Say the wrong word or sounds out of order. I am afraid that she will ask if something‚Äôs wrong and I will have no escape. She will know I‚Äôm not who I‚Äôm supposed to be. 

Sometimes, I‚Äôll replay a mind recording of the conversation I don‚Äôt remember choosing words for, and determine that my answers do in fact make sense despite everything. Other times I fear I came too close to the being found out part. 

Please. Does anyone else feel this. I‚Äôm so tired. My thoughts are everywhere and this is my fourth attempt at this post. Thank you

EDIT: I did not expect people to actually respond thoughtfully and now that I'm less scatterbrained I feel very grateful. Thank you again"

Can someone help me with doubts about DID and dissociating? (long post sorry),4,jxprkg,4,"So, I've been searching a lot about DID and it fascinates me, but I've noticed some things about myself as well and I'm not really sure if I would fit in the spectrum?

From the start, I think I might dissociate but I'm not really sure because sometimes, not sure why (my main theory is stress so far) I blank out. Like, I start staring at nothing and my vision gets all blurry and I feel extremely lethargic and simply stop moving or move slowly in repetitive movements if I was doing something like drawing (the lines get thicker and more pointy), but my brain, my mind, keeps in there very aware and hyper-focused on my hearing and my thoughts as if I'm not there and there at the same time.

I've been going to a therapist as well lately and I discovered that I don't feel emotions, I can still read a situation and know if I should be happy, sad, angry or whatever else and I may notice more subtle ones like stress when I notice a lack of appetite and hair loss during my daily or weekly routine. And there are cases where I think I feel something as when you're happy you feel your chest heating up, right? I think I felt that once in my life when I was little but that's everything I got. I don't feel it anymore, if anything, I may laugh or smile in front of others to keep appearance or even alone (but when I'm alone it happens only after something funny that was unexpectable happens and a second later it's gone, and it's all numb, no feeling at all, just a change in expression that disappears just like that).

I mentioned my therapist because yesterday she asked me to draw myself when I was little so that we could work on that (I can draw with some confidence as I've done it for six years now?) and I did it, but the thing is, I drew myself as five different characters.

The thing is, all those characters are the same, at different ages and using slightly different clothes and have different names and one of them has a nickname.

First, I drew Sara, she's a teenager, I think, and she uses a green-bluish sweater with a hoodie over her head, the hoodie has cat ears stitched on it as well as a small cat face that has stitches for eyes and mouth (it looks sad as the ears and mouth are downwards), and a button for the nose, the hoodie as well as a long ribbon attached to it on the back as if it was a three-coloured tail with another button at the end. The hoodie is big, but not overly big, and she has very short shorts and a three-colored pantyhose wherein one leg the strips are small and the other the strips are really big. She is sitting on a staircase, that was where I used to sit at my school, and she looks really sad/bored. I didn't draw her shoes. Her hair is really long with a single pink stripe on her long fringe and the end of her long hair dyed as well.

The next one I did was Alexa (Kat is her nickname) she seems slightly younger than Sara and her hair is significantly shorter, while Sara's go all the way to her back Alexa's stop on her shoulders. She ties a portion of her side and fringe back and she has the hoodie tied to her waist, she has a small blouse that one short sleeve while the other side only has a strip, the shorts and pantyhose are the same, and she uses braces. She has the same stripe of hair dyed on her long fringe. Oh, and as she has the hoodie tied to her waist she was the ribbon tail as well as it is lifted in the air as if it can move on its own (Sara's ribbon is mostly stagnated and acts like a normal ribbon should). She seems to be really happy and energetic as well as confident in herself.

Then there's the older, she really doesn't like a name as, after I drew all of them, each time I saw one a name popped up in my head and she really didn't want one so she's just called the older. She uses glasses and, as her ""name"" says she is the older one with the most mature face. Her hair is really short, above shoulders, and she doesn't have the stripe, but she does have some dye on the ends of her hair, a very light dye but no idea what color. I only drew her upper body and she used the same shirt as Alexa but she does not have the hoodie on her and I have the impression she uses normal jeans and plain shoes. She just looks like a responsible adult taking care of the others.

Then there's May, she looks to be the smallest of all of them, she likes to use a heck ton of makeup and her hair is as long, if not longer, than Sara's. I have no idea what clothes she is using as I drew only her head but it looks to be the same pink shirt and her his is dyed in the same way as Sara's. She seems somewhat confident and slutty but something tells me she's a crybaby and too cocky for her own good even if she's really small, not sure of her age tought, she seems to be eight, but her expression says fucking cocky and dumb adult.

And lastly, there's Mia. She was the strangest one to draw as I started ""blanking out"" A LOT when I was doing her. She seems to be the older's age and she uses the hoodie, but the ears are not there as horns seem to have grown on her head torning the hoodie in the process. She has huge and heavy shackles on her wrists and her hands have long black claws. Her mouth is shut by what looks to be metal bands of some sort and her hair is shoulder length but it's not curly and well taken care of like the others, but it still is dyed in the same place. She has a huge ""X"" scar on her face and she has blood on the corner of her eyes and mouth. I drew her three times, one was only her face, the second she screaming as her claws gripped he head e through the hoodie so hard she broke her skin and it started to bleed as her eyes are closed and her mouth opened in a silent scream while the metal bands that previously kept it shut shredded her lips and blood started to pour out. The third one is her with her head on the floor and her hands in front of her.

The strangest thing is, I blanked out a lot when drawing her, I totally remember drawing her and I did it with my own hand but I would start blanking out and more thick and rigid lines appeared and I remember doing them when I was on the back of my mind, but just looking at the drawing so I can write about it makes me start feeling like I'm baking out again.

And I really don't have too much memory of my childhood, for me, it is a common thing but maybe not? Like, I just remember bits and pieces here and there but it's very fuzzy in a lot of points and I really remember nothing with certainty before my 13th anniversary?

I think these blanking outs would be disassociation, right? I know people say they can see themselves when it happens but I don't, like, I can if I want to even when I'm not disassociating but I simply don't, I keep in the blank out state as it's comfortable, I feel at peace? Maybe it's the only time I really feel something and my chest feels strange and I simply like to keep on that state, but I know I shouldn't so I relish on the feeling for a few seconds, sometimes some minutes, before coming back and fighting to not disassociate again.

Keep in mind that all these ""alters"" for lack of a better name, are very alike if not the same person in different ages or states of mind (I think this is the case). They all have different personalities and qualities and different names, or lack of, as I do have a name, but nome of them answered to it as even I'm not very fond of it, like, I don't have problems with my name, I just don't care?

And sometimes I've felt like other people talked to me in my head, like, the voice is the same as mine, but slightly different at the same time depending on their personality? For example, sometimes I'm just hearing a lot of bullshit like ""You're an ungrateful brat, idiot, worthless"" and all that fun stuff before another one coming and being like ""stop this shit already, just ignore it"". When this starts I feel like my head is in a hurricane of bad thoughts until this other voice comes and I just stop listening to it and, eventually, it stops and all feelings are gone.

TLDR: I think I may have alters but I do not switch, or at least have not switched for a long time as before my 13th, or 12th, birthday I remember nothing other than bits and pieces, and I'm just not really sure what it may be. Or I'm just stupid and crazy... Oh well.

I'm really afraid of telling my therapist this shit ,-, I already have enough problems as it is with my emotions, or lack of, in this case."
dissociation and how it affects me i think?,4,jxkioe,2,"sorry for mentioning bts if that triggers some of you that may read this aha. i just thought itd be good to include an example of how i think or something idk. the song is also called ""life goes on"" :)

bts's new song came out and the bridge/chorus really made me think. 

it goes: ""there's no end in sight, is there a way out? my feet refuse to move oh. close your eyes for a moment, hold my hand. to that future, lets run away"" 

i dont know why but it makes me want to cry. i eventually did cry while watching the mv again lol. it made me think of myself. like how i dont think there will be an end to my dissociated consciousness and feelings. i dont know if there'll be a way out of it or a way to help me. then the rest just like really idk. lol. 

idk how it makes me feel but i just think its like. idk. do i want that? someone like that i mean. someone to grasp ahold of my hand and help me move forward? i just want someone with me that i can talk to and be comfortable with and maybe with them being there it'll help me. their warmth will help me maybe. 

i wasnt really sure what dissociation was awhile ago and looked up something that was similar and saw dissociation and clicked it. i read it and it seemed pretty accurate to what i thought was going on with myself so i self diagnosed myself aha. reading some peoples' descriptions and definitions of it helped me realize certain situations or episodes ive had were a part of dissociation. 

i forget pretty much the whole day, i cant remember anything from past days, i cant even remember what day of the week it is even if ive asked multiple times within 30 minutes, nor keep track if the day of the week is or mistake it for a different day. 

my memory has gotten significantly worse and i often find myself zoning out while thinking about nothing. my brain feels so blank even as im writing this. my body feels so blank and empty. i cant feel emotions anymore but i might be able to subconsciously know how im feeling sometimes, but not physically feel anything related to emotions. everything i do seems so empty. 

i read about the grounding but im unsure on where to start and how to do it. im glad theres a subreddit on this aha, i didnt even know there was until my friend showed and told me about a post they made awhile ago so they could try to help me."
First episode after a long while,3,jxjeia,0,"So I've commented here and there the past few months, trying to help others without actually dissociating myself. My last episode was at the beginning of quarantine in like, April. Anyway, I'm in a very odd state right now. My long term partner has been visiting but the only way she could get here was by her other partner bringing her, who is pretty new and someone I hadn't met yet. At first, she had family she was going to stay with but somehow it turned out she is staying here as well. I thought I'd be fine because I'm not a jealous person and I was grateful for her making the trip happen. But I've been very emotional and angry, as has the other partner. That has led to us all 3 being emotionally charged. It came to blows today and now I'm completely drained. I had a panic attack because I made a big decision without thinking about it enough. Since then, I've dissociated. I think I'm still scared but I can't actually feel it."
Does anyone else experience these symptoms too?,7,jxehr1,1,"I‚Äôve been struggling with dissociation for over two years know and I‚Äôm still not sure what caused it.

I(19F) need help/advice about how to ground myself,32,jx7qes,10,"I never knew that what I was going through had a name. When I was younger I would go into movie theaters and watch movies/read books and be completely immersed in what was happening. By the time I had finished the book or the movie was over I‚Äôd feel very off and not like myself. It‚Äôs like I was in the world, I just thought I was connecting to whatever media I was interacting with. But lately it‚Äôs been caused by my dreams. I‚Äôd have such vivid dreams and I‚Äôd wake up feeling differently about other people and my own reality. I just can‚Äôt grasp what‚Äôs happened was fake and it‚Äôs like everything in my reality is now in another perspective. I zone out and it‚Äôs really hard for me to concentrate on whatever I‚Äôm doing or what reality I‚Äôm in. Honestly I could freak out but right now I‚Äôm kind of experiencing it. But I have work to do and I want it to stop. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to ground myself?

I don‚Äôt even feel like myself anymore. I try not to cry but i can‚Äôt help it.

Question for people with bad memory loss going back to childhood,32,jwpg2f,16,"I have dissociative amnesia to where I can‚Äôt remember a lot of parts of my childhood and even pass that going into elementary, middle and high school. 

What I‚Äôve been questioning to myself now that I‚Äôm older is, 
Was I disassociating through all those younger years of my life? 
or
Have I only been disassociating after my high school years and that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt remember my past?

Does anyone with childhood memory loss have a guess to which one sounds more accurate?"
Struggling to Let Go,19,jwgqlb,10,"Does anyone feel like they have trouble letting their body take over itself when trying to ground for an extended period of time? Every time I try, I keep stopping. I notice the changes in my body and I begin to get uncomfortable. I know I‚Äôm heading towards a good place(home) and the changes are positive but what‚Äôs next once I get there? How will I feel? Will I feel depressed, excited or just plain normal? Will I return to the awful realization that brought me to where I am now? How do I live my life in a place I‚Äôve been gone from for so long? I don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs very frightening for me. Does anybody else feel this and if you do how‚Äôd you break out of it once you did?"
Is this ‚Äúnormal‚Äù?,2,jwflbi,5,"My SO gets angry with me or bored And about every 3 to 4 months will cheat on me in one way, shape or form.

Hearing screams when dissociating?,7,jw7vb9,13,"hi i (F16) dissociate sometimes, and sometimes I hear screaming in the back of my head. It feels like everything around me is suddenly very loud, and I know through my ears it's actually a normal volume, and if someone is speaking it's never in a yelling tone, but in my head the volume is way up and it feels really overwhelming. I can hear this far away scream in the back of my mind at the same time, it feels like i'm hearing the sound and making it at the same time. Ive had a recurring dream with the exact same scream in the background in the sense that it feels the same. This doesnt usually last too long, never longer than about 10 minutes id say, and i cant pinpoint why it happens, sometimes itll be during a test other times its just listening to music on the bus. Has anyone else had this experience? frankly im a bit scared but ive never had an episode of any kind or been diagnosed with a disorder"
thoughts and experiences,1,jw74gy,2,"Hello all

I (20f) have experienced certain aspects of disassociation for a while now, and am doing a research project on Disassociation/Depersonalization/Derealisation for uni. i thought this would be an interesting and informal way to gather information on how different people experience Disassociation... If you would like to participate, simply comment some of your experiences -past or present-, thoughts, feelings, etc. as someone who experiences Disassociation. you can be as detailed or non-detailed as you‚Äôd like, and likewise share anything you feel comfortable sharing."
so what exactly is dissociation?,4,jw3ncd,2,"so what info i got about dissociation, is that dissociation is basically detachment from reality, ive seen people say that foods lose taste and fun activities arent fun anymore so therefore its anhedonia / depression guaranteed, another thing is that its caused from a trauma /panic diaorder and also causes us too become detached from your own thoughts and feelings - therefore we are unable to truly realize whats causing Dd , which makes it even harder to fight it .so to summarize - we space out alot, activities arent fun anymore , nothing feels real, we are constantly stuck in our head with anxiety that we cannot even fight, .....
.....whack"
Does looking the mirror help anyone else?,6,jw12hx,10,I'm thinking of buying a small mirror to carry with me to look myself in the eyes ever so often. Anyone else do that? Anyone find mirrors helpful?
Had a bad weed trip and have not been the same since,5,jw0bp9,8,"About a month ago I decided to smoke some weed with my friends. I‚Äôm not a regular smoker but that day I felt like it - WISH I HADNT. My friend gave me a hit from his pipe and I really didn‚Äôt feel anything so I took another big hit and kept it in for very long. At first I got giggly but before I knew it I felt like I had to get up and started to feel my heart racing. That‚Äôs when my friend told me this strain of sativa had the highest THC content at the dispensary- no kidding! I told them I wanted to walk, I needed to move so we did and btw we were outdoors. And then as we walked a million thoughts went through my head in the span of two minutes and I had to stop. I had a mini existencial crisis. My life felt meaningless like I was just part of this big simulation like it wouldn‚Äôt matter if I died but if I did would I just be another kid in the news that others would forget about? I felt like my fight or flight was on and I felt like an animal trying to run away from danger. Why was I the main character in this situation? Am I the main character, but why me? And then I just felt like there was no point to anything and that this is what people who are about to die feel and then I FELT LIKE I WAS DYING. I thought I was going to die. My friends told me they were gonna walk me home and I felt safer but I was still gone. My mind was elsewhere and I could see my body walking. And then I decided that I would let go that that was it. So I threw myself in feb grass with my eyes closed and prepared to die. And then the sunlight hit me directly and I knew I couldn‚Äôt just let go yet so I stood up and began to yell ‚ÄúCALL 911‚Äù. My friends tried to calm me down but I kept saying I needed to go to the hospital so they finally called 911. The ambulance came and the paramedics took my vitals and assured me I was fine and that I was just having a bad trip and that my friends would take care of me. I live in a very liberal college town so no one got in trouble. Then my friends took me home and we got pizza and I was fine.

But since then my depression has come back, I‚Äôve had lots of anxiety, I feel like I‚Äôm literally going insane. I‚Äôm a bit of a hypochondriac and having my brain play tricks on me about dying has made me more scared about illness and death because now I feel like I know what dying would feel like. I‚Äôve been sleeping less.

The only moments when I feel like I can truly escape my mind are when I drink with my friends.

Since that day I feel like I need to be doing something to escape like eating, or smoking cigarettes, or taking adderall , or drinking, or smoking hybrid strains (those don‚Äôt give me paranoia) or just walking. Worst is I‚Äôm thinking of doing other drugs like Xanax that can just help me.

I feel dissociated from reality in a way and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real or not anymore. I have a lot of existencial questions and I‚Äôm very scared every second of the day and have an awful gut feeling. I wanna cry and scream. I just want to feel normal again."
"TW//death. My parents are angry I don‚Äôt have my license, but my dissociation is too bad",4,jvz324,3,"TW// mention of death

My parents got me (17F) into drivers ed when i was 15. I passed the class, but i put off getting my license for a month, then two months.. then a year, then two years. My parents remind me every day that I should have my license and how irresponsible I am (mostly my step mother.) The thing is, when i was in my freshman year of HS my very close family friend died. He was a few years older than me, and we were very close. he passed away on his way to work when the driver fell asleep while driving, and they went off the road. This was extremely hard for me to handle, and I couldn‚Äôt even get myself to go into a car for months. I would have panic attacks whenever i was in a car or if my friends or family were in a car. Eventually i got myself to be comfortable enough to be in a car, but even to this day I restlessly watch the road and panic. Well, I also have dissociation from a young age, and when i drive not only do I panic because of what happened to my friend, but I get so dissociated that i feel like i‚Äôm not there. i could close my eyes and nothing is real, that scares me when it comes to driving. what if i dissociate while driving? what if i panic? what if i fall asleep? my dissociation is so severe I cant even feel my body when i‚Äôm driving. I‚Äôm scared i will lose control of the wheel. I want my license one day, but right now i am so bad mentally i can‚Äôt do it. my parents do Not understand. every day they talk about it, i‚Äôve even offered to pay them back for the Drivers Ed money. they know I have PTSD and they know i have dissociation, but still they don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt just ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù and get my license. I‚Äôm not sure what i‚Äôm looking for here, maybe just some encouraging words? i‚Äôm tired of being told i‚Äôm lazy and irresponsible."
Sometimes Movies Feel More Real Than My Reality,70,jvyuwr,6,"ive (17F) had dissociation from a very young age due to childhood trauma. it feels like as time passes it‚Äôs just getting worse. I often lose myself in movies and shows and books just to feel alive. When i‚Äôm reading or watching films it feels real, it feels More real than reality. Then when i step out of that world, my life feels even more fake. At this point nothing feels real and everything looks as if someone turned the sharpness setting a little too high. Watching series after series and reading books are the only thing keeping me sane at this point, they make me feel alive, but i‚Äôm so scared of wasting my life away. time passes and passes and i still feel the same, i still feel wrong. Do you guys feel that way? do movies and books often feel more real than reality? I‚Äôm scared and wish this feeling would go away. I can‚Äôt even remember what it felt like to be normal."

Despersonalization and weed,1,jvn642,1,"Hi, i need help please. I had to quit drugs because of the despersonalization, but i miss them so much. At the beggining i had this dissociative episodes by smoking weed and doing extasis. They weren‚Äôt frecuent at first, but with time it got worse so i had to stop smoking. Then I started having desrealizations without being high. My question is, Im not going to be able to smoke weed or use drugs no more? The desrealization may be consecuense of the sudden sobriety? Im 273 sober now, do u think its safe to use again without going craizy?"
This time is different,3,jvkvb1,0,"First let me say my therapist is aware of my situation and called me today. I see her Wednesday as well. My psychiatrist also has a call placed in to her about my state of mind but hasn‚Äôt gotten back yet. 

I‚Äôve dissociated off and on since I can remember. Of course I didn‚Äôt understand or know that‚Äôs what this feeling was. 
From ages 2 (my first memory of it or anything really) to age 17 I was sexually abused and assaulted by my grandfather. I lived with him for several years of this period and stayed nights and sometimes weeks with him. I have been diagnosed in hospital (mental) with severe depression disorder, severe ptsd and anxiety disorder, later on with bipolar 2. 

I‚Äôve never cared for the dissociative state (it‚Äôs never lasted more than 30 minutes average.) 
It always seemed disconnected and not ‚Äúme.‚Äù

However I‚Äôve felt on a downward spiral for a couple of months (headed toward depressive episode, but I was fighting it) and my adoptive mom died on November 12th. I thought I was ok, handling it well. 
Until Sunday. In the middle of church I felt an almost literal jerk feeling and a switch had been flipped. 

A warm blanket felt like it had been wrapped around me and and I sank into it‚Äôs beautiful comfort. My emotions (happy, sad, anger, grief, all of them)...gone but what was left felt so good. Silence. Relief. I smiled just thankful it was peaceful. 

My only complaints are a few memory issues. (I have trouble with stuff I really should KNOW) and feeling a bit more tired. 

I really want to keep this feeling around for a long while. It‚Äôs very familiar now that I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôd like to stay. [blank stare](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHrN_RkFYtS/?igshid=3h80cicm6uky)

Included is a pic of me between ages 4-7. I had the same facial expression that I feel now after the switch.  It‚Äôs odd. Maybe I was switched off there too. It‚Äôs more the far off look in the eye that gives it away. I stayed kinda in a distant state at a young age."
I need help,1,jvjr6c,0,I‚Äôve thought of so many things that could be causing what I‚Äôm feeling but I can‚Äôt figure it out. I thought maybe I just had to much caffeine and my body was having a bad reaction. But I noticed while I was sitting on the toilet after brunch with my ex step mom that my legs were feeling weird and then when I stood up it felt like I was having delays. I got so scared I was drugged because when I was younger I used to smoke and it felt like I was having delays and super sensitive yet numb skin like only physically I don‚Äôt hear auditory delays or delays when watching a video but only body delays like when I adjust my head on my pillow ect it felt so much longer to do so and sensitive yet felt numb idk how to explain it is it possible to only have bodily functioning delays due to dissociating. I have been diagnosed with GAD but stop taking lexapro because I hated the side affect hellppp
Society Confuses Me,3,jvix6t,0,"Hi guys! I'm newly (within the past 3 years) diagnosed bipolar 1, and I think I have been disassociating for a long time. I have always thought my memory is broken, or that I may have ADHD, but I am now thinking I disassociate almost constantly. When situations become too stressful or emotional, my body and mind goes numb or blank. I can be really into an argument, but it seems like once I hit a certain point, I just go blank and numb and can't find any words. In periods when this goes on for months at a time, I become basically catatonic and find myself questioning society and losing hope in humanity. When I am really depressed, my mind also goes ""blank"". When I am manic, I am an ordinary person again; I love being social and I am productive at work, etc. I do see a therapist and psych, and I am going to talk to them about this, I just wanted some input for anyone who already struggles with this. Does this sound like disassociation? Has anyone had any similar experiences or feelings? Thank you so much in advance :)"
Can isolation cause dissociation?,4,jvf7tv,2,I‚Äôve been isolated for around 8 months and for a while now I‚Äôve been feeling very strange and couldn‚Äôt describe it well at all but after looking into it I‚Äôm almost sure it‚Äôs dissociation. I think I‚Äôve been like this for a while but I‚Äôm realizing it a lot more now because I went back to school last week. Can isolation cause dissociation?
"But the psychotherapist said ""you don't need therapy."" - Lessons learned from a functioning dissociated person.",4,jveqqs,5,"During the last year, I learned a lot about myself.   
I learned that this feeling of numbness and my inability to feel my own emotions is called ""dissociation"". I also learned that Psychedelics might be the best way for me to relearn what it means to be fully human, fully alive.   
 

A year ago, when I went through an especially dissociated phase, I pushed myself to see a therapist. After three appointments, she basically said that I don't need therapy. I told her about my dissociation but she said that she only knows that symptom from ""big T Trauma"" patients. And because I seem to have had a good childhood and no traumatic events in my life, she did not know what to do with me.   


What I since learned: 

* Being a ""functioning"" person does not mean that I am making my dissociation up out of nowhere.
* Small traumas exist. Not only complex PTSD, but also smaller events can cause dissociation. 
* **Dissociation caused by ""small t traumas"" are not well-known among psychotherapists**. If the person is able to keep up with her daily life, many mental health professionals assume that there is no problem to treat. (My response often was something like ""But I do not *feel* anything, isn't that a problem?"" and they pointed into the vague direction of ""maybe you have a too tight schedule, maybe its just a phase. Did you try meditating?..."")
* **Meditation made things worse for me.** A very helpful resource to know where this was coming from is this: [Mediation-induced dissociation](https://www.cheetahhouse.org/hyperarousal-and-dissociation). (They also have a monthly support group, although I didn't try that)
* I was afraid of getting talked into having a ""big T trauma"" when I digged deeper into my dissociation. Now I am fine with acknowledging that **I probably have some ""small t traumas""** that might be coming from comparatively innocent childhood neglect experiences. I do not have to make it bigger than it is, however, I also do not have to ignore them. 
* **Psychedelics, if used carefully, are probably one of the most effective ways of getting out of dissociation** (for me). See also this podcast by a professional psychotherapist, who tells the story about his own way of coping with dissociation caused by ""small t trauma"": [Spotify - Back from the Abyss](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CnRbabZPNs1dzxcBIcbpS?si=8f1fZ0hhRmqDeO-UCpDbUg). For me, psychedelics were incredibly helpful. I was able to get in touch with emotions I did not have for *years*.  


Hope this was helpful for some if you. 

**DISCLAIMER**: If you are planning to experiment with psychedelics, please be very very careful - they are insanely powerful substances. I only tried them for the first time after I read a book and lots of articles about psychedelic experiences and I hope you will do so as well. See it as yourself being the doctor **performing surgery on your own conciousness** \- you would want the doctor to study medicine really well.

turning dissociation into music,1,jvavez,3,"I've struggled with dissociative issues since I was 13 for 3 years now, and honestly it's still a huge problem but if there's 1 thing that's helped it's writing and producing music. Doing something creative is such a good way to feel connected to something and grounded, I would strongly recommend finding some kind of creative outlet like this, because it's helped me so much. Yesterday I released my 1st EP called 'spaceout!' (get it lol) and if you're interested here's a link to it x"
"Anyone ever finish a sentence, and then think about what you said after and it doesn't even feel like its yourself who said it.",106,jvarfi,11,
People think Im gaslighting them...,5,jv7vow,4,  People say that I am gaslighting them because I will say a sentence and they will argue until they are blue that its not what I said.  THIS DRIVES ME MAD. Or they will tell me Im not listening because I cant repeat word for word what was said or just plain forget whole conversations as they are happening and ask the same thing again.  Im very very new to this as my therapist just introduced me to this last week. I just want to know im not as crazy as I feel. It so lonely.. I can feel my whole inner being just shift anytime I want to have a serious conversation because I know its going to turn into a fight.  I try grounding myself but I thought it was just anxiety and I can't recognize Im not myself till its to late. Every single fight especially lately ends with me having a panic attack. That's another thing I was accused of faking.  I just want to understand myself so I can help others understand Im not trying to do these things on purpose....
Can we talk dissociation and sex?,27,jv6679,7, Sometimes I have a normal drive but mostly I don't want to be touched. My skin gets so overstimulated so easy it almost hurts when my hubby rubs my legs or back or whatever...   But other times its like Im manic and lets just say its the opposite lol. Im very new to this journey and Im not sure if the two are related. Anyone else experiencing something similar?
Is this dissociation??,6,jv1cph,1,"Long story short. 

Left a 10 year physical/emotional abusive relationship. Didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave time‚Äù for therapy as I was raising a baby by myself, worked 2 jobs, and went to school, so I basically pretended to the best of my ability to focus on the present moment. Fast forward over 2 years of learning the depths of mental health, consciousness, self love, spirituality, etc, experienced great highs but also kept relapsing with anxious lows. I haven‚Äôt given up as my mental health is extremely important to me, but it seems to be a vicious cycle of fear, anxiety, and ptsd. Tonight I realized the extent of my distraction/avoidance coping mechanisms, so I tried pinpointing when it started and found it was 3 years ago from the day my ex tried to kill me. I went to work and school continuing my day like it didn‚Äôt happen. I thought I was making progress by accepting the past and focus on the good things in life, but after analyzing this I feel it makes sense why I haven‚Äôt been able to connect or even give a chance to connect with my closest friends/family, or the fact I have no interest in doing so because any alone time I get, I spend learning about things that benefit my mental/physical health. I tend to wonder all the whys and how‚Äôs in all aspects of life, and the more I learn, the more each system doesn‚Äôt make sense to me! I feel as if we‚Äôre living in a simulation, and I‚Äôm just the odd ball out observing. 

Also, in early childhood I had major commitment issues which stemmed from fear of abandonment. I learned to suppress my feelings until I a few years ago so it‚Äôs been a riiiiiiiide lol. 

I am currently receiving psychotherapy, which we mainly focus on meditation, breathing, and skills on thoughts which have helped immensely. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to stop having flashbacks of those thoughts and feelings of fear. When I experience anxiety, 90% of the time I can use skills I‚Äôve learned and it helps, but certain triggers really have me going 0-100, quick! I can manage panic attacks, but they always seem to attack me in my dreams lol. My apologies on the unorganized mess of my thoughts! I am desperate to overcome this unhealthy pattern. 

Thank you in advance"
Not 100% sure if I am experiencing dissociation but these feelings are pretty much 24/7.,1,juzda4,4,"I feel stuck and helpless. I used to be funny and witty and make everyone laugh, but since I began to feel depressed, abuse drugs, etc. I began losing my sense of self. I feel I have no personality and am the shell of my former self. I just go through the motions in the blandest of ways. I have lost my sense of humor and ability to make others laugh and enjoy being around me. I have had strong hypochondria delusions(thinking I have schizophrenia, cancer, etc) I feel perpetually lost and often question whether or not I should end my life."
Everything triggers me,3,jutdsb,14,"Idk how people can be so tolerant towards the quirks of this world when everything always ends up making me dissociate and hit another psychosis, every single day. I can literally feel how writing this is unlatching my mind from reality and have it take off into a safer delusional world. I just hate existence, being inside of a body disgusts me so freaking much. I just hate how I can feel my bones and flesh around it and the thought alone makes me squirm. And other people disgust me so much and how apparent their primal urges are to me. How they spot someone they like and feel the urge to procreate. Like it just doesnt sit right with me and I dont want to live right among it where it happens. I would rather sit with corpses because they dont have those urges. I hate when people look at me because they absord my terestial body with their primitive brain and it makes me uncomfortable. Their pesky eyes, and their ulterior motives it is all very ugly. I want to die and live as some kind of fluid that keeps having dopamine rushes without the influence of something else. That would be pure, clean, and without any annoyances. I even thought about becoming a crack addict because that comes pretty close to it. Mindless, if not bodiless at least...."
I don't know. Am I dissociating?,12,juqzgo,4,Sometimes I can't feel my arms. I forget about some parts of the day. I sometimes am like... There? But its not me. Or at least I don't remember. I say things I would never say. Reality feels different sometimes. Harder or softer. Sometimes the lights are so bright. I don't know if any of this makes sense. I just need some clarity...
Everything loses color and gets significantly darker when I feel like I‚Äôm being verbally attacked or critically examined,56,jum5e2,8,"Ever since I was younger I‚Äôd have a specific response to being reprimanded or criticized. An offhand remark doesn‚Äôt bother me but those moments where the person is locking eyes with me and either telling me my faults and wrong doings or talking about me and my character at length, I will start to lose my surroundings a bit. Kind of like tunnel vision but everything, including the person I‚Äôm looking at, will lose color and everything seems significantly darker. I can kind of control it too, I can‚Äôt turn it off but I can make the feeling intensify or lighten slightly when I focus on it. 

Does anyone know what type of dissociation this is or experience this?

I find it an interesting response and to add more detail, I have a difficult time managing appropriate eye contact in a normal context. When I‚Äôm at my best I don‚Äôt struggle too much that I feel it‚Äôs noticeable but I find eye contact to be intimidating as a rule. And when on the spot with no way to appropriately end the eye contact, I feel trapped."
Is this dissociation?,2,judvby,4,"I had a major anxiety period last year where I couldn't sleep or eat for almost 2 weeks, and I had zero energy left and couldn't feel anything but fear and exhaustion. After this, it seems like I can't feel like I did before. Or sometimes, it suddenly returns to how it felt before, for some days, before going back to feeling out of place. It's like I don't feel the rays of the sun, the mysterious feeling of autumn rain, the great feeling of waking up to sunlight, etc. 
I feel like there is this pressure in the front of my head, and I often get a dizzy feeling, especially during stress. It's like being drunk without being drunk, I guess?
And it often feels like I have a gloomy or uncanny feeling that something is wrong. It feels like I'm walking in a fog. My head feels foggy. This has continued for almost 2 years now, and it scares me.
What is it?
Is it dissociation, derealization or depersonalisation? How can I stop it?
It feels like I'm back to feeling everything on rare occassions, like if I am completely calm in my head. But how can I get back to feeling permanently?"
Lost sense of self?,36,jub987,5,"I don‚Äôt really know who I am at the moment. I have no ambitions, no dreams, and no motivation to do anything. My schoolwork is piling up which could be so easily avoidable if I just did it on the day it was handed out. When I think about myself I can‚Äôt define my character, everything is just a jumble in my mind. Why am I so lost?"
Pressure/heat in inner ears a physical sign of dissociation?,2,juar47,5,"I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced a warm or hot sensation in their inner ear, correlated with dissociation?

I've never been able to figure out why I get that- and any doctor or therapist I've asked has never had any clue what it is- but I thought it might be similar to the feeling of pressure that some people get in their head before or during dissociation. I've had way more stresd than usual (Covid19 + coming out of denial about my parents' abuse), and I've noticed I'm experiencing that hot inner ear feeling WAY more.

I'm gathering from forums that there are actually MANY more physical sensations of dissociation than the basic ones I usually read about in books (i.e. eyes fluttering, blank expression etc.)

Does this sound like it could be a dissociation symptom?

*(I know no one can say yes or no definitively, I'm just curious if it rings any bells for anyone.)*

Any chance anyone else has ever experienced it?"
Does it sound like dissociation? (conscious naps + episodes of fatigue),2,ju951c,8,"So I tried to describe my experiences in comments in another subreddit. I was suggested it could possible be dissociation. Currently my psychiatrist believes that it could be chronic fatigue syndrome possible caused by undiagnosed adult ADHD.

Could you please tell me if it sounds similar and if you can relate? I do not think I have dissociaction, but it seems to be such an unusual disorder that is difficult to describe. Following is a compilation of what I feel *(sorry that there is so much text)*:

**Weird naps**

These naps always last 20-40 minutes.

When I nap in  sitting position at my desk, I stay conscious of what I am doing,  roughly where I am and what is going on around me. At the same time, I  forget some details about the world, see dreams, lose sense of time  (although I know if I just started napping or getting closer to the end) and feel myself getting refreshed. I usually feel great after such a nap for at least 30 minutes.

The more I try to remember things about the world, the more I start waking up, and the more I let my mind wander and show me images, the deeper I get into this sweet state. When someone speaks to me, I can roughly understand what they are talking about and decide if I want to wake up in order to answer, or I can just acknowledge that I heard them with a grumpy sound instead. I like to think that I somehow invented meditation without properly  learning how to do it.

I feel surprised with my surroundings when  waking up from these naps, as if I was teleported from a different  world, even thought I knew where I was the whole time I was napping. World seems much more detailed than I remembered it while napping.

The dreams are random objects that are constantly shifting and moving. They can start as shifting shades and become more real the deeper I start napping. For example I might see sunset, then in a couple of seconds a tree in the sunset, then an apply might fall from it, and it could transform into a baseball ball flying horizontally only to be hit by a bat which might turn into a sword.

**Fatigue**

The episodes a few times a week and  usually last 3-6 hours, but sometimes up to 24 hours. They usually start when I am bored, for example, when I am commuting or waiting in line,  or when I just have a boring task at work.

Mentally  I continuously lose focus, willpower, emotions and sense of boredom.  The world seems less dynamic/sharp/tangible *(probably because of lack of  focus)* and time moves faster *(probably because I do not feel boredom*). I  enter the state of tranquility, peace and indifference. It is kind of  pleasant as long as I do not have any responsibilities to fulfill.  Working in this state is extremely difficult and unpleasant. I just want  to relax and not move a muscle, to stay alone with my thoughts, trapped  inside a turned off body. I find it easier to just give in than to try  and fight it which does not work anyway. I am usually a very energetic  and positive person when I feel fine.

Physically  it starts with inability to dance, run or smile genuinely. Trying to do  a light jog for a few seconds feels like I am doing intense sit-ups as I  lose breath and will to continue very fast. When my episode deepens, my  walking turns into stumbling, it becomes very difficult to walk uphill,  my arms get heavy and work with a delay, my facial expression gets  numb, I start speaking slowly, catching breath mid-sentence.  I need to  plan every movement in advance and then execute them consciously. One  time it got so bad that I had trouble following mouse pointer with my  eyes.

For some reason, one of the first things that I can notice when an episode starts is relaxed feeling in  the frontal part of my brain. As if there is some object there that  should firmly stand upright, but instead was toppled backwards and it cannot get up. As if center of mass of my head shifts towards back side.  I assume it is just my eyes muscles getting to relaxed.

""Testing""  myself if whether I feel normal or not often makes me feel worse.  Thinking about this state makes it worse. After putting these memories in words, I had the biggest episode today in a long time of taking bupropion.

The experience also feels like I am half asleep. I am even drawn to darkness and somewhat uncomfortable staring at bright light.

Music that I like becomes annoying and feels like noise.

These episodes end very suddenly in a matter of minutes or even seconds. It feels like I just  wake up from a dream. I instantly notice a feeling of solid ground  underneath my feet. My body becomes responsive, the world becomes  tangible and real. I often feel a surge of energy.

If there is anything that can snap me out of this state reliably at least temporarily, it is an interesting conversation, as long as the other  person is willing to spend a few minutes trying to engage me in  conversation.

Edit: 

So I tried some common grounding techniques like touching things but it did not help at all, probably even made it worse. I often try to convince myself that ""I have the power to move my leg with force exactly the way I want it to move, and feel it hit the ground"" but it is usually very ineffective, but seemed like it helped a couple of times. Today I started trying to look at my body and think ""These arms and legs are not just meaty tools that my brain/me uses to sustain itself. They are part of my identity, part of who I am. If I were to lose an arm, I would lose part of what makes me myself"". At the same time I imagined that my ""life spirit"" fills up my body like a liquid. As a result, that weird feeling in the front of my head evenly ""spreads"" across my body and then my arms and legs feel responsive and light again. Hopefully this is not a placebo. Whenever my fatigue gets worse, I start feeling like I consist of just my brain that is pulling all the strings to move my body."
Dissociation vs anhedonia,10,ju8hh3,13,"Anhedonia is usually used to describe a reduce of pleasure and or motivation. [wiki ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia)

Im not so sure if I‚Äôm dissociating or just being anhedonic. I‚Äôm not exactly sad there‚Äôs just a void of feelings. When I‚Äôm ‚Äúhappy‚Äù it‚Äôs more like I feel nice, instead of happy if that makes sense."
Describing people is awfully difficult,6,jtxhgl,1,I have an awful time of describing what kind of people e.g. my close friends or family are (their personality etc). Is this a dissociation thing or something else? Maybe it‚Äôs just my character?
my experience with dissociation,2,jtuvhl,1,"cw: weight talk

i just wanted to share my experience with it, maybe there's someone else out there that relates?

dissociation to me is having your emotions and thoughts be muddled, i can still feel emotion and hear my thoughts but after they showed up; it's quickly forgotten. i don't have lingering thoughts or feel a feeling for too long, it's just empty. 

i dissociate to the point where my body is numb, numb to the point where i don't feel hungry. so i eat once a day, i don't even feel hungry for the first meal, i just eat so my body won't collapse. for some reason my body didn't lose weight, i don't know the science behind it but i maintained my weight during this whole ordeal."
Has COVID19 made your dissociation worse?,21,jts2ta,0,"Because same. I don't know why because I'm not a germaphobe or anything. But being in public, I'm VERY aware of people breathing on me (maybe triggering my trauma?)"
Forgetting things?,37,jtr1b7,9,"Does anyone experience this, I feel as if at times I will forget what I used to like doing, For example someone might ask me my favourite movie, I could normally name 10 but at times I feel like I barley can name one. 

I feel as if at times, I truely forget myself?"
I had my first significant dissociative episode today. Trigger Warning: Detailed Description,24,jt9kaw,10,"Today, I was triggered by something. I do not know what it was, but suddenly it felt like my mind was lagging behind, I could not think inside my head, my vision was tunneling, things looked 'off', I was going through everything like a dream, my eyes were wide open, I was hardly blinking, I was unable to introspect or contemplate, I was blanking on the events between getting from point A to B, my movements seemed jerky, I felt disconnected from my body, etc. It was weird, and lasted two hours at least.

I have had something similar before, but never so prolonged, and usually accompanied by vertigo and tremors.

I just thought to put this out there. I am sure someone else can relate."
Help me!,3,jt7pjy,2," 

Hey guys theres one symptom that really is beating me up and i really need some help!

Because my mind feels so blank, To remember things i have to picture it, For example to remember to make my bed, I have to picture my bedroom, To feed my fish i picture my fish tank, Is this normal?

Has my mind adapted to picturing things due to feeling so empty?

But because im so dissociated all the time, It feels like it's not me picturing these things?"
Mine feels like two movies at once,4,jt3py2,3,You know when you pause a tv on for a long time and the image gets burned into it? And then you play another movie but you still see bits of the burnt image? Reality is the burnt image and the movie is what‚Äôs happening in my brain. But it‚Äôs less like a movie and more like flipping channels quickly. Ya know what I mean?
Anyone else having an extra hard time right now?,3,jsyl5n,1,"I work at a place that makes us wear masks all day everyday and seeing everyone‚Äôs faces covered, seeing my own face covered in the mirror all the time, it‚Äôs not helping. I feel like it‚Äôs making everything worse. Humanity doesn‚Äôt even look like humanity anymore. 

On top of that I am also very clumsy and I often find bruises, scrapes, and scars that I have 0 recollection of how they happened or where they came from."
"Hi guys, this is getting very tiring and i feel like i'm all alone with this",26,jsxxiz,4,"I have had dissociation for almost 7 years now and it's getting more difficult. I often drift into a whole another world, in another reality. i can be there for hours without realising the time and during that time i just lay on my bed feeling absolutely nothing.

it randomly starts with me not being able to speak, then not feeling anything. then i just disappear from this world. sometimes i end up there on my own will and sometimes it just happens. once during a class i suddenly felt like i was flying above the classroom and just couldn't really do anything.

i have forgotten years of my life. i don't remember anything from my age years of 9-13. sometimes i get flashbacks from somewhere in my life that are triggered by smells, places that i don't really remember visiting before that etc. and the problem is that i can't even tell if the memories are real.

i found this group in hope of others with the same kind of problems as me...so...how are you doing?"
I'm going mad,5,jsrxmq,0,How to you cope?
Is this a symptom of dissociation?,20,jsq2iq,3,"I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm experiencing is a symptom of dissociation or a slow on-set of what could one day become dissociation, or something totally different - let me know any thoughts.

Fairly often (maybe once a week or so) I get this sudden and random feeling that I refer to as the ‚Äúdaycare feeling.‚Äù The best way I can describe it is it feels like when your parent dropped you off at daycare as a young child and everything felt foreign and a little uncomfortable and you wanted to go home (mind you, this feeling has come over me before while I‚Äôm at my parents house with them there too). Basically it‚Äôs like everything around me and where I am at the moment doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúright.‚Äù
It‚Äôs happened at home, at school, at work, at the mall, you name it - it doesn‚Äôt discriminate. The feeling always comes randomly and goes away as quickly as it came...typically within a few minutes. I‚Äôve never thought too much about it, just assumed it was generalized-anxiety based (which I take medication for) - but recently learned about dissociation and wondering now if I‚Äôm experiencing a slight variation of that.

Thanks for any input."
DID presentation? (Regressive states),11,jsk9ol,3,"I lurk in this sub because of my own dissociation related to mental health problems, but it's usually the dissociative states and derealization type. 

I just had an epiphany though. 

My mom was diagnosed with BPD many years ago. But when I was younger and her condition deteriorated, she would have episodes where she acted and sounded like a scared little girl, about 4 years old, she'd rock in the corner and ask about the 'bad man' and I'd bring her a teddy and she'd be like that a while. When she finally went to sleep she would wake up more like herself and deny any memory of what happened. 

I was 10, so I wasn't sure if she was acting or not, but I erred in the side of supportive because I wasn't sure what else to do. 

She suffered horrendous abuse for most of the childhood until she finally left home. 

I've always felt confused by how I feel like my mom is ""two different people"", sometimes she hated my guts and we wouldn't get on. Other times she'd want to hold my hand, do things together, be sweet. I put this down to the BPD. 

But the regression to childhood never made sense in terms of how it worked. 

Could this be DID (which I know is very rare so I'm sceptical)  or perhaps it's something else? I don't know what it's actually like as I feel there's some disinformation out there. 

Just curiositt really when I randomly remembered those times."

Psychosis episode or dissociation,1,js5c5h,2,Last night i had some sort of episode. I felt as if I had been kidnapped and I was locked in my room i was scared and was about to call police but then I came out of it.
Poem from different pieces of me .,50,jrz2fa,9,
A ‚ÄúPoem‚Äù From a Vision of hell,4,jryh7i,2,"
Days flash by like slugs in salt
All is quick, and slow and aught
They called me nothing, but that‚Äôs all I feel
A cracking husk hiding blackened zeal

I am it all, and none and other
Life and vision invaded, smothered
I writhe from sights and fathomed horror
My mothers fury is in my gutter

I can‚Äôt control this hypno-hell
Save me, Lord let all be well
Or rather not, leave me at bay
Take me home for this I pray

Let my body match my heart
Let the coma never stop
Let my soul regain its rest
To leave my body as it has

(I just wanna say I know nothing about poetry and I wrote this while being dissociated. Also I‚Äôm only 16 so please no hate lol. Also this is just from my perspective. My therapist believes I have some sort of post traumatic disorder and the majority of my symptoms are bad dissociative episodes, fragmented emotion, and intrusive images. Also I want to say I‚Äôm NOT suicidal, as in I don‚Äôt have a plan or a desire to kill myself)"
does anyone else deal w this?,3,jrybaa,6,does anyone else thoughts just run on an endless stream in the back of their head? for example i was just sitting and watching tv and drawing and all of a sudden i was like ‚Äúhmm what is my brain even thinking about?‚Äù its almost like im thinking unconsciously? maybe that‚Äôs normal ive just been super hyperaware lately
Dissociating or Meditating?,19,jrt59h,6,"How do I tell which one I'm doing? 
It feels like im doing a combonation of both sometimes."
am i dissociating or dying,4,jrnqdb,5,"for brief context, i have had anxiety my whole life and have dissociated for varying amounts of time since jr. high/high school but never too intensely

this last year i went through several traumatic events in a short time span (dog died, car accident, bad situation made me leave home, lost home i lived in my whole life, ex/close friend commits suicide, longterm relationship ends abruptly right after) and i felt.. strange ever since. like i was numb and careless and life had no meaning. then covid hit and this resulted in me having a terrible panic attack worse than ever before and i ended up in the ER. four times in a month. which resulted in a 3 month span kn which i would not even leave my bedroom out of fear. its been a lot lmao.

THANKFULLY i am able to leave my house now and other than my general anxiety things are mostly peachy. but the other day my boyfriend and i had a tiny discussion that reminded me of a traumatic relationship i was in 4 years ago and a BIG issue that caused a lot of stress.

almsot immediately following i started questioning jf my name was even my name, because it didnt ""feel"" like my name. my face didnt feel like it was my face, even though i knew it was. i feel like i dont connect to my identity or my life evn though i have all my memories and i know technically that thats my life and my name and my face, but none of it feels emotionally like mine. and i couldnt emotionally connect with my boyfriend or my cats or any new things in my environment from this last year. its been three days and i still feel disconnected from him as a concept and its genuinely the strangest thing ever.

am i dissociating? ive disconnected from surroundings before, and thought people were robots, but never quite like this. it triggers my anxiety and has be convinced i have brain cancer."
Phrase I‚Äôve been telling myself to get through the past few days,3,jrkd0j,1,"(Copy and pasted from a comment I did and thought it could help more people, little long but helpful. OP from other post had problems sleeping and getting to that point where you‚Äôre being too aware, I‚Äôm sure we can all relate)

‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôve been going through this lately and it‚Äôs been driving me crazy. It happened the hardest when I was socializing and just getting depressed randomly when I‚Äôm suppose to be having fun.

I just get in my head so much that I forget life is still moving on around me. This isn‚Äôt harsh advice, but it‚Äôs been the only thing I have been able to trick my brain with.

My phrase for the past 2 days has been ‚Äúso, now what?‚Äù It‚Äôs like so what if I dissociate, so what if don‚Äôt remember things, just so what! I have to keep living my life and keep being depressed and having fun at the same time. I‚Äôll figure my brain out one day but I‚Äôve been letting being in my head stop me to much on things I want to do or something I‚Äôm currently doing.

So try that phrase for your situation. You‚Äôre up and thinking and....so, now what? What are going to do with those thoughts, write down any productive ones, discard the negative ones, the ones that have you questioning life just ask them so now what are we going to do with all this awareness that I‚Äôve figured out. If the answer after 10 mins end up being nothing, then you just have to stop dwelling on it and tell your brain all this thinking is leading to nothing. Fighting dissociating is a mental battle for sure, I hope I still feel this way later this week lol, but I hope this helps someone today."
I need help please,6,jrjnlt,1,"Hey this is my first post here 

I need some advice or someone to tell me that it‚Äôs going to be okay

I‚Äôve always been a stress head all my life until three years ago I had a panic attack while working at McDonald‚Äôs and since then I‚Äôve never felt the same 

I feel like I don‚Äôt control my body or mind, my short term memory is absolutely terrible, I don‚Äôt have a appetite but I still can force myself to eat, I just feel like I‚Äôm almost dead, Like I‚Äôm in this body somewhere but I‚Äôm not sure where. I feel as if I have no control of anything, Even when I think it feels as if it‚Äôs not me thinking.

I‚Äôve tried anti deppresants but they made it so much worse with my mind. I don‚Äôt know if this is Normal because I don‚Äôt know what normal is but when I think for example, like going to my brothers house, I don‚Äôt have the thought I just picture his place and go there, I feel as if I have no thoughts at all, I just picture things to remember things, for example to water my veggie garden, I will picture it and that reminds me to water it. But I don‚Äôt like the feeling of having to picture things, I wish I felt like I used to.

It feels as if my brain has damage to it or it‚Äôs scrambled, I don‚Äôt think I have schizophrenia or psychosis as I don‚Äôt hear voices, or have beliefs or anything like that, I just feel completely empty but terrified.

I also have no cares about anything, I used to take pride in my job but now I couldn‚Äôt care less if I got fired. 

But I don‚Äôt allow for this to beat me up, I‚Äôm starting to eat extremely healthy, I drink heaps of water, I set goals everyday, I take vitamins and now I‚Äôve started the gym and going to workout to my body drops and this may help me hopefully.

Can anyone give me any advice thanks!"
It‚Äôs 6AM & I‚Äôm dissociating hard right now,31,jrj2yb,10,"Haven‚Äôt slept. Been up for awhile. 

I‚Äôm ‚Äúthinking too much‚Äù.  It feels like I‚Äôm too aware 

Anybody else gone through this? 

Can somebody talk to me?"
Was this dissociation?,9,jrgbm7,1,"In the middle of my session, T asked me ""where did you go just now?"" I never thought I dissociated before but now I'm wondering after that incident. I don't know ""where"" I went, but just felt like I got distracted by my own thoughts. I also can't exactly remember what we were discussing right before she asked that. 

Was this some form of dissociation? I will of course bring this up with her but just curious if I'm just over thinking this entire thing."
Not being able to hear sounds properly?,10,jrfimb,5,"hi, i‚Äôm in a pretty bad bout for the past while. i‚Äôm trying to figure things out but recently i‚Äôve had a newer symptom where i can‚Äôt hear things? like i‚Äôll physically turn up the volume on my phone to the highest volume but it feels like it‚Äôs super far away from me and i‚Äôm drifting away from it, kindve like through a telephone call. (my ears are physically fine lol so it‚Äôs not a external issue...)

does anyone else have this symptom? wondering if someone can explain it better than me, i‚Äôm not very good at putting things into words. 

i‚Äôve had issues with hearing when people talk but not as much with things such as music which usually grounds me."
How much is too much?,24,jr7699,3,"I am finding myself very frequently dissociating (daydreaming, derealization, zoning out, going onto auto pilot ect.) and I was wondering how much is too much? Like, where is the line drawn between healthy dissociating and a dissociative disorder?"
"Who here has lost hope, and motivation? If so why?",8,jr5vfx,1,
Hard to listen to other people share their experiences,7,jr4vhu,1,"Does anyone else find it difficult to hear others share their experiences or express a thought? I‚Äôm unsure if this is a dissociation thing, but I can feel myself taking on the thought of others or almost feeling like I‚Äôm experiencing their experience vividly by just listening to them share a story or idea. I‚Äôve found myself more in a dissociative state for the past 11 months and it‚Äôs been harder and harder to sift out what I actually think about situations or what I actually want to do. Sometimes I feel like I take on the lives or thoughts of others and this didn‚Äôt really happen before I experienced other dissociative symptoms. Just wanted to see if anyone else felt similarly with how their dissociation manifested itself."
is dissociation on a spectrum?,3,jr4grj,2,i believe i have been suffering from various degrees of dissociation for most of my life. there have been short periods of time where i completely experienced derealization and depersonalization after traumatic events but most of the time its my brain denying reality or questioning if i even exist. does dissociation exist on a spectrum?
Is this dissociation or something else?,2,jqn7b8,2,"Hey guys. I‚Äôm looking to get a little insight onto stuff thats has been going on lately and am trying to, basically, find out what the heck has been going on.
For starters, I am working with a therapist but it can be very difficult to see her on a regular basis. I also have an intake appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist in a month. 
Here‚Äôs a little background (TW abuse/death/drugs):
I‚Äôm no stranger to mental illness/abuse/traumatic events, and have been clinically diagnosed with depression and GAD. Ive been abused in my youth by my brother, father, and mother (who almost died from a drug OD when i was 14). I have also recently (july 2019) witnessed vehicular manslaughter. Most of these things I have received therapy for in the past.
Recently, though, due to COVID/losing my job/risk of eviction, I had a really nasty depressive episode that lasted well over a month. I was able to eventually get a great job though and am working on financially recovering!
While i think i am recovering in some areas, i have moments where I feel like im slipping in others. If i have a REALLY busy day compared to what im used to, it can leave me questioning the events of the day, debating wether or not they actually happened. A lot of times, too, when I drive, i end up having episodes of anxiety (+fuzzy vision/dizziness) that make it very difficult to focus on the road and leaves me feeling shook up for an hour or so. Today, however, was a tipping point. I got in my car to go to work, and while i knew i was driving, i had a really hard time processing what i was doing. It felt like i was going slower, then faster, then slower. I was fully convinced for just a moment there was no way i was awake and was dreaming. I pulled over to call some friends just to make sure, went home, and called off work. It took me a while to, i guess, feel grounded again. I feel much better now, just mentally drained from the event.
So thats where Im asking you guys, is this dissociation? Or could it be something less or more severe? (Also, if anyone has any ideas/advice to fight driving anxiety that would be great!)
Thank you so much for reading what I have to say! I hope I do not offend anyone here."

I understand the brain in such a complex but it is a double edged because I cannot live with humanity and so I‚Äôm always inside my own head or trying to dig my way into others. I came from monsters and I learned to weaponize it. 

My specialist disappeared when COVID first happened and she was the only one who knew ‚Äúus‚Äù. She‚Äôs said there‚Äôs four. I know of their basics but I never know when they are around. Weird. Like a car I have no control of. I can feel my cracks and I know what I have to do. 

My ears are ringing I can‚Äôt see or feel anything. All I know is that I‚Äôm pregnant. That is confirmed via messages with my worker who is real. 

My head is spinning and my mind is a mess 

I can‚Äôt believe this but bless Reddit for allowing the alters to have their own pages to express. We used to keep journals when we were still seeing the specialist. 

Have you ever felt your brain working? It‚Äôs like I can feel every bit of it. 

Maybe it‚Äôs the 50% more blood pumping through my body because of the baby. 

Will I keep it? 
That seems up in the air with the others. 

Gem insists on talking to our aunt first. I know she wants to keep it but... eh. 

Others seem set on aborting.

My brain hurts anyway. Yeah. I wonder how long I‚Äôll be conscious. Ask away.. maybe I‚Äôm already dead and I‚Äôm a ghost looking on?? 

Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm a schizo too. Never been confirmed. Too... self aware perhaps? Hmm maybe. Who knows"
How to date with dissociation?,26,jq2frd,14," How do I stay present and relaxed while talking and being on dates and everything. Everytime I get a good feeling it doesnt feel real, I am so confused and dissapointed with the way life feels(like a dream). Its supposed to be enjoyable, tangible. But to me its not even real."
is this real?,8,jq1a0c,5,"The dissociation has been so bad lately, I just feel numb all the time. I feel like the lines between reality and fantasy are becoming more and more blurred and because of this I've become extremely suicidal. 

It's to the point now where I'm catching myself seriously considering ending my life multiple times within a single hour and I'm not even really sad about it. I think it's because I kind of just feel like I'm constantly dreaming so what does it matter if I'm alive or not. I know this isn't healthy but I don't know what to do about it, I don't trust myself with my own safety anymore. 

At this point I'm just biding time until the moment where the dissociation becomes so strong that I'm not able to hold onto any sense of reality anymore."
is it accurate to call my situation dissociation?,3,jq0gsc,7,"hey everyone! i‚Äôm in need of some feedback here. i‚Äôll try to explain as best i can.

i have been sheltered my whole life. i did not go to public school, i had very few and short social activities, and my life was built on games/movies/internet. 

for as long as i can remember i have felt ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù.  i do not feel connected to this world or its people or my body. i simply drift through life, floating through day by day. my memory is terrible. i used to treat people like video game NPCs because it didn‚Äôt occur to me that my actions had worldly consequences or that other people actually existed with hearts and minds. 

i am often apathetic because i do not feel ‚Äòpresent‚Äô. in fact, i don‚Äôt know the last time i was fully present, if ever. i literally just exist, i don‚Äôt LIVE. i don‚Äôt know how else to explain it other than i‚Äôm just not connected. i lack a connection that everyone else seems to have.

but i don‚Äôt want to use dissociation incorrectly so thats why i‚Äôm here. do you, dissociaters, think this counts as some constant mild dissociation? thank you so much in advance!"
im terrified of my own head,13,jpvvxc,8,"this is exactlt how i feel now. ive had dissociation for a while but this is the worst its ever been and i‚Äôll think to myself ‚Äúwell at least im noy paranoid or delusional because that would be bad‚Äù and then instantly i‚Äôll start overthinking all of yhe thoughts ive had, everything feels so far away. im convinced i have a brain tumor and it scares the living shit out of me. ive always had really bad health anxiety but this is the worst its ever been and out of no where. im so scared of it, the past few days have felt like a dream or a nightmare im so anxious and paranoid. i feel like  a little kid, im scared to be alone im scared of my health and im scared im going to die. im only 16 im so scared i feel so helpless and vulnerable and im so scared somethings wrong"
Warping of time and the perception of ‚Äúlives‚Äù,11,jpqnwg,5,"Does anyone else have a screwy sense of time? Most days I get to about mid afternoon and try to think about/remember what I did that morning and it always feel like it happened yesterday or the day before. Alternatively, sometimes I‚Äôll fall down some kind of rabbit hole and whole days just disappear as if they were mere minutes. I‚Äôve started looking at the clock constantly to try and ground myself, try and keep a grip on reality, but I am often still shocked by how much or how little it moves. 


Also, if I try to think about anything that has happened over a month ago it feels like an entirely different life, like I died and was reborn in the same body, or like I‚Äôm remembering someone else‚Äôs life that they told me about, second hand memories.

I‚Äôm not sure if I dissociated & I‚Äôm scared something is wrong with me.,3,jpkr4d,2,"TW: RAPE AND DATING ABUSE

Hello. I‚Äôm not sure how to go about explaining this so I‚Äôll just be as transparent and honest as possible. Almost 6 years ago I was in a emotionally, verbally and physically abusive relationship for a year. A few months after that his best friend raped me. Fast forward to the beginning of 2020 I am having a hookup with a friend of mine (friends with benefits if I‚Äôm being honest) and when we had sex for the first time I literally felt nothing. Nothing. On my drive back home I was terrified. I thought (and still think) something is wrong with me. I felt nothing emotionally and physically. It felt like I was there for a couple of seconds. We had sex many times after that and it was amazing but that one time really really scared me. I know it sounds lame but it really freaked me out. Is that normal from past trauma? Can I prevent that from happening ever again? Please help. I don‚Äôt ever want to feel that again."
Therapist wants me to use stress ball,3,jpi3kd,2,"I scratch myself constantly in therapy. Otherwise I can't stay present. Even when hurting myself I can't stop the dissociation from happening. My therapist made me use a stress ball instead. It's less effective and I can't fully be ""there"". She wants to leave me a choice in wether I use it or not. Said it was mostly to protect me from myself. I tried but I had intrusive bloody and violent images in my head and it's disturbing. I have tried grounding techniques, focussing on a part of my body where I don't feel stress, describing an object in the room.... most of the time I am also frozen and can't speak. How can I continue therapy?? I don't know how effective it can be in this context."
Near Death Experience,5,jphvkc,1,"Hey guys. I recently have started having some sort of episode. Relatively recently I had an episode where I blacked out. I felt like I was hopping through time. I felt like I was no longer in my body. I was touching my arms and hands and it seemed as though nothing was real, I couldnt hear, I could barely talk, and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt understand anything. I was shaking and my heart was racing. I kept losing my memory and couldn‚Äôt remember how I ended up in one room verses another, I couldnt remember the last thing I said. 
I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack or a stroke. 
It was by far the most terrifying experience of my life. 
I have struggled with childhood trauma, depression, and anxiety. Panic attacks have happened to me before- but nothing quite like this. 
**Trigger Warning** 
I genuinely thought I had killed myself, or maybe someone else, and was trapped in a sense of purgatory trying to figure out what I did to get there. 
Finally, I was able to spit out to my roommate that I thought I was dissociating. Thankfully she could understand my stuttering self, looked up what it meant to dissociate, and tried to ground me. 
I have never dissociated before- or not that I know of- nor do I know if THIS is what THAT was. 
But finally I was able to take a breath and feel like it was actually giving me air, and thats what brought me back. The breath I took felt like the first breath after drowning. 
I was so hot, yet so cold, shaking, shivering, and felt like I was going to get sick. I was so dizzy I‚Äôm surprised I didnt pass out. I thought I did, because there were moments I blacked out and dont remember anything at all.

I guess I‚Äôm just sharing my story and wondering if anyone else has ever felt this way? Is this dissociating?"
Do you keep having flashbacks of past trauma? Trauma is a disease that robs your ability to be present. And when we lose control over and over it‚Äôs easy to become ashamed of ourselves. Here is a video that will help you understand and heal trauma so those flashbacks become non-existent!,2,jpe6z6,0,
Fighting Lows after Reaching New Peaks,6,jpcxsy,2,"I‚Äôve been going to therapy for about five and a half months now and I‚Äôve been going through the same pattern the entire time. Every time I feel like I gain a deeper understanding of my situation and my attitude slightly changes, I go through a low period that lasts up to a week. A newfound sense of courage is followed by weakness and hopelessness. I‚Äôve been trying to break through this pattern with grounding techniques but I have trouble keeping focus. I become afraid and begin to doubt my chances of ever breaking free. It takes a real toll on my body and my mind as it‚Äôs bogged down in negativity. Has anyone else felt this?"
Has anyone else ever cycled between dissociation and panic relatively rapidly? Kind of like a feedback loop?,53,jpazbk,12,"If so, how would you describe your experience? I recently had a session in therapy where we were covering some traumatic material, and I started getting agitated and experienced panic attack symptoms. And then I think the panicked feelings and feeling triggered got to be too much, which caused me to dissociate. Things started not seeming real and my therapist's face looked like it was melting, and I was getting tunnel vision which really freaked me out and sent me back into panic. It went on like this for a bit before I managed to calm down.   


Has anyone else experienced anything like this, or is this strange? Usually the dissociation is my 'primary' symptom (I spend most days dissociated to some degree) while the panic only happens when I'm startled, triggered, having a flashback etc. I've never felt such a mix of both before that recent session. Are you guys able to feel scared or freaked out while dissociated, or are you often too detached to feel any of that?"

Cosmic dust dissociation,5,joycdh,2,"When I was younger I often had these strange anxiety attacks before falling asleep where I would zoom out from my head and into space. It was scary because I thought that‚Äôs what would happen when I died and feared losing all my senses/consciousness while simultaneously floating in space as cosmic dust rather than my own body (try to imagine yourself drifting thru the milky way). As a kid the phenomenon was frightening, it all felt very real to me. Recently, I‚Äôve experienced something similar usually when im stressed/anxious/depressed ill feel as though an anxiety attack is forming but instead of continuing to feel overwhelmed by thoughts and emotions I‚Äôm met with the Milky Way again. I feel sort of numb to my surroundings and my mind draws blanks (quite literally spacing out). I‚Äôm surrounded by distant stars and darkness with the sensation of floating. Usually my mind and gut returns to their anxious state after this weird sensation, but for a moment it feels kind of peaceful. Hopefully somebody has experienced something similar"

"I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know how to make it stop, please tell me I'm not alone and someone else is going through this. Im scared.",11,joszjw,3,"I've been going to therapists for years for my childhood and teen trauma. I feel like, especially recently that my dissociation has gotten completely out of hand. hours in my day are flying by and I can't remember what I did. I just remember facts. ill know that I did something for example today I made mac and cheese. I have no actual memory of making it, getting it out. but I know I did. the containers are out and my kitchen is a mess, not to mention the leftover mac and cheese. sitting here while writing this I feel as though I'm inside my head. I don't even know how my fingers are moving to type this out and it's scary. It's like there's an invisible wall that is keeping me detached from everything and anything. I recently got a new dog with my partner. I picked him out and paid for mostly everything. but I feel no connection to this dog. I don't love him, I care for him as an animal but I feel as though if I left him and my partner, I wouldn't miss him, id be sad but I wouldn't miss him. it's like my brain is stopping me from making a connection. not only with him but with almost anyone. being in a relationship has been so hard. I love the person and I'm finally in a healthy relationship with someone who deeply cares for me, but when I think about him the first thing that pops into my head is that ""it won't last"" ""he's going to leave"" ""I won't even remember this relationship one day"". AND I DONT KNOW WHERE ITS COMING FROM. I know they are completely unreasonable thoughts but they feel so true. It's making it hard to care or think about our future. I can't even begin to think about just mine. My mind is all over the place. my thoughts are sporadic and I find myself staring into space for unknown amounts of time. everything feels so slow and fast at the same time. my thoughts are rapid. I haven't been able to watch anything with dark subject matter otherwise my head fills with a fog. It's almost as if my mind holds onto it and pulls things out from past memories as if I'm being triggered. it especially happens with mention of child abuse or yelling at children. but it's like I can't even clearly remember what im being triggered over and I sit there in an anxious/depressed/mad mess.  I can only seem to remember the horrible parts of my life or my biggest triggers. if anything negative happens my brain correlates that instant to something that's happened in my past. I've forgotten many amazing memories and times with friends and people who have passed that I'm later told about and have no memory of. it makes me sad to not remember such great things. it feels like I was never there or existed in the first place. I know all of these thoughts are irrational but everything in me wants to believe. I feel like I'm battling over my brain. I feel like I'm going insane. I just want it all to end. I just want it to be quiet. I need peace... please someone tell me I'm not the only one going through this. I feel so alone and scared"

Disassociating on anniversary of trauma every year... has this happened to anyone else?,5,jorlps,1,"About 4 years ago, I was drugged and sexually assaulted. I tried to block it out of my mind ever since then to cope but for past 3 years, once November hits, I find myself disassociating for the entire month.

I showed up to work yesterday and just felt completely unfamiliar with my job, a job that I absolutely love. No one seemed real and I felt like I was faking my entire self talking to my co workers. They ended up letting me go home because they told me I looked ill and was acting strange. It‚Äôs just embarrassing I HATE this so much and I don‚Äôt know how to snap out of this. It‚Äôs a nightmare every November. I feel detached from literally everything like I feel empty inside right now. What usually makes me happy and excited currently has no emotional effect on me.

Hallucinations during dissociation?,3,jojx5s,4,Does anyone get hallucinations or experience alternate realities while dissociated ?

Dissociative psychosis,9,jojoqf,1,Had anyone had a severe dissociative event that was sort of like psychosis or similar to what I‚Äôm gonna describe? It was where my physical body wandered around a nearby city and took multiple vehicles (taxis and trains) all around this city but my mind was somewhere else entirely. In my mind I was vividly experiencing an acquaintance‚Äôs birthday party ( at their house ) . I only know I really took taxis cuz I saw the trip route on my phone and the train ticket . I also went to a mall with my grandpa he claims that day but like I say all I recall was a birthday party at a friends house that apparently did not really take place but it felt totally real and I really thought it happened until a few days after I began to question aspects of it. I‚Äôve asked this question before and some people said they had some things vaguely similar as i recall but this still worries me cuz not many people seem to have it like this. It ties in with a lot of frightening recurring hallucinations I‚Äôve had that scared me so I‚Äôm trying to see if anyone has had this before where it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre dreaming while awake. Almost like sleepwalking but dreaming during it. Like I described above. It still worries me to think about a logical explanation or if anyone else has had anything similar. I know about it dissociation but I‚Äôve not heard of where many people have it this vivid ( this experience lasted the whole day my the way )

I feel nothing it‚Äôs all bland 

I feel my heartbeat on my wrist 
It thumps softly and I collapse 
I‚Äôm back where I belong, in bed 
Because everywhere else feels like it‚Äôs not worth my time

If her life is just a fraud
Is it all a simulation or is she going insane

She‚Äôs sitting in an empty tub 
While she plays music really loud
To block the sadness and the pain out 

She still doesn‚Äôt even feel real 
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard to watch her try 
When every step she take is just 
Another failed effort in vain

If her life is just a fraud

I‚Äôm watching her from a chair with tissues and handlebars 
As I get high because I can‚Äôt even watch her life pass her by

My reality is slipping away she isn‚Äôt real

Finding out I disassociate has made my train of thought worse,29,joasm6,11,"I‚Äôm 28 and I‚Äôve been disassociating for 10+ years and it hasn‚Äôt bothered me because I‚Äôm still here enough to keep a job and be responsible. But my memories over the past 10+ years are very limited and I have the disassociative amnesia where I barely remember my childhood. 

I‚Äôve been working from home since the quarantine back in March and I guess being alone this long and not seeing people everyday for work has put me in my head a lot more and has been giving me way too much time to think about how much I zone out and barely remember things and can‚Äôt stay grounded (I‚Äôve been going more crazy knowing that I disassociate than before I knew)

My post for today is about it‚Äôs gotten worse to the point where I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs derealization or depersonalization. But I know that I‚Äôm real and that I‚Äôm here on this earth and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm leaving my body or anything but my psyche currently is stuck on a train that I‚Äôve been noticing that I‚Äôm too real...
Like I‚Äôm noticing that everyone is a individual and that we‚Äôre all stuck on this planet together just ruling ourselves and everyone‚Äôs trying to be normal when there is no normal.

My girlfriend is currently dealing with some bad depression and anxiety and a lot of stress from her job. She‚Äôs been through a lot in her life and suffered a fair amount of trauma as a child and teen, dealing with abuse and neglect at times. Lately she has moments or periods of time where something is triggering and she disassociates entirely from reality. She is very upset with me, believes I‚Äôm going to abandon her and that I don‚Äôt care about her. It becomes really, really hard for her. She wants to talk to me to know I‚Äôm there but also is very upset with me at the same time believing that I don‚Äôt want to be with her. 

I love her dearly, and I‚Äôve gone through my own dark bouts of depression in the past but I find myself so helpless and unsure of what I can do or say to help. 

Any advice or help you can offer would be very much appreciated."

I dabbled with acid quite briefly and my friend had told me it wasn‚Äôt smart since my brain isn‚Äôt fully developed and I was taking it rather frequently, but stopped once I had a particularly bad trip. These random flashes didn‚Äôt happen until a couple months after that though. Are these random bouts related to depression / dissociative disorders?

I don't think I've experienced much trauma in my life, but for months now I've been struggling with feeling like I'm not actually real/in control of my own body. It feels like I'm invisible and I keep getting freaked out when I look in the mirror. I know that it's illogical, but I just can't connect to the idea that I'm looking at myself in the mirror. It's like I'm not real. I exist within my head but my body is doing its own thing and I can only watch. 
It gets better and worse, but last night everything felt so hazy and weird. It was like everything including my body had been swapped out for almost perfect replicas. Nothing was real? I don't know how to explain it without sounding mad. It was like a waking dream, I got so paranoid that I didn't exist anymore. I felt like I was outside myself and it wasn't pleasant. 
This is really starting to interfere with my life. I can't concentrate or hold normal conversations anymore. I think I'll have to see a therapist or something to see how I can make this stop.
To anyone who read all of this, thank you for taking the time out to listen to my ramblings."
Should I ask my therapist for medication?,2,jminc8,1,"Recently, while I was venting to my friend about how I‚Äôve been dissociating 24/7 for the past 6 years. she suggested I try meds. I‚Äôve been going therapy every week for about 5 months now and I don‚Äôt really see a difference, should I keep waiting for something to happen or should I ask what she thinks about meds for me?

Edit: I‚Äôm 14 btw idk if that matters lmao"
Advice on how to deal with dissociation and marijuana.,25,jmhovh,14,"Hello, I‚Äôm 18 years old and am struggling with Dissociation Disorder. I am diagnosed with anxiety and have dealt with it my entire life. I do not currently take medication but have in the past. When I was 15, I tried smoking weed for the first time. I didn‚Äôt like it very much and was pretty nervous the entire time. The day after I smoked, in school, I had experienced what I would consider to be a panic attack. My anxiety shot through the roof, my body felt warm, and I felt what I now know as dissociated. Finding myself in social situations where I smoked a few more times, I realized I had dug myself into a hole to which I have yet to climb out of. I stopped smoking for 8 months and didn‚Äôt notice any change in my thoughts and perceptions of the world around me. I still felt dissociated and disconnected from reality. I took on smoking again as I thought, at the time, I was the only person who felt this way and things were not going to get any better. I now enjoy smoking weed as I have learned to seek its benefits. However, my dissociation has remained the same as when I first started experiencing it. I am conflicted as what to do as I enjoy weed and don‚Äôt seem to get better when off it. Thanks for spending the time to read this and if anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate the thoughts."
it feels like a constant existential crisis,5,jmdi7r,1,"It‚Äôs so hard to describe but this is the best way i can. I never had any crazy trauma in life so i dont know why this is happening to me because that it was dissociation is tied to. But sometimes i just think about how am i here? and how are we just floating on a ball in endless space? and then it just feels like i‚Äôm falling. my chest cavity gets all warm, my eyes go a little blurry and then i panic. I wish it would stop. but my mind is always racing and life and questions of how. like i am 16! i don‚Äôt want to feel this way anymore. I hate it. I want to be happy. even in times where i‚Äôm with my friends and family, it‚Äôll just happen and i get sad and it ruins my mood. I feel so small and vulnerable."
I think I died last year and this is just me venting about it,32,jm5o1a,6,"Around this time last year i was not in a great place. I was incredibly reckless and I didn‚Äôt care what happened to me, and one night in particular at a college party i filled my system with as much cocaine, weed, and alcohol as i could get my hands on and then chased it all down with about 5 energy drinks, as one does. When i told this to a few of my friends months later, they all looked at me like i had 5 heads and told me i‚Äôm lucky i‚Äôm not dead. Ever since then, i feel like i‚Äôm in purgatory and the universe has been testing me to see if i should go to heaven or hell (the state of the world over the last few months and how i respond to them is my ‚Äútest‚Äù of morality). It kind of scares me because i think the US presidential election might be the final test of morality and i might not see my family anymore after this week. I try to avoid thinking about it too much because it immediately sends me in a state of full dissociation and it takes a bit for me to kinda come back but sometimes i‚Äôll see something that triggers thoughts of it (happened this morning). Sometimes I think i‚Äôm just being insane but i still use it as a way to justify my irresponsible behavior (‚Äúit‚Äôs completely fine that i just don‚Äôt submit any assignments for 4 days i‚Äôm dead anyway‚Äù). My therapist hasn‚Äôt really offered any
solution for this so i guess it‚Äôs just gonna be a part of me for now."
Could dissociation be mistaken for autism?,20,jm0y0y,9,"I've learned that I dissociate a lot, space out, feel numb, have almost no memories from my life, and so on. Could those symptoms be mistaken for autism by someone who knows very little about dissociation (and is, perhaps, biased towards an autism diagnosis)? Especially when the patient is a child/teenager?"
Does anyone else ever feel like they might be faking?,3,jll1et,1,"I don‚Äôt mean for this to come off the wrong way, because obviously no one would be able to fake something like this, but I guess what I‚Äôm saying is like. Okay. So when I first started having really bad episodes (my grandma calls them seizures, but they arent. Apparently they look like seizures to her though) my grandparents (who I live with) thought I was faking this and would always tell me to just snap out of it or to ‚Äústop playing around‚Äù. They understand that it‚Äôs nothing I can control now but they‚Äôll still tell me stuff like to snap out of it or whatever. But when I have consciousness during these episodes (I don‚Äôt all the time, usually when I‚Äôm fighting my very violent fragment) I feel as though I should be able to just snap out of it, and I feel like I should be able to move my body, but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like I can will myself to move, but I can‚Äôt actually move until I come out of it a certain amount and still then my movement is very slothful and janky. But I guess what I‚Äôm asking is does anyone else feel like they should be able to control it or like they are faking it at times?"

A painting I made during a heavy dissociative state. Tried to express how I felt. Looking at the mirror in the mind. Reflecting yourself in an endless loop.,217,jlghe7,18,
myselves‚Äôs ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù was yesterday. this is the first time I have googled this word,7,jlcvdj,25,"and i feel like one of myselves has decided now is the time. 

im making this because im triggered and in great need of reassurance and reality confirmartion. 

i feel an unamable fear and shame

im not sure of my name - but when we feel the emotion we call ‚Äúgrey‚Äù (thanks DBT/BPD) - when we feel we can speak English, we call it euphoria in mania, or bliss othwrwise. 

We dont think we have been less than hypo manic. we fear we have gone beyond mania - but are geounding with smell. sticks and spices (smokes and insence)

but time is missing... and things are not where i left them. sometimes i trust my housemates, but sometimes their faces are that of strangers. i wonder if the thee of us share the trait of dissociation, and if we are similar or not. 

this is all we can say, we have begun to release the tension - thank you for creatinf this safe space. 

if we felt grey, we would introduce iurselces, but we arent sure right now. 

When I have finished grounding, I will feel like the two/three names I *choose* to be, accpeting that these stories are helpful in me living the life that brings me happiness. but we get triggered and dissociate so much that we are scared that we are much less in touch than we appear to be. 

Its weird holding white and black, instead of grey. I belive that i want to integrate into 3 persons within my mind...

off to the sidebar i go, I would really appreciate any recommended reading for someone who is scared, condused, easily triggered, newly accpeting, and who is able to get out of thus painful headspace when others are able to provide feelings and thoughts of safety. 

much love to anyone who feels or has felt as i do. this is... interesting to say the least.

edit a moment later: Making this post has allowed is to begin to ground. If we felt bliss, we would also add that the reason we are not accessing MH support in our local community is that every healthcare professional has (re)traumatised us and our life has always ended up worse than before - except for one, but they are currently not available to me as a therapist."
Disconnected,1,jl5aci,0,"I was confused about why I was so confused and then it hit me that I am probably dissociating.  Everything felt strangely wiped out without anything connecting and it made me feel disoriented, alone.  Just a weird feeling overall.  Makes me think I got a serious brain damage from breaking down so much, which wouldnt be surprising.  But the world just seems, off."

A positive-ish tale,14,jkqwq0,10,"I met my gf online and we met in person about a year later. I flew across the country, where I'd never been, to see her. We had also never video chatted or talked on the phone, the closest being a few brief snapchats. When I saw her, it was magical and beyond what I had ever imagined. I quickly fell into a rare, euphoric dissociative state. I stayed a week and the whole thing felt like a dream. When I got home, I was still residually dissociating so I quickly wrote down what happened each day in a journal because I know I wouldn't have remembered any of it otherwise."
Holding onto emotions and feeling like past is real,14,jkgp4m,12,"Hello. I've been working really hard to feel safe and have emotions come up as a couple months ago started with a great therapist to work on complex trauma. I've been able to cry more and my thoughts have become more noticeable as well as occasionally getting emotional at reading or thinking of things. It seems to come in waves, and in the past my memories have not come back until I've been able to stay consistently in touch with my emotions, which hasn't happened yet. I'm still having a hard time in the appointment feeling and having emotions while talking about things that had me crying and being processed between sessions.

Sometimes the day before the appointment, I start feeling more grounded and that my emotions are not as accessible and wonder why I do not feel as reactive. Wondering if my body and mind is unconsciously ""getting ready"" for therapy and tucking my emotions back inside me. 

I also keep having random moments that last a few seconds that my past is not real and things weren't so bad and life feels unreal and wonder why I'm even doing therapy. Wish these moments would stop.

&#x200B;

What has helped everyone stay in touch with their emotions? To combat the feeling the past isn't real? And hang onto and feel emotions for therapy appointments?"

Listen up!,5,jkdoi4,3,"I had a shit childhood, abusive father, divorced parents, living in the hood, and all that came with a lot of trauma. We eventually worked our way up to the middle class and now I‚Äôm 14 years old and have DPDR/Disassociating. I have NEVER ever had anxiety or panic attacks. But then I got this out of no where, from my research and tests, I believe it‚Äôs from the fact that I didn‚Äôt relieve stress and realize my trauma because I never cried, never released my stress, and never came to realize all the pain I have been through. During this entire experience of torture that still effects me now and has been for 4 months, I‚Äôve noticed over time it will SLOWLY fade away. Little by little, unless you make a big deal of it, constantly think about it and don‚Äôt let yourself think positively. By me crying when I feel like crying and doing other things to relieve my stress I have noticed it works. It feels like an endless journey that will LITERALLY never end, but I promise it will, wether your journey is for years or weeks good luck, and remember this is a solo mission.

I think I'm finally coming out of it?,17,jk5ll9,10,"Hey everyone, this subreddit has been really great for having people to relate to about what has been the most difficult experience of my life.  Ever since it first started (dpdr) when I was 20 (26 now), I found it really hard to cope.  But gradually over time I got kind of used to it, of course with episodes in between.  The fog never really left though, and even as I'm writing this I do feel it a little.  But today when I was getting dressed for work I just had this moment of extreme clarity, like I could see everything in hd.  Just this feeling of calm wrapped in a subtle happiness.  After all this time and after having accepted it, thinking I would feel like that/this for the rest of my life, I feel like I'm rising out of the fog.  It's like I've come to this realisation that everything will be ok.  Dunno just wanted to share my good feelings, but also that even when you've completely given up, you can still get better and feel like a real human being again.  For those of you still in the fog, hang in there, you can do it!"
Little gem from Tumblr,23,jk5c09,2,
Is this an alter?,2,jk288x,1,"16 M here. I‚Äôm very dissociative. I‚Äôm almost always in what I call ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù and when I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm full on dissociating as in I‚Äôm not moving, completely not there almost like I‚Äôm hypnotized. My memory is also very bad and splotchy due to the varying degrees of dissociation throughout my day. But I‚Äôve also had a lot of weird episodes. I had a current ‚Äútraumatic event‚Äù happen recently which has caused a lot of my dissociation and paranoia to get worse (as well as intrusive thoughts) and also it has unlocked some very repressed memories from my childhood and it‚Äôs all been unfolding and getting worse over the past two months. Another thing that has happened though is I have very random moments where I‚Äôll go into a ‚Äútrance‚Äù or deep dissociative state and suddenly I‚Äôll get really mad at my grandparents (whom I live with) over virtually nothing. It‚Äôs never gotten physical (it almost did once) but I will have the worst most sadistic thoughts towards not only my grandparents but anyone else I can get mad at. It‚Äôs unlike any other anger I‚Äôve ever felt. Apparently I start cussing and getting all up in their faces over whatever nothing I decided to get mad about that day. I also remember none of this afterwards. My memory of any of this was only jogged by my grandparents recounting everything afterwards to me, and only then I can only really remember what I thought and how I felt. I really don‚Äôt want this to progress and the last thing I want is to hurt my grandparents. I am beyond heartbroken that I could even have such terrible thoughts about them. Oh, and oddly enough it comes up whenever I hear my grandpa specifically chew. Anyways I was at an emergency therapists appointment (i know, 9:00 pm is pretty late for that) and it happened while all four of us (me my grandparents and the therapist were in the room together) twice and it was directed toward my grandma both times. It wasn‚Äôt awful, but it came fleetingly, for about 2 minutes each time. I told her to shut up or whatever apparently, but it‚Äôs weird. My body physically gets angry. Like my heart starts beating, blood rushes to my face, and I have that feeling on my feet like I‚Äôm about to pounce on someone. I think it didn‚Äôt come out as much though because I was in front of someone other than my grandparents. The second time, however my therapist did have to calm me down somehow by making me do some sort of breathing thing. I remember gaining and un-gaining that sense of being there, almost like a light switch being flickered on and off and my therapist said it didn‚Äôt look like ‚ÄúI was anywhere there‚Äù. Anyways, they‚Äôre currently looking for somewhere inpatient now to help me get on some medication that will ground me or something if any of y‚Äôall know anything that could help with that that would be amazing. But I guess right now I just want to know if what I‚Äôm experiencing is what they call an ‚Äúalter‚Äù and what type?

Also, I‚Äôm gonna give some background on my childhood or whatever to see if that helps:

So I was born to my mom and my dad (obviously) who were recently married and 19 and 21 respectively. My mom is undiagnosed BPD (Borderline) and my dad‚Äôs always been off at work for most of the day and emotionally absent when he was home. They were very strict religious folk and my gay ass was literally testing their limits since kindergarten. I had a couple experiences in my life that my be considered ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù but nothing that sticks out to me as that one traumatic event to push me over the edge. A lot of beating from my dad and emotional manipulation from my mother. Some sexual experiences that weren‚Äôt rape but still left a mark on me too from as early as 3 years old. I also have two younger brothers and as soon as they were born my ‚Äúgiftedness‚Äù (I‚Äôm not gifted, just kinda smart imaginative and emotionally sensitive from a young age. It‚Äôs the only thing my mother could brag about regarding me was how ‚Äúgifted and full of potential‚Äù I was) was put on the backburner for them. And I‚Äôm not saying that to be a brat. Literally, my parents would lock me up in a room all day while they nurtured those two.  My mom went really off the hinge when I was like 10 and started fucking one of her friends from the gym. I got into a ‚Äútherapist‚Äù at that time who wasn‚Äôt really a therapist by any means, since she was cheating on her husband as well and told me that it my and my dad‚Äôs fault for her affair, since she had to get married at such a young age and quit her life she had planned. I started being suicidal around the first time then. Then my parents reconciled and got only more religiously staunch afterwards. It was during this time that I totally lost it, cause I started coming into my sexuality (and by that I mean laying the foundations to a pornography/masturbation addiction that I‚Äôm just now starting to try to control). I also sat in church for at least 7 hours a week with a preacher who constantly talked about how terrible gay people were and basically preached hellfire and brimstone if you know what that means. I also went to a Christian school at the time and was very sheltered my whole life. Eventually, my parents catch me watching porn (on my Nintendo 3DS browser) at about 12 years old and beat the literal shit out of me (I had bruises and bleeding wounds). So I kind of got treated a lot different for a while and wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave my room for a long time afterwards. Then at around 14 my mom found out I was gay (officially) and we had a repeat of the episode, we eventually ended up moving halfway across the country to Texas, where they continued to do everything they were already doing x10. I ended up attempting suicide three times during that six month period and ended up going to a hospital twice. The third time, my grandparents who I‚Äôve always spent lots of time around and who have been the only ones who have shown me real love found out and demanded that I come live with them back in South Carolina. I‚Äôve lived with them since and after having being raped my second week down here I started seeing the therapist I‚Äôm seeing now, who has helped me so much over the past two years. Oh and I saw another ‚Äútherapist‚Äù after my mom outted me. He wasn‚Äôt really a therapist but my dad got him for conversion or whatever. Anyways I hope it doesn‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôm complaining about my life I‚Äôm just trying to give some insight. Anyways so the rape never bothered me really other than the fact that the guy never went to prison for anything since it was never able to get ‚Äúall the way‚Äù. But anyways so yeah I‚Äôve been with this guy for the past two years and he‚Äôs helped me so much, but he won‚Äôt really tell me too much of what‚Äôs going on with this stuff that‚Äôs just coming out.

Anyways I‚Äôm sorry for all that. And I‚Äôve been very out of it while writing this in case you can‚Äôt tell. Also I‚Äôm sorry for writing SO much about my past but it honestly did help me to be able to get it all out for tonight. But yeah if you know if that was an alter please do let me know."
Is this this disassociation or something else.,2,jk226a,2,Hey y‚Äôall I have a question. For the entire month I have been feeling really out of it. Like I just woke up and haven‚Äôt shook off the sleep feeling. I have like this tunnel vision and bright lights are way to bright. It‚Äôs also like I have a heavy foggy head. My head feels like it weight a lot. I feel mentally slow too. This is stressing me out and scares me. I know I am real and I know that everything around me is real too. I have no question about that. It‚Äôs really weird I‚Äôm constantly tired and feel like something is not right. It gets worse sometimes but also sometimes for a brief moment I ‚Äúsnap out of it‚Äù and everything goes back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but right back to the fog after. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I have tried grounding too and that does not shake it off.
Am I dissociating?,6,jk1zlm,1,"Hi I'm sorry if this isn't allowed, but I'm wondering if I'm experiencing dissociation? I feel like this every so often but today I was really wondering if I was dreaming or not, and I just felt very ""off."" Pretty numb, like I couldn't feel everything wrong going on. I'm wondering if it could be related to regressing a lot more recently, and my brain could maybe be like confused about who I am? Also maybe being a bit tired and not eating enough so my mind was kinda foggy. It got a lot worse when I got home from school today and was talking to my mom again, kind of reminded of everything that's ""wrong"" and things that are stressing me out and making me feel depressed. Things are also going to be changing a lot, I'm working on high school applications, I might be moving, and just things about growing up in general. Anyways, I just felt very weird and disconnected, and very much like I was dreaming, listening to music helped a bit, and it lasted a like two and a half hours at its strongest maybe? Also I suspect my mom is gaslighting us, intentionally or not, and sometimes it makes me feel just insane. And I've struggled with a few different mental health issues including a trauma diagnosis if there's any correlation there? Anyways I'd really appreciate some input as to if this sounds like dissociation or not. Thanks for reading!

Edit to clarify: I feel like the main factor is maybe the things that are ""wrong,"" relatively small things like my mom taking away my phone (kinda my entire life lol) again, indefinitely, her cancelling my Halloween plans, and stress over things like planning about high schools, my plans partially going to hell, things changing a lot, but honestly mostly just losing my phone. I'm not sure why it always affects me so much. Someone please help I don't know what's going on"
Using Archetypal energy to manage dissociation?,2,jjyp8j,0,"

So I am reading this book right now about archetypal psychology and it talks about a basic dichotomy where people either over identify with archetypes too much or disidentify and detach from them.

The one I'm reading is about primal masculine archetypes but there's a lot of different archetypes , still it seems the more primal ones (King/Queen, Warrior , Magician, and Lover) are important to this concept.

But each arcthype has a bipolar shadow form, that is basically shaped like a triangle, and there's a triangle that shapes childhood and builds in to adulthood.

So 4 triangles makes a pyramid, and the entire structure is a pyramid within a pyramid.

So it says people get identified with certain aspects of the primal archetypes, and that causes pathology. At the same time , they can become so detached from some that they forget that exist completely, though those energies may still manifest in neurotic or other ways in certain situations.

Still, when dissociating I wonder if it is possible to tap in to any of these archetypes and find a sense of balance or purpose to ease the disconnect?

Thoughts?"
was dissociating hardcore last night and drew this to cope :),162,jjuwok,5,
if this is a coping mechanism.. can I get a new one?,23,jjrwdd,11,"I know thats a goofy question. 

I told my therapist about my dissociation and traumas, we traced it back to where we are  pretty sure i've dissociated since childhood and that its just gotten worse since other traumas have entered my life. 

she described it as a coping mechanism, which until now I thought coping mechanisms had to be something you do on purpose to some extent. where I feel like I don't dissociate ""on purpose""

so okay, my brain is doing it. but like I forget stuff all the time, I lose interest in everything I care about, I feel like I have to pretend to be me? 

it affects my job, my relationship, my safety??? 

how does this help? 

I always thought I was open, I always thought that i was the type to deal with things emotionally early on so it wouldn't prolong but my brain is like lol no. 

what gives?"
Is this Dissociation?,2,jjrjom,3,"I just remembered this one time when i was like 8? I dissociated (this used to happen to me a lot as a kid and I'm just learning the term for it, or if it counts?) while watching tv with my family, apparently my grandmother had been calling my name? she was next to me and  I didn't hear anything(no tv, conversation, nothing) I don't even remember watching the actual tv.
The only reason i snapped out of it was because my grandmother threw a heel at my face and it hit near my eye, right after she threw it she started screaming at me for being ""embobada""
(Closest English translation is dumbfounded)
Thats the last memory i have of dissociating near anyone."
Please lmk if this is dissociation,1,jjizlh,0,"Ok so I‚Äôm not rlly sure where to start cause my brain is constantly jumbled up and I can‚Äôt form things correctly. I think I dissociate mostly all the time every day. I can‚Äôt drive anymore cause I feel like I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on, I can‚Äôt get a job cause I‚Äôm so checked out and my social anxiety and anxiety in general sky rockets. I have ocd and now somehow everytime I dissociate (often) I think it‚Äôs something in my food or drink or something I‚Äôve touched causing me to be high or out of it. The only way I know how to explain it is that I feel high, out of control, I don‚Äôt even really know what I‚Äôm saying most times it scares me so bad. I can‚Äôt remember things, time goes so slow, I ask people to repeat themselves 1 minute after they say something cause I realize I have no idea what they even said to me. I‚Äôm questioning if I have an attention disorder like adhd or if it‚Äôs just my dissociation. I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for my anxiety, ocd, depression, panic for about 2-3 months and on 50 mgs. It‚Äôs not helping if anything I think it might be making me worse? Idk. It‚Äôs terrifying when I realize I can‚Äôt recall what I‚Äôve said or what is happening around me, I don‚Äôt want to do something weird or irrational and not know it.. I don‚Äôt really feel like I‚Äôm in a dream or anything, I know I‚Äôm real but I just can‚Äôt think. Grounding doesn‚Äôt work for me and at this point I just feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. Sorry this is long there‚Äôs so much more but I just need to know what this sounds like, I want to be in full control but I just feel out of it 24/7. Thankyou."
What are some tips that has helped with your dissociation?,6,jjf61e,8,
Do I dissociate?,2,jjemdr,6,"This is ultimately something I‚Äôll talk to my psychiatrist about, but I also wanted an opinion from those who deal with dissociation. I don‚Äôt know too much about this because I just discovered the term, but I thought it would be helpful to hear from people that struggle with it first hand. Forgive me if some of what I describe is totally unrelated, I‚Äôm just trying to learn. 

I‚Äôve had several things happen that make me think I may have a tendency to dissociate. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll suddenly feel like the world around me isn‚Äôt real, like I got teleported into another universe. Things around me feel different and strange even if I‚Äôm in my own home. This doesn‚Äôt usually last more than a few seconds. My sense of self feels strange during these times, I wouldn‚Äôt say I detach from my body or anything but I don‚Äôt feel like myself. 

This one is particularly weird to me, but say I become very immersed in a book or some sort of story telling from a first person narrative for an extended amount of time, I begin to feel more like that character and less like myself for a period after. Like my identity fades to the background and a false identity comes to the foreground. 

//TW: sexual abuse//

In addition, according to my therapists over the years and just based on my behavior as a child, I have experienced some sort of repressed sexual abuse that I honestly remember absolutely nothing about in terms of the actual event(s). I remember when my behavior changed and I exhibited some very obvious signs of sexual trauma, and I became incredibly distressed and haunted by something I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint, but I don‚Äôt remember anything else. I think I must have dissociated during whatever it was that happened to me, and locked the memory away. 

//End TW//

Other than that, I often have an incredibly hard time focusing on my surroundings and even what people are saying to me directly (I don‚Äôt have any diagnosed attention related disorders) and don‚Äôt process audible information well at all, I have to see it visually and even then have times where I just can‚Äôt process information.
It‚Äôs most likely due to this that I have terrible memory, and sometimes even something someone told me seconds before I simply don‚Äôt recall. During these times I feel stuck in my own head and like I can‚Äôt get out of it and into the real world where everyone else is. Everything outside of my own thoughts and consciousness doesn‚Äôt make it through. My fianc√© will often times ground me a bit by telling me I‚Äôm spacing out again, because I‚Äôve either stayed completely silent for extended periods of time because I‚Äôm stuck in my own mind, or because it‚Äôs clear that I‚Äôm just not present. 

I‚Äôve also experienced a severe loss of personal identity over the years, and feel there is a different ‚Äúme‚Äù I separated from to form whoever i am now. I have a lot of issues with my overall sense of self.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I was just hoping to learn some things and maybe find out if I should bother my psychiatrist about some of this. I really appreciate any opinions or observations!"

What I thought would help me has left me feeling worse than ever.",42,jj6cg9,10,"My entire life I've felt dissociation/depersonalization and I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. When I was young I was extremely shy and anxious with no healthy way to cope. I feel dissociated all the time and that makes me even more depressed, being depressed all the time makes me constantly think about suicide, constantly thinking about suicide makes me anxious about what that entails and traps me even deeper in a disconnected state. The only person who has ever cared to take what I have to say seriously has told me I potentially use dissociation as a coping mechanism for moments of extreme anxiety.

I had hoped my whole life that if I got my act together and found someone to love that I would feel fulfilled enough to break the cycle, but now I can see that the cycle is independent of any outside force. No matter how perfect my life is on paper I have a unrelenting nagging in my head telling me I should just end my life. I think that if I could get a grip on reality my other problems would fall away. It's so hard to feel happy and satisfied when I know it's just a fleeting emotion I can't truly feel, everything just slips away and passes through my brain without ever feeling like its mine. 

I'm constantly reminded that only I can fix my own problems but I genuinely don't know if I can do it alone right now, I'm getting closer and closer and I feel like I'm going to have a breakdown or worse. I just need someone to rely on even for a moment but instead it just feels like no one is rooting for me, not even the people I would give anything to help."
Dissociation and sensory issues?,14,jj116c,2,"I‚Äôve always kinda wondered if my dissociation is linked at all to my sensory issues, or if they‚Äôre just seperate problems. My sensory issues are no where near as severe as my dissociation, though. 


Could it be something like because the connection, the tethers, I like to say, between my mind and body are not as secure as they should be I then process any input from my body in a weird way. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how it links up, though, because I‚Äôm too sensitive, so if anything it would mean that I‚Äôm too in my body... I dunno...


One of the worst ones for me at the moment is a constant tingling/ticklish sensation, I‚Äôm constantly twitching as if I‚Äôm a horse/cow covered in ants or flies or something. I‚Äôm constantly having to shake or move limbs, clothes, blankets, etc., accompanied by a fuzzy, blurred, stuffed-with-cotton feeling in my head. 


Just something I was thinking about recently"
Hoping To Educate About DID,2,jivbqu,6,"In light of, um, the glaring ableism on r/DIDCringe: 

If you actually want to help DID systems combat stigma by learning about this disorder, please feel free to ask us anything. 

DID and OSDD are very real disorders that impact thousands of people's lives. Not your ""cringe.""

I won't entertain questions that are just trolling. I'm happy to answer anything for those who are genuinely interested. 

We aren't professionals but maybe our experiences can be useful for something. Sometimes the stigma gets really tiring and I feel the need to do something."
help,21,jiv1s9,2,"i really am at a lost right now, i have been experiencing dissociation for quite a while now, like while covid had just begun as it happened after i took edibles while i was in a state of stress. it really affects the way i think and feel. some days i just feel completely out of it like i‚Äôm not in touch with my emotions and surroundings and it causes constant stress and anxiety. i‚Äôm constantly tired and just feel numb. i went for my road test today and failed it because i just couldn‚Äôt think properly and it affects how i think all the time now. i really am just at a loss and don‚Äôt know what to do."
Experiences,16,jis8vb,9,"A big part of dissociation for me is the anxiety that comes with it, or preceeds it. What are your experiences with dissociation and anxiety? For me, I feel like I'm about to either lose my mind or start tripping out. I'm not sure if my anxiety causes dissociation or the other way around. It seems like it goes both ways."
need some comfort/reassurance. Please. i just want to know if any of you could relate to this to take stuff off my chest.,3,jiqswf,5,"Hello. I posted here about a month or two back, possibly 3 but, i really need some comfort and reassurance (a response/reply is highly needed rn.) I struggle everyday with severe/extreme anxiety, OCD,  panic attacks, and dissociation. I hope somebody can relate to these but here are a couple of symptoms I suffer from below:

- dissociation.
- neck tension. (my posture is not the best and my mom has always told me to hold my shoulders and back up more.) 
- headaches. (mainly either in the back of my head, on one side, or just like a band on my head.) 
- possible new symptom from today: eye pain. (reminder, i was wearing my glasses for long distance and i squint alot.) 
- feeling dizziness when walking or getting up. (possible slight vertigo.) 
- feeling like a robot/fear that im gonna loose control of myself and anxiety. 
- somewhat hard to swallow because of anxiety. 
- forgetful.
- sore temples.
- and rarely feel as if my arm (or leg, foot,etc.) isn‚Äôt apart of my body.)


I really just need some support right now. I‚Äôm really sorry if i posted this in the wrong thread but, i just had to reach/seek out some comfort. Also, My therapist said this is dissociation but my anxiety is going haywire. My health anxiety has come back at full force and im just so mentally tired. Can any of you relate to any of these symptoms? :("
Not sure what I'm expieriencing.,0,jioj9q,0,"I have bpd, and I'm regressing right now. Previously I was in recovery , until probably covid hit. 

There are other comorbid diagnosis, but I've never understand if what I'm expieriencing is dissociating or something else. I spend alot of time day dreaming, and when I think about myself I don't think of my physical image, I think of like a skeleton with a mass of black air inbetween the bones instead of organs and skin and what have you. 

Like, I logically know I'm a real person and I'm here, but it doesn't feel like that?? I'm really a nice person, but my inward narrative ( I do have one going in my head constantly ) is super negative, and basically when I'm alone with my thoughts it all just turns to... That.. thinking I'm some kind of entity trapped in a skeleton more then an actual human being who is horrible and a terrible monster. I've also had long periods of time where I felt ' my soul was rotting ' which was a really weird feeling. 

I know that's really weird, and I have been having short term memory loss issues also ( just forgetting stuff alllllllll the time, thoughts, specific words, what I'm talking about when I'm taking about it or forgetting my destination when I'm driving there ) and I function normally I should say. I've been isolating for the past two months really hard except for working and games and this is all I think about. I've expierienced this feeling a few times over the past several years and I'm just wondering if it's dissociation or if I'm missing something."
Feeling Anxious For No Reason? How YOU Are Unconsciously CREATING Anxiety & BLAMING It [UNIQUE],0,jij6e1,0,"These are most people‚Äôs answers when I ask them why they feel anxious and what they believe about anxiety. I don‚Äôt know why I feel anxious. Anxiety is ruining my life. Anxiety is a demon I have to fight. Anxiety just happened to me and I‚Äôm just living with it. Anxiety is genetic.

The reason why I can‚Äôt achieve this goal/move forward in my life is because of anxiety. Anxiety is not letting me live my life. Anxiety anxiety anxiety is the problem right??

You see, in all these labyrinths of explanations, one thing is sure: You are not taking responsibility of how YOU have created and contributed to the anxiety. üò¨

You‚Äôre not seeing how you are unconsciously CREATING anxiety, then unconsciously UNDERPERFORMING in your life so you can retrospectively (meaning, looking back) BLAME the anxiety as the ‚Äúreason why‚Äù you couldn‚Äôt succeed, achieve your goals, start a relationship, date, have a partner, start a family, start a new career, and do all these wonderful things you want to do with your life

and then, unconsciously focusing your analytical/intellectual mind to find EVIDENCE and proof as to why anxiety is not letting me live my life/is genetic/can‚Äôt be overcome/etc. so you collect more ‚Äúintellectual proof‚Äù that strengthens the excuse of why this artificial self-created problem called anxiety can‚Äôt be overcome and IT is controlling your life and you are just its unfortunate victim right? Sure! üòè

And how do we feed our excuses? Well we feed them with theories, statistics, intellectual explanations, research papers, becoming intellectually stubborn and not wanting to give up your explanations,

being secretly affectionate to the explanations, using explanations as your fallback plan and carefully preparing them in your mind by rehearsing them so you deliver them in the most articulate way possible so that ‚Äúit lands‚Äù and ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù in the other person‚Äôs minds and in your own, making the explanations so seductive and logically coherent and backing them up with so much proof and logical coherency so that the excuses have a more serious and ‚Äúofficial tone‚Äù, etc.

See that? Believe it or not, you have created all of this. üëå

Consciously or unconsciously, to protect yourself, to avoid responsibilities, etc ‚Äì whatever the reason, you have created your own cage so stop blaming the anxiety and take responsibility. Regardless of the why or when, you have done this to yourself and the sooner you face this harsh reality the sooner you get better. If you prefer to keep lying to yourself and avoid reality, don‚Äôt watch this video.

awful,6,jiig6s,5,"so i just took a walk and i realised that im not really aware of my surroundings as if im not paying attention to them and are stuck in my head, like i just filter out every noise that i hear and almodt everything visually , like i see stuff but im not paying attention to it . i just wanna know if this is something that dissociation causes or if im just extremely anxious because sometimes i question myself if i really have this"
Why do people not ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù dissociation?,41,jid5ro,8,"Having a tough time wrapping my head around how it‚Äôs possible to define mental illness.

The mind can‚Äôt be measured, the DSM isn‚Äôt about neurological damage or physical pathology. 
If anxiety is real it‚Äôs an abstract sensation dependent on an individual‚Äôs interpretation of what COULD be something perceived totally differently in another‚Äôs mind.. how can one understand their own mind well enough to gauge what is occurring, whether bad or good? I  don‚Äôt understand what makes a feeling ‚Äúbad,‚Äù or why drugs treat what can‚Äôt be measured? 
I‚Äôm scared of the mental health field tbh 


Having a tough time. If dissociation isn‚Äôt real enough for people then what mental illness could possibly be? Sorry if this offends, I do not mean for that I just want meaningful discussion and to possibly be enlightened üí°"
Can u describe your most memorable dissociative event ?,1,ji9fb7,5,"One time
I physically wandered around a city in a taxi , I was able to interact with drivers and get around as if I was normal , but my mind was elsewhere entirely . I really thought I was at a friends birthday party. It was a scary party with demons and stuff dancing but I did not think
It was weird till a few days later. I‚Äôve asked this question a few times but so far no one has had something like mine. It was like dreaming while awake or dreaming while sleep walking u kno
What I mean ? I can only relate it to a flashback like cuz in a flashback ( ptsd ) peoples minds go elsewhere but I haven‚Äôt heard of it being like this . This experience lasted the whole

Risperdal and Wellbutrin for Dissociation?,2,jgzhne,3,"My doctor just put me on 1 mg of risperdal (risperdone) a night, with 150 mg of Wellbutrin (bupropion) in the morning. I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for about three weeks already, and haven‚Äôt noticed any positive changes so far. I was taking CBD oil, for about two weeks along  with the Wellbutrin, and it did help with anxiety to a degree, but caused an increase in dissociation. I guess what I‚Äôm asking is has anyone had any experience with any of these and does anyone know if they actually help?"

My very recent experience with driving,8,jgybtb,2,"I‚Äôve been in a state of 24/7 dpdr for two years now. For the past year, my family constantly pestered me about driving but I knew that if I did I would space out and crash. 

After getting recently a job, the topic was more brought up. I practiced a bit and had to drive on my own very quickly. I drove to and back from work 2 times so I thought I was ready.

Just about an hour ago, I crashed into a pole. I was making a turn and completely spaced out. I went too fast and I couldn‚Äôt stop. The moment right before my eyes closed because my head hit the air bag made me truly believe I was about to die. I was so shocked that I just grabbed my phone and got out. Thankfully there was a group of men who were very nice and pulled the car into a lot. I honestly can‚Äôt imagine myself even getting into a car right now. Let alone driving again. Man, my therapist is going to have a blast hearing all this."
I‚Äôm Only 16 And My Life Is Going To Shit,36,jgnt0x,21,"16 year old M here. I‚Äôve been in therapy about two and a half years now, and I‚Äôm just now starting to be told I‚Äôm dissociative. I don‚Äôt know if I really am though, because I don‚Äôt really have any ‚Äúalters‚Äù. For me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a constant haze and my conscious mind has little control over anything. I don‚Äôt think coherently, and I would say I have different personality states. It feels like I‚Äôm in a constant muddy fog, and every sort of emotion or thought my conscious mind has stays repressed. I also have constant intrusive thoughts and images of sexually violent things. They originally started about a month and a half ago, and it was really bad at the beginning, causing panic attacks where I would move and do things outside of my control. Now those don‚Äôt affect me, but I have these really weird other types of attacks that I don‚Äôt know how to explain. It‚Äôs like randomly, I‚Äôll stop dissociating, and I‚Äôll begin feeling a sudden rush of one emotion, but I‚Äôm still not able to control my body consciously. I‚Äôll get really angry, and start acting just like any other angry person would (nonviolent with excessive violent thoughts), or really sad, or paranoid, or anxious. And I‚Äôll switch between one emotional extreme to the other, with brief periods of dissociation, where it‚Äôs almost like a hypnotist snaps their fingers and I‚Äôm suddenly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, how I got where I am, why I‚Äôm crying etc. All I remember is the immediate moments right before. I‚Äôll also be ‚Äútransported‚Äù occasionally to different made up circumstances and be affected as such. For example, yesterday I was being operated on without anesthetics and I could feel everything inside of my body and I couldn‚Äôt start screaming. And this all usually happens back to back, like multiple episodes at a time, then it just stops and I can barely remember anything. Right now, ever since I‚Äôve been unable to think clearly at all (I could at least remember things like 2+2=4 beforehand), I can‚Äôt hardly remember anything, and I‚Äôve been really angry and snappy towards everyone. I never had any one sort of ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù experience as a child that I can think (I don‚Äôt remember being raped or any sort of other thing) but I was forced to take showers with my dad at a young age and it has been one source of trauma for me, as well as growing up in a religious extremist household with two very manipulative parents. But other than that I can‚Äôt think of anything that could have scarred me, even though my therapist wrote a letter to my doctor about me having PTSD. I‚Äôm also really paranoid. I‚Äôm scared half the time that my grandparents (who I live with) are going to kill me, even though bless their hearts they love me more than anyone else and have been here for me through everything, or I‚Äôm scared that the governments watching me and is going to take me away (for what I don‚Äôt know) but I recognize that it‚Äôs all crazy paranoia. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve always had mental health problems to some degree, but I was still an all A‚Äôs honors student. I‚Äôm not that anymore. I can‚Äôt even sit down to do schoolwork or I dissociate so far that I‚Äôll end up just sitting there, often staring at something and doing nothing else. Please tell me someone knows what‚Äôs going on. I can‚Äôt think of any other sort of community to reach out to."
I'm kicking the cult of my family out of my head and it feels good.,8,jgnrmi,0,"I have some thoughts in my head that won't stop. 

I'll say, ""no stop"" to triggering feelings and physical flashbacks of being raped. And hear ""you don't mean that"". I used to just disassociate, and go back to being numb (I've always called it death), but now I'm, fighting back. 

All I do is yell ""no"" back. My brain apparently knows narcissists well, because my subconscious will cycle through various narcissistic answers for *hours*, but just like arguing with, the only thing that matters is *I said no*. Thassit. Anytime I try to reason with it, it wins. *i said no""

And I'm starting to believe it too.

I deserve bodily, mental, and emotional autonomy. Family is only family of they recognize, respect, and nurture, your autonomy.

It gave me new strength to yell down the voice. 

My family (that spawned the voice) doesn't care about *me* they love a fabrication of me. And I refuse to die for them. I refuse to die for it. 

It will die. 

It's just a piece of shit rapist voice that can't respect consent. Like rapists it calls rape love. It deserves to die. 

It deserves to die. 

And yeah, I know meds are available, but this is really the first time I've acknowledged that I can't just expect the ""running commentary"" to just disappear unless I'm actively, viscerally countering it.  So im trying that first."

In a blur. If only I could live like everybody else‚Ä¶

**HAZY DAZY**

Walking around in a daze  
I want to be in the moment, the right now, all the time  
But I can‚Äôt be, because if I ever finished a day‚Äôs to do list, rather than thinking about doing things  
Then what would I do?

I‚Äôd have *too much* time to think  
Because nothing I do can be in the moment  
It‚Äôs all in preparation for not ticking those things off‚Ä¶

And I never admit or deal with the real me  
If I could just live in the right now I‚Äôd finish typing  
Then I‚Äôd do the day‚Äôs tasks before relaxing

I think the relaxation is what I crave  
Proper chill time, and me time,  
Not dissociated, out of body slumps

I want to feel free, like I‚Äôve dealt with it all  
And when something comes up I can move through it  
Conscious relaxation would be amazing

I think about abuse; the physical and emotional affects every second of everyday  
Yet I process nothing, or very little.................

This ruined my life,5,jgecsk,3,"I am an 18 year old girl who has gone through incredibly traumatiic life experiences. Last year around midway through 2019 I fell suddenly ill and had to drop out of high school because I was deteriorating so fast.  I spent the entire year bedridden , hardly able to be productive and in constant torment 24 / 7 due to my symptoms , all of while having my friends abandon me in my time of need. I spent many days in tears , screaming at the top of my lungs to make the torment stop while everyone else was in school applying to their colleges while I suffered alone. Fast forward one year of HELL I am now in disassociation. I was naturally a once a highly intelligent person, with great introspective skills and gifted creativity. I always had a knack for innovation and was starting a cool idea I had come up with as well, and exceptionally analytical abilities. I was very passionate and emotional too, capable of being both left and right brained . I had passions in many fields, ranging from cooking to music , to philosophy , history, and sociology/psychology, various sciences.  I was seen as someone who would ""go places"" , and genuinely really wanted to help people in my life with the skills I was born with. I had spent my high school years feeling like I never actualized my potential enough due to not putting myself out there , having severe depression and generally being lazy . And when the huge turning moment of my life was to occur (graduation and moving on with college ) , I had to fall fucking ill. And then after that I had to develop this fucking disorder. I have lost all of those abilities. I have head pressure and have lost my executive fucntions. I get little twitches over my body and don't experience normal body sensations like appetite, thirst or sleepiness. Music is dead to me yet I used to be the type that LIVED for music, and genuinely wanted to share my own with the world.  My emotional blunting has stunted my creativity, and I struggle to carry basic conversations. I have severe trauma and am STILL unable to graduate high school, and I hardly do anything in the day. Living in my body has been torture and the people I thought cared about me had left and abandoned me, failing to respond to my messages or even talked behind my back . All of those people are now self actualizating their potential after treating me like fucking shit, while I sit here and suffer . Nobody even wished me happy birthday. I used to once feel connected to the spirit of the world but I now fucking hate it. I have developed severe misanthropy and don't even feel like a person anymore due to the way I was treated. I am so sick of peoples pathetic behavior and my life and the amount of suffering I've endured,  that I've disassociated completely . I had great hopes for the future in my teens, and was a naive and innocent kid. and THIS is what my life ended up like at 18. What a fucking joke. I dont know how I will get my brain back ever again, how I will get my creativity , my higher level intelligence, my humour and my love for life back. I can't. Because this place absolutely destroyed me. I have to completely rebuild my foundation in life and I dont know how."
Feels Like Brain Damage,40,jgcmov,6,"**the only reason I can articulate this paragraph is because I have ocd tendencies and can‚Äôt stop ruminating over my symptoms and researching them. I want to stop thinking about this but nothing successfully distracts me from it besides sleep. 

My brain is VOID of thoughts, ideas, words, consciousness. I literally CAN‚ÄôT THINK, process, reason, plan, create new ideas, think critically, have any sense of judgment or insight. Can‚Äôt wrap my brain around any complex thoughts anymore. Takes my brain so long to process reading books, watching TV, and listening to conversation. I forget things seconds after they occur, my memory is like a goldfish. I can barely maintain a conversation aside from responding with the most basic phrases because my verbal recall is terrible now.  I can‚Äôt write like I used to or make art. I feel like I lost my entire personality and sense of self. I‚Äôm emotionally numb. Light and sound sensitive. Music doesn‚Äôt make me feel alive anymore. I make stupid mistakes all the time. I‚Äôve been socially isolating because it takes so much energy to figure out how to respond to messages or conversations irl and I‚Äôm embarrassed because I probably sound stupid and boring. I‚Äôm training for a new job and barely can comprehend what‚Äôs going on- I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to keep this job. This condition has turned me into the opposite of who I used to be‚Äî intelligent, charismatic, highly creative, social, passionate, great critical thinking skills, unique, artistic. Now I‚Äôm diminished into a mindless robot who can barely take care of herself. Prior to all this I had finally found my calling and was just embarking on my passions and now those dreams have dissipated. I‚Äôm beyond depressed- this has taken everything from me that I‚Äôve ever cared about. My soul, mind, heart, and personality are gone. There‚Äôs a pressure in the front part of my skull that has been there for 4 months. No medical professional has alleviated these debilitating symptoms, which all started after quitting weed, experiencing extreme anxiety/panic, and going through a very stressful life event. I can‚Äôt stand this much longer, I‚Äôm stuck in purgatory like a sick joke. No one deserves this 

I might‚Äôve experienced a weed-induced psychosis this past year, and now I‚Äôm afraid that after quitting and going through severe stress I have all the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (cognitive decline, anhedonia/depression, and anxiety are key factors). Friends and family keep saying that I will recover, which I desperately want to believe, but if I do have the negative symptoms of schizo, it‚Äôs a degenerative disease and most psychiatrists don‚Äôt know how to treat negative symptoms. I just want to cry all the time and run away from this hell of an existence- I wish I could press a button on in my brain and turn ‚Äúme‚Äù on again. I‚Äôm scared, debilitated, and devastated, feel like I‚Äôm mentally disabled now, and don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this. I was finally pursuing my dreams this year and then it all fell apart when I lost my brain capacity within weeks"
I just want someone to talk to.,3,jg8ohj,4,"
I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm posting in the right spot I guess but I‚Äôm just desperate to find community because I‚Äôm just getting worse with each day and am so terrified. 

I‚Äôm diagnosed with CPTSD and DDNOS. I was initially misdiagnosed with BPD years ago but then when I saw a trauma specialist she was like nope that‚Äôs night right and everything fell into place. We tried doing EMDR twice and during the second session she stopped and told me she felt I had serious issues with dissociation and diagnosed me with DDNOS. That was about 3 years ago. I lost my health insurance so I couldn‚Äôt see her anymore and now things are so much worse, especially the dissociative symptoms. A lot of the symptoms I‚Äôve started experiencing seem to be a lot like what DPDR looks like from what I‚Äôve been reading and seeing on here but I don‚Äôt want to diagnose myself but regardless, chronic dissociation is completely destroying my life. 

I am dissociated to some degree 24/7 and it‚Äôs been this way for about almost two years now but it‚Äôs just slowly crept in and gotten worse. I feel so alone all of the time and like I‚Äôm suffocating due to a lack of connection with anything and built up emotions that I cannot release or feel but I know they‚Äôre there. I‚Äôm stagnant. I can‚Äôt connect with others. It‚Äôs ruining my relationship with my partner. I can‚Äôt be sexually active or romantic at all because any feeling of connection or vulnerability sends me into a panic causing a more serious dissociative episode. Grounding doesn‚Äôt work for me because I‚Äôm so terrified of my reality that it sends me into a panic attack and I go into a full blown dissociative episode. The only thing that keeps me calm is looking at my phone or the tv. I guess because it‚Äôs not reality and it‚Äôs distracting. I usually close myself in my bedroom with the lights off or low because lights fuck with me. I look around and everything overwhelms me. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm overstimulated all of the time. I avoid being outside during the day at all costs because looking around and seeing all of the details scares the shit out of me. I get overwhelmed knowing all of the tiny leaves are real and I can‚Äôt handle it. Sometimes I go to the bathroom in the dark when it‚Äôs really bad. Sunglasses help. I have roommates and the sound of hearing them downstairs freaks me out. I avoid going to the kitchen to get water or food unless my partner is here with me. I guess the thought of having to be ‚Äúon‚Äù and presents fucks with me. It makes me overspend because it‚Äôs just easier for me to go through a drive thru rather than connect with anyone. 

The only thing that helps me is my cat. He‚Äôs the love of my life and is the only one I can be vulnerable around and feel safe. I have one really good friend and like two others that are okay but none of them experience dissociation. They‚Äôre supportive but my situation is so bad that I can‚Äôt just rely on them to be able to handle this heavy amount of shit all of the time. I need community that understands what I‚Äôm feeling. I was laid off in March due to COVID so being stuck in the house has made it so much worse. I‚Äôm about to go back to work next week and I‚Äôm so scared to interact with people because of my anxiety and having to try and snap out of it all the time. 

I don‚Äôt really daydream anymore. I used to nonstop as a kid to escape my trauma and some as an adult but now it‚Äôs just like static in my head. Sometimes I just drive around for hours at night to keep myself busy. I‚Äôll just come home and sit and stare at a wall or my phone for hours and hours. My whole existence is just waiting for night to come so I can feel safe then fall asleep. And even then the nightmares still haunt me sometimes. I‚Äôm on sleeping meds due to chronic insomnia. 

My chest hurts constantly because I just want to feel so badly and let loose. I have fibromyalgia too which is probably from childhood trauma and all of these pent up feelings just exacerbate my chronic pain. 

My stomach hurts because I don‚Äôt eat properly. I‚Äôm scared to go downstairs and cook if other people are around so I just won‚Äôt eat or eat bullshit take out that I can‚Äôt afford anyway. 

It wasn‚Äôt always like this. I used to feel like a person. Even now I have snippets of passion but they‚Äôre very brief my brain usually shuts that down really quickly. 

I‚Äôm just so lonely and want to be able to connect to someone who feels this pain. I just need a friend. I want to feel whole again but I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. 

Sorry this is a huge ramble. I‚Äôve never posted before. I‚Äôve always been too embarrassed but I know I shouldn‚Äôt be. 

TL;DR: dissociation is fucking awful and I want community. I feel like it‚Äôs my only hope."
Feel like an airhead/ robot,30,jg7i75,5,"My brain just constantly feels empty because I can‚Äôt remember anything. It makes having a conversation extremely hard because I have nothing to contribute.i have no personality or anything, I‚Äôm just a blank piece of paper. So when someone talks to me I feel like I‚Äôm just reading of a script of what someone normal would say but it still sounds fucking stupid, monotone and uncaring. I can‚Äôt stand repeating the same fucking script every conversation. It‚Äôs driving me insane just repeating the same thing over and over, listening to people who have lives and personalities and all I‚Äôm able to say is ‚Äúoh cool‚Äù or ‚Äúdamn that sucks‚Äù like who even am I???"
Any resources on mild/moderate dissociation? Can't find anything so far :(,8,jg5mpe,0,"TL;DR: Resources for learning about moderate but not severe forms of dissociation? I'm processing some trauma I didnt realize I had and am trying to figure out what's going on with me.

---------------------
Is anyone familiar with any resources on dissociative symptoms that are more on the mild to moderate end of the spectrum? 

Most of what I've been able to find out there makes reference to how everyone dissociates a little bit, like the example of spacing out while driving, but I'm more interested about what's in the middle- still of ""clinical significance"" but not necessarily inducing amnesia? (I have blocked out some memories- mostly from childhood but some more in more recent years as well. I suspect it's from dissociation because it's all stuff where my parents were mad at me.)

Like... maybe just emotional amnesia? Or feeling like I'm aren't part of the real world, but not really with any visual disturbance?

Is that even dissociation?

If this isn't the right place for me I really apologize. I'm realizing I'm not as healthy as I thought I was (I was in denial about how abusive my parents are for a long time, and that extended to denial about how their actions have affected me.) I've got a solid therapist, supportive partner, went NC with my parents when they ramped up their abusive rather than listen to me when I tried to confront them...

...but if anything I feel worse, like my I'm cracked open or disintegrating or dissolving or something. 

Sorry now I'm rambling and I don't even know if any of this makes sense, or if it's even relevant to dissociation.

Thanks for taking the time to read this! I appreciate it!"
Fed up trying to get help,1,jg4y5x,1,"I have DID and derealization/depersonalization. My psychiatrist has been encouraging me to seek further therapy as our appointments have slowed during covid but everywhere I‚Äôve called won‚Äôt help me. He gave me a list of places to call.

I called them all. No one has counsellors with training in dissociative disorders. Literally zero of them. Just got off the phone from a centre for trauma and abuse he referred me to. I told them I have DID, described my symptoms, the secretary hesitated and asked, ‚ÄúIs that an official diagnoses?‚Äù 

I told her it was. Immediately she said ‚ÄúSorry, we can‚Äôt help you with that.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm so tired. This was the last place in my city that I hadn‚Äôt called so guess I‚Äôm shit out of luck. I just want someone to help me. And nobody will."

Therapists are not helpful,36,jfrrf1,15,"Hello,

I am struggeling at the moment to find a therapist for trauma and dissociation. I have different forms of dissociation dp/dr being one of them and at the moment chronic. For me no matter how bad I feel or how dissociated I am its not very visible to anyone else...my problem is that therapists i go to dont see me. they cant see behind the appearances. I told one I was seeing about my chronic dissociation and she said ""you dont seem dissociated to me"". she i think meant it as a helpful statement but it was completely devastating. i mean why would you invalidate someone like that when they are trying to tell you how they are feeling? also is dissociation really something that is alway perceiveable to others?"
Do you sometimes feel better than people?,19,jfjly2,7,"Moment of honesty here, i'm not sure if its because I dissociate or if I have another problem I need to figure out but. I feel because I can dissociate and that's why things really don't bother me at all (because I forget the drama anyways) and people think i'm calm/collected but really I just cant connect to me my emotions enough to react like a normal person.  

Does anyone have this sense of 'nothing can bother you' attitude sometimes and it makes you feel better than people because they get worked up about such trivial things?

(I know this sounds a-hole-ish, but I really am a nice person, but I know that I have this above side to me also and im trying to pinpoint if my dissociation has created some A-hole ego or something)"
Not my face,6,jf5j1g,7,"I used to say I spent most of my life with my head in the clouds, I think that‚Äôs an almost romantic way of explaining near chronic dissociation. It‚Äôs like my life is a dream. Not a nice dream or a bad dream, just simply not real. I‚Äôm always thinking that any time now I‚Äôm going to wake up. It ebbs and it flows, I have some days and weeks that are clear, I think, as far as I remember, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I didn‚Äôt dissociate very much as a child. First time I remember it happening was halfway through high school, and it was one of those out-of-body types. For the most part I just carry on, it doesn‚Äôt freak me out too much, I don‚Äôt think I really feel enough for it to freak me out. 

For about three years I was very suicidal. I‚Äôve lost count of the number of attempts I‚Äôve made. I was in and out of the mental health ward, spent a whole month there at one point. The rooms were quite nice, you had a bed, some shelves, an armchair by a window, and your own bathroom. I had to ask the nurses for some newspaper and sticky tape. I had to cover every reflective surface. My face was ((is?)) not my face. I still struggle with this. I have days where I can‚Äôt stop looking in the mirror, I want to put makeup on, I fluff and I preen. Other days I want to scream and cry just catching a glimpse in the back of a faucet. 

I‚Äôm getting better with it. These days the problem is mostly just ‚Äúslippery-ness‚Äù. Trying to grasp reality is like trying to grasp a wet bar of soap. The harder I squeeze, the further it gets away from me. It‚Äôs most concerning when I‚Äôm driving, I tend to not even remember getting from A to B. When I try to tell people this they dismiss it as just ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù, saying that everyone does that with their regular drive. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs really the case, I‚Äôm always questioning if I‚Äôm just imagining this all happening. Is this really happening? Am I just imagining it, making it up? 

I‚Äôm foggy at the best of times, and in conversation I‚Äôve noticed I sometimes say things without realising I‚Äôm saying them, that words are just happening, or alternatively I‚Äôll have to ask people to repeat themselves because I didn‚Äôt realise they were actually saying something. I watch them talking, trying to focus, I see their mouths move and I hear noises, but my brain doesn‚Äôt actually register the words. 

I think I was ok for a little while, I don‚Äôt remember anything bad happening, except for the ‚Äúslippery-ness‚Äù, the ‚Äúditzy-ness‚Äù, the ‚Äúhead in the clouds‚Äù or ‚Äúoff with the fairies‚Äù type thing. Lately though I‚Äôve been having trouble getting to sleep. I get comfy, the lights are turned off, I‚Äôm warm and feeling calm, but then everything morphs and twists. Black shadows appear, patches of dark that are darker than everything around them, my body feels like tar, different parts of me feel like they swell or shrink in turn, pulsate, ooze. I can‚Äôt move. I can‚Äôt speak. I can‚Äôt open my eyes. Sometimes I cry, but it‚Äôs only tears dripping down my face. I fight it. It feels like eternity, but eventually I manage to open my eyes, and then I find a patch of light in the room, turn on a light or reach for my phone. I‚Äôm simultaneously terrified and numb. I get up and go for a snack or a cigarette, drink some water, read for a bit, and then try to sleep again, apprehensive, but knowing that I must. If I don‚Äôt go back to sleep it only gets worse. 

Sometimes, in the dark, when I‚Äôm trying to get to sleep, instead of the shadows, I simply forget what my face looks like. I try to remember photos of myself or looking in the mirror, but I only remember all the other faces I‚Äôve seen and never my own. If I try to look at photos or turn on the light and look in the mirror I only feel nauseous and uncomfortable. That‚Äôs not my face. Again, if this happens I get up, try to clear my head, have a snack, drink some water, and go back to bed. I‚Äôve never tried to kill myself during one of these episodes, but if I don‚Äôt go back to sleep I will try to in the next few days, and I typically won‚Äôt sleep until I make that attempt. 

I don‚Äôt really know why I wrote this, perhaps to see if anyone can relate, if anyone is real, to scream into the void, to put non-existent words to non-existent paper, I don‚Äôt know."
Relationship With Someone Who Also Dissociates,6,jf4szl,1,"My boyfriend and I have recently discovered that we both dissociate. He‚Äôs been doing it for most of his life while it‚Äôs somewhat new to me (at least at this level). I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has also been in a relationship like this? Tbh I‚Äôm relieved to feel like we can understand and hopefully support each other. That being said I‚Äôm curious of what I should look out for as potentially negative things that could come from this? Even if you haven‚Äôt had the same experience, any potential problems you could think of, I‚Äôd love to hear. I‚Äôm not even considering ending the relationship but I like to be prepared."
question for people who have gotten therapy help before and have dissociative amnesia,7,jf20eu,2,"Hey everyone! my name is Saizon I‚Äôm 27, married and trying to live as much of a normal millennial life as I can. I did have a traumatic childhood and just found out I have dissociative amnesia. I know that I‚Äôve had it for a while, but seeing a high school friend and hearing the stories he brought up as if they were new definitely brought back to my attention that I need to deal with this and stop avoiding it especially before I start having kids. (Other big signs are barely remembering my wedding, not remember raising my baby sister or any moments that I‚Äôve had with family members/friends). 

I‚Äôve reached out to Reddit because I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research, but I can‚Äôt find anywhere about people‚Äôs results from getting the different types of therapies out there done.

How do you know you're dissociating?,6,jec505,2,"I've been extremely tired for almost three years now (I'm 18) and sometimes it gets worse for a couple of weeks/months, like the last couple of months. It often feels like my visual range is really small as if I'm only aware of what I'm directly looking at. Most of the time I feel like I'm far from reality, as if I could do anything without any consequences or repercussions. Finally, when my moods get bad, if I'm really sad for no reason or if I have a mental breakdown, everything feels really heavy and I'm not able to clearly see how people see me or how my life is going. Am I dissociating?

I'm scared I shouldn't be driving anymore.,1,jeb2td,5,"Please don't judge me for this. I know I need help.

I have a job and I need to keep driving to keep it. I work part time, flexible hours, and sometimes called in. The cabs are not reliable where I live, and the bus even less so.

But here's the problem - I dissociate while driving. Frequently I will get in my car, turn it on, and switch off in my brain. I drive on autopilot. (Tw!! - if it's related, I lost my virginity through rape in a car. I'm mentioning this because I think this is why I switch off in the car.)

I got in a couple fender benders when I was younger, all due to me dissociating while driving. I tried to do grounding techniques and only drive when necessary and avoid driving in bad weather if possible. Things got better for a few years and I drove with very little incident.

But then I got a job and I'm not stressed out at the job, but I got in an accident in July. 2 weeks later a bump in the parking lot. And just this afternoon, a very rainy fall day, I got in a fender bender and I have serious damage to the front end of my car.

If I didn't have the job I would give up driving. But I like this job and I want to keep it. I'm proud of the fact that I'm working again after a breakdown where I never thought I would work again. I'm getting off disability and my coworkers are nice and I feel useful. I don't want to be an r/neet again, but I might have to if I can't drive.

I don't think I'm a danger on the road? Maybe, I'm not sure. Nobody has been hurt, it's mainly just been bumps. The last 3 accidents, I'm off in my head and I'm not paying attention because I'm dissociated and I bump into the back of another car at a slow speed. Nobody has had to go to the hospital and actually most of their cars haven't been damaged at all. My car has taken the brunt of the damage.

Tbh I'm in a really stuck situation. I'm feeling lost and hopeless after this afternoon. I wish I could just be normal."
for any scared Newcomers,2,je9he5,0,"Listen to me, this is for any new comers, I‚Äôve had this feeling of dissociation for awhile now, from the fact that I was abused physically and neglected as a child.

been dissociating for a bit,4,je0cc4,2,its scary reading the posts on here that say they‚Äôve been going on in dissociation for years. i‚Äôve only been severely dissociating for a month and a half and im scared???? i hate it so much and sometimes i feel like im better than i start thinking about how i used to be carefree and not have to constantly worry about if im here or not. im so jealous of my past self when i just had depression or anxiety this is so scary

Just realized how deep this actually goes,11,jdyf4g,13,"It's so crazy that the only thing connecting me to reality is my cognitive knowledge that this should be reality. All the other aspects of the human experience seems to be less real than a dream to me. It feels like I'm in a coma and even my senses are only understandable to me, but not ""feelable"". If I get out of this it will be quite a shock to actually feel again that this is and always was in fact reality.

Question about visual symptoms,2,jdstn0,1,"I was dealing with severe panic disorder and intense dissociation for about 6 months.

I get quite bad after-images, have quite a bit of sensitivity to light and quite a bit of sensitivity and visual snow in dark places.

is this dissociation?,2,jdovi6,0,for the past month i started having focusing and memory problems and kinda distancing myself from reality by watching movies /streams / other peoples lives. i feel like im too scared to actually live irl and constantly need something to distract myself.. i kinda dont think anything about my irl and create a fake reality involving youtube if that makes sense? also i feel like im out of it all the time
Am I Dissociating?,10,jdlmj9,3,"I've been feeling very off lately. Is it dissociation? I've been trying to find the best way to describe it, and I guess I would say it feels like I'm on autopilot. I cant get out of my own head, I cant focus on anything, and I feel very distant from everyone and everything. It doesn't feel like I'm in my own body. When I try to observe my surroundings and be present in them, it feels as if I'm looking back on a memory. I don't control anything. It doesn't feel like things are actually happening to me, if that makes sense. I just feel cut off and I cant connect with people or engage in activities. I've been trying to help this feeling by doing things I don't normally do. Yesterday I made tea and sat outside, which I don't normally do. I think it helped, but when I woke up this morning I was back in that state of detachment. I'm not sure if this is dissociation or not, it's never happened to me before."

My thoughts everyday,1,jcwao8,2,"This is a comment I posted on a YouTube video about dissociation but I wanted to share it here as well.... It sucks dealing with this in your head because my mind keeps telling me that this is all made up and that even when I try to get help that's made up as well and not really there so like I could of made this whole video up. Part of me knows that's not true but like whys the other part push me to believe that all day then? I constantly dissociate and have the worst exestential ocd you can imagine. Sometimes I feel like im literally nothing at all, not even happening in my own head so like what even am I and what's going on what did i Create? What do I do? Do I listen to these ""words"" or whatever I'm saying to myself? Is history real am I actually not alone and there's been a life and world before me? I couldn't have created this right? But like nothing can convince me other wise when I feel like this and it's the scariest thing ever and I don't wanna kill myself because what if I don't even go anywhere I'm still stuck dealing with it? Im not suicidal I'm just lost. Sometimes I wonder if this language or whatever these  "" words"" I'm using even make sense to myself. Whys my brain so powerful and it controls me. But I am my brain so who the fuck is asking this to myself?"

Is This My New Forever?,1,jcmyeg,1,"Last week I had an awful panic attack, which led to the worst dissociation episode. I was dissociating so bad that I would blink and every time I opened my eyes time would skip. It was like I was blacking out over and over. I started tasting metal. I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking. I couldn‚Äôt physically feel anything (but that happens nearly every time I dissociate). I ended up leaving work in a hurry. I got home, called my mom (she‚Äôs my rock) and begged her to come home from work. I‚Äôm 23.... I shouldn‚Äôt have to beg my momma to leave her job, but I was terrified. I had no idea what to do. I don‚Äôt even remember the drive home. I blinked and I was on the couch with my mom next to me.

Ever since that day I‚Äôve been living in a constant dissociation state. I am left to question if this is real or not. I hate labeling it, but it‚Äôs almost like I have PTSD of this panic attack: That‚Äôs how horrifying it was. I‚Äôm in constant fear of having another one, which makes me so on-edge that I‚Äôm never feeling like my true self. I‚Äôm going on vacation with the in-laws next week and I‚Äôm terrified. I can‚Äôt be in the car 3 minutes without freaking out. I don‚Äôt know what happened in the car that day, but I get so scared being in the car. Actually, I‚Äôm scared, period. My mind is constantly racing around my panic attacks. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm going to call my psychiatrist on Monday, so that will hopefully calm my anxiety, but that won‚Äôt stop me from dissociating, it‚Äôll just hopefully make my panic attacks happen less...

Also, I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with any dissociative disorder, but I‚Äôve been having spell like this, almost daily, since I was 13.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am scared to go into work, scared to drive, scared to be anywhere that‚Äôs not my bed... I‚Äôm even scared of sitting in the living room. 

This is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me. I am so lost.

Is this my new normal? If so.... I absolutely hate it."
Why I personally feel like my consciousness of thoughts and the way others perceive me are disconnected,6,jcltv9,0,Does this happen to anybody could someone please explain to me what I constantly feel on a daily basis a lot of people perceive me as a weirdo but The complexity of my thoughts and personality can‚Äôt be explained through words and ive realized that mabye this is why I‚Äôm dissociated from myself and other people and can‚Äôt be the person I want to be and be social and have a problem communicating because words are created with my voice box which is apart of my body and my words are perceived by other people and heard by other people in reality and that is what is perceived by other people and my consciousness is what actually holds my actual thoughts and this is why I feel dissociated because the overwhelming feeling of realizing that nobody will ever be able to realize who I truly am through the English language is what makes me dissociated

Dissociating on nicotine?,2,jciqka,1,"I vape occasionally and though I hate doing it habitually, it is really really helpful in relieving stress at times, and can be really helpful in certain social situations. I enjoy it half the time, it used to make me pleasurably dissociate. But now it doesn‚Äôt seem to hit the same, it tends to just make me sick. I took a break and that made it hit harder, but made me feel more sick. It also gives me that dissociated feeling like i‚Äôm slightly in front of my body, or i‚Äôm feeling everything slightly offset to my body.

Dissociation & a struggle to be present or do anything but dissociate 24/7,9,jcesf6,5,"So I‚Äôm diagnosed with a dissociative disorder. At first it was just depersonalization & derealization, which is bad enough. But It‚Äôs gotten progressively worse since then & it‚Äôs probably more of a fugue now or even progressing into DID. I have a long history of complex childhood trauma, & I guess I‚Äôm stuck in this freeze state pretty badly. So my question is where do I start. I feel so lost and I really struggle with being mindful for even a few seconds, like extremely resistant, especially due to all the traumatic feelings under the surface. I know it‚Äôs necessary though if I ever want to recover. Besides the mindfulness what else can I do to go the other direction instead of it getting worse (don‚Äôt know if it can get much worse than this). I appreciate any input, thx in advance."
Can you tell me what dissociation feels like to you?,4,jc9upg,6,"I'm sure you guys get this question all the damn time so I apologize but I'm currently working on getting a psych assessment and I feel like knowing if I'm dissociating is important for that. I'm pretty sure I dissociate during intimacy for totally unknown reasons. I find that I blank right out and then just come to and I'll be trying to make eye contact but my eyes are out of focus. 

However I don't get like that in any other situation. I do still space out a lot but I'm usually deep in thought. I'm wondering how else dissociation can present itself. Can you dissociate and be thinking still? Does everyone who dissociates feel kinda the same way while doing it? Help please"

how is any of this real? like... is life real? loll i cant even feel emotions or anything. i just feel so cold. its so cold in this room. i am safe rn but i keep hearing stuff and i get scared by little things. for example, if i hear a cupboard close? i get an anxiety attack. i think im scared of the dark now too..."
Does dissociation remain permanently for some people?,5,jbwwab,8,"I‚Äôve had it since I was 13. In 26 now.

Dissociation after car wreck??,3,jbu6lj,1,It‚Äôs taken me a few months to figure out what‚Äôs going on but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs dissociation. I will suddenly feel like I‚Äôm not in my body. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt see my feet moving but I don‚Äôt feel myself moving them. I can even literally pinch myself and barely feel it. I have a hard time bringing myself back. What‚Äôs crazy is most of the time no one can tell. I‚Äôll be at work (retail) and be checking customers out like a fully functioning human but in my mind I‚Äôm screaming that I can‚Äôt feel anything. It has sent me into panic attacks because I start to feel like I must be really sick or something?? The only thing I can think of that could have started it all is a car wreck I had in June. I wasn‚Äôt critically injured or anything but I was trapped inside my car for about 20 minutes while the car was laying on its side. Idk. I just learned about dissociation recently and found this group today so I‚Äôm not even sure if I have a question I‚Äôm just trying to get through the day.

"Forgetting, then finally remembering again. My experience",36,jb8vd2,4,"So I didnt realise it fully at the time, but for the past year and a half I had essentially forgotten almost anything emotionally significant that had happened to me before that point.

 I was aware I had forgotten and it distressed me to a point because I felt separate from myself and didnt understand why I am like I am, it was confusing and distressing. Like I didnt know myself at all. But apparently I didnt put much effort at all into trying to remember which looking back is a bit odd sinse that was what was distressing me.

I could recall events mostly, like I knew certain things had happened. But it was like I was recalling a story someone else had told me. I had no emotional awareness of those events, things that hurt me deeply at the time, when recalling, didnt even slightly phase me. Again, bit weird when I think about it but at the time I legitimately didnt notice. 

I was struggling with how forgetting made me feel. I felt conflicted, I felt separate from myself, I felt angry at myself because I thought I had made up the fact I'd ever had problems. I wasnt sure if I ever had genuinely struggled, but it felt like I had. I felt like I was lying to myself and to others but I didnt know what I was supposedly lying about. But weirdly I never tried to remember, and if i did i was just completely unable to recall any of the emotions.

Then yesterday, after about a year  and a half of blissful ignorance, it was like someone opened the flood gates. All of it came back, I never had a specific significant trauma, just significant prolonged pain. I sat there in shock, both at how far I'd come in that time and at how id ever managed to forget the defining features of my life up until that point. I honestly was in shock, for about 4/5 hours after it all came back I just sat there and remembered, gobsmacked. It was jarring and overwhelming, my ears were ringing and I felt like I'd pass out. What I remembered wasnt objectively that bad , but to remember how I had felt for years, remembering the emotions and the pain, truely remembering... was surreal.

But i wasnt sad or upset. I was sad to remember my suffering, but me now wasnt sad. It was liberating, almost felt euphoric. Like it all made sense again, I knew who I was again. And for the first time in years, I dont hate who I discovered I was. I was proud of how far I'd come, proud of my progress, proud if my strength and resilience. I wasnt having an identity crisis anymore (like I'd been having sinse I apparently just fucking forget everything one day). I wasnt conflicted, I recognised myself again. I'm me again. And who I am does include the bad, but only as context, not as a constant. Both the pain I felt before forgetting, and the fear that forgetting brought me were each torture in their own right. But as I remembered, it felt like seeig it in hindsight. Like it was all in the past now. 

I was understandably confused as fuck and a bit concerned that before yesterday I had no real memory of almost anything past primary school. I looked it up and it seemed to fit the category of dissociation. But I'm not too familiar with the concept so I might be wrong, but it seems to be the best definition I can find right now. I think after a certain point It just got too much for me, I dont think anything triggered it really. Just a long time of a lot of things and it got too much. 

I'm kind of greatful though. It's like I emotionally checked out and went into autopilot for a while. But in that time I chnaged my life so much, chnaged it for the better. Things that held me back and overwhelmed me for years just one day I forgot about and took that clarity to sort my shit out. I've managed so much in that time that I'm so proud of myself for, in that time of having forgotten I truely turned my life around and had fun doing it. 

The only truely difficult thing I was able to acknowledge in that time was how lost I felt. Despite turning my life around and achieving a lot of amazing things, I knew something wasnt right. It felt like the person doing things and the person judging those things being done were separate somehow. The person I saw in the mirror I didnt recognise. Not metaphorically but literally. It was a scary feeling. I felt like a liar and an imposter, not knowing what the lie I was telling was, or what the truth I was hiding was either. I felt like I'd lost myself, but i didnt know what I'd lost. I didnt know who i was or why. But despite that, superficially i thrived. 

Looking at the big picture now I feel greatful and sad. Sad that the person that felt that pain was me, it's always been me. But im so greatful that one day I just unknowingly separated myself from that and bettered my life permanently and effectively. Both stages came with their challenges sure, but somehow I dragged myself out of my self dug grave. I feel at peace now, I can benefit from the changes I have made comfortably and I can know and love myself for the first time. I know myself again, and i love myself. I'm so proud of myself. Forgetting was fun but it was blissful ignorance. Now it's just blissful. Knowing myself again, feeling in control and whole.

 I didnt know this kind of thing existed, forgetting, let alone how someone could be so complacent and unaware of it. I knew I'd forgotten but that's about all I knew and I rarely addressed it. I think it makes sense though, like the brain I've hated myself for having... protected me. I couldnt have done it all knowingly, I was in too deep. So I just... forgot. And now that I'm at a place in life i never thought I could EVER get to, a place im beyond proud and a bit astounded to be, my brain let me remember. I'm at a place where the pain is long enough ago and different enough that it feels unfamiliar for the first time in my life. I can handle it now, I can cope on my own this time. I can remember and thrive, not just one or the other. 

That's my story. I'm sorry it was so long and I highly doubt anyone cares or is reading this far but i dont really care. This has been really therapeutic to get out and it feels like a conclusion. Like that chapters over now. I'm not sure if this is right for this sub, I'm not well versed in dissociation and what happened to me might not even be that, but it's the best fit I can find. I'd love to talk or chat with anyone who has experienced this phenomenon, or someone that might be knowledgeable on how and why this happens. It's new and confusing to me and It feels a bit surreal to know it all happened, it sounds mental because it is but i jsut never realised I guess. So yeah thanks for reading if you did. This has been my experience. My story and struggles are far from over, but I feel a peace and calm I've never felt before and for that I'll forever be greatful:)

How to ground yourself and get out of a dissociation when you're working?,3,jb3o4e,1,"I had a scary moment yesterday and start dissociating really badly in the middle of my shift at work. I was aware I was at my job, but I couldn't convince myself it was actually happening or I was actually there, it's hard to explain. I couldn't feel anything and I had extreme tunnel vision, but at the same time I still couldn't really see or process anything. I struggled to hear or understand others and have conversations, I could only get about 5 words out.  The only way I ended up grounding myself and getting out of it near the end of my shift was when my friend hugged me for like 20 seconds, rubbing/patting my back and his hand on my head, but it caused me to have a bit of sensory overload for a second since that's the first thing I felt the whole night. I got better from there. I don't know what triggered it, because it started at an anxiety attack, and then it turned into dissociation. What are some.ways you ground yourself while dissociating, because I genuinely could not get out of the episode?
TL;DR: what are some methods you use to ground yourself while dissociating and help you get out of the episode?"
Driving with dissociation,16,jb16x4,7,"Hey guys
I‚Äôm currently on my 10th driving lesson and my dissociation is preventing me from doing as well as I could do. Some days it‚Äôs worse than others.
It feels like my eyes glaze over and everything stops looking real. I desperately try to zone back in again, but sometimes I can‚Äôt, so it‚Äôs like my fleshy human suit is doing the driving for me & then I panic. I also have trouble retaining the information that my instructor tells me because of it.
I reckon music would help to ground me a bit more, but I‚Äôm not allowed it on during lessons, so I‚Äôd like to know if anyone has any other suggestions? I would really appreciate it, because it can be scary and frustrating 

Thank you <3"
Happened yesterday... Anyone has any idea what that was?,0,jb05d8,257,
Therapist says I'm dissociating due to burnout @ work. Similar experiences??,1,jaqgih,6,"A little background: My job has been stressful since day 1. I started out doing two jobs with basically zero training. Things got better for a while after we hired someone else, but one of my other employees quit, so I'm back to doing two jobs during my busiest time of the year with no supervisory support or even empathy/encouragement. I also have a trauma history and GAD/illness anxiety.



Recently, I was explaining to my therapist how I felt at work and how I haven't felt myself lately. I wondered about burnout.

For example, when working on a task at work, I completely forget what I'm doing or what I'm working on and cannot get the thought to come back. I have to completely start the task over or just start a new task because I can't remember what I was trying to accomplish. 

Today, I had a pretty scary thing happen. I restarted my phone and I absolutely could not remember my passcode for about a half hour. I haven't changed it recently or anything either. My mom and partner try to normalize this by saying similar things have happened to them, but I'm beginning to thing there's something seriously wrong with me. I also had a headache during this episode, so my immediate thought was ""brain tumor.""

I have also been quite short with people and I say things that aren't like me. My personality is very bubbly/smiley, and due to my anxiety, I am not usually confrontational. I feel like I've been quite opposite, at times, more recently. I say things I regret, and I just hope no one holds the door for me so I don't have to force a smile (under my mask) and polite ""thank you.""

I also have these experiences where I picture myself drowning underwater, and I can't get to the surface. These usually happen when I'm driving home from work. I have also thought that maybe I want to get an illness so I have a chance to breathe. That is very odd for me, considering my illness anxiety. 

Has anyone dissociated due to work stress, and does my experience sound like burnout/dissociation?"
Are these symptoms of Dissociation?,4,jakg9f,1,"Hello! The other day I was going through my pictures on my phone and for the first time in my life I had a very weird feeling. I was looking at pictures of me yet I felt like I didn't know that person. I really couldn't identify with them. For  a few minutes it felt like I was so lost and I panicked a bit because of this unsure empty feeling I got. I really didn't even feel like I was in my body, that was the really shocking part.

Some days have passed and I still get that feeling from time to time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and it is very hard to connect that image with myself. The logical part of myself is saying ""Well you are looking in the mirror, it must be you"" but it still feels odd. Sometimes when I walk in the street I don't really feel like me, more like a hollow husk that I am trapped in.

Now that I am thinking about it while writing this, I always had moments where it was hard to place myself in the image in the mirror.  I had these for as long as I can remember . But they felt minor and now they are more common.

I have to add that I have some body image anxieties.

I am just posting this here because I want to know if what I am feeling is familiar to what people with dissociation are feeling. Of course I am not doing this as a diagnosis, I just want to have an idea of what is going with me. If not do you know anything my situation reminds you of?"
Is this dissociation?,3,jajde0,1,"So this has been pretty much happening since I was around the age of 12-13 and I always brushed it off up until recently when I friend suggested that I was dissociating. It's really difficult to describe but randomly I will very suddenly feel like all my surroundings are foreign to me. For instance, I'm walking towards my lecture hall and suddenly I'll feel like I've never been in the building before and have difficult remembering where my lecture room is. I know that I've had lecture in this particular building numerous times but suddenly I feel like it's really foreign to me. 

Fortunately muscle memory guides me to the room but otherwise it feels very new. Every time this happens it lasts like 5-20 minutes long. Can anyone relate?"
Who in here has overcome dissociation? Even if it was just for a finite time.,3,jah513,2,"What works for everyone? I've always felt like I was in a dream after a traumatic experience when i was 1 and 4 y/o. I dont remember anything about it and most of my childhood in general, but i was told by my mother that something happened those years and i was never the same after. How do I get out of this 'dream' state and start enjoying life again?"
Need help understanding my own experience,24,jaedix,11,"I had a really weird session with my therapist today. The time felt very distorted and on several occasions, I was heavily dissociated. I'm not very familiar with dissociation, but it seems to happen frequently. I feel like I'm not really there or like I'm watching myself or like time is paused (I guess would be my best way of describing some of what it feels like)

I also felt a weird experience. It's hard to explain, but I have a set of many (I think around 8-9) inner voices. One of the inner voices is incredibly sweet and acts like a caretaker to me in moments of stress or challenges. Well today during the session, after a period of dissociation, it was as if she took over and started doing the talking instead.

I feel like that doesn't make much sense - but yeah it was very strange. My memory of the session is patchy and I was having a lot of difficulty remembering things during the session. But my overall impression leaving was good. I'm just confused about what happened. 

Wondering if anyone can help explain my experience at all. Thank you if you can - sorry if this is the wrong place for this"
Alternativs to mindfulness?? (self harm TW),1,jabgcm,2,"Tw for self harm

So I have complex PTSD and I'm fairly use to dissociating, and I've got to the point now where mild-moderate dissociative apisodes don't really bother me too much, I mostly get frustrated because I can feel that I'm not really myself or being as productive as I need to be.

Because of this, I've never looked much into how to stop dissociating. I used to see a therapist (not an option rn, like at all) and we realised pretty quickly that any kind of mindfulness makes me dissociate far more, and adds a good dose of panic into the mix. Instead we focused on other things and eventually the dissociation improved on its own to the point where it was having minimal impact on me, so I paid it very little attention.

Recently its gotten so much worse, I'm dissociating most of the time to the point where I can barely move, and I have a lot of periods of blank/missing memory. This on its own isn't ideal, but a few times after 'coming to' after these episodes I've found that I've scratched my arms or dug my nails into my skin. Not enough to do any real damage, but it's not a trend I'm keen to continue and definitely not one I want to get any worse.

I think basically what I'm saying is does anyone know any other ways to 'snap out of it' (ugh I hate that phrase) that don't involve mindfulness? (or therapy to address the cause since that isn't possible rn, and likely won't be for some time, if ever)

If you got to the end of this then thanks for reading üòÖ"

This is not the first time something like this happened. I remember I was having another dissociation episode a while ago and I heard two people(?) arguing inside my head. Also, when I was being verbally abused, I felt like a totally different person. This other character would come inside my head, and basically try to protect me. They (?) would think **""I have to protect (my name), this is my purpose. I have to make sure that (my name) is safe.""** After the threat was over, I would sorta feel like myself again.

However when I look at my phone again I realize that almost 2 hours have gone by. I have absolutely no recollection of this two hours,  and I know I wasn't asleep. I came back to in the same exact position that I was initially in, so it is unlikely that anything occurred during that period. There was no trigger for this, at least that I am aware of.  For reference this isn't the first time something like this has happened, I used to occasionally have mild dissociations when driving to and from school and work when I was younger, along with mild dissociation due to gender dysphoria.

Official Resource Thread - PLEASE READ,12,8gjybb,1,"I would really like to build up our resources so that we can take action when we're having moments of dissociation or terror. Having a subreddit helps, but I know from experience that sometimes you need IRL help to bring you down. So I will be posting all resources I find that are relevant to DID/DPDR/CPTST as often as I can. I don't want anyone who comes here to feel helpless. And as always, if you are having a crisis please call 911 or go to the nearest hospital. That being said, my inbox is always open and I get notifications on my phone when I get messages so I will be here to help to the best of my abilities anytime you guys need it. Even if you just need to hear that everything will be okay.

Please feel free to share any resources that you find on this thread and I will compile a list and beef up the sidebar with as much information and resources as possible. We can do this!

My latest and greatest resource is [The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation](http://www.isst-d.org/)

Also, the National Alliance on Mental Illness offers a  24/7 crisis line that you can text when you're feeling scared or dissociating a lot. They will text with you and offer advice and try to get you to calm down and they will also offer resources if needed. Most importantly, the mobile crisis line allows you to speak with someone who, if they determine you need this, can send someone to your house to check on you or get you medical attention. 

For the text crisis line, text **""NAMI"" to 741-741** and someone will text with you and get you calmed down or help you find help otherwise (I love the text line, because sometimes I just need to hear everything will be okay from a professional and this makes it so easy).


If you are in a crisis whether you're suicidal or not please call **800-273-TALK (8255)** to get with someone who can direct you to a crisis line specific to your needs. Or, find someone to just talk with you.

Thanks guys and I look forward to seeing what you all have to bring to the table!"

I‚Äôm 26 and have lived in Australia, Canada and England since I left Ireland at 18.

I‚Äôm back in Ireland now and I‚Äôll remember my life in Canada or Australia, go back to that moment mentally and then start feeling insane trying to work out how I got here again.

I also will frequently see doppelg√§ngers of people I knew in other countries, in my hometown which also makes me feel crazy/like I‚Äôm in a Truman show situation.

My ex from Canada wrote to wish me a happy Easter and, despite living together and dating for over 2 years, I felt like I didn‚Äôt know her at all. I remember everything but the only feeling attached is confusion... everything is just ‚Äúhow did I get here? Was that (past life) really me?‚Äù"

A while ago I was getting ready to sleep, and then suddenly I felt very overjoyed, and I felt like my name was Steven, even though that was not my name. I also felt like a different gender.

This is not the first time something like this happened. I remember I was having another dissociation episode a while ago and I heard two people(?) arguing inside my head. Also, when I was being verbally abused, I felt like a totally different person. This other character would come inside my head, and basically try to protect me. They (?) would think **""I have to protect (my name), this is my purpose. I have to make sure that (my name) is safe.""** After the threat was over, I would sorta feel like myself again.

However when I look at my phone again I realize that almost 2 hours have gone by. I have absolutely no recollection of this two hours,  and I know I wasn't asleep. I came back to in the same exact position that I was initially in, so it is unlikely that anything occurred during that period. There was no trigger for this, at least that I am aware of.  For reference this isn't the first time something like this has happened, I used to occasionally have mild dissociations when driving to and from school and work when I was younger, along with mild dissociation due to gender dysphoria.

Can I get some help?,2,mkfbgd,4,"Pretty sure this is the right place to post and just warning there is slight mention of self harm...

This is like the only way I can explain it.

I feel like I‚Äôm watching my world shift from and inch or two behind my normal view of sight and everything is a little more blurry than it should be. 
I could be sitting in one spot and everything starts shift up and I feel like I‚Äôm moving down but I‚Äôm not physically moving and nothing feels real.

This also happens sometimes throughout the day when I‚Äôm just walking, or in school or anything like that and time is just gone. I‚Äôm in class at 8 or 9 and all of a sudden I‚Äôm already at lunch and ready to leave. Like I realize I went through the first few hours and I can sort of recognize what happened and have certain memories of that part of the day but it‚Äôs all one big blur. 

I‚Äôve been trying to focus on not self harming and I‚Äôm trying really hard not to and I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough unless I do it and there‚Äôs my other post, I feel inadequate, or something idk but I was just laying down scrolling through Reddit and everything was not real, well it was but it didn‚Äôt feel like it, it felt like for a second like I was high again but having nothing in my system and I was on the verge of having a panic attack. 

I felt shifted back from my normal vision, it wasn‚Äôt exactly tunnel vision but it definitely didn‚Äôt feel right. I could only focus on my breath and realized I had started breathing heavily and everything was moving sort of laggy and slow compared to normal. It‚Äôs the first time this has actually kind of scared me into thinking nothing is real and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I‚Äôve told my mom about it and she says I don‚Äôt have enough trauma for my brain to resort to dissociating and splitting from reality and she says I‚Äôm sleep deprived, vitamin deficient and maybe it‚Äôs just my way of living.. but I‚Äôve only started really experiencing it big time in the last 9-10 months and my memory has gone to shit and everything is almost constantly shifting and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Could someone possibly give some advice other than go see a doctor or therapist cause right now that‚Äôs not an option...?"
My story/venting.,3,mk9qh0,1,I've been dissociated now for 3 years.  I've had childhood trauma where I was abused by my father for 7 years non stop almost every day verbally and sometimes physically threatened and yelled at and insulted day in and day out. I've always had anxiety but 3 years ago I was put into a situation with someone from my school when i was in high school. And it reminded me of how i felt when I was with my dad but I felt powerless to fight back or do anything because I felt embarrassed. And since then I've been dissociated. Dissociated non stop for 3 years. I cant even remember really when I was last happy. I've been to 6 different therapists with no luck. It hasn't helped me. At this point I dont really know what to do and I wonder if Ill ever be happy again.

Dealing with amnesia,7,mj7yc0,9,"Good day! 

I am struggling with dissociation since my teen years due to childhood and adolescence trauma.
What bothers me the most is the dissociation leading to chronic amnesia.

Examples like me telling me friends the same news twice on separate events because I forgot I already told them. I forget whether I have eaten today. 

When I'm going through very stressful times (like I do now, I'm learning for my a levels) I even forget what I did each day and struggle to remember what I taught myself.

Now, here's my question: How do you deal with the amnesia that comes with dissociation? 

Should I be writing down everything I do and reread it? Should I just let it be and accept it?

Is it gonna get worse? What if I struggle to remember very important life events?
 Can I restore my lost memories? 

Thank you in advance!"

This is my second coffee gig but my first post-ish pandemic.

Sometimes I stand for long periods of time doing nothing. And I have no recollection of doing so. 

I‚Äôm familiar with dissociation. I‚Äôve done it before, but I‚Äôve never blacked out so hard it affected my work performance. 

In result I‚Äôve decided to leave in good faith with the company to go to a more intensive therapy, but I‚Äôm terrified because I‚Äôve never experienced this deep of a dissociation unless I‚Äôm literally being berated/yelled at.

How to recognize when you‚Äôre beginning to dissociate.,14,misznj,2,"I have trouble with hard conversations or talking about my trauma. I want to help both my partner and I have the tools to recognize an oncoming episode of dissociation. 

I recognize that when I start floating away, no actual problems are getting solved. I want to be able to problem solve rationally, without getting overwhelmed and feeling like a basket case. 

I feel like grounding and coming back to reality after it‚Äôs already happened is one thing. But I want to be proactive with nipping these episodes in the bud beforehand. 

My partner doesn‚Äôt recognize when my eyes are glazing over and I‚Äôve gone quiet. He‚Äôs a Chatty Cathy, and will keep talking. It‚Äôs not intentional, and I know he feels bad, and doesn‚Äôt want to make it worse. I think it would help to figure out how to communicate when he‚Äôs lost me.

Being a better partner while having a dissociation disorder,3,miyaej,3,"I'm currently with someone that I consider is my very best friend and the love of my life. I'm very happy and lucky to have him in my life but I know how hard it can be with myself sometimes or how tough it can be when I go through episodes or recover from them. I accept how I am and he does too because he's amazing, but how can I really ensure that I'm not letting my disorder control some aspects of how I deal with things or my relationship? 

Recently I've really focused on how I deal with problems or situations. It's very easy for me to shutdown and I recognize that it very much affects other people around me even if it's not my intention. It gets very hard to speak or have linear thoughts or recognize social cues when I dissociate but I am working on it. I know communication is a big answer for so many things and i don't want to be unfair to my significant other and just shut down because it isn't fair to him. I've been working on just trying really hard to open myself up and ask questions or talk things out when things get hard (something I really struggled with, sometimes he would have to even ask for me to say anything because speaking up was so hard) and I can say that I recognize improvement on this behalf ever since then. I love him with all of my heart and I just really want to be better and be the best that I can be so I can truly make him as happy as he makes me and so I can just be the best version of myself. I want to make sure that my actions reflect my intentions even if it's hard to speak out sometimes, he just deserves the best.

This is one of my main problems but I really want to and is actively working on this but I don't want to lose hindsight of progress. Do you guys have any tips on how you ensure that you're really seeing the big picture in your relationship and on how you try to progress from having a dissociation disorder for yourself? Or how do you guys deal with dissociation in your personal relationships/friendships to where you can make sure your partner gets the love that they deserve?

I think I made my nephew dissociate - did I react in a bad way?,10,miqmov,4,"He is 4 years old and said the word ""bitch"" and I told him in a calm and warm tone that it's not a nice word and that people feel offended by it but that it's ok that he didn't know the meaning of the word. He was so ashamed by this, that he wouldn't look me in the eyes and when I called his name he didn't react. I took him in my arms and apologized, but he was like a lifeless doll, said no word, no eye contact, tears rolling down his cheeks. I held him in my arms and then I told him that it was my fault for being insensitive and that I didn't want to shame him and so on... I thought that leaving him alone in this situation as for ""giving him space"" would just make him stuffing it down and forgetting it, so I stayed sitting next to him and just ""being there"" with him. After a while he went out for some minutes, came back and we went on playing..
I don't know if this really was dissociation, but I felt so sad for him, it was awfull. It reminded me so much of myself. I think I know how he was feeling: worthless, unworthy of forgiveness and love, abandonable.
I don't know if I reacted in a bad way. Should I have given him space?"
Forgetting I've told people things...feeling out of it etc,5,miv00n,1,"Hi, I'm 21 and I have a lot of experience with dissociating...especially ever since covid started it seems to have gotten worse. Anyway I'm in therapy and essentially it's seen as my coping mechanism when things make me anxious and what not. 

Usually i experience this unsettling feeling where everything outside of me feels off and almost like everything is glitching if that makes sense? Often it's very subtle and grounding techniques can get my mind off it but occasionally it becomes very prominent and takes over me and I begin to panic.

For the last I would say 2 weeks I started noticing subtly that I don't feel like anything that has happened actually happened, which again I'm often used to, but it's been for a prolonged period and I'm finding that I cannot connect with things and events that happened the day before seem like they happened ages ago.

Another thing I've been noticing is forgetfulness, I will tell someone something and they would tell me I've told them before but I would have absolutely no recollection of doing so which is weird? I've also been much more tired recently but this could do with the fact I've been on 3 different antibiotics in the last 3 weeks for a persistent uti.

I guess I'm wondering if I should be worried?"
Clinical dissociation from working long hours on computer?,4,mitiw6,2,"I work really crazy hours in front of a computer, sometimes 100+ hours per week, mostly programming. I basically work Elon Musk hours (but unfortunately without the billionaire wage).

Lately I've been feeling extremely dissociated, sometimes so intensely it fills me with panic. I look at my arms and body, and it's like I'm looking at a different person. I feel mentally detached, like I'm on autopilot or my conscious mind is somewhere else. I feel like I'm on low-level psychedelic drugs, just not in a fun way. I keep reminding myself that if something was truly broken with my head I wouldn't be such a productive software engineer. People who are dying can't do super high-level cognitive tasks.

Obviously getting away from the computer would help, but my job is super demanding and it's not realistic for me to cut my workload. I'm making a lot of money and I'm responsible for a lot of other people's jobs, I can't just stop working like this for probably at least another 12 months.

I'm getting bullied there by some of the other girls, my family tells me to tell them off but I'm not even present to be able to do anything. On top of that when I get home I go crazy with impulsive behaviors like drinking, cutting, yelling at people for nothing. I decided to post because it's the weekend and I got my check and I was thinking about buying cocaine. Idk why I'm behaving like this at a time in my life I have been most productive. I am, by all means, ""happier"" than I have been in a long long time. I love this job. I love what I do and it could not be a better fit for me. Maybe it's because of my first 2 weeks, less friend interaction, or maybe it's because I have to re associate at the end of the day when I'm already tired. I've been working closing so when I get home I am exhausted but wanna have fun.

Is this dissociation?,19,mi4pvp,3,"When you live your life on autopilot and with depression (for me also pure-O OCD), then after a few years something suddenly ‚Äúwakes you up‚Äù to what your life has come to.

How it isn‚Äôt what you wanted at all, you didn‚Äôt take the time to focus on what your heart truly desires, you settled for less, you hung out with completely wrong people, you made many wrong decisions, and you didn‚Äôt care enough to go on the right path, and now it‚Äôs too late.

It‚Äôs like you see ruins after a war, but now you can‚Äôt do anything about it. All because you weren‚Äôt ever completely present in the moment to notice the unfullfillment inside you, and you didn‚Äôt take care of yourself.

And because everything suddenly feels so strange, you feel disconnected with reality, and prefer to escape it as much as possible, with excessive daydreaming and internet use over many hours of the day.

I don‚Äôt feel like I have multiple personalities but I do have a lot of blackouts and memory loss from disassociation so who knows how I act when I can‚Äôt remember. I‚Äôm a little fearful of this diagnosis and what it may mean about my brain and how things have gotten. I thought this was all just severe dissociation but knowing something else may be at play is very frightening
Does anyone take SSRIs?,12,mhtwhs,32,"Ive been prescripted setraline (zoloft) for depression, anxiety etc and mood swings. i did inform the doctor i dissociate daily (im always flicking in and out, for longer periods when im tired or in social situations) but he didnt ask any questions about it and didnt mention it at all. just said he recommends i go on medication. im really really worried about taking SSRIs for many of the potential side effects and fear of the unknown, but im wondering how it could or if it will impact the dissociating at all? positively or negatively?? anyone else? currently not recieving therapy either which is another reason im so worried of starting the medication, without further support"
psychiatrist made me feel like i have no hope,23,mhfxo3,7,"im not sure if psychiatrist is the right word but whoever can prescribe pills/diagnose is who im talking about, anyway awhile back maybe 2/3 months ago i had an appointment with her for the forst time because my therapist thought it might be helpful to get medication and a proper diagnosis. she seemed really sweet but once i mentioned dissociation it seemed like she didnt really care, i eventually ended up being diagnosed with ptsd and given zoloft but it dodnt work and i stopped on my own accord because i felt helpless. i keep thinking anout it all and it feels uncurable. and its So hard to find anyone that specializes in dissociation disorders and when u do they r booked up for months. i feel so stuck. :( just a rant :("
Dissociation Episode in Airport Today,5,mhlevv,8,"So it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve been around a huge crowd of people since COVID really took a huge toll on everything. Alongside my dissociative disorder, I have extreme, EXTREME anxiety. I had been nervous about getting on a plane, but mostly nervous about going through the airport. TSA, long lines and so many people coming and going from all over the world gives me a tad bit of anxiety. Take in mind, I also was traveling alone through the airport today and that might‚Äôve contributed to the huge episode I had while waiting to board my plane. 

First arriving to the airport, I start to experience some uneasiness. Mostly some slight shaking of my hands and feeling a bit nervous going through TSA. I just start to notice all the people there and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how ‚Äú all I need to do is board the plane, and I‚Äôll be OK.‚Äù I started to notice something was off with my brain when I got past TSA. I was on the underground bus sitting down waiting for my stop when all of a sudden, I started feeling so strange. The bus was kind of shifting on the floor very subtlety and it threw me off but I eventually shrugged off the weird feelings I was having, I got up... And I walked off the bus. 

As I‚Äôm approaching the boarding area for my flight, I noticed I was an entire hour early. A surge of panic started jolting through my body and my brain. I felt very disconnected from the world around me. As if, I was a strange entity invading the space around me. I felt so far away from people mentally. I ended up going on and out of the bathroom, 5 different times before the flight left. It got so bad, I thought I was going to have to ask someone for medical attention. My heart was pounding out of my chest, light headed, very very dehydrated and really disoriented. I tried to throw up in the bathroom, for the uneasiness was so disturbing, I felt physically sick. I was hyper away of myself being nervous and felt as if it was so bad, I was making others alarmed around me. I tried tapping exercises in the bathroom stall before going back out to sit and waiting for my plane, but it seemed like a endless feeling of dread and a peculiar sense that consumed my mind. 
 
‚ÄúWill this feeling ever go away?‚Äù 

I couldn‚Äôt think a single, positive thought as I drifted off in to this disturbing mind space. On top of things, my phone was on low battery. I called my boyfriend and managed to get words out and talk about what I was going through. Hearing a familiar voice sometimes helps with the dissociative episodes but I felt so far gone. 

I found a charging outlet and convinced myself to get through whatever was happening. All I could think about was wanting to just pass out and not exist anymore. It was so scary feeling so out of my own body in a room full of so many people I did not know. 

As a side note; I took some CBD oil thinking it would calm me down but it did the exact opposite. I‚Äôm not sure if the oil only worded my situation or it just didn‚Äôt cure my anxiety this time. Either way, I plan on staying away from CBD oil and I‚Äôm going to try to avoid traveling by myself. 

As far as dissociation, it is a very real and scary thing when you‚Äôre by yourself and no one is there to assure you of anything. Does anyone else‚Äôs dissociation co-sign with their anxiety attacks? I feel as if they happen for me at the same time, just making my experiences worst overall."
"Experiencing something weird, not sure if dissociation and could use advice",4,mhj3b5,7,"I‚Äôve been experiencing a sensation recently where I will be on my phone typing, playing a game, scrolling etc and all of a sudden I will stop recognizing my hands. It feels like they‚Äôre typing and moving completely independent of my brain and I don‚Äôt even recognize them as a part of my body. it isn‚Äôt like I actually forget they‚Äôre my hands, I consciously know that they both belong on my body and that they are mine. its more like I just am suddenly not involved in their activity and they appear to be foreign and unattached to my existence.

I am naturally a very anxious person. my mental health has taken a harsh hit over the past year, and new anxiety symptoms have been showing up in my everyday life. is this an experience that could be tied to some form of dissociation/dissociative disorder? I also am pretty sure I have undiagnosed attention deficit disorder, so my focus and attention are sometimes less in my control as well. does any of this sound similar to anyone else‚Äôs experiences? should I be worried?"
Psychiatrist prescribed me citalopram oral drops? Can you share your experience with this medication?,1,mhoxtm,2,"I am scared to start taking it because I don't know what I am supposed to feel when I take it.

Visual remnants of DPDR,12,mha2wb,6,So I‚Äôve had to deal with DPDR for about 2 years now. I believe the main cause of it for me was marijuana but I‚Äôm not too sure. Over the last year I‚Äôve quite weed and have worked on improving my thoughts to combat my dissociation. However there is one symptom that I don‚Äôt know how to deal with. The best way I can explain it is my vision always seems a layer away from reality and I‚Äôm separated a bit. I no longer feel actually distanced from reality and things don‚Äôt look weird anymore to me. But I still have a visual distance that I don‚Äôt know how to go about fixing. Would trying to ignore it and act like I don‚Äôt have it fix it? Or should I be more aware of it? Any help is greatly appreciated
Is brain dissociation reversible?,5,mhdf9t,7,"If someone has brain dissociation, can it be reversed, if day you‚Äôve resolved those traumatic memories? Or does it just stay that way?"
Has anyone else felt this before.,25,mgu9ir,11,"Do you ever feel so impossibly empty, that you aren't sure where anything starts or where it ends? Like you're floating at the bottom of the sea, or walking through pitch-black darkness? The thoughts in my head, are they mine? The things I say, do really I mean them, or am I saying things out of social expectation?

I had a psychotic break four years ago after a traumatic event. Lost a substantial amount of memories, probably won't ever get most of them back. The memories I do remember, they feel... reconstructed. As though they were something that happened to someone else.

I don't recognize myself, because all I see in the mirror is a face and a body that has never really felt like mine.

I thought I'd adjusted as well as I could. Some days harder than others, and all that. I though I was moving on and making my peace with all of it. Engaging in all the right things like work, hobbies, and so on. Even through 2020, I managed quite well.

Until I couldn't do it anymore. Something I only ever seem to realise in retrospect.

Lately I feel like an impostor stuck inside a stranger's skin again. It feels like some VR game gone horribly wrong. I don't know why that feeling came back. I haven't felt it in a long time.

Everything has spread out too far and nothing feels real. My emotions aren't mine. I just...watch this body feel them, in some strangely removed sense. I cannot focus on anything. I have to work so much harder at being ""present"" when I'm really somehow a million miles away.

That's the thing about the emptiness, isn't it. The distance from everything is welcome, until the distance *is* everything, and whatever existed before feels like it's gone.

Not really sure what the point of writing this is. Wondering if anyone can relate maybe."
does anyone else get hit with reality?,27,mge9vi,8,"it seems to me to sort of be the opposite of disassociation. at random moments i‚Äôll just be hit with the fact that i am alive i go to school i live with my family i exist i can feel and see and hear and touch things. it‚Äôs really uncomfortable when it hits especially if i‚Äôm in the middle of doing something. it can also mean i think fuck what if life isn‚Äôt real, what if this is all a dream or a joke or some other big scary thing. i‚Äôve talked to other people about it but i‚Äôve never heard of anyone else experiencing it. i couldn‚Äôt even put it into words to google it. please let me know if you experience it/ know if it‚Äôs normal"

I love it,6,mg7j0p,3,Does anyone else kinda love dissociation? And dissociating. It helps me escape the real world. I wish I could never leave the feeling honestly.
"Rarely dissociated for years, now I get an episode at least once every 1-2 weeks",3,mg7kxv,4,"Is it common to go years rarely having dissociative episodes only to suddenly get them constantly? I would only get them if I was extremely stressed on rare occasions, but after recently pulling up possible flashbacks, I'm getting them all the time. I don't even think these flashbacks are real memories (they're memories related to preschool, but I loved preschool and never was scared to go, so I don't believe these are genuine flashbacks) but my brain seems to be treating them as genuine. So I'm having lots of episodes where I feel very detached from my body and reality, I have waves of intense emotion where I really want to bawl my eyes out before snapping back to an emotionless state, and I feel like my body is a robot. Sometimes I think of what might be flashbacks and I curl up violently and try to cry. These episodes last for hours and will sometimes continue even after I wake up from an episode.
Is this something that is common or is what I'm experiencing not dissociation and something else entirely? Google results says that's what dissociating is but I have so much doubt towards what I'm experiencing. Trying to get a therapist but with the pandemic going in, it's hard to get anyone right now, so I've just been feeling lost and confused for the last several months."
Losing my taste with dissociation,0,mg8u4x,2,"I have DID, because it is genetic within my family and my sister also heavilyI recently have acquired this new ‚Äúsymptom‚Äù in which I can‚Äôt really taste when i dissociate. It‚Äôs a weird thing, I‚Äôm not really sure what triggers it. But I will be eating something (usually my favorite foods, bagels and baklava and my favorite iced coffee) and they seem to have a lack of taste and I can still feel the texture of the food but the taste of it is barely there and I if I think too much about the fact that I can‚Äôt taste, it gets to a point where there is no taste at all. I‚Äôm not sure what triggers it but I am fully aware of when it happens. And it freaks me out that I can‚Äôt enjoy my favorite foods anymore. Maybe because it is too ‚Äúexciting‚Äù or overwhelming that I can‚Äôt handle it? I don‚Äôt know.. let me know if this happens to anyone who suffers from DID. Thanks y‚Äôall üôÇ"
"Can the ADA help, if dissociation makes my job impossible?",11,mfrgpw,1,"So I've been dissociated to various degrees for most of my life, but now I've reached the point (working at home during the pandemic has contributed mightily to this) where my job has just about gotten too hard for me to do anymore. I've been pondering retiring to a simple life in Mexico. But I was wondering if there was any chance I could leverage my condition (with formal diagnosis) to get my boss to structure my job in such a way that it's sustainable. The ADA includes mental health conditions, and employers are supposed to make reasonable accommodations, but I'm wondering just how much leverage it could give me. I'd be willing to take a cut in pay and job title, commensurate with whatever duties I have post-restructuring."
I'm curious if anyone has had a medical explanation for their symptoms.,6,mfweic,1,"I've been hit by this junk pretty hard for a little while now. The onset was so rapid and ""unprovoked"" that I'm wondering if there might be a physiological element to what's happening. I know certain issues specifically in the temporal lobe can cause DRDP symptoms. I even read an interesting paper relating symptoms to vestibular dysfunction (aka vertigo). I'm hanging in there, but the persistence and timing of this just doesn't seem to fit a psychological explanation (although, I'd take a psych-cause over a brain tumor, epilepsy or stroke damage any day)."
It‚Äôs a start,10,mff20j,5,"So we have had validation from a psychotherapist that we aren‚Äôt faking and that what we are experiencing is real and is okay since we have been working on internal communication 

We have periods in which their is denial and blockage of switches which appears to cause headaches or migraines. So We really want to be open with them but still struggling with the reality of it despite the fact that more than one mental health person has now commented 

We‚Äôre waiting for a psychiatrist appointment now and on top of all that we believe that we are on the autistic spectrum, so that‚Äôs fun 

And so much dissociation lately too and don‚Äôt even know if we mad about it either

Why is it so hard to accept and to get proper diagnosis for stuff that has been experienced since the vessel was very young, based on clips we recall and things remembered by family or friends and partners"

how to live w/ dissociation?,23,mf5l5r,6,"So the past 2 or so months my dissociation has gotten a considerable amount worse and i still haven‚Äôt learned to live with it ig? Sometimes i feel like i‚Äôm not myself in my head or there are two different people in my head, it‚Äôs kind of distressing. I‚Äôve talked to medical professionals and they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs only dissociation but how do i live with it without panicking myself every other hour? for instance i‚Äôll be sitting and i just think hmmm having a body is weird, my voice sounds weird, or the worst what if life isn‚Äôt real. It‚Äôs hard to get these thoughts to go away and they‚Äôre very unsettling. In other word how do i stop questioning everything, how do i stop believing i my dissociation (ie. life is a simulation, not being real) Help would be greatly appreciated"

Long-term dissociation and Getting worse (years),27,mewk9l,6,I feel like I'm.. Degrading fast and hard. Its been bad for years but the stress and anxiety and the covid-ity of the world and my personal life makes it so much worse. I want to be a person again and remember things and stop being...  gone for long stints of time. I miss experiencing life and remembering it and being there for all those moments
Possible DID?,10,mevv8x,5,"Anyone with DID or knowledge of it I was wondering what you think? So I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs been going on but on top of my dpdr I‚Äôve been experiencing odd things. I researched and DID came up but I‚Äôm not sure it fits because I don‚Äôt feel I have alters with formed identities. Instead it‚Äôs subtle changes in my identity that do not feel like my usual self, emotions and memories that do not fit with what I am doing, and sometimes I‚Äôll just have a feeling like I‚Äôm a different age or even gender and do things that cause me to question why I would say or do that. I still identify this as me but at the same time it‚Äôs confusing.

Edited to add that I have running conversations in my head all the time that I feel almost left out of or like they are kind of far away if that makes sense. Nothing bad or scary just stuff that doesn‚Äôt fit with what I‚Äôm doing which I‚Äôve always just ignored even though it can be distracting."
Anyone else ever aware enough that you talk during dissociation?,37,meilck,15,I've been dealing with dissociation over the last several weeks as a response to being fired from my job. Has anyone else ever experienced having a conversation while you are dissociating? It's strange because I feel like I'm lucid but I also feel like I'm not. Sometimes I try to speak and no words come out but sometimes I talk but I feel like I'm literally in no control of what I'm saying because I have no control and feel like I'm just watching myself do all this.
"Fear of ""my"" reflection?",28,medarb,3,"Hey guys, it's my first post here. After being treated and medicated for depression and anxiety, I'm not seeing any improvement in my symptoms. They used to be mild but now they are getting to a point where they affect my life.

I don't know if it's dissociation, I don't really know what this is actually, but I can't see my reflection. I mean, I can perceive the image in the surface but I don't see anyone. Not even myself. I know it is me but I don't see me. I covered my Room's mirror and I avoid seeing me in other reflective surfaces. It terrifies me for some reason to the point I flinch and have to look away. 

What is happening to me? What can I do?"
Question,2,meqay5,2,I have not been getting enough sleep lately and I feel a little bit out of place and I forget stuff easy and I feel like I‚Äôm not always 100% in the world and I also have ocd and anxiety is it normal to become dissociated when these things combine or just on there own?

Dissociative Seizures,4,me9xip,0,"I was diagnosed around 6 years ago with dissociative seizures (and honestly never understood what these or dissociation in general was until recently, I‚Äôve only recently realised that I have huge chunks of my life missing, and that these black outs and ‚Äòweird feelings‚Äô were cause by dissociation - which I still can‚Äôt quite wrap my head around) and while looking into it, I couldn‚Äôt find many people who have this issue. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people describing their experiences with DP/DR, DID, OSDD etc, but not dissociative seizures and I was just wondering if anyone had similar issues and had any advice on how to handle them? 

Also apologises for any formatting issues, this is literally my first post."
Can I get some help from y‚Äôall?,4,me8wpz,2,"I‚Äôm not entirely sure if this is me even dissociating but my anxiety and stress has gone up quite a bit in the last little while and I‚Äôm constantly out of it. Today in particular I ‚Äúzone out‚Äù but when I do the world shifts. It‚Äôs weird for me to explain and I feel stupid talking about it.

This is like the only way I can explain it. It‚Äôs kinda like when you look at an optical illusion for a while then look at a wall and it moves and shifts but like make it the rest of your vision and everything moves, kinda like being high which I feel like I‚Äôm not very entitled to say cause I‚Äôve been high once and didn‚Äôt have a good experience. I feel like I‚Äôm watching my world shift from and inch or two behind my normal view of sight and everything is a little more blurry than it should be. 
I could be sitting in one spot and everything starts shift up and I feel like I‚Äôm moving down but I‚Äôm not physically moving and nothing feels real.

This also happens sometimes throughout the day when I‚Äôm just walking, or in school or anything like that and time is just gone. I‚Äôm in class at 8 or 9 and all of a sudden I‚Äôm already at lunch and ready to leave. Like I realize I went through the first few hours and I can sort of recognize what happened and have certain memories of that part of the day but it‚Äôs all one big blur. 

Sometimes I don‚Äôt feel real either, actually scratch that, most of the time I don‚Äôt feel real but today, like I said, was pretty bad, and I lifted up my left arm and my vision went wonky, stuff was moving, my view of sight went back a couple inches like I was watching a movie on a big screen and my arm didn‚Äôt feel like mine, it was light and airy and moved fast and had not a lot of control like it had fallen asleep without the pins and needles.

Sorry I feel really dumb saying all this and have no clue if this is the right place to post to get any sort of info and help back. And thanks if you took your time to read this. Sorry"
Memory loss / feeling like my memories weren‚Äôt me?,9,mdy9bz,1,I have aphantasia ( I don‚Äôt have a minds eye I can‚Äôt remember things with imagery)  and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just because of that but when I think of my memories they feel fake .

The Deep and Michelle - what my disassociation looks like to me,2,mdyeuy,0,"I used to think it was normal for people to set their dreams. I get in to bed choose a vision or scenario and press play. Its the same every time: a dream about me wading in clear still water with no top and no bottom. I think i‚Äôm drowning but i‚Äôm not panicking or gasping for air - its all very calm. Funnily, I actually think this is/was me ideating suicide or death. 

The second is me dreaming about a character I watched on TV when I was 14. Sometimes I am her. Sometimes we are together. Kind of like an imaginary friend but less interactive - more watching things play out in the right order. But it‚Äôs this intrusive obsession that cuts in to my life because I take several naps a day to press play and see these two visions - deep waters or Michelle. 

I want to think or dream of other things sometimes but these two bring me so much peace and comfort from my anxiety and internal criticism. Now, I‚Äôm in therapy so I‚Äôm learning not to judge my actions either way but we‚Äôve gotten to the point of talking about my disassociation and I freeze up and insist we talk about something else. In one session I just cried in silence for the whole thing. I know these dreams are not my only disassociation symptoms. I probably have a dozen triggers and symptoms that I don‚Äôt even know of. I‚Äôm sure not every one is watching harry potter and drag race on repeat since lockdown started like some kind of gay wizard hermit. üòÇ"
Has anyone ever tried plant medicine for dissociation?,9,md5nul,18,"Lately I've been getting really fed up with not being able to think, feeling out of body all the time and not cognitively aware of my surroundings and have had a terrible memory.

I recently have discovered a bunch of testimonials on YouTube about plant medicine. Particularly Ayuhasca. And I know any substance like that gets an automatic resistance from a lot of people, but I've been doing a lot of research and what I've found is that it seems to have the ability to heal deep seeded trauma. I've been looking at a center in Costa Rica called Rythmia and it's the world's first medically licensed plant medicine sanctuary where they have trained doctors and staff leading you through a week of Ayuhasca ceremonies that supposedly 93% of people have life changing events. 

I was wondering if anyone here has tried such a thing. What your experience was and did it help at all with dissociation?

Thank you for your time."

Tips to prevent dissociation during an interview?,8,mch6ab,5,"I started getting panic attacks again in December and was put on 40mg Propranolol 3 x a day. Three weeks ago, I had to give a speech in front of my professor and a judge and I'm pretty sure I dissociated. I had tunnel vision, nothing felt real and I don't remember giving my speech at all.

Wth??,2,mbythj,4,"This is my first Reddit post, but I feel like I need help and advice. So my reasoning for posting under this community is not to undermine, stereotype, or put out misinformation. It is more for my own mental help. 

Okay so about a year in a half ago I realized I started having amnesia episodes. I think what made me first realize is when I would be driving. I would start at one destination and either black out and come back to being there in a matter of seconds, or come back and realize that I‚Äôm completely lost and have no clue where the hell i am. There were multiple scary times where it‚Äôs happened and I‚Äôve had break downs or panic attacks, because it‚Äôs a scary situation to be put in. At that time I weighed my options and after a while longer of these episodes happening I cut out driving. This was a very hard decision with me being in my prime time and just getting my license. Although I told my parent about my situationist was brushed off, and became a very sensitive topic for me. They would say things like ‚Äúwhy have your license if you‚Äôre never able to drive‚Äù and although I know it wasn‚Äôt meant to be hurtful it, made me feel so useless. Jump ahead a bit and what made me really realize something was wrong is when I was at college. My first two weeks there, I thought I was adjusting pretty well. With covid going on, being away from my family, and some shit not working out how it was suppose to. My mom would call me everyday, and I would get up and go to class, call my friends all normal shit. Well I guess subconsciously I wasn‚Äôt okay. On one particular day, I remember mom calling me and asking if I was okay and just saying that I seemed off. Once again I assured her that I was fine, everything was going great and I was super happy and excited to be there. Well a bit after that call is when things started to change. I started to become a bit chaotic and reckless, which is nothing like how I normally am. I attempted to shave my eyebrows and face with a razor I think? I say I think for the fact I can‚Äôt fully remember what the object was. Another thing about that day is I changed my clothing about 3-4 times. And each time would change back to what I was originally wearing Bc who tf agreed to what I was doing??? Everything is somewhat of a blur honestly. Once again another jump in the story, I don‚Äôt remember why or how but I remember being on my bed with my computer. I suddenly started to feel really ill. I got a really bad migraine and started to feel super nauseous. I remember saying ‚Äúdamn keliana, you didn‚Äôt drink enough water‚Äù and arguing with myself that I didn‚Äôt feel thirsty and felt no need to actually get up and get some. However I didn‚Äôt win that argument, I remember getting off my bed, and when my foot touched the floor it was like I jumped into an entire new universe. It was like I was seeing everything from a new perspective that I couldn‚Äôt recognize. I couldn‚Äôt remember my name, where I was, who I was, how I got there. This obviously brought on an entire break down. I remember having this feeling like I could see, but that I was also blindish if that makes sense. I remember touching everything around me and going ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay calm down, your keliana. Your feeling sick, you need water, this is your dorm room, you just feeling sick. Grab your water bottle and fill it up‚Äù mind you all these conversations are going on in my mind. And at the time aren‚Äôt really a different distinct voice, just sounds like myself. Which has always been normal for me. I‚Äôve talked to myself for as long as I can remember. I don‚Äôt remember a time where I didn‚Äôt talk to myself. I had this huge window in my room that I so fucking loved. It was such a beautiful spot to just sit down on the ledge and look out at. But suddenly I was to terrified for the curtains to even be open. I had this weird Idea that Someone across in the other building was planning on sniping me. I shut the blinds and crawled on the floor for the rest of the time I was there. I did start to feel a bit better later, but it was such a scary and odd experience. Since I couldn‚Äôt get my guinea pig up to the dorm with me as my support animal, and the process was taking so long After that me and my parents agreed that I should come back home. I don‚Äôt think my mom understood how deeply it was even after that until she witnessed it first hand. One day once again everything was fine I was in the car with my mom and siblings. We had just come back from shopping and it was a good day for me. While in the car though I suddenly got the feeling again. I started to feel pressure right on my head, and started to get nauseous and the paranoia set in. I do t remember a lot, but I remember my mom asking me questions and from what I though, I thought I answered them right. Turns out I didn‚Äôt , not my name , my birthday, where I was going, who I was going to pick up. When my mom finally did calm me down I remember just being so irritated. So many words were trying to come out my mouth at once that nothing was making sense, and I was becoming so irritated that I think I even said ‚Äúomg shut up‚Äù and my mom said to calm down and some other stuff I can‚Äôt remember. *small side note, my mom has dealt with similar things with my grandmother who was professionally diagnosed with did* so she told me some grounding techniques. Another thing is the difference in perception of reality. I was abused from a very young age until 12 when my mom finally got custody of us. There would be times where I would tell my mom a story and everything is wrong or not close to the truth. Like I remember living with my dad when I was in kindergarten and us having such a happy loving life, and him making me blueberry pancakes. I remember it so vividly that it can‚Äôt be fake. Yet I never lived with my dad fully at that age. I stayed with my mom. Yet I don‚Äôt ever remember staying with my mom until she got custody of us. I remember living with my dad was hell. The shit he put us through was horrible. And I remember crying all time in my room on the floor petting my head saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay keliana, it‚Äôll get better, one day you‚Äôll see mommy‚Äù at this time I was in 3rd grade and was already having suicidal thoughts. The only thing that kept me is the thought of leaving my younger brother with my father. I was his mother at the time. I made breakfast for him, woke him up for school, helped him with school work, took him to school and picked him up. I made sure that although I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to but myself, he always had someone to protect him. That was my goal, my job if you can understand that. Anyways idek how I got to this subject. I remember when I first started realizing that I was ‚Äúweird‚Äù was when I was 12 and my mom got me back. I would have these moment where I wasn‚Äôt myself, or everything seemed fake or like a game. I randomly started talking in third person. It just seemed normal. I would always respond like ‚Äúkeliana wants.... keliana said.... kelianas hungry.......‚Äù I remember my step dad saying that it was weird and he definitely didn‚Äôt mean it in a detrimental way but that‚Äôs how I took it. I began correcting myself and working really hard to not seem weird. I threw away all my stuffed animals and began to just talk to myself more in my head. I regressed and became once again dependent on myself. This started a long list of mental problems, from eating disorders to depression and suicidal thoughts and actions. Recently now that I am of legal age and can legally smoke things have once again changed up. Whenever I feel a ‚Äúswitch‚Äù it‚Äôs more  amplified. I remember very traumatic things that I shouldn‚Äôt remember. But it‚Äôs not all bad. Sometimes it‚Äôs good and I‚Äôm happy, and remember amazing memories. One specific time after coming down from a high I found myself typing in my notes. *THIS IS COPPIED DIRECTLY FROM MY NOTES THAT DAY* 

‚ÄúIf someone don‚Äôt answer this damn phone 

I‚Äôm good I‚Äôm grounded, moved to Yari on the couch
 
She said your loud

Teenaged huh uh josh

Some old man screaming at me like in a movie zhbdjdjsudbe being disowned. People holding me back. Him screaming you can‚Äôt do that, stop her. And people in the background holding him back trying to calm him down

Bitch turned my notes app off

They won‚Äôt stop fucking arguing

Like I‚Äôm trying to act normal

Hurry before they start yelling again‚Äù

This is the first time that it was like I was there there with them, I could see them and hear distinct differences in voices. I remember the guy yelling at them to stop me, and other people holding him down. And my cocky ass saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs my fucking life,my phone. If I want to type and write this out you can‚Äôt stop me‚Äù.  Another time which is more recent. I was laying in bed. Not asleep fully but not fully awake either. And I suddenly had the need to use the bathroom. And I was like ‚Äúfuck that I‚Äôm not getting up‚Äù and a little girl saying she had to use the bathroom too, and another women saying at since I had to go I might as well take her too. And I remember saying ‚ÄúI do t even want to get up to go myself, someone else take her‚Äù and the argument continued. Like five minutes later I got hit in the gut and could jo longer deny that I had to go. I remember sitting up and going ‚Äúfuckkkkk fine I‚Äôll take her‚Äù and I remember when I opened my eyes I was like no. Did I just fucking imagine that shit? Did I just hear all that shit in my mind. I did have to go to the bathroom though so I didn‚Äôt think to much on it. Recently everyone‚Äôs been kind of silent and it‚Äôs been good, but scary and sad as well. I think maybe it‚Äôs because I criticized myself and them so much. Continuously telling myself to stop faking shit. Because that‚Äôs what I feel like I‚Äôm doing. Faking. But I also feel like it‚Äôs to intricate to much details for me to remember to fake. I thought maybe I hurt there feelings and that‚Äôs why they are silent. I still get random conversations or thoughts, or find out that I bought some shit I know I don‚Äôt remember buying. I did apologize though, I said that I would try to make an effort in being more understanding and reasonable. And also start asking for permission. Which someone decided to get another piercing without asking and you wouldn‚Äôt understand the shock when I woke up the next morning to find it. Either way I think I‚Äôm trying to cope better. I remember I made a ‚Äújoke‚Äù when out with a friend I hadn‚Äôt been out with in a while. It instantly hit my gut when I said it. I made the joke ‚Äúit would be my fucking luck keylin comes out‚Äù or something similar. And i remember a lang in my chest as soon as the words came out. And instantly apologized. Well I didn‚Äôt apologize in my head Bc I was so shocked I accidentally said it out loud. And my friend was asking who I was apologizing to. And told her enough but not the full truth. Also the reason I don‚Äôt know if this is real that I‚Äôm talking about is because I don‚Äôt have names for everyone. The guy who yells at me and we argue a lot I don‚Äôt have a name for. But I love him, he‚Äôs so caring and although we argue a lot because of how stubborn I can be I wouldn‚Äôt trade him, because he also comforts and prefects me so much. And he‚Äôs the one I hear most of the time. Telling me I should eat, drink take this, do this. Idk I love him. There‚Äôs another guys who is around my age, his name is josh. I don‚Äôt know much about him other then we get into trouble together and hype each other up to much. He was hyping me up the day when the guy was yelling at me. Like ‚Äúyea it‚Äôs her life‚Äù yards yada. There‚Äôs any. And idk if it‚Äôs a guy or girl. I have always told people I would change my name to Amy since I was as young as 7. Everyone thought it was Bc my aunt name was Amy. But it always had a deeper meaning. I would make all my sims characters named Amy as the main character. Which would be a girl, but i have pictures of me dressed up in real life as a guy at that time. Then there‚Äôs keylin. Keylin is for sure a ‚Äúmacho man‚Äù and he even just now said to remove the quotes from Macho manüòÇ he started about 4 years ago. It‚Äôs a spin off from my own name, and I hope that if I ever have a son to also name him that. Anyways this is so fucking long and Idek where I was going with this anyways. Last point I want to say is that when I ‚Äúswitch‚Äù it‚Äôs not always a bad or full black out experience. Sometimes it‚Äôs a full blackout, where next morning hopefully I can figure out what the hell i did before. Sometimes it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm coherent and there enough to respondish. Like I‚Äôm more just observing and watching, but can still put in whatever I want to say. Other times is where I‚Äôm not fully black out but I‚Äôm also not fully there. It‚Äôs just a roll of dice in which I‚Äôm gonna get. Also I know people have very distinct voices when switch and speaking out loud, but it‚Äôs hard for me to distinguish. Sometimes it hits me and others around me, and we are like where tf did that voice come from, but it‚Äôs also hard Bc I‚Äôve always had a passion for languages and accents. So am I just picking up what I‚Äôve heard and am repeating it???? Idk but if anyone has any answer please let me know. I know I should talk to a therapist, but I dont have therapist money right now. Please don‚Äôt be mean when responding, when I come back to look at this later after I make a note I don‚Äôt want to fall into anything dark as many things are easily triggering. Which I also know why post it. At this point it‚Äôs just be nice‚ù§Ô∏è if anyone has anything they want me to go deeper into let me know and I‚Äôll try to as soon as I can. I hope this is easy to understand, all love K‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è"
Remembering my life,22,mbj509,1,"Tw for a lot of things. 
There are a lot of things I feel I can't tell people because they'll think I'm lying. What has caused me to dissociate my whole life is having to suck it up and hide who I am. It's not like I don't want to tell everybody my trauma I just feel like I was never allowed to. I'm not allowed to feel anything ever. I feel like I've never been allowed to to the point it doesn't feel like it even really happened. Society does not allow an open conversation about trauma and assumes you don't want to talk about it. Maybe I do.
I was so sick as a child I almost died, I had an autoimmune issue and it caused inflammation that probably damaged my brain. 
My mom had dangerous men (johns) at my house often. 
My mom was in a coma from a car accident when I was 6. 
My mom did hard drugs. 
My father rejected me due to me being born with too brown skin, although a paternity test proved he was the father.
I was abused by my grandparents physically and mentally. 
I was abused by a friend sexually, and felt guilty my entire life for asking for it to happen again for 3 years. 
I was severely bullied in school. 
I chose to be in an abusive relationship because it was comfortable. 
I'm choosing now to address these. I don't have to ""get over myself"" I'm allowed to be sad, upset, and angry that these things happened. I'm allowed to feel every emotion at once about my childhood. This was years upon years of daily trauma. I refuse to wear something pretty and smile just because that is how someone is supposed to act. I'm allowed to be me. If you want to tell something you are frustrated you had to hide you don't have to worry, you don't have to. You're allowed to be upset."
Am I faking it?,2,mby8ch,1,"I can't find anyone else who has similar symptoms to me anywhere and I don't know what's happening. I've been to a therapist and she says I have depersonalization and dissociation disorder but they don't really fit to what's happening. And I definitely don't have DID because I just don't have the trauma for that. Don't get me wrong, my life has been shitty enough for plenty of trauma but. You know. 

I often dissociate and begin to believe I am someone else. 1 of them is a character from a book series I've been writing. 1 is a child with no preexisting character. And what really gives me pause is that 2 of them are existing fictional characters. Anime characters. Which is fucking cringe, I know. I hate it too. 

I still retain memory from when someone else is in control, which I see memory loss is a main symptom of dissociative disorders. 

When it is someone else, I often mistake the people around me for people in their universes. When the illusion is broken and they realize that their loved ones aren't with them, they often panic and cry ect. My boyfriend had been putting up with one of them and pretending to be his boyfriend and whenever he'd remember that his friend didn't exist he'd break down and would yell. However for the most part they all seem aware of the fact that they only exist in my own brain (which gives them quite the crisis). 

They all have their own tastes in things however none are too far off of my own desires and opinions which leads me to believe this is completely my own doing. One of the anime characters that ""lives in my brain"" is very loud and rude and physically aggressive. While I am MUCH more so of all of those things, I'm not even nearly close to the level of aggression he possesses. 

I don't know. I don't know what's going on with me. Do you think this is a big placebo effect that I've tricked myself into believing is real? 

Tl;dr: I don't have did. But it sure feels like I do lmao."
I took adderall and so far it has changed everything.,57,mb66vn,18,"Again, I only just took it for the first time an hour or so ago, but my intrusive thoughts are gone. My dissociation is gone. I feel real, I feel okay. I feel happy. I feel safe, and my thoughts are so normal and just.. calm. I have no more bad thoughts, I feel good."
I‚Äôve been dissociating on and off for almost a week,3,mbione,0,Currently right now I am grounding techniques aren‚Äôt working and it‚Äôs horrifying. When I go into therapy it gets worse. I‚Äôm having medication issues so I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing it. I feel dizzy too does anyone have any tips ? I‚Äôm also diagnosed with ptsd for reference
clinging to reality (its a long one),3,mbd9ui,0,"So i dont have really anybody to talk to about all this. I never really posted in reddit before, but this seems like the right place to post this. (correct me plz if im wrong) Anyway Ive always kinda been struggling with anxiety especially health anxiety since late teens. Well of course with all the Covid stuff going on things have gotten significantly worse. Well to keep things short i ended up getting covid and suffer from PTSD now. Ive went to the doctor afterwards and they said i was good to go back to work. But in my mind i was convinced my heart was damaged and i would never be the same. I later had a total mental collapse (panic attack at work) and had to give up my rank at work which i was in management. I ended up having to settle for a lesser job which i still get by so its not terrible. Other than a little damage to my pride and a snicker here and there by choice associates. So now im stuck in this anxiety phase and cycle of feeling like im getting better, and then completely collapsing wash and repeat. But now i feel like i been having this sensation of going outside of time. Its hard to describe but it seems like time is either sped up or im just forgetting things (spacing out). Like i can see things from a different camera angle. I can see myself from celing sometimes. i can see from a birds eye view of the sun setting and moon rising rapidly over and over again. But then SNAP im back. I come back to my senses and trying to realise wtf just happned. I realise they im aware of what im doing. Going to work, talking to people, eating, etc etc. But i dont feel like any of its real or matters. I find myself in a daze until my anxiety brings me back to my senses. Just to torture me about how im going to die, or whatever my mind is trying to convince me of that day. So im either completely out of it and im just on auto pilot. Or im in a panicked state like im in right now trying to convince im real and im going to be okay. Im not going to lie i wrote this not just to get advice but just incase something was to happen to me. Im not sure how much longer i can go on living like this. I been planning and plotting on how to ""wrap things up"". But im always to afraid to do anything when comes time too. I just want to be normal i just want things to go back how they used to be. Ever sinced this Covid nightmare started and the world went to shit. I try to sympathize and know im not the only one suffering. But its hard to relate when no one is talking to you and your doing everything alone. I dont really know what im asking for in advice. But just anything would just about do. I noticed i dont like consecutive sunny days because it seems to trigger it more. I dont know i think like it seems anything in repetitive behaviour or repetitive surroundings makes it worse. Please if anybody is going through anything similar. I am more than happy to talk about it and go through some functions with you. Thank you for reading my long story."
Are u ok?,4,mb8g9y,2,
Dissociated badly tonight.,7,mb3omq,2,"I went out to eat tonight at a beautiful sake restaurant in Clearwater FL. I sat while waiting for my food and all of sudden I just stopped moving. It felt like everything around me slowed down. A very slow tempo music played into my head, the way it thumped in my head started to literally drive me crazy‚Ä¶ I felt like I was in a depressed game after someone is going through withdrawal. I couldn‚Äôt snap out if it for a good few minutes. The room starts to expand on me. I have never ever went through this before and it absolutely petrified me."
"Do you keep losing your train of thought easily? This is a sign your body is perceiving a threat. When you develop social anxiety, your fear of being judged becomes so overwhelming that your body takes over and blanks out your mind. Here is a video that explains this further and how to overcome it!",18,mawsfn,1,
Yikes...,2,mb6ssg,2,"So, almost a year ago in May 2020, I got in a car crash. I was too much in my head while I was driving and I hit a motorcyclist. He lived, though he was injured, and I left the incident plagued with guilt and trauma. Earlier tonight, I got an email from the lawyer from my insurance company about whether or not we would do a settlement or litigation etc. Soon after reading it, I dissociated HARD. At first, I was just kind of detatched. Then I got pulled into the part of my brain where I put trauma memories. I call it ""The No-No Room"". While I was in there, my victim proceeded to beat me up. He was punching me, kicking me, and throwing me around the room. I was on call with a friend of mine and I was able to use his voice as a way back, but I can still feel my victim trying to pull me back so that he can continue getting  revenge."
Is this dissociation?,3,mb2m99,5,I feel like I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm here and constantly questioning reality. I feel like nothing is real and every happy moment I have is meaningless because I‚Äôll be dead one day. I question why I‚Äôm alive and why this world was even created. What‚Äôs the point in all of this? I feel uneasy thinking I need to actually breathe in order to survive and require oxygen. The thought of being a floating ball in space makes me feel very uneasy too. I just don‚Äôt enjoy things anymore and I‚Äôm a lot more frightened of things than I I used to be and just so much more aware of being alive. Any ideas as to what this is? Dissociation is the closest thing I could come to
I fucked up. I was already gone before I realised it.,40,majfnx,19,"I just left everything. I took 4 outfits, way too many socks, a bunch of jumpers, 3 pairs of shoes, one can of deodorant, a book, my bible, my chargers, my phone, wallet and keys, my tablet, 2 pillows, a blanket, a pencil case with various stationary, a small notebook, my TTRPG Dice and Rolling Tray, whatever was in my car already, a laundry basket (holding all my clothes and stuff) and a leather satchel (holding everything else).

Why did I do that? I've left so many friends behind. My family were in a panic, I let them all down. There's still work to be done on my house. I left a bunch of stuff at my sisters place. I could barely talk to my mum on the phone Sunday morning. I've only told one friend I've even left. I was suppose to meet a bunch of my mates at the pub Saturday night. They were there for me. They were gonna have a open pit roast lunch next Saturday. How do I even tell them I'm gone.

I'm 500kms away. I only had a week until I left anyway. I'm lucky I already had a job lined up. I had 120 bucks, most of it got eaten on the drive down in fuel. An old bloke from church has put me up for a few days, and my mum is going to get me a hotel room for a little after that. I slept in my car the first night. 

I can't explain to them why I left. I don't even know how to face the ones I let down. I've never felt such shame before in my life. Even typing this feels surreal, like I'm just along for the ride. I'm switching between deep feelings of guilt and sorrow; and a detached view where my only thought is ""why does it matter, they only miss you now youre gone"".

My mum said I need to go to a hospital, but I don't know how a hospital is going to fix me, I'm not injured, I'm not even diagnosed. I can't afford food, let alone therapy. My rational brain says that thus we the right decision but made at the wrong time. My irrational brain has all the controls and I'm lucky I was able to get up for work this morning.

I'm sorry if this isn't the place, but I needed to put it somewhere to make it real and if anyone knows how I could confront the friends I left in the dark, that'd be a huge help."
Feeling like I‚Äôm in two places at once,5,manj9q,1,"
Hi, 
Does anybody else ever experience feeling like you‚Äôre somewhere else? Almost like you‚Äôre living in a depressing movie sometimes? Like things just feel like you‚Äôre not where you are... like you can ground yourself back to where you are but it feels like you‚Äôre in a movie or like you‚Äôre somewhere else? 
Also lately when I think of a certain place ( a town near mine that I went to school in and have a lot of friends in, and I do my shopping there) it‚Äôs like in my brain I perceive it differently then how it actually is there. Idk if it‚Äôs depersonalization or disassociation but when I THINK of the place, it feels different and distorted then how it actually is when I go there"
How I conceptualise my personality/dissociation,7,mak5bw,0,"It's the lack of internal feeling, will(power), agency, evaluation of the situation, non-passivity, awareness, and coherent narrative to the point where I seriously like don't even understand that I'm a real human being (trauma, sigh) because I wasn't treated like one in the past. Just a small human outline to scream *at*. 

Maybe it would be better if I was not just screamed at like a mental punching bag but I was just communicated with *by* yelling HAHAHA. because what I mean by being screamed *at* like I was an inanimate object or animal is that communication was only one way and not two ways as a feedback loop that occurs when one is yelling but also communicating with a child. I think that this is one of the core causes of my dissociative personality, which is having no two way relationships in my entire life, ever. Friends at school, yes, but no one who I ever developed and shared a personal and ongoing history that involved the core of my being in. No one to really think back to and nobody who I can always call and reminisce with. Nobody who really knows or knew Me, no childhood friend or aunty or cousin or siblings. Not sure if there's anybody I could ever actually say I have been close to. Strange how I only realise this now, that I've never cared for anybody outside of myself (sounds slightly worse than it is, I'm not sure how to word it to make it seem like I'm not a sociopath ahahah), even though I've had a few relationships before. What I mean is I care like I care for my friends, but ""*I* love you and care about *you*"" is a foreign concept to me. 

Narrativeless. In my later years I would not reflect, I'd just do things for 100% of the time I was awake. 

Maybe not for much longer though. I am remembering some things from the past where I had a friendship where we would hang out a lot but I would never say we were actually close. ...But I think that in an alternate universe, we could have been. 
I am not sure how I feel about him. ...Shit. I don't know at all anymore. 

I seriously forgot I existed as a human being in other people's eyes and shit. Lol. I guess human relationships are where one develops a sense of self but ehh..."
is this dissociation?,5,mal1rg,1,"i don't think i can even explain this but i'll do my best.

for a while now i've had somewhat severe anxiety, and due to that i've started developing depression again after recovering completely from middle school (im 17f). then, i think it started a few months ago, i began becoming hyper aware of life and myself. like everyone has moments like that from time to time but it was scary and intense and eventually became constant for me. i couldn't do or feel anything without asking why. i couldn't look out over a beautiful horizon with trees and wildlife without thinking about how strange it truly is and i feel alienated. it's like that feeling you get thinking about what alien worlds might be like, but it's my own. concepts such as trees or bodies make me feel uncomfortable. eventually, after it got so bad, i finally forced myself to come to terms with this world. i told myself it's my world, i belong here, it's not alien at all. i made a post here during that time and i got the same advice i found elsewhere: ignore it and it'll eventually pass. 

now, it's slightly different. it's so hard to explain. it's like a constant, numb discomfort. anytime i experience anything like passion or happiness, i simultaneously have this feeling of ""it's worthless, it's nothing, it doesn't make sense"". sitting in a room i feel strangely aware that it is a room, a concrete square on a patch of earth. of course. this is true, but when i was more mentally stable, these things were just.. normal. if someone were to tell me that clothes are weird because it's a piece of fabric that covers your human meat body id be like ""uh yeah lol?"". 

and that's the other thing. now, if i look into any other time of my life, future or past, it feels inescapable. for some reason it seems to cloud all my memories or dreams in a false perception that i didn't have. it's like i can't possibly believe that there's a way i was alive and thinking without being so uncomfortable in my reality. and when looking to my future, it feels like i'll never be able to heal. i believe i can heal from anxiety and depression, but somehow it's so hard to believe i can ever look at this universe the same way again. it feels like i was transported to an alien world where the concepts the human mind can understand are gone and replaced with a different, supposedly normal one. 

even this long text post i feel does no justice to how i feel. i feel unsatisfied with my description, but it's the best i can do. i should also mention i'm christian, and this also plays a role in my discomfort. i somehow feel this is only normal to god and that the universe is only designed this way because he's creative. i just can't feel normal. when i've talked to people about how our universe is so finely tuned it can't possibly be random, i've gotten the response ""it just seems normal because you've grown up this way. if the universe was any way else, that too would seek perfect"" a few times. the way i feel is like the opposite of that. i know i should feel this is all normal, that things like oceans, trees, social interactions, i shouldn't be critical of their existence.

i also have a strange issue with doing things not *everyone* else does. like it's hard to listen to music i don't think is popular, or play a game that not everyone knows about. it's hard to explain but basically whenever i see a video with a  low view count or a game lobby that's mostly empty, it gives me anxiety and a weird feeling.

i feel like there's more i want to say, but i don't know what. i just want this to end and for me to never know this feeling ever again, but i'm scared that's impossible. and please don't just say ""get professional help"". i can't right now. the best i can do is use free resources online and i have a couple friends who are there for me, but they don't truly understand"
I had a bad dissociated episode yesterday and now I can‚Äôt remember anything the day before,16,ma8qbm,1,"So yesterday I felt super out of it, I had been for a couple days, I think since Thursday. Now feeling back to normal, I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt remember it like it was me. I can‚Äôt connect to what happened, but when I was in the moment I felt super .. horrible, and now I feel like that wasn‚Äôt even me functioning my body. Like it was another person. So strange. I felt like nothing meant anything to me, my stimulus check hit and I wasn‚Äôt excited like I normal would‚Äôve been, I went shopping and didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything. Weird.. any ideas?"
Does anyone experience like a sort of meta-dissociation?,11,maa7wx,4,"Does anyone else feel like their perception of life is like super meta to the point where you feel disconnected from reality? Like on the one hand there's my trauma and I think it has a lot to do with feeling like I'm a monster. But at the same time, I am sick and tired of feeling this way and don't want to believe this about myself. It's like I'm aware that I'm not supposed to believe this but at the same time I believe it.

It feels like I need to say the correct things to my therapist to release the emotions to be free from this hell, but at the same time I am aware of what I'm doing and then I don't feel any emotions because I'm like thinking one step ahead of myself. It's so weird and it freaks me out and makes me think I've lost my mind and will never recover.

I didn't used to think this way. I wasn't even aware of what happened to me until I was in college and took mushrooms and saw myself and realized I was really messed up. Until then I had been in denial and didn't even know, I just knew something was wrong but never told anyone. Then afterwards, after I realized what was wrong, it's like I felt like if I told someone everything then I would be free. But it wasn't like genuinely me telling them, it was just knowing that if I did it then I would feel better. I am struggling to describe it and yes I know it sounds fucking crazy. I am worried that when I took the mushrooms, maybe it fucked me up or something even more because now not only do I feel like shit because of the trauma, but I also am existing in this meta universe where I am constantly trying to escape from this mental prison but at the same time, I am aware of what I'm doing and that makes my efforts to escape not work because it isn't organic or it isn't how life is supposed to work.

Just today I was talking to my mom about this stuff and as I was saying something I felt a surge of emotion and started to cry, but right as I started to cry I became aware of it and the emotion completely died because I was aware that I wanted to cry to be free and then it's like the sadness completely went away and I was just thinking about what happened. It's like I'm watching myself and my thoughts and am detached from reality and my emotions completely.

Does anyone else deal with this? I don't know how to make sense of it. It scares me and gives me a fuck ton of anxiety because it makes me feel psychotic and hopeless. Like not only do I have trauma but I have this meta dissociation that honestly seems way scarier and impossible to overcome. Even as I type this, a part of me feels like if I can somehow express these thoughts and feelings, I will be freed from them. It's like I can't trust myself or something. I just don't understand."
I can‚Äôt stop thinking about leaving everyone I know and starting a new life in another country,7,maayhd,2,"Only problem is I don‚Äôt have the means to. But I want to so bad. When I dissociate really bad I just want to get in my car and drive until I run out of fuel, then make a new life wherever I stop. I don‚Äôt care where it is. I just want to be in a new place where no one knows me and I‚Äôll pretty much be dead to those I did know. I want a clean slate. The thought of continuing my life now makes me sick.

I am not dissociative but i need some clarification on whether my friend is or not,1,madufh,0,"My friend messaged me this evening that she‚Äôs been having these episode sheets she suddenly forgets who she is or where she is or what she‚Äôs doing for periods of time, along with feeling like she‚Äôs not really here sometimes and that in those moments she feels like she isn‚Äôt in control of her own body. (she describes it as fog as well.) we did some research together and we‚Äôre wondering if she could be dissociative? this has apparently been happening for a while but she‚Äôs been scared to tell anyone since she didn‚Äôt wanna be perceived as crazy. I just wanted to know if she could try to get diagnosed with having dissociation or if these are all coincidences. i‚Äôll try my best to answer any addition questions in the comments, although if i don‚Äôt respond for a while it‚Äôs because i‚Äôve accidentally fallen asleep (it‚Äôs almost midnight where i live but i want answers for the sake of my friend)"
Something I've been wondering about,1,mad5mg,0,"So I've realized something recently. It's been on my mind because it has a lot to do with my dissociation, I think at least. Does anyone ever feel anxious and feel like they are constantly out of place, even when they're at home? Especially when you move homes? Like, does dissociation get worse or even better with moving? Because I remember the last time I moved, it was to escape something, and my mind never really acknowledged that I was out of all that, I think. And at that time I was 11. Now, fast forward, I'm 16 and about to move again. But this is the first time in my entire life that I will be moving for good reasons, like they're are a lot of positives to this move. The only concerns I have are about my dissociation. This house that I currently reside in, it has never been a home to me and I am just now realizing that. I hate coming home to this house, or trailer rather, and opt to go to my grandmother's when I can to get away. I have gone through countless reality loops at this house, to the point to where it almost feels that I have three or four different personalities. Does anyone else ever get this? Please tell me. But my main question is, is there a chance that this move might bring me out of this rut that I have been in since I was 11? I mean, my dissociation has been going on way longer than age 11, but it kinda took its big debute at that time. You know? So is it possible that moving again, for a better reason and a better future, could lessen my symptoms? I am going to also be starting a new school next year, which scares me because I never feel right with switching schools and I always have trouble with the new type of work setting and people, and this always worsens my symptoms. But could this better situation improve that too? Any commentary would be greatly appreciated."
I will look at a picture of myself from high school and literally say ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt even feel like me‚Äù,34,m9rsls,3,Does this sound like dissociation?
What is this? Anxiety? Depression? Dissociation? Psychosis?,3,m9y160,0,"Fair warning- it‚Äôs going to be a longer post because I feel the need to explain when it started and anything that might help. If anything needs to be explained upon, pls let me know and I‚Äôll try my best.

As a child I would feel like a video game character. I vividly remember walking out of a restaurant at the wee age of 5 and kicking rocks. When all of a sudden I got hit with this feeling of being controlled, like I wasn‚Äôt in control of my own body. Like I was a character in a shorty arcade game. In my naivety I looked up at my dad and asked if he ever felt this before and if it was normal. He chuckled and said it was. Looking back I think it was to prevent me from freaking out further. From then on I vaguely remember feeling this again every so often, but I was young and didn‚Äôt know it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

Flash forward a decade and high school is kicking my ass. I haven‚Äôt felt like a character in maybe a year(?) and I‚Äôm focusing on classes. This is when my underlying anxiety surfaces. I‚Äôm ‚Äúspacing out‚Äù more, I‚Äôm jittery, and all of the anxiety after effects. I think it‚Äôs time to point out that my whole family has suffered with minute anxiety, usually this is shown by a shaky leg or just spacing out. Though I don‚Äôt think spacing out is anything to do with anxiety but it‚Äôs VERY apparent in my family. It‚Äôs when I started dealing with depression that I started to feel detached. Not in the angsty ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to me‚Äù detachment but I felt out of place in my body. I would also go mute in these ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù, needing to control something in life. I also seemed to feel, smell, and hear everything. It was a total sensory overload, which lead to me feeling alienated even more. I would feel my mind draw away, I would get dizzy then run on autopilot.

Now I‚Äôm 20 and I‚Äôve been medicated for G.A.D and it‚Äôs... ok. I don‚Äôt get overloaded anymore and I can almost go the whole day without spacing out and feeling detached from my body. Some days are better than others, the latter of which leaves me in a foggy-dizzy state where I feel like I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs life or I‚Äôm in a simulation. Normally these are tied with a brief anxiety spell, either from slight ptsd or something that just made me nervous. I also have a playlist consisted of songs that tend to trigger this otherworldly feeling. To either escape or to remind myself to not listen to them, I can‚Äôt really recall why I made it.

In the past I just assumed it was from my depression making me feel numb but as I‚Äôm going through this community I‚Äôm... conflicted now. I have never had the ‚Äúout of body‚Äù experience before or have had any memory loss (that I know of). Are these the worst it can get? Or are they the normal things that you have to have?? Honestly I just want to know how to explain to people what it happening to me. I haven‚Äôt had a straight answer about what my mind is doing for around 2 years, and even then it was a ‚Äúeh, maybe these will help??‚Äù."
"Everything looks super close but super far away at the same time. Sounds are super loud, I can hear everything.",20,m9kkr9,13,"Literally everything looks super far but so close.. I feel I could do anything without consequences, and that I‚Äôm outside of my body. Is this dissociation? Or am I in psychosis? Should I go to the hospital?"
"So I don't know how ""I"" talk",12,m9n2uw,3,"something I've always struggled with is deciding how I talk, and while I've been at high suspicion of identity-altering dissociative disorder(s), I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, though it can definitely be connected to my lack of cohesion in terms of a personality or sense of identity.

let me explain. the only constant in my verbal expression is my diction; my vocab, how I form sentences, pacing, grammar and the like. the only thing that I have trouble with is consistently pronouncing words and expressing in that sort of way. sometimes I have a twang, other times a british/russian crumple of the tongue, and other times a very nasal sound, and more.

what's your experience with this? what did it turn out to be? how can I find my way of speaking, integrate the rest, or stop changing my voice all the time without noticing?

thanks!"
please tell me what this is,5,m9m6mq,1,"i don‚Äôt know what this is or if it‚Äôs even dissociation but i feel like i‚Äôm living in a memory everything i see seems so familiar and i get a kind of nostalgia from it, and i get emotional from smells of things and things that happen to me. it feels like i‚Äôve lived it before, i cant explain. it‚Äôs freaking me out."
I don't have a core self/vent,3,m9osxy,2,"Some people think I'm autistic but I don't think I am. I think I was treated like a lot less than a dog emotionally when I was younger. Maybe something like a pack horse or easily scared rabbit that one scares for their own satisfaction until they're tired of doing so. 

I believe something went fundamentally wrong at ""birth"", that being, early childhood per se- I had a vision of myself in a pot induced semi psychotic period as having a rotting fetus inside of me, waiting for its real mum and dad to come, but they never did, so it's just always been rotting in there (I'm 20 now.) Also a strong feeling on acid that I've been in the 'waiting room' of life for, like, forever now. I know I never individuated. Haven't yet, at least. 

My object relations are really fucked because of this, I'm basically truly an emotional orphan. Idk what I've been doing these past 20 years lmao. Well, being passive I guess. I feel like a child emotionally and for some weird ass reason, I'm only realising now that like, other people exist and that I exist and am alone. I'm very egocentric and lack true agency and psychological aloneness at this current point in time. 

So every past self feels like a different entity. I don't remember or understand these entities when I try and look back on them now. They are strangers to me and thus I am a stranger to myself. I've never been properly loved so now I just feel like a floating entity who lives in the conceptual realm. 

I spend my time simulating conversations in my head with people that I know. I don't think that this is normal. 

I hope that neurofeedback and EMDR helps. Man, at times I feel so peaceful. But I have never, never really been in a real emotional human relationship. I just am, like, here. And I always have been. Not separate from the environment. Mm... The sky is pale blue and foggy today. Peace at last. 

Not really. The rare times I do feel alone, I feel like I have been given a death sentence by my parents to be cast out in a horrible place where unlike other shitty families, *I could not do anything about it.* The powerlessness conceptually haunts me to this day and it still awes me that I was once (at birth I guess) truly happy and trusting and open to this world. 

It feels like nothing is really real except this current moment. Thanks, foggy numbness, I guess. But I feel I started to ignore reality because being a real person and entity in other people's minds is just too much for me to handle. I don't even know how to feel about the fact my body is... Eugh. Completely in the complete mind of another (sigh) I wish I could just delete off this oh my god I just want to hide from this forever and ever and ever it feels so disgusting and intrusive goodbye I am gone idc abt my persona and how I appear to others nothing is real I'm not real. That was the first time I started to dissociate for sort of real instead of just emotionally numbing my tears and sadness because of easy to understand trauma like yelling. : )

But I am. 

By definition, there's nothing worth it coming out for from this fog, right, and that's why I'm not rly coming out. I feel safe. I feel safe and I would feel remorse for the things I've done in the past that have hurt my friends and be a better person. But I don't want to do it because the friends I've hurt won't ever be able to fill the void. I want to be here and own my fkn self and be ALIVE of my own accord and as a debate independent being who isn't attached to her parents or family whatsoever. Just me. And be free from all I want to let go of (I think psilocybin in a few months will help me do this.) And then fall in love with life all over again and be reborn into a place where I always wanted to be. A safe place, that is. I don't know if this universe is really safe and that it has a plan. But at least I'll be in control as adults are, and not under the jurisdiction of the people that I used to live with (I live alone now). I guess friends make me happy but now is not the time yet. Sigh..."
Dissociating when its totally dark?,3,m9mu1n,0,"First off I'm not really sure if this is dissociation, but basically for me it kinda feels like hitting your funny bone but in the brain. There's just this kinda sudden snap and everything goes numb. Sometimes I even get this kind warmish tingle down my body. It feels like I'm living more in the current moment because my memories are turned off and eyes and ears are more sensitive to my surroundings.

I think my first time feeling disconnected was around 4th grade. I just kinda remember waking up one day and feeling like my personally was slowing changing. That caused me to have panic attacks which kinda turned to depersonalization or dissociation episodes. Also during that time I would basically force myself to dissociate because I was so nervous about feeling like I was going insane that I would sit there and think really hard about going insane, and by thinking about it I would start to dissociate.

It feels exactly like you're pulling an all nighter and half way through your brain decides its had enough and flicks off the switch. Then again maybe that's not a normal sleep deprivation feeling and maybe that's just me depersonalizing from lack of sleep idk.

But I noticed I get this feeling whenever I'm at like at concerts, theaters, circuses, fireworks events, or sports events. Generally I feel fine but once they turn off the lights my eyes go all dilated and I suddenly get really anxious and sensitive to all the loud surrounding music and flashing lights, and then my brain kinda shuts down and everything goes muted and numb. It usually doesn't happen if there is decent lighting though.

Sometimes I dissociate for no reason like if I'm playing video games or watching tv. Sometimes I dissociate because I imagine that I'm about to dissociate and then actually start dissociating.

All my dissociation episodes only last about an hour or 2.

But yeah, does this sound like dissociation/depersonalization and is anyone else triggered by dark places?"
Is it possible to dissociate from more recent trauma?,2,m9ogva,8,"When I dissociate is either random or because something triggering from my childhood trauma came up. But is it possible to dissociate because of more recent trauma?, when I dissociate I get quite bad memory blocks. It‚Äôs kinda like the trauma gets repressed temporarily well I‚Äôm dissociating, I thought this could only happen from childhood trauma or old trauma? Is it possible then for more recent trauma to be blocked out too? I won‚Äôt go into detail but its been almost half a year since more recent trauma happened and Iv noticed I tend to dissociate when it comes to mind and I can‚Äôt remember what happened at all. I thought it was strange since it was recent, Iv only recently found out from my therapist that Iv be dissociating so I don‚Äôt know a whole lot, sorry if this kinda dumb question lol."
Dissociating at weird times,6,m9bpem,14,"I smoke weed everyday, at night mostly, around 10pm or 11-12pm. I smoke a couple times after that time and I‚Äôve been dissociating more.

"Thanks to therapy, I finally stopped dissociating all the time as a primary coping mechanism. I am mourning the loss of the years I don't remember.",105,m8l8l8,10,"I'm not well-educated on dissociating as a whole so please forgive me if I don't use the correct language to describe my experience. I'm eager to learn more. This is mainly a ramble but I'm really interested in talking to other people who've had a similar experience with dissociating.

I started dissociating about 10 years ago after an extreme trauma as a teen and... basically never stopped until 6 months ago.

I assume it's normal to live within a spectrum of dissociation because that was my entire adult life until recently. I had the severe ""stares at a wall for a week but it feels like 20 minutes"" after major triggers but for the most part I was functional in every way except emotional. I never felt my negative emotions. The few memories of therapy are being asked ""why are you crying, gryff? What do you feel right now?"" I'd honestly shrug and say ""I feel fine, I don't know why I'm crying."" I spent years experiencing the physiological actions of grief and trauma without ever connecting to it emotionally, and most of the time I wouldn't remember my session the next time I went in for therapy.

I spent 12 months in a residential treatment center for trauma disorders and I barely remember it. A whole year of my life that my brain never bothered hitting 'record' on.

I started seeing a new therapist after moving across the country a couple of years ago and she's the first person I remember using the word dissociating to describe what I was going through. We spent literal years working on it, most of which I don't remember but I know we must have because I don't do it much anymore. I haven't dissociated for longer than a day since October, which is huge for me. I was so out of touch with it that I didn't even *notice* I wasn't dissociating from big emotions anymore until she pointed it out to me.

I spent the last fucking decade thinking I have a bad memory, that I'm just naturally the most forgetful twenty-something on the planet, but the last 6 months have totally changed my view of myself. I remember shit now. I remember being upset, I can identify why I'm crying for the first time in a damn *decade*.

I'm starting to feel grief for all the years I don't remember. College, first jobs, first girlfriends. Deaths. I used to think I wasn't bothered by death, but now the grief of those losses is seeping into me for the first time. Most of them have been dead for years - I can finally feel the sadness and loss those people deserved. 

So many memories, at best, hidden in heavy fog. I'm so glad to be back in my body but I feel such immense grief for those lost years, along with all those heavy emotions my brain was keeping at bay. I was raped 3 years ago and really felt my grief around it for the first time last night. I've cried when talking about it before but yesterday was the first time I could identify *why*. I'm simultaneously grieving for all the shit I couldn't before, and also feeling grief for sleepwalking through my entire young adult life.

Has anyone else come out the other side of dissociating and felt this way?"
i‚Äôve never experienced ‚Äúout of body‚Äù dissociation ‚Äî am i still valid?,9,m8r1lw,3,"hey, kind of a dumb question but i‚Äôm in need of some answers.


i am constantly in some state of dissociation, or at least detachment from the world around me, but every time i‚Äôve looked into dissociation, i‚Äôve read examples about ‚Äúout of body‚Äù type experiences that i do not have. it makes me wonder if since i don‚Äôt, my ‚Äòdissociation‚Äô is invalid?


my other symptoms are: i space out a lot, have empty pockets in memory, struggle to acknowledge worldly consequences, have identity issues, and never feel a part of this world. i don‚Äôt believe i live in a simulation, but it feels something like one; i often have to remind myself i‚Äôm not a character in a game or movie and other people aren‚Äôt emotionless NPCs. otherwise, i do stupid things under the guise that there will be no consequences. i also am nearly incapable of practicing mindfulness, and cannot meditate. i am never present.


is this dissociation, or perhaps another term for it? do i need to have an ‚Äúout of body‚Äù moment to qualify? thanks a lot for your time!"

Imagine crossing two young girls while overhearing one say to the other: 'What kind of human is that?',20,m8gljx,7,"I'm used to alienation for some years and I thought it would get better for a while but this is scary.

Please give me advice,4,m8p04c,2,"Hi! I developed dissociation from many different things but one that sticks with me is a bad weed high.  It was terrifying and I can't ever smoke again, I can't even drink because the idea of being under the influence haunts me and im terrified ill feel what I felt that night. When I get anxiety or dissociate, sometimes I feel like im somehow still high from that night (it was in the winter or fall or something I don't remember my brain blocked it out) and ill feel like im forever still high I guess when I get anxiety. I also developed severe health anxiety and anxiety in general from it. I wish I could go back to that night and just not smoke. It gave me SO many problems that I feel like are irreversible. I've had so much anxiety that it terrifies me to leave my bed and my house and its becoming a huge issue. I dissociate when I leave my house and I feel like im going to pass out and have a panic attack when I leave my bed. not to mention, im turning 18 in a month and I really rather not have this so young.

BPD & Dissociation,4,m8j689,1,"Hi,
I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder with my most severe symptoms being anxiety and depression. I am used to having moments of dissociation that typically only last anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or two at most, and with these moments of dissociation I usually can pinpoint my trigger - either while I‚Äôm dissociating or when I come to. Yesterday I started dissociating while grocery shopping, I figured the environment of being in public around a bunch of strangers trigger a dissociation. However, when I got to the car and started driving home I noticed I was still dissociating, it was quite scary actually. I felt like I was outside my body watching myself drive home, it was almost as if my body was working on auto pilot and nothing was going on in my mind. This ensued panic but I was driving so my survival instincts kicked in and I was able to drive home. I tried tapping my forehead, tapping my shoulders alternatively, changing the temperature drastically (these are the best techniques for grounding for me personally my therapist and I have decided) and nothing would snap me out of my dissociative state. I thought maybe good night‚Äôs sleep would help snap me out of it but I woke up feeling the same. I feel like my vision is distorted - as if I‚Äôm looking through a tunnel - and my body feels heavy. It‚Äôs kind of scaring me mostly because I‚Äôve never been in a dissociative state this long. Had anyone else had this experience? Or can someone who experiences extreme dissociation give me some tips on how I could maybe work on this? TIA üò™"
Addicted to escapism,44,m7x61w,10,"So, I'm addicted to the need too escape into a fictional world. Sometimes it's through movies and books but often times I don't even need that. I can just sit for hours and spend time in my own head. That's how I start my day, do during the day, in the evening and at night. 
People ask me, what I do in my free time and I say: ""nothing"" and literally mean it. I don't need to do anything else, then internally disepear in my own fantasy world.
If I don't do that, I become very irritated and stressed. It's my way to relief all the stress.

Lately I've been trying to break the habit. Because, as anyone can probably figure, if you only live your life throug fictional characters you don't have much of your own life. It's like and drug addiction. The highs are high.
I love and know the characters, their journey, their feelings. I feel every high they feel. If they win a war in the story, I feel like I've just won a war. If they lose someone dear to them, I feel like I lost someone dear to me. This escapism gave me some of the most heartwarming moments in my life. 
But the lows are low.
I can't focus in anything else, then my dream world. When I drive my car, am at work, during a conversation. I constantly zone into my fantasy world. I live my real world life, but I never feel, like I'm really there.

I know it's ruining my life, but it's so hard to let go. It's my safe space, that only I can control. But in reality I know, that I'm giving up my real life, for absolutely nothing.

Did anyone experience something similar? And does anyone have any advice, how to get free if this addiction?"

A couple things I found that may help with dissociation,0,m7yx2b,4,"1. Chain chokers, the weight and tightness around the neck feels as though it grounds me from the sensation and whenever I bend my neck back, I feel it tightens which helps keep me in the moment.
2. Balisong flipping with a live blade. This may be helpful due to adrenaline and the sensation of it bouncing against knuckles, not only may it help with dissociation but it also creates a hobby.

From my personal experience these things do not completely remove the dissociative state, however it may lessen it. For example, I choose to wear a chain choker nearly all day because without it I feel as though my mind is truly floating away from dissociation.

Edit: A couple other things that may help is having a window open and having a *real* neon sign."

is this dissociation?,5,m7f2nj,11,"Little heads up, my english isn't the best! 

I've had this feeling since I can remember. When I was younger it would only last a few minutes or hours, I didn't mind it. But the more I grew up the more this feeling/sensation lingered for longer and longer, sometime months (It's been a month and half since my last ""relapse"" and I've been feeling like that since)

Let me describe how I feel, because I'm quite unsure about the nomenclature. I've always called it dissociation because it sounded right but maybe it's not that. 

I feel like I'm watching a first person POV movie, everything feels simulated and fake. Everything that I do/say isn't really ""me"", it's more of a facade or reflexes. I do things because I know I should do those things, not really because I want to do them. My 'real' self is just confused or even absent. I feel completely detached from others and my feelings. I just feel extremely empty, pure abyss. Emotions and life feel absolutely absurd and nonsensical.
This feeling comes and goes without any obvious triggers (or maybe I haven't been attentive enough) but I know that weed makes it way way worse. If I smoke, I feel like my body isn't actually mine and I have to talk to myself using 'you' to do basic task. I had a psychotic episode the first time I got high + two other times. 

anyway, it's a bit lengthy but is this dissociation? 
I haven't been to the doctors in years/talked about my mental health issues with anyone who could diagnose me, so I don't have a diagnostic 

thank u for your time:)"
I live alternate lives rather than face my own,39,m6p2cv,5,"I‚Äôm a 24-year-old writer. I‚Äôm on disability due to my diagnoses, of which there are several. I have dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization and derealization disorder, all stemming from a combination of horrific bullying and my mother‚Äôs sudden death when I was 15, along with the subsequent abusive relationship that developed with my father because of her passing. 

What this means for my daily life is I am 100% dissociated from the moment I wake till I go to sleep. 

I do not work. I have in the past but find it impossible now. I don‚Äôt drive. 

To cope I have constructed fantasy simulations of my life in my mind. Lives where I‚Äôm a famous game developer, screenwriter, playwright, author, actor ‚Äî you name it. When I watch new films or tv shows, I immediately integrate them into a personal canon by pretending I‚Äôm the director/artist responsible for making it, and I‚Äôm showcasing my completed masterpiece to a group of adoring friends. When I read famous novels I pretend I‚Äôm the author. 

This alternate reality is the only space where I‚Äôm not panicked and frightened and depressed, because the reality is ‚Äî I‚Äôm not any of that. Not successful, not wealthy, deeply unhappy. From the viewpoint of wider society I‚Äôm probably just a welfare bum. Nobody notices me. My attempts to make a career, make friends, get into grad school ‚Äî all of those have failed. I‚Äôm invisible. So the fantasy world is the best place for me. 

Just wondering if anyone else does this. I‚Äôve done it since I was a child, and at times the fiction feels more real than reality."
I can't stop talking to someone who isn't there.,19,m6gc5x,14,"For a few months and especially in the past two weeks, I have been having conversations someone who I am (sexually) attracted to. I don't hear voices or actually see the person, but I look at a pictures of him a lot. I am 22, still live w/ family, have no job (can't find one and probably couldn't do it anyway) and am in college. I spend most of my days alone, isolated from my family, and fearful of leaving the house because of how I look and feel. For the past 7 years I have been socially isolated (and dissociated much of that time) and I have never formed emotional bonds to people (not even my parents). So naturally, I crave love and connection and have for years (but am disgusted w/ myself obviously). 

I talk to this person most of the day, sometimes looking in the mirror thinking I am talking to him while looking at myself. I do my makeup daily even when I don't need to to try and feel more attractive when I am talking to him. I am basically like [this lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uES3lA9OU), but usually less intense lol.  When I go to bed, I imagine him next to me. I don't think it's erotomania because I don't believe he likes me at all. I can pretend I am talking to him for hours, sometimes all night. I barely remember anything from the past two weeks. I have a therapist who does not help and I am on 30 mg of parnate a day. My depression is much worse since this has worsened, and I find myself exhausted everyday just wanting to be in bed or distracted. I feel like I am losing my mind. Talking to him has made me feel better sometimes, and I feel like it is the closest I can get to practicing talking to people since my social brain pretty much stopped developing at 15 when I starting isolating. Sometimes I laugh out loud, which I haven't done in years. But I feel so ashamed and weird. I just want to be normal, but I don't want to face reality, and I never really have and don't think I actually can. Does anyone know what to do?

Thanks for reading. Sorry for the long post."
Anyone else have something like this when dissociating?,5,m6o26k,3,"So, something I've managed to take note of for my therapist is when I dissociate I genuinely feel like I can't see in front of me. I've had dreams exactly like this, like best way I can describe is turning on a light switch and it doesn't work, or having a light on but nothing is lit up. It feels weird to just walk around."
Does anyone else‚Äôs eyes get sensitive while starting to dissociate?,4,m6jbhk,4,"Whenever I feel myself slipping into the void, 9/10 times it‚Äôs accompanied by my eyes getting really red, pupils becoming pinpoint, and sensitivity to light. Otherwise I don‚Äôt have any other physical indicators. I‚Äôve struggled with dissociation for about 7 years now and this sign really only started about a year ago."
Does anyone have moments where objects look very small and their distance is completely distorted?,45,m5z1ne,16,"It's happened to me a few times, mostly with houses. They end up shrinking and expanding in size both vertically and horizontally. And the distance between them and I seems to oscillate as well. Sometimes I almost feel like I could reach out and grab them as if they were miniatures.

Have any of you ever experienced this? Is this dissociation? Typically when I dissociate I have a more out-of-body kind of experience and I don't necessarily feel that way when this happens. Mostly nauseas if anything. I'm leaning more towards it being a hallucination."
I just made a thing,2,m6exn8,0,I can‚Äôt post a pic now but I had to write a note to myself since I still feel dissociated. But I wrote something in two different thought sets so I feel better In a few hours and maybe my format might help a few people. I just might not remember this later that‚Äôs why I have to post this now. Sorry guysüò£
I feel like i‚Äôm living in plane mode and nothing feels real and i don‚Äôt know what to do,5,m62clu,1,"I feel like i‚Äôm not the one controlling my body and i spent most of my days living inside my head (if that makes sense) and feeling like my sorroundings aren‚Äôt real and it completely freaks me out because i can‚Äôt pay atention nor enjoy anything, and sometimes i even get claustrophobic¬ø? Because i feel like i‚Äôm trapped inside my brain, i don‚Äôt know what to do and it freaks me out"
Split,5,m62j49,0,"Surrealism hits me like a blow. 
Rarely as today do I experience 
the difference between being 
and being-in-itself so clearly. 
Detached, outside. 
Only a rigid shell. 
I walk and stand at the same point. 
My spirit looks down from above. 

I should experience shock, 
should fear,
tremble and despair. 
A cold shiver, 
or an overwhelming heat. 
I should flee or I should fight. 

But what I experience is the cold 
air wrapping itself around the back of my head, 
my spirit leaving my body. 
Rising towards nothing and fading away.  
I see the chest rising and falling. 
Open but expressionless eyes. 
Silenced thoughts. 
An empty shell. 
Detached. 
Split. 

Like a zip, the individual separated 
parts fall to the ground, 
collapsing in on themselves, 
without the hold of its supporting pillar. 
They do not form a whole, 
so, they are broken. 

Strange voices at my ear, 
but I hear nothing. 
Sounds in the far distance. 
Eyes mist up with black. 
Where arms had been, 
I float in empty space. 
Only the dark angels with me 
in the maelstrom of darkness. 
I am not afraid, 
I am drawn down into nothingness, 
I lose myself in eternal silence. 
Peaceful, 
silent, 
detached, 
split.

How do u know if you have disassociation or multiple personalities?,10,m5s6bi,4,"Hi, I‚Äôm so sorry for using this term. I know it‚Äôs no longer called multiple personality disorder, I just feel like this is how most people know it and understand it. How do u know if you just have disassociation and derealization vs multiple personality disorder? I‚Äôve been disassociating for so long it‚Äôs scary, it‚Äôs been almost 2 months. I started Zoloft but it‚Äôs not really working and my therapist doesn‚Äôt know much about disassociation."
Experience with Naltrexone?,1,m5whco,7,"Hello I‚Äôm new here. 
I struggle with anxiety and depression, and disassociation the past few months. My therapists thinks this MAY have been caused or triggered from smoking weed. I‚Äôm talking with a psychiatrist about naltrexone, but I haven‚Äôt started it yet. Does anybody here have any experience with it for mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and more specifically disassociation/ Derealization/ depersonalization? I just want to feel better, everything‚Äôs been agonizing."
Acute State of Dissociation,9,m5eoej,13,"What helps you best in an acute state (depersonalisation, derealisation) of dissociation? I have made the experience that I don‚Äôt really get out of this state well myself, I usually need help for that (therapist, a friend who know what‚Äôs going on). I‚Äôve already tried out some skills from DBT. Have you found other possibilities for you?"
Anyone have horrifying dissociation but lately it‚Äôs good?,22,m54vhu,3,"Ok, I was diagnosed with depersonalization. And all day since I woke up I am really amazed. My beverages are already where I want them. I‚Äôm constantly delighted and feeling on top of things. It‚Äôs a relief because I think ok I gotta bring this cup here or put this away. 

And I walk over and the cups already there on the coffee table as I wanted to place it. Idk if it‚Äôs a side effect of this new antipsychotic. I always panicked when I‚Äôd dissociate full blown horror and anxiety sometimes for hours on end or 30 mins. But I space out so deep and so far.. ha .. key words. I‚Äôm overjoyed by these small surprises. I just now see why people use drugs to feel this. 

My brain just does it. Ole trauma from childhood and up. It‚Äôs a new skill I‚Äôve acquired I‚Äôm giggling. Anyone else experience? Or what other types.. idk
if starting this new antipsychotic and having hyperthyroid recently . Is allowing me to not suffer when I dissociate. Curious what you all think, and your experiences."
this is probably good?,3,m5ar5a,0,"So I got in touch with       m e n t a l    h e a l t h    s e r v i c e s    and now I'm pretty sure I've got the Beepadeep (BPD) ill probably tell the psychiatrist   


So basically WHY   
is my body so weird.

It's like, I'm autosexual so I sometimes love it but then  
I sometimes look at my hands and disassociate while the music I was listening to becomes background white noise and then BOOm

self image issues

DP/DR and Sex,5,m56che,4,"Does anybody else feel a disconnection from sexual feelings? I've been in a healthy relationship for 3 years,  he's incredibly amazing,  respectful and hot as hell. I am 100% sexually attracted to him. Now,  this is where it might get tmi for some people but: I know when I'm horny. I have the thoughts and it excites me,  but I feel like it's dulled compared to other people? Like. I don't have an urge to do anything more, i really couldn't care less if we have sex or not in that moment and usually I opt to not do anything,  but ofc if he starts doing stuff to me (consensually ofc) ill go along with it and it all eventually works out. I think it might have something to do with the body mind disconnect but I really have no idea and just wanted to know if anyone can somewhat relate to this? I know some people with ptsd become hypersexual, that's definitely not the case for me,  i also don't have sexual trauma. Also super sorry if this is confusing so:

 Tl;dr I can get mentally horny but I also rarely proceed to do anything sexual. I have a theory its my dissociation but it could be unrelated. I wanted to know if anyone gets this."
Can I still have dissociation?,8,m505h6,3,"I don‚Äôt have any trauma. At least that I know of I guess. I had a very normal childhood, good parents, good family. Nothing has happened to me as a teen or young adult (I‚Äôm 24F) that would be traumatizing. 
The only thing about me that maybe has to do with anything is that I‚Äôm extremely anxious. I have been all my life. Like even with I was very young. For example I would cry all day at school till I was probably 6 or 7 because I was so anxious. I also think I had mild OCD as a kid because I used to have to tap my wall so many time before I went to bed or I thought my family would die. I had a few things like that I would do.

Anyways. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a dissociative disorder. Usually I get this feeling like nothing is real. Like I can‚Äôt be positive I‚Äôm actually experiencing life. I think  ‚Äúwhat if this is just a dream and I haven‚Äôt woken up‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm dead and I‚Äôm not actually here.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know how to explain it really. I even have faint memories as a kid of telling my parents ‚Äúdo you ever feel like nothing is real?‚Äù But I also think like ‚Äúwhat if I just made those memories up?‚Äù I feel like I can‚Äôt trust anything. I am a nanny and sometimes when I leave I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwait did the parents actually come home or did I just think they did and I left the kids alone.‚Äù Stuff like that. I plan on going to a therapist soon as I know this all probably isn‚Äôt normal. So if anyone says ‚Äúyou should see a therapist‚Äù trust me I know I‚Äôm working on it haha. Still I‚Äôm mostly just wondering if that is a dissociative disorder or maybe just something else and if I can have a dissociative disorder without having any trauma in my life?"
I dissociate 99% of the time due to childhood trauma and I get physically sick when I come out of it. Coping methods?,24,m4p79u,6,
Anyone else feel different types of dissociation?,19,m4isbl,5,"‚ÄúDissociation is a break in how your mind handles information. You may feel disconnected from your thoughts, feelings, memories, and surroundings. It can affect your sense of identity and your perception of time.‚Äù

Does anyone else dissociate in different ways each time? Like depending on what caused it, I might have a few different symptoms in each episode. My therapist says I have BPD traits so some of this falls into that criteria also.

Right now I just feel empty. Removed from reality. It‚Äôs especially bad when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm either emotionally numb (most of the time), or my emotions are dialed to 90-100%. Like I‚Äôm running on autopilot.

Whenever a bad thought enters my head and I start ruminating (usually about an ex), my vision gets blurry and my eyes suddenly feel heavy. It‚Äôs almost instant. Sometimes I‚Äôm asking myself, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù Other times, I‚Äôm just completely absent. Then there‚Äôs times where my vision doesn‚Äôt blur at all, I just feel floaty yet heavy and I feel a little removed from my senses. Touch feels weird and distant. Watching my hands or looking at myself feels off. Like I know they‚Äôre mine but it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm using them when they move. Movements kind of look like animation with some of the frames removed so it‚Äôs ‚Äúoff.‚Äù

When I have panic attacks I think I also feel a type of dissociation. I feel a lot of the same symptoms, yet everything around me feels ‚Äúhyper-real‚Äù and scary. And sometimes dissociation makes me anxious, but other times it‚Äôs just numbness.

Is this dissociation with some spells of derealization thrown in? Is that why they feel different?"
Have I been Dissociating for Years,3,m4rt6k,1,"So, I just posted about this situation in another subreddit but I want to ask a different question about it here. For the past 2-4 years (my concept of time is horrible) I‚Äôve found myself unable to talk about anything I care about, or to seemingly even have thoughts that aren‚Äôt self depreciating. This has put a serious strain on my relationship. Recently I‚Äôve discovered I have dissociative issues and likely OSDD. When I discovered them I realized I had been in a state of dissociation for months, but I don‚Äôt remember when this was. That said, I also find myself unable to remember things, even if they just happened, and it‚Äôs like my life is disappearing behind me. But then the things I do remember are the same as what I‚Äôm experiencing now. It‚Äôs hard to do anything productive. Lately it seems to just be getting worse as the world around me feels unreal and I find myself staring at nothing and thinking nothing more often than I find myself not. So, is it possible that I‚Äôve been in a near constant state of dissociation for possibly 3+ years, possibly longer? If so, any advice?"

I so badly want to be dead even though I already feel dead. It's hard to explain. This has been going on for months now and I can't take it anymore. I have a plan that I will carry out as soon as certain things are in place. Knowing that this is life and how it's always going to be, I don't want to be apart of it anymore."
hi,1,m40wja,2,"Ever since October 2020, I have had this weird feeling that my surroundings aren't real and that nothing that I do really matters. It is often a bad feeling because I used to be so hyper aware of my surroundings and I used to remember everything that I do. Now life simply feels like one blob that I can never seem to escape no matter what I do about it. I had thought that my dissociation was triggered by my job (Starbucks) where I had started working back in October. However, the company provides me with 20 free therapy sessions and I have been using them. I talked to my therapist about this feeling and she said its a response to the guilt and shame I feel. I felt a little bit better in January of 2021 when I had transferred locations and had less stress to deal with. It flared back up in February of 2021 because I stopped going to college because I graduated. It sucks because I have no motivation to do anything because I am like why does it matter. I also used to love my job but it honestly feels so insufferable to go. It has also been harder to text my friends or even talk to them for that matter. I also feel the same way with my partner and my parents, I love them so much but I feel so detached from them as well as my emotions. To note, I have tried everything. I meditate in the mornings, do yoga, read, try to decrease my screen time, and I have also do things that interest me. It all leaves me feeling the same way"
idk if this applies,4,m3o9es,1,"I have no idea what's going on really but nothing feels quite right? some days have different/ unique flavors to them, today being one of them, but in the now i just have a persistent dull headache and everything feels off but like my brain is also denying that anything is wrong, its frustrating... I keep having to unfurrow my eyebrows and everything just feels... off. the flavor of day is still here so at least its not totally unreal but still. idk about how real i myself feel but that's another story.. i guess i want some kind of reassurance? or something. i just want to be able to get stuff done but im pretty sure its getting worse as i type this?

Is this Dissociation or DPDR?,3,m3nz4j,0,"Hello everyone, so ever since August or September I have had very bad OCD/Health anxiety. I never felt dissociate in that period

I started taking Lamictal for a mood disorder in January and stopped taking it soon after because of side effects. I had terrible withdrawal symptoms and that's when I started feeling dissociated ever since.

My symptoms: Feel a little dizzy and like in a blur/movie when I go out. Also when I'm watching a film or play a game with dialogue, it feels a little hard to concentrate on the picture and what they are saying. Also speaking is a but of a challenge, words get in the way.

Is this common with dissociation or DPDR? I was also diagnosed with ADD, don't know if I'm just more aware of it now"

What helps you to snap back to reality?,5,m3fagq,3,"I've been feeling dissociation for quite a while now (a few months maybe?) and I honestly don't know how to make it go away. I've tried mind fulness, but that doesn't seem to help a lot. Either I drift into thoughts or it just doesn't help much. I don't know what causes it either. I doubt it is caused by a traumatic event, as I have a great family, and was not experiencing anything too traumatic in my family or outside it. I doubt it is caused by self hate, as I have a high self esteem and happy to be who I am. I suspect that depression is what causing it. Two years ago I went through an identity crisis and fell into depression, that's when I started having dissociation. It passed when the crisis was over and I got out of this depression. Now, because of the virus, my country is constantly in lockdown, which means that I have to stay home all the time and learn from my computer. Because of it I'm depressed again, and I think that this is what causing the dissociation to come back.

&#x200B;

I have found out that listening to music, podcasts, watching movies, or reading books helps me to get out of the dissociation. but instead of anchoring to reality, my consciousness anchors itself to what I'm listening to/watching. Although this helps in the short term, when I have to go back to reality the dissociation comes back. It is as though reality doesn't serve as an anchor to my mind anymore, and so I feel as though being halfway into nothingness.

If you have any information on how to deal with it better I'll be glad to hear it! :)"

Dissociation or am I stupid,2,m2kt54,3,Hi! Soo for the past year or so I have been having a really hard time keeping a train of thought. This happens mostly when I‚Äôm at work (Starbucks). A coworker will say something to me and my brain just totally blanks out and I have no idea what they said. Or someone will ask me about what position I worked yesterday and I don‚Äôt know because all of my days blur together. One time I was having such a hard time keeping a train of thought I asked someone else to count out change for a $100 because my brain just felt like it was NOT working. I still am a highly functioning employee 95% of the time as I do everything on auto pilot mode. I feel really stupid and my coworkers make a lot of jokes about me never knowing what‚Äôs going on. I was wondering if I am actually stupid or if these are examples of dissociation? Brain fog? Maybe important to note that I am on Effexor right now and noticed it‚Äôs made my dissociation worse. I was just wondering if these are also little symptoms of dissociation.

Which way of therapy/psychotherapy you practice and recommend,3,m20r5p,5,"Hey everyone,

So far I haven't had much success with psychotherapies(I guess majority was gestalt and any sort of ""talk"" therapy. I have had appointments with psychiatrist too

Most of the time diagnosed with depression, anxiety, latest psychiatrist even prescribed me concerta with possible attention issues that I guess stems from early age trauma and some bullying that induced tremendous amount of shame, guilt, anger for not intervening when anyone tried to hurt me

I will have my first (successful) somatic experience soon, had one that was complete failure and got some contact for a body psychotherapist and she also had a degree for EMDR

My issues as mentioned are possible early age trauma(a few years ago I have been told that my mother left our family couple of times) that induced big amount of trust issues, insecurities(in relationships), attachment issues, abandonment issues

What do you think of my plan for helping myself out? Any other psychology path?

Thanks!"
I think I‚Äôve lost my family and I feel so lost,1,m23hq6,3,I‚Äôm struggling so much right now and I don‚Äôt know how to keep it together. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with a dissociation disorder and I have conversion disorder as well. There are times where I feel like I‚Äôm two people. I say the most hurtful things to my partners and after 7 years and a child together I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I constantly feel like running from my relationship and I struggle and feel like I don‚Äôt even deserve my son at times. My fianc√© is of the mindset that he might as well keep things in storage because who knows when I‚Äôll flip out and tell him to leave. I know I‚Äôve hurt him so bad and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. I want to make things right but I feel like it‚Äôs too late. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be truly happy in a relationship. There‚Äôs always this part of me that wants to run and hide and push people away. I put on this act at work like I‚Äôm fine and I‚Äôm really not. I don‚Äôt know how to fix my negative thoughts. How to push them away and bury them so I don‚Äôt hurt the people I love.

Dissociation During School,5,m1fqyf,4,I have a huge issue with dissociating during a particular class. Its gotten to the point where sometimes I dont remember if I even went to class later in the day. The teacher terrifies me and I know that that's why I'm dissociating. I currently have a D in the class and I just cant retain any information from it no matter how much I study. I just want to pass. Does anyone have any tips?
Not being able to recognize familiar places?,3,m1j8p7,1,"I‚Äôve recently been having these experiences and I‚Äôm not sure if this is dissociation or something different? basically I am just going about my day and suddenly I dont recognize where I am.

for reference, i am diagnosed with ptsd and do have other experiences with dissociation in my past however this all just feels different?? additionally i would say i havent exhibited any other ptsd symptoms in the past year or so. i‚Äôve tried looking up others account of situation like this but keep only finding sources on agnosia however given my history of trauma/diagnosis i feel like dissociation is the logical answer

I can‚Äôt do this anymore,11,m18o2b,12,My disassociation is so severe and has been for so long. I don‚Äôt remember what reality feels like anymore.

Hands felt unreal,6,m1com3,1,I was holding my phone on my desk just barely and I started feeling like my hands were sliding down and sinking into the desk. I've had depersonalization and other dissociative issues frequently but this was the first time I felt this. Is this just an extreme form of depersonaliztion? Or was i having a delusion/hallucination? I did some grounding and talked myself through it but it kind of freaked me out.

And I really don‚Äôt remember how much later my dp was gone i should‚Äôve kept track really. Around april 2020 i started to smoke again. I know im an idiot. Just cigarettes no week no alcohol. I drank alcohol like maybe once a month or even once every other month. Anyway fast forward February 2021 i suddenly got my dp back with dissociation dizziness and heavy head and i hate this so much.

Disassociation?,15,m02qan,2,"I have been having a very difficult time the past few months, i would rather not go into specifics because its not just one thing, its a lot, but there was a moment when i was at a cafe and it all got so much, like it was the most excruciatingly horrible and painful mind state ive ever felt, i put my head down between my arms, then when i lifted my head, i felt nothing at all, not one thing, good nor bad, nothing whatsoever, i was still aware of all that was happening, i just felt immense tranquility, or maybe it was that to feel nothing compared to what i did feel like was perceived as such. 

Either way i just dont know, ive not been diagnosed with anything, ive never spoken about my mental health to a doctor or whatnot, and it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault, i just dealt with things wrong and they piled up too high against me to cause me to be pushed to that point where whatever happened, happened. 

I believe its something i phase in and out of, there are moments that slice right through it and i feel truly bs and full of despair, but i can also have a lot of fun and look forward to things as usual, its just that every so often when things look bad, it kicks in, almost like its like my mind tying to protect me or something, who knows.

It is so severe that i have heard my friend speak about his suicide attempt and felt nothing, the first instance happened before he did so, and ive felt it many times throughout the past few months. It‚Äôs something i feel stupidly grateful for, even if thats really bad, atleast it gives me some time to recover my will and when it wears off or whatever i feel ready to take on things until it gets too much again. 

Sorry for rambling so much but i just wondered what someone may have thought, i also apologies if its all offer the place, my thoughts are kind of scattered at the moment. 

Have a nice rest of the day."
What I Whilst High Off of LSD and weed but barely feeling either,5,m08c9e,0,"To me my life is so significant.

Yet to others it's nothing special. They all have their own lives to focus on.

If you saw things from my way maybe you'd understand, maybe if I saw things from your way I'd understand.

I've come to realise no one sees it right, just the best they let themselves see. If you ignore random thoughts they go away, but if you let them hold onto you they can change your whole perception of existence.

&#x200B;

At points I've told myself this is part of growing up, the realisations I've made, but then I remembered that people have lived far beyond me without these thoughts.

This is something I have to face. Maybe this doesn't have to go completely, I just can't live afraid. I can't live afraid of my own perception.

What the fuck is even going on.,2,lzk0ks,0,"A couple hours ago I was reading and I came back out of the dissociation. The last time this happened was about a year ago and it lasted for a few days. I don't even get phased by it anymore. I'll probably sink back into the dissociation and there's probably nothing I can do about it. I have been this way for like 13 years now. I have no idea why it's like this.

When I'm dissociated I literally feel like my thoughts are just running and I'm just miserable and feel weird. It is so painful to be dissociated but it's literally all I know. The sad part is that there is literally nothing I can do to get out. When I'm dissociated that's all I think about--how do I get out how do I get out? I think about it 24/7 I can't even help myself. I just think about healing and coming back to myself. I try mediations, constantly trying to tell myself how I was a good kid, positive affirmations up the ass, etc but nothing really does anything I just feel a little bit better than when I feel like I hate myself. 

I have no fucking clue what is going on with me. It's like terrifying but I feel totally numb to it. It's like it doesn't even phase me because it's all I know."
Does this count as dissociation?,6,lzd5h8,10,"For reference I am diagnosed with PTSD, Bipolar, ADHD, and Fibromyalgia. I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúdissociation‚Äù brought up in all those spaces but I‚Äôve never known if it applies to me.

A lot of times when I‚Äôm doing it I lose track of time for sometimes up to like 8 hours and I have no idea what I‚Äôve read or looked at.

Bad night,1,lziudc,0,"I had a pretty unstable childhood but the only constant light in my life was my grandma. She raised me most of the time while my mom was out ‚Äúfiguring herself out‚Äù & putting men before me & my other siblings. Siblings that went off to live with their other fathers. My own dad having nothing to do with me. 

I‚Äôve used dissociation to get through most of my life. However it‚Äôs been pretty consistent and relentless since the age of 16 when I had some pretty traumatic life events. I‚Äôm now 25 and just came out of the craziest years of my life. I had a mental breakdown, found out I was pregnant in the hospital trying to admit myself, lost my job due to COVID, moved back to my childhood home (grandma moved up north with my aunt)  and right before I was about to deliver my grandma died suddenly. 
I was able to get through all of it the same way I have my whole life and that‚Äôs to shut it off. I‚Äôve shut this whole year out. 

I was having a pretty good day. In awe of my beautiful 3 month old son. I actually felt happy and clear. Then I looked up and seen the house I grew up in with my grandma and it didn‚Äôt seem foreign to me. I ‚Äúfelt‚Äù all of those memories. Then it hit me... I‚Äôm never going to see that beautiful woman anymore. I‚Äôll never just be able to sit and talk to her again. I couldn‚Äôt handle it.

That‚Äôs when I realized I‚Äôll never be able to get out of this until I process a lot of things. Things that I‚Äôm honestly not ready to feel."

I try to physically focus my eyes on something and I can't. Is it dissociation? I feel like I can still function fine, drive, work, etc. I also have some memory problems, I can't remember at all what I did at work yesterday.

I don‚Äôt know what the point of this post is, but its so frustrating to feel like I‚Äôm losing whole days to being out of it. On days where it‚Äôs particularly bad, it feels like I literally don‚Äôt have enough time in the day to do anything other than lie in bed.

This is INSANE,54,ly4l2q,14,"I (20F) lived in a state of derealization for as long as I can remember. About five months ago, after a big and very weird road trip alone across the entire US, I started to come out of it. 

Everything feels SO REAL now. Space looks different, trees are beautiful and dimensional and familiar rooms feel like new spaces. Everything I saw used to seem two dimensional. I‚Äôm so cognizant now of other people‚Äôs separate life experiences... it‚Äôs hard to explain, but before, it was almost like people didn‚Äôt exist when they weren‚Äôt around me. Life was like a movie, there just wasn‚Äôt anything else to the story besides what the camera captured.

I can look in people‚Äôs eyes now. Empathy has a whole new meaning. I can communicate more effectively, advocate for myself and my needs, and be so much more authentic with others. 

I am also horrified. My childhood, my teenage years... I never felt the weight of so much of that. My first love, the joys of family, losses, accomplishments, mistakes. It‚Äôs horrifying how far away my brain put me.

I thought I would share this here in case anyone could relate or had similar stories, or in case this might help anyone. Because coming out of this is beautiful, but it‚Äôs also messy and very VERY scary. I simply can‚Äôt believe we all exist on this big beautiful and messed up world.

In the beginning of this journey through DR, it was just moments of clarity or presence. I could sense something was changing. But it took a lot of faith to believe this emergence actually might be happening and that I wasn‚Äôt just imagining it. And every day now, I feel more and more grounded, more and more present, and more terrifyingly alive in a continuous nature.

Comfort place/headspace,3,lxw4zd,0,"This is kind of a weird question but I'm just now finding out that not everyone has this, but does anyone here have a place they go to in their head when they're completely dissociated/having a really hard time mentally? mine is a perfect recreation of my childhood home and I can ""go"" there only when my brain really needs to (these are the only ways to describe it that make sense). Sometimes there are other people there that I know aren't real people in my life, but they're very comforting.

Dissociation?,5,lxr45s,0,"I think it all started the first time I tried acid and then took my first dab during the trip which after that had a bad trip and noticed whenever I would smoke weed after that I was very sensitive to it and it became more psychedelic, before that I didn‚Äôt really have a limit I could smoke as much as I wanted even tho I hadn‚Äôt smoked that much prior. This was about 4 years ago so I can‚Äôt really remember if I felt like I was feeling the things I‚Äôm feeling now but I‚Äôm pretty sure after that nothing was really the same, I continued to smoke tho and tried shrooms too eventually which was a great trip and ended up taking acid and shrooms and good bit more in smaller doses as time went on but where I‚Äôm at now I think I‚Äôm constantly disassociating just now learning about this stuff so don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what it is but I think it is I just don‚Äôt really feel here my memory is terrible and just articulating my thoughts is difficult and I just kinda feel like a zombie on autopilot a lot of the time and usually when that‚Äôs happening I‚Äôm deep in my thoughts ruminating on existential things or just stuff that stresses me out or random shit, most of the time tho im neither in the present moment or with those thoughts tho I‚Äôm just kinda there I‚Äôm not really aware of my thoughts or my surroundings also I‚Äôve had a lot of anxiety and stress at points where it was almost all day everyday and I hear that can cause derealization as well and that would happen before I took acid that first time. I was never feeling like nothing feels real and all that until I think about and realize nothing really does seem real a lot of time that doesn‚Äôt really cause me to panic or any of this I‚Äôm usually pretty apathetic about it and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm thinking everything is fake either it‚Äôs just kinda bland and idk why but this stuff is starting to really bother me and I do sometimes get very emotional about it maybe they could be called panic attacks I‚Äôm not sure. It feels like my brain just needs a refresh but I don‚Äôt know how to get to feeling normal again, from what I‚Äôve read the root of derealization is anxiety so if you get rid of that it goes with and I do still get anxious sometimes but it‚Äôs definetly not like when it was bad and I feel I‚Äôm constantly in a state of derealization it doesn‚Äôt really come in episodes if anything I have brief moments where I kinda feel more here and I‚Äôm confused about that cause I‚Äôm not constantly feeling anxious at least that I can tell but Ik I do stress a lot about what I‚Äôm going to do I‚Äôm 18 and feel like I‚Äôm supposed to have more figured out about what I‚Äôm doing with my life, I know I want to enjoy it so I really want to fix this derealization thing which I‚Äôm guessing just may be a combination of trauma, drugs, stress/anxiety. I think when I am able to make an effort to feel present I feel a little more here so I‚Äôve just been trying to make an effort to do that as often as I can and meditating and trying to excersise as often as I can, also I feel like socializing helps when I have good interactions but that‚Äôs difficult cause that‚Äôs where I feel the most anxious is in social situations and I feel I just completely suck at socialization now so it‚Äôs hard to have those good interactions that make me feel good.

How do you tell the difference between anxiety and disassociation/derealization?,3,lxmurv,1,"
To start off, I likely have OCD and am being treated w 5mg Lexapro. I used to have religious OCD when younger but I became non religious and no longer felt that way. I now go to a catholic school because my parents wanted me to and it‚Äôs a good school.

Fast forward to this morning 

We have something called 7:17 liturgy on thursdays which is optional, but if your club is hosting you have to attend. I‚Äôm in NHS and we were hosting this time 

I‚Äôve been in church thousands of times even while being non-binary, gay, autistic, so many alienating things but I‚Äôm usually able to stomach it and get through it with mild annoyance that I have to take time out of my day for this. But today was different 

I haven‚Äôt been relatively anxious since starting my medication, and religious stuff usually doesn‚Äôt make me feel like... this.

When I was there, it started as mild annoyance at some bible contradictions, nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle but.. as time went on, as I noticed everyone singing in sync, everyone so happy and comfortable, everyone else was right where they were supposed to be it seemed. Everyone knew I wasn‚Äôt religious but I couldn‚Äôt ignore the subtle side-stares of my teachers and classmates as they realized I wasn‚Äôt singing/praying. One of the youth ministers gave me a hymn book halfway through because I didn‚Äôt grab one because I‚Äôm not religious, even though I refused it and,... I‚Äôve just never been so aware that something about me is wrong.

It felt... unnatural, how in sync everyone else was, how normal this was to them and wrong how scared I was, how choked I felt, how I felt like I was harboring some dark, slimy, inky black evil mass inside of me working it‚Äôs way through my veins. Five minutes before the bell rung I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and I ran out, and once I got out of the room I could breathe again, even though there should have been no issue breathing before 

In my first class everything still felt wrong. Not just me but.. everything. Touching my head long enough to fix my hair felt sinful. Everything I looked around at felt wrong somehow even though I knew these rooms. The items inside and the people inside felt fake. 

I know the objects around me in this room are what they are, and if I touch them I will feel them and they will behave according to their properties. I know that. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs a cover for something. That hell is lying underneath. The room I‚Äôm really in must be different. I don‚Äôt know how much it differs from the one I‚Äôm in, maybe it‚Äôs barely a noticeable difference. But it can‚Äôt be this one. I feel like it can‚Äôt be.

What am I experiencing??? Is this just super charged catholic guilt or more?"
Age regression during dissociation spiral? Has anyone else experienced this?,13,lxbsgi,3,"I‚Äôm pretty new to identifying my experiences as dissociation (both me and my therapist aren‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs the right label), so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong on anything.    


A couple months ago I went down a pretty severe dissociation spiral, to the point I couldn‚Äòt emotionally recognize my family or friends at all.  It was terrifying being in cars and hanging around with them.  Felt very much unlike myself, nothing felt real, you know the drill.  I was desperate to find an answer as to why this was happening so much more severely (and much longer) than usual, and that‚Äôs when I found out most people don‚Äòt dissociate or have ‚Äúweird days‚Äù at all, or avoid certain songs because it‚Äôll make their brain ‚Äúweird‚Äù.

Naturally I was concerned, so I looked into why this might be happening.  The answers the internet gave me only freaked me out more, with all that ‚Äúchildhood trauma‚Äú stuff, and especially the idea that I might have DID (don‚Äôt know why that came up before dpdr, but it is what it is).  Of course this only made everything worse.

I don‚Äôt know if I manifested this out of paranoia or if age regression is just a common thing among people who dissociate, but eventually one night I suddenly felt as if I was a child (I use the pronoun ‚Äúhe‚Äù for him but for some reason in the moment it felt important for my brain to note he was androgynous).  I was immediately gripped with an extremely strong terror and started hitting myself and freaking out until it stopped.  I think it then happened again a week or so later, but my memory is really bad (especially from around that time) so I‚Äôm not sure.  I still am very avoidant to hug pillows or stuffed animals, because I felt that was what brought ‚Äúhim‚Äù out initially, even though ‚Äúhe‚Äù hasn‚Äôt been a problem in months now.  Aside from my own overthinking, of course.

I‚Äôd really like other people‚Äôs feedback about this, as my therapist doesn‚Äôt seem to have any clue for the time being and is just focusing on stuff she can handle (anxiety, depression, you know).  Is this normal for people who dissociate?  Did I just manifest this out of paranoia?  Does anyone else relate to this?  Feel free to ask me any questions if you need."
Could this be dissociation,1,lxp2xu,0,"I change all of a sudden like I‚Äôm someone else

Hi people! So basically I‚Äôve been experiencing something really weird, one moment I feel calm normal and all sane, then all of a sudden I become so sad, and rage so hard at everything like I‚Äôm talking bashing things and smashing things, and everything I do for the rest of the stay feels like I‚Äôm just another person; and the scary part is everything I do for the rest of the day is blurry as if I‚Äôm dreaming and not actually living it, and the next day I don‚Äôt even remember much from after the anger. During these periods I feel suicidal and depressed asf, and also enraged too, right now I literally feel normal like I don‚Äôt feel sad or anything, but all of a sudden I stop being normal. One trigger is when I‚Äôm cocky, I literally take on a new personality, and I go into the zone and forget what even just happened, and when I calm down I feel foggy and weak. And another trigger is when something pisses me off even in the slightest, I go beserk and forget everything, the only thing that stops it is going to sleep and waking up, or just suddenly snapping out of it. One more thing I want to add right now, when I feel normal, I want to do many things such as go for a run or workout, but when I go enraged I forget that it even exists I turn my sights on random things that make no sense. Sorry if I‚Äôm waffling around, but I don‚Äôt even realise this while I‚Äôm in that state like I FOR SOME REASON believe my life is always like this always bad and I have this disgusting feeling in my chest/stomach feeling like it‚Äôs always been like this, but for example rn I don‚Äôt feel like it.

If anyone can help tell me what is going on because I‚Äôm scared for my health and safety, I think I made another post yesterday about some problem with a girl; I was in that state I was saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having suicidal thoughts‚Äù but right now I don‚Äôt feel like trash or anything I feel normal almost like I don‚Äôt remember ever even thinking that???

If anyone can offer me advice and how I can get help I will be greatly appreciated!

Thankfully, my way of coping with this is taking pictures of everything, I mean everything, so that even if I can‚Äôt fully remember what happened. I still have the footage with me, it helps a lot."

Disassociation becoming dangerous,3,lx6hna,1,"So I‚Äôve had pretty severe disassociation my entire life, as I started treatment and got diagnosed with cptsd it has gotten worse as I‚Äôm dealing with trauma I have ignored for a long time. The past couple weeks it‚Äôs been almost unbearable and gotten me into dangerous situations because I‚Äôm so out of it I pay no attention to anything in front of me. I was driving home on a path I‚Äôve taken a million times before and I turned down a one way street the wrong way and almost caused a wreak  because I was so out of it . It‚Äôs like my procedural memory is even turning off and doing things I‚Äôve done a million times before is becoming challenging even. I could sit in my room and ignore my responsibilities in a disassociate state for hours even. It is literally hell"

First-time poster seeking information,1,lx39v0,7,"Hello friends- I want to ask a question involving my original family. My mothers' side specifically, they are all older ranging from 60s to 80s. Recently my 76-year-old uncle was diagnosed with dementia (nobody will confirm this currently) Friday he packed his car, the dog, a bunch of guns and drove his car off the road and into a ravine. It doesn't seem to be a suicide attempt but he has no memory around the incident, or what led up to it, he is very confused at this point and is aggressive. His sisters are all very concerned about getting information yet do very little else. He has adult children and they are involved at this point but don't seem to be getting professional help for him. My question stems from is it possible for a family group to all use dissociation as a coping mechanism? The family has dealt with years of abuse and hidden trauma with substance abuse, sexual abuse coupled with devout catholicism. (so minimizing your feelings or pain is considered normal) They are all waiting for him to snap out of it and are scared that somehow they will ""catch"" what he has. My mother told me directly ""I'm glad it's not my family"" I told her it's your brother, how is it not your family. They end up feeling helpless or do a lot of head shaking or give it up to the lord sort of behavior. Is it possible this is a coping mechanism of an entire set of siblings? Any insight would be appreciated."

"Does anyone else experience something like this ( Sudden Paralysis, no muscle tension but mentally functioning)",19,lw9zl8,21,"So I've been to several doctors and because of my history of dissociative disorders they all think what I'm going through is dissociation. However it doesn't really feel like it and I wanted to see if anyone has similar experiences or an opinion whether it's really dissociation or not.

For some years already I have sudden phases (between a few minutes and two hours) where I am unable to move. I lose my muscle tension, fall down and cannot move anything except for my eyes. My mind doesn't feel affected at all though. I recognise everything going on around me and can respond without delay (I communicate to my partner through eye movements - up/down is yes and left/right is no). My thoughts are clear and my emotions feel normal. I personally don't feel any signs of dissociation that I would usually have when dissociating. In general my level of dissociation is not very high anymore and for me it doesn't feel like it's strong enough to cause such heavy symptoms.

If anyone could say something about this I'd be so thankful. None of my doctors could really tell me what it is and I'm desperate because it heavily affects my day to day life. Thank you so much."

I don't know how to describe it, mainly because I can only remember doing it, not the actual experience. Usually I sort of zone out one minute, and I'm back to normal the next. Sometimes I can catch myself slipping or I can snap out of it. For example I had to take multiple breaks from writing this because it kept happening while I was trying to explain.

The confusing part is that whenever I read about it, the results always say that there's a reason, when for me my mind just randomly goes blank. (Or perhaps there's a reason which I can't remember?) 

I'm asking here because I want to figure out how to stop it from happening when I genuinely need to focus (eg: during a lesson) but I can't go see a psychiatrist or therapist about it. Is there a way I can ground myself? (Other than using the 5-4-3-2-1 method because it doesn't help much.)

It started yesterday and has been ongoing today

I‚Äôm scared and I don‚Äôt know how to help

I‚Äôm looking up things to do but am a little overwhelmed and currently can only text her, though hopefully I can take her somewhere in a few hours.

She can still talk and remember basic things, but I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to get worse and I‚Äôm not going to be able to help when it gets that bad.

Is there anything I can do right now? Or any other resources I can look at that I haven‚Äôt seen?

When I look in the mirror something doesn't feel right. I don't know how to explain it. When I talk I feel like my voice sounds really weird and not right. I see other people and I see them--like their soul in a way. When I see myself, I don't see a soul. I don't know what I see. It feels like the white noise static when a TV gets no reception.

I know I have negative emotions. Otherwise I wouldn't even worry or care about any of this. I have trouble connecting to other people and I feel shitty about that. I feel lonely a lot. I think I can best sum up this feeling as not having a soul. Does anyone have these feelings and know how to get out of it?"

sometimes I think that all the anxiety and panic I felt before it evolved into dissociation was just me begging to be comforted and my body fucking crying out for what it needed and I never got it so I just tapped out, like the fucking chemicals in my brain got weary and took the hint and gave up. It was better to just believe none of it was even real. 

and I just I don't know I'm 19 I feel too young to be this hurt in this way, I had to grow up too fast and sort out my shit all by myself and I pretend I'm fine but I'm not I'm so untethered I just want someone to say yeah me too"

Then I found out I misread my diagnosis and it actually said it was trying to rule out DID.

In a fit of rage, I tried to kill them all. The voices, I mean. The presences in my head. After all, they're not real people, what is the harm of it? Why should I entertain a delusion?

But now they're missing, and I am mentally torn about this. I feel so incomplete and hollow without them.

I miss them so much, and I want them back. But I don't know how to go about getting them back.

Do I get myself into as much of a dissociative state as I can? Do I listen to the kind of songs I thought would trigger them to come forward?

I don't know how to handle this. Usually I'd post this in the DID subreddit but I don't want to disappoint everyone or make it seem like I'm trying to copy a them or mock them or something.

I went to the hospital to do blood tests. Had a bit low vitamin D and b12 not very low just a bit and im taking pills and drops plus omega 3 daily . I went to the ENT to take medication for my dizziness ive been taking betaserc and i think yes its a bit helping the dizziness and unbalance. I went to the neurologist and did an mri she told me no tumor nothing just empty sella and she told me its not very serious and has nothing to do with dizziness and all that. She wrote me PAXERA 10mg its an SSRI first 5 days 5mg then i take 10 mg at night. When i had dpd 2 years ago i was prescribed ‚Äúbrintlex and dogmatil‚Äù and i took them for i guess only 2 weeks and i couldnt they didnt help me at all. And i am trying to avoid any thing that would ruing my brain i am scared to take anything more that would me me dizzy again and feel more shitty.

I go out sometimes and try to enjoy everything but im always on edge and panicky and i feel very uncomfortable with everything. 

I have sometimes high blood pressure and i used to take blood pressure medication daily but 3 weeks ago i stopped it the cardiologist gave me ‚ÄúBELOC‚Äù and he said only take it for emergencies and when you blood pressure is high

Constant 'spaced out' feeling and rapid mood swings.,2,lt4xnv,1,"Apologies for any spelling or grammar mistakes I am quite drunk and on mobile.


For around two years I've had an almost constant feeling like I'm not really me and there's a separation between me and the real world (almost like I'm watching a film or am from an inner perspective). It ranges from mild to a 'drunk' feeling where I simply cannot think, speak cohesivly or manage in social situations. 

I went to the doctors a few months after it started and he suggested it may be depression; I've struggled with suicidal thoughts and low mood for a while now so he put me on a list for CBT and I was having bimonthly check ins for around a year.


I'm a fairly introverted person (I have a tight knit group of great friends but I don't really feel comfortable showing emotion around other people) but Ever since lockdown started I've just constantly been 'out of it' and have been getting extreme moodswings. One minute I may be completely ecstatic and I will just be overwhelmed by this urge to cry the next.

I have never been officially diagnosed with dissociation or a DD so I was just wondering how my experiences compared to your's. I feel like someone just watching a film or like I am behind my own eyes- just watching but not participating in what is happening.

Sorry for the long post but I have had quite a bit to drink and just needed to splurge- any replies will be appreciated."

Now, one symptom of dissociation is blurry eyesight, and this may sound like common sense but if your eyesight is constantly slightly blurred, even if you're convinced its because you're dissociating and your vision is fine, please go get your eyes checked. I had slightly blurred vision for years but put it down to dissociation, but it started to get even worse. I only recently got my eyes checked and I now need glasses.

Does anyone play Dungeons and Dragons? Do you dissociate a lot during sessions?,5,lpfubu,2,"So I play D&D with a group from uni and I think I have been dissociating a lot during sessions and some of my mates have noticed the same problem with themselves. None of us have any idea why D&D seems to be a situation that's easy to dissociate in. It seems worse when doing it online without cameras so I can't see the other players (I struggle with auditory info anyway, and when I dissociate I can't really process what people are saying, sometimes even if I am concentrating really hard but idk if that's relevant). I think anxiety over playing is relevant but I don't think it's the main cause.

Anyone else experienced this kind of thing when playing a tabletop RPGs?

Anyone have any idea what might make D&D an easy situation to dissociate in?"
I'm finally feeling grounded again.,6,lpa2ld,0,"For the past few months (ever since school started, really), I've been feeling so detached from everything I do. It was like I wasn't even there to witness my own life. Everything was moving around me and I was frozen for so long. 

Today I finally started to feel normal again. I don't know how it happened; I was just listening to some music from last summer and suddenly something in my head just clicked: O*h, I'm here. This is real.* And it was magical. 

I can't explain it, but it doesn't feel like I'm all that distant anymore. 

It gets better, guys. I promise."
Amazing- Documentary about living with DID,2,lpgbge,1,"I am currently working with a local film maker about a documentary about my life and my struggles with DID. We talk about so many different things like: sibling loss, abuse, bullying, attempted school shootings, court cases, assaults etc. but really it's a story about healing. After my sister died by suicide I had a really hard time managing. I ended up in the Psych Unit 33 times, had 8 attempts, was in every other kind of program. During all of that my Mom was told that I would never go to college, have a job, live on my own, drive a car, or contribute to society in any meaningful way. After getting a ton of help I now have not been in the hospital in almost 4 years and haven't had an attempt in 5. I do all of the things I was told I never would and I speak about my story with organizations through out the US and I'm hoping by doing this documentary I can share with even more people."
How do I stop dissociating in conversations?,8,lp8h2w,11,"Whenever my boyfriend and I and talking through something or trying to work things out, I can't help my mind wandering off.

Sorry if that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.. it's hard trying to describe it. But it makes him feel like I don't respect him or what he says, but I do. He's the most important person in my life."

Ways to prevent dissociation?,1,lpcnuh,1,"Basically, I‚Äôve gotten really close to having an ongoing dissociative episode (idk what else to call it, and I‚Äôm really sorry if that name counts as self-diagnosis) multiple times this week and just the other day I suddenly didn‚Äôt recognize my mom.

How do I stop feeling like a thought process of the brain and start feeling like a human again?,14,loja6c,4,"Quarantine has destroyed me mentally and I'm an anxious, depressed, and paranoid individual. Over the last several months I've been feeling more and more disconnected to the point where I feel like just a thing in my brain. A metaphor: My brain and all its processes and thoughts are a ship, and I am just the wind observing and guiding the ship in directions across an infinite ocean. The ocean is reality. I feel like I'm an observer pushing my mental processes in directions instead of being a human. I feel like I'm observing this crazily complex replicating biological machine controlled by a brain. 

I also don't recognize myself in the mirror or who I am. I really feel like an amalgamation of a constant stream of thoughts trimmed up for what's important. I feel like a creation my brain created. My arms feel like tentacle-like appendages protruding from me to grab at things and shove them into my mouth be chewed up. I feel like an animal in a world where lifeforms consume other lifeforms. Everything replicates just to die or be destroyed either by itself or by another replication machine in this ruthless and hopelessly anarchic reality. 

I listen to music and feel like I'm not hearing music, I feel like I'm perceiving stimulus in my brain that my brain makes sense of and gathers it all up and creates the stream of consciousness. Me.

In short, I don't connect with myself. I am just a bundle of thoughts and processes my brain deems most important to my survival.

 How do I start feeling like a human and not a crazy weird pattern recognition machine controlling a body with the sole purpose of surviving?"

Does anyone have the problem where when they‚Äôre dissociating everything they say is backwards or jumbled together?,6,loj06d,21,"Some times when i‚Äôm dissociating I will say things opposite of what they are for instance I‚Äôll be doing something and if someone asks what i‚Äôm doing somehow the word not gets said before I say what i‚Äôm doing,also if I didn‚Äôt or am not going to do something I sometimes say I am,i‚Äôm not sure if that makes any sense at all but also at times when i‚Äôm speaking in sentences the first part of each word gets mixed with another word in the sentence or phrase and make words that don‚Äôt exist for instance instead of ‚Äúgood by‚Äù,I say ‚Äúbood guy‚Äù,or if i‚Äôm trying to say ‚Äúyea I just did that‚Äù I say ‚Äúyea I dust jid that‚Äù.i‚Äôm not sure if this is part of dissociating or if I have problems other than just dissociating,it seems to only happen when i‚Äôm really stressed out and thinking about a lot and dissociate at the same time.any input on this would be appreciated."
How to stop dissociating in sexual situations?,8,logu43,8,"Mostly when I dissociate, it‚Äôs because a very important moment is happening and I cope with that by losing touch with reality and just letting myself dissociate. 
And I haven‚Äôt recognized I‚Äôve started dissociating since around six months ago, but I think my first instance might‚Äôve been a few years ago. Basically me and my ex-boyfriend were hanging out and I was really desperate to let him get back together with me, so I kind of let them touch me in any way I wanted, even though at that point I wasn‚Äôt really sexually attracted to him anymore, but I was really young and I thought I needed him to stay in my life. Even though I didn‚Äôt really want him to touch me sexually, I still let him, and I think to cope with that I dissociated and I can‚Äôt remember it very well and it pains me to remember.
That happened in sophomore year of high school and I‚Äôm a freshman in college now. Ever since then, I haven‚Äôt done anything romantic or sexual (maybe a couple relationships but we never got to the point of being very physical) and this weekend I‚Äôm supposed to go ‚Äúhorror movie and chill‚Äù with a guy at my college. 
He‚Äôs very attractive and I‚Äôm pretty excited, but I‚Äôm also very desensitized and don‚Äôt really care about many things anymore, especially sex. So I‚Äôm worried that I will become bored or I won‚Äôt like it as much as I thought I would and I will dissociate to cope with the disappointment or maybe just ambivalence. I‚Äôm trying to keep my standards low to help myself and I‚Äôm also trying to let myself leave if I‚Äôm not feeling it, but even if everything does go well, I just cannot see a scenario where I do not dissociate while having sex.
My question is, how can I stop dissociating while having sex? Are there any techniques y‚Äôall do? When I normally dissociate, I just look at my birthmarks or I feel something, but that‚Äôs just to convince myself that I‚Äôm real. I don‚Äôt think that would help that much, so I would love some tips! I‚Äôm very scared, but I can‚Äôt think of any time when I would be more ready than I am right now."

"I have been experiencing, for months now, what I feel is dissociation, but I don‚Äôt know and I can‚Äôt see a therapist anytime soon.",9,lod932,1,"I (19f) serve in the army. I have had many mental health issues and when I was younger I was very deep in depression for a couple years. Suicide ideation, not feeling anything, that sort of thing. 

The problem is usually army therapists are for short term issues that need taking care of. Not really long term psychological ‚Äútreatments‚Äù, to put it one way. And I don‚Äôt have the time, nor means, nor money to find a therapist outside of the army, so I‚Äôm left wondering.

Every time I go home after the army I look forward to it so much. The first day is usually fine, but the rest of the time I find myself ‚Äúdissociating‚Äù like hell. For me, it feels like nothing is real. Like I‚Äôm completely disconnected from my body and the outside world and I‚Äôm kinda stuck in my mind. At the moment everything feels fuzzy and it only stops when I go back to the army, to my base. Nothing I‚Äôve tried helps. Sometimes when I‚Äôm out of the house it lessens but as long as I‚Äôm in and around my house I am dissociating. Only thing that seems to help is getting drunk which is a really unhealthy way to cope, so I try not to, but on days I get really desperate to feel something, I drink. 

I think maybe I dissociate only at my house because of past trauma. My parents can be pretty manipulative and I have nightmares about it pretty often. But I don‚Äôt know for sure.

Does anyone not believe they dissociate unless theyre actively dissociating?,6,lo43fq,2,"When im not dissociating, a part of me doesnt believe that i ever dissociated. I know I do, but i dont always believe it. 

I know that i dissociate based on confirmations from 2 different mental health professionals and when i dissociate i actively make a note of it. When im at home, its an out-loud verbal note ""oh look, dissociation..."" and when im not at home, i tend to make a written note in my phones notepad if the episode is worth noting. It's nothing more than a casual observation, im not actively holding my breath for it.

The only reason that i know for a solid fact that i dissociated is because of the notes that i made, and the confirmation from my therapists

Does anyone have any idea wtf is going on?"

Any advice for dissociative fugue?,13,lndfae,13,"
f, 19
Ive heard that dissociative fugue is when a person suddenly forgets his past life and associations due to a traumatic event or stress and have the urge to wandere usually far from home for a couple of months or years. (Also: If the person already started a new life it can happens that he suddenly remembers his past life again and forgets the years he lived his ‚Äönew/fake life‚Äò.)
This is exactly how I feel like right now... for months already.
Does anyone know if hypnosis can bring your old associations back? Or do they just come automatically? 
I‚Äôd be really thankful for any other idea or advice for a treatment 
and Stories of similar experiences:)
Im just trying to find a way to bring my old associations back. 
In my case it was mostly due to lots of stress from university."
Does anyone do this too?,15,ln2u3r,8,"It feels like I play these cognitive games with myself. I think when I started feeling emotionally overwhelmed I thought I could fix my problems in my own head since I had no one to talk to about it. I thought I could trick myself into forgetting things, pretending like things didn't affect me, denying things, tricking myself into being a certain way, etc.

I'm 26 now and I'm still dissociated. I don't know how to stop being dissociated. I feel like I do it to myself somehow but I don't understand how. I have been this way for so long I don't know how to stop. It always feels like I'm somehow controlling myself or something. Like a part of me is controlling myself and I can't describe it. I don't trust myself on some level it really is confusing and scary.

All I know is I don't want to be dissociated anymore. I want to feel like the old me again. I try meditating and all these somatic/being in the moment exercises but nothing works. As I'm doing it I'm constantly thinking that ""If I do this, I'll be cured"" but then another part of me thinks ""Stop thinking that because you're stopping it from happening"" I sound crazy.

Even when I talk to my therapist I feel like I'm only telling them things because that ""will cure me"" not because I actually want to. It makes no sense to me. I think I basically constructed this complex/thing in my head when I was younger and overwhelmed and now I feel like I can't break out of it. I don't know how.

I research about dissociation/trauma all the time. I keep reading about acceptance and all this bullshit. Like if I accepted that I was dissociated and miserable I wouldn't even be searching for this shit. Then it's like do I accept that I can't accept? Do I accept that I can't accept that I can't accept? And so on. It gets so meta and confusing. Life makes no sense anymore and I don't know how to go back to the old me where it was simple and I didn't have these crazy thoughts. I feel trapped by these existential/confusing thought loops. I just want to break free from the dissociation. I want to be me again. Can anyone relate or help?"

Am I going through a long period of dissociation or is it just depression,4,lms4f0,5,"Wow ok hi so I just spent about an hour and a half typing a background story and context for the situation I‚Äôm currently dealing with in which I poured my heart out and expressed all of my pent up thoughts from the past 3 years of my life and I accidentally reloaded the page and deleted it all. Honestly at this point there‚Äôs nothing I can do but I don‚Äôt have the energy to type a whole paragraph up again so I‚Äôm just going to give a short summary. So I‚Äôm a freshman in high school (F,15) and I‚Äôve been struggling with several various mental illnesses for a few years now including depression, anxiety, and ADD. I also have a pretty terrible relationship with my parents and I really want to get out of my house but that‚Äôs a story for another time. So I‚Äôve been dealing with stress and depression from covid, my virtual classes for school, and my parents. Honestly I thought things were getting a bit better but on Friday I had a random anxiety attack and a small identity crisis. I went to bed expecting to be better in the morning but I wasn‚Äôt, and five days later I‚Äôm still in this situation. My symptoms include: -Loss of interest for all of my hobbies -Loss of goals and aspirations -Loss of emotion -Mild short term memory loss (nothing severe) -Loss of feelings of certain places and memories

I feel basic emotions, like I laugh when my friend tells me a joke, but not on a deeper level which is alarming because I always try to stay in tune with my deeper emotions but I just stopped having them since Friday. I‚Äôve lost all interest in all of my hobbies including drawing which is particularly alarming considering drawing has been something I‚Äôve enjoyed for years and has helped me get through a lot. I talked to a psychologist I‚Äôve been seeing (who I don‚Äôt particularly like but my mom wants me to keep working with her anyway because my doctor recommended her) and she said that‚Äôs it‚Äôs just depression and I should try to get outside more and journal. She thinks it could also be diet related because I went vegan a month ago. My mom also said it‚Äôs just depression and she doesn‚Äôt want me to see a psychiatrist even though I really want to because I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I‚Äôve done research and to me it seems like it could be a long episode of dissociation but I‚Äôm not sure. I bought this up to both of them but they both dismissed that as being too intense a diagnosis for what I‚Äôm going through. My two best friends have been helping me as much as possible and I appreciate them so much for being there for me but they can only do so much to help. At some point I need professional help. I‚Äôve never posted on reddit before but at this point no adult that is supposed to be helping me will listen to my concerns and I guess this is my last attempt at getting help, or at least some direction as to what I‚Äôm going through. I really don‚Äôt know what to do at this point and I want to go back to how I was before this. If any of you have any idea of what could be going on with me I would really appreciate your input, and to anyone who takes the time out of their day to read this and maybe give me some advice, thank you, you have no idea how much it helps."
What is the difference between Dissociation and Absence seizure?,2,lmkyzk,2,"
Can someone here describe the difference between the two. 

I think I have experienced both in different occasions in the past.

I would like to add that I suspect having ADHD. I  daydream all the time. there are times when people talk to me but I don‚Äôt hear a word they say. 

I would also like to point out something weird I experience sometimes. it feels like I‚Äôm being hypnotized, as if someone possessed my mind but I can‚Äôt move I just freeze and my eyes gets fixed on one object and if someone talks to me I repeat the word they say very slowly but I don‚Äôt answer them. It‚Äôs like when someone gets hypnotized in TV shows. it only lasts a few seconds though.

I‚Äôm very confused about my symptoms.
I was never diagnosed with ADHD by a professional. But I think I have it.
High chance I have PTSD/ or CPTSD too. past two years were hell to me. flashbacks, agoraphobia, severe depression ... etc"
this is a new one ‚Äì dissociating because of art,15,lm6s67,2,"I just watched some online interactive theatre stuff. And I enjoyed it, but the comedian was playing with reality a little bit. Well, a lot.

And ooohhh man. I'm fine, I'm okay, I've gotten better at knowing how to handle feeling spaced out, anxious and disoriented. I trust that I'll be fine eventually, if not today or tomorrow, in a week at least. But it's a lot. And it's impressive. I don't remember art ever triggering my dissociation this bad ‚Äì Get Out and Midsommar weren't great for my brain, but this is something else.

I'm going to hope and assume no one knows what I'm referring to, because it was so brilliantly done and I wouldn't want to spoil it. But basically, I was made to feel I was also watching other people watch this comedian. We were in a kind of big zoom thing together. Zoom/skype/facetime stuff already cause me to dissociate more, so I try to avoid it. But I love this comedian and the pandemic is boring. So I was prepared for *some* dissociation. I watched other people, and how they laughed, sometimes didn't at all, or walked away, made tea, hugged their dog. For about two hours. It was fascinating and made me feel less alone, which was much needed. I was even made to feel I had talked to someone, one on one.

In the end, it turned out, all of those people had prerecorded their stuff. No one could see me, I could see no one. The idea was to show the audience how isolated and lonely we are, during covid.

Great, cool, very creative, genuinely pretty brillianty done. But when I closed my lapotp, nothing felt real and now my derealization is so, so bad. There's also just the fact that I really didn't need to be reminded of how incredibly lonely I am. Being isolated triggers my dissociation as well. Besides that, it's just very depressing. These feelings aren't enjoyable or fascinating for me. It just sucks and it scares me.

And I feel a bit weird about someone making such depressing art in such a difficult time. Especially when you're a comedian, oof.

I laughed and applauded when it ended but am close to tears now. It makes me feel like there should be a warning, but maybe that's completely ridiculous. You might as well give a sunset or anywhere loud or bright a warning. This is just not what I needed, am I'm going to try to find something hopeful and grounding to read or watch now.

Just needed to vent about it to people who get it."
I'm not sure what or how I got this. But Im genuinely starting to believe the friends I made online aren't real.,6,lm8yva,4,"Apologies if this isn't the correct subreddit. This is just a vent. 

I've only really talked to people online, I never had much interaction in person friend wise. At most it's just been over discord or the phone, or even texting often. Over the past few weeks I've just been having what I think is some sortve panic, and isolating myself from chatting online because I don't believe that anyone I'm chatting to is real at this point. It feels like I'm just using one of those ai bots to talk to someone, or at most someone out of pity being forced to talk to me, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I don't feel in my own body anymore, I don't feel like I can snap back in. I have no emotion or thought towards typing this right now and I don't know why anymore. Just the constant idea of being in a false reality is stuck in my head all day. I want to stop talking to them but I don't know why I can't.

I've done some light research on dissociation since I started having episodes about 4 years ago. Most of the stuff I read directly associates dissociation with trauma. What are all your thoughts on this? Do some of you have dissociative episodes with no (known) history of trauma? Pardon my ignorance- I've never talked to someone who regularly experiences these episodes so I'm hoping to learn more. 

FYI- when my episodes started, I was in a depression and in a toxic relationship-maybe that was some form of trauma? (also unsure what qualifies as trauma...)

Look forward to responses. 

Thanks"

Texting vs Speaking?,9,llo9vm,2,"Does anyone else find it easier to text while they're dissociating instead of actually talking out loud? Even if the person you would be speaking to is in the same room as you? I have a tendency to go nonverbal when I'm dissociating really bad, and I wondered if thats common amongst other people who dissociate?"
"feeling absolutely nothing for weeks or maybe even months, anyone?",27,llanzo,22,"My best friend recently went through a bad breakup, they had attempted suicide, and they now feel basically nothing. 

They don't feel sad, they don't feel happy, they don't feel joy, and they don't feel love. They no longer love me (or anyone) and it's kinda devastating. 

I asked around in r/BPD and I was told it could be a form of dissociation. 

Does anyone know more about this? what is it called, and how do you support someone who's currently going through it. How long does it last, and how can you help someone going through it to start feeling better? How do you avoid annoying them? Resources would be very appreciated too."
Did anyone start disassociating after being given a drug?,1,llnlod,4,"*dissociating

Back in mid-September, I was given Fentanyl and Midazolam by my gastroenterologist as sedation and pain management for an upper endoscopy. About two months later, I had my first major dissociative episode. I was wondering if anyone thinks they could be connected, because Fentanyl is similar to Heroin, which has effects on brain chemistry for about 30 years after using it. From what I remember, being in the haze of Fentanyl kind of reminded me of dissociation in a way."
Dissociative episode tonight,1,lljogb,0,"Cw/tw: intense dissociation, emotional unavailability, family emotional neglect

Had a relatively good day mental health wise. Husband starts playing with 5 year old we co-parent on the bed, all fun and games. However, the moment they started, I immediately starting seriously dissociating. Still am right now (not as strong but definetly still there).

I think what triggered it was just the fact that I'm adopted (abandoned 2 days after I was born, not adopted until about 9 months old) and the family I was adopted into was just genuinely emotionally.... Not there. The 2 were having fun rolling around and playing on the bed and I just was there, somewhat reclined, looking like I was zoning out but dissociating hard. Why was this such a trigger for me üò≠"
I had a huge insight this week,14,ll0p7w,1,"So first off, I‚Äôve never made a post on reddit before (!!!) so I hope I do this right? 
But it‚Äôs about 3 am where I live right now and I‚Äôm coming off of about 6 ish months of a combination of mania, depression and dissociation. Like really hard dissociation, sometimes my vision even gets really blurry. I‚Äôve been in therapy for over ten years, working through some really hard grief, emotional neglect, chronic depression and (although I didn‚Äôt know till I spent 6 weeks living alone during quarantine) dissociation issues. I finally found some tools to help get out of that, earlier this summer, before I went home to where pretty much all of my trauma happened. (I moved like 3000 miles away from my hometown, but visit sometimes cause my nieces are SO CUTE). I finally had enough mental energy, reconnection with my support network and time to take those recovery/grounding steps this week and I just woke up to a flood of some really, really amazing positive memories I forgot about (classic memory loss, smh). 
Im really grateful for all the posts on this sub cause they give me hope and insight and laughs and good vibes even when it‚Äôs hard. I know I‚Äôll probably dissociate in the future, cause I can‚Äôt control what triggers me but I also know I‚Äôm glad I can go to places like this, to my fave music, to some key people in my life (finally) to find the way out.
Keep going, I‚Äôm thinking good things for you, there are ways to get through it and get out."
Dissociation and Adderall,15,lkstnz,5,"I dissociate in all degrees, from a day totally blank in the face and unable to remember anything moment to moment, to impulsive dissociation where I become erratic, dangerous, a flight risk.
Recently I began taking Adderall. I had never even considered taking it, but after a traumatic, emotional break I had been unable to focus. Unable to stay in my own body.
I am in between doctor appointments and waiting for a refill and I have been in a constant state of dissociation. I realize now as I look back on my days with Adderall (low dose) I was present. Calm and present.
I don‚Äôt want to have to depend on a drug like Adderall, but it has changed my life. I haven‚Äôt felt alive in over three years now.
Should I be worried? Am I getting myself into trouble using this drug to keep present? Can any of you relate?"
Help?,1,ll7gcx,5,"I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here can help, or if anyone will even see this. My boyfriend (16), told me last night that he hasn‚Äôt felt real for two weeks.

We‚Äôve dealt with minor episodes like this, but not completely. I understand it‚Äôs a trauma response, but me, and even my mom have little to no experience or information on what‚Äôs going on. He cant seem to feel real again and I don‚Äôt know how to help. Do any of you have any tips on this? Anything?

Im confused,5,lkx39j,2,Made a throw away. Ive had an extremely stressful week at work and i feel so overwhelmed. I have a history with depression btw. So i woke up this morning and i felt like i was looking at a random person in my mirror. Forward to about an hour ago i was on the brink of a panic attack and it feels like my body just shut off. I feel like I‚Äôm in a dream state and that nothing is real. I feel like I‚Äôm floating and that the things i did today happened years ago. I feel like im dead. Im just so confused as to whats happening if anyone knows what is happening please let me know. Thanks
"have been in a dissociative state for days, just don‚Äôt want to feel alone..",8,lkq2o9,3,"hi there everyone :) 
I am 23F, and about five days ago I took an antibiotic for a small infection that I probably didn‚Äôt even need, and since then, as my title suggests, I have been in a dissociative state. I assume, that it either may have interacted with my bipolar medication (lithium), or the more likely scenario, taking it was a trigger for me due to a very very bad experience I had at the end of 2019. either way, I‚Äôve not had a dissociative episode this long before and it‚Äôs quite scary. it‚Äôs not so bad that it‚Äôs debilitating and I can‚Äôt go about my life, but it‚Äôs so taxing and I‚Äôm always quite aware of it. I am doing all the usual grounding exercises and making sure I am taking extra steps to take care of myself and asking for help when I need it etc, etc. but I‚Äôm sure you can all relate, it is still quite scary. I can‚Äôt help but have thoughts like ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm actually going crazy, what if something else is wrong with me and I‚Äôm not just bipolar, what if it isn‚Äôt even dissociation and I have lithium toxicity or something else terrible happening with my body‚Äù etc. sometimes the worst part about dissociation is that of course you feel so disconnected from everything, and by extension it leaves you feeling so alone, like you are the only one this has ever happened to or is happening to. so, I just wanted to come on here and vent, my support network tries their hardest to understand but it‚Äôs one of those things you simply can‚Äôt wrap your head around unless you‚Äôve experienced it and sometimes it makes me feel even more ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù trying to explain it to them. if you have any advice or kind words for me of course I would love to hear them, or perhaps you are going through or have been through a similar situation, I would also love to hear your story, otherwise, I am just here to vent.

Dissociated During Job Interview,11,lkh5xp,1,"Five days ago and one of the worse job interviews I've experienced. Two things occurred that triggered me and I dissociated. 1) The interviewer had told me on the phone she was going to interview me along with the owner. When I was called back into the back office the woman proceeds to introduce the owner to me and then tells me he's her father. So a family owned business and I wasn't prepared. There's a whole dynamic there I wish I had been aware of before the interview. 2) The owner proceeds to tell me his employees are treated like ""family"" and the office is their ""home."" These words ""family,"" and ""home"" are huge negative triggers to me. I then found myself detaching from the present and became lost in a fog. I didn't get the job and feel it may have been for the best in the long run. 

This is yet another learned experience I'll chalk up to help prepare me for future interviews. I felt like it was a set-up, the whole family business situation and having it withheld from me until we were face to face. I wish this would get easier."
Does media (films/shows/books/etc) trigger feelings of dissociation for you all?,3,lkm3nh,0,"I used to think it didn't. But after (unintentionally) watching several things about living in a simulation I've been left in this eerie detached state of mind for the past few days. But this type of 'media-triggered' sensation feels different from what normal 'dissociation' feels like, in a way I can't quite describe. Part of the difference is that it's not as bad of an experience I guess because there's this clear external cause of it, it makes me not as bothered.

Anyone else get this way or feel varying 'types' of dissociation depending on whether it is set off by something external (whether media or any drug or anything like that or life events) versus when it just happens spontaneously/ caused by something internal?"
I think I‚Äôve been completely dissociating for this whole day?,17,lk0ulq,3,"I don‚Äôt dissociate normally and I‚Äôve never been this bad before. I can still talk (sorta) and do things but I feel really disconnected from my body and surroundings. I haven‚Äôt been able to do my work today (school coursework) because it‚Äôs been so severe, just like sitting on the floor and being trapped in my own head staring at nothing

There hasn‚Äôt even been anything to cause any of this and I‚Äôve tried to sleep it off but it just stays, it feels like I don‚Äôt even exist and my body isn‚Äôt real, I don‚Äôt even know if I can still bleed?? My co-ordination isn‚Äôt terrible but everything is taking me a lot longer and I know that I can‚Äôt do certain (intricate) things like sewing or writing at the moment.

"Oh brother, today was rough.",3,lk8jb3,0,"Alright, so, where to begin?

So today I was working. Yeah, I worked on Valentine's day, in a cafe, where Sundays are usually our busiest days. So already I was really feeling the heat.

Basically, while I was at work I was dissociating. My body was so sluggish and when I walked I would develop a limp for a few seconds. The room seemed like it was spinning for a minute, and I raised my hands in the air to try and, well, ""put me back in my body"", or whatever.

And then it got worse when I was at Sunday School today. My Dad was teaching, but when he realized that he wasn't getting the attention he wanted, asked what was the point of it all and went through each of my siblings for answers. It caused me to dissociate more, and I eventually went into the bathroom. I huddled into a ball and I was shaking. It was super difficult to get up.

The lesson began to be heated and an argument was ensuing, so I decided to pack it up and go to my room to avoid getting a worse case of dissociation. But then I heard the fighting going on downstairs, and so I decided to hide in my closet until it was over, while listening to music to drown the screaming out. One of my particular favorites is this Triage at Dawn cover:  [Half-Life 2 - Triage at Dawn Guitar Cover ft. Barry King - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qb3XkWJeI0Q). I had a voice act up that helped me calm down and just walked through the process of breathing and finding some headspace.

It calmed down, but I basically stayed in my closet for about an hour. I also skipped lunch today and I was going to eat a PB&J to satisfy me until I could eat something, but then Sunday school happened and then the fighting, so I just had some Snickers. Not the healthiest choice, but whatever, I did manage to have something resembling a meal later.

It seems to be on Sundays when I get dissociated, and voices acting up. I don't know if it's the stress of it being the busiest day of the week or if it's because of religion, but...well, I don't really know what my triggers are, and I feel like there could be a lot of things.

Thank you for reading this far."
Burnout and dissociation,4,lk37tb,4,"Does burnout and dissociation go hand and hand?most days I feel dissociated due to stress anxiety and depression,lately I‚Äôve been burning out a lot and feel exhausted and ready to go to sleep when my day isn‚Äôt even half way over.i‚Äôm going through a lot of problems lately that don‚Äôt seem to help such as,toxic family,lack of ability to find a job,lack of real relationships,lack of people to talk to,plus i‚Äôm practically broke as far as money and have some costly legal expenses at the moment.I procrastinate a lot and always seem to never get things done till the last minute,which dosent help my situation at all.any thoughts and opinions on this would be appreciated.thanks in advance"
Smoking till I loose my mind I think,2,ljyi6k,1,"Right now, all I can do is wait, and work internally on my constent DPDR

I have to wait to get my unemployment money, althought I should not even get it as I'm not even looking for a job as I just can't work at all since I got into hospital because I wanted to die, so in bonus it stress because I know I might get caught one day... But I need to pay the roof over my head, I need to eat and protect myself from the cold... And there is no other money help I could get as I need a psychological evaluation to have a medical money help *flip a table* *zen*

Then I have to wait that my debt are all paid

And then, maybe, I will get to see a psychologist good for me and then maybe I will get better, will be able to work, endure the stress and not live in the fear to live in the street.

And my problem seem to get worse...
I have strange dreams. They aren't nightmare, they don't scare me nor wake me up... They just leave a strange feeling during the day. Like a disturbing feeling. Like a bad taste. Like something strange. They started 2 months ago, and now I even sweat in my sleep. I'm not even hot. Usually I would wake up because I feel hot. But now I wake up because my body is all wet and it's inconfortable and I get very cold.
They don't understand arround me... They say it's nightmare, just try to not think about them and they will go away. The more you stress about it, the more it will be a problem.
Yes a concede. But they should try to not mind a very sour or shitty taste in their mouth.

Plus, I have problem to eat now, since December. My psychiatrist told me it didnt seem to be problematic as I didnt loose a lot of weight in a small time... Fine I concede. But when I told her that I had problem to eat I was only able to eat pancake ! Anything else would make my body react, I would feel sick and want to throw up just looking or smelling them ! Mind you, I looooove food ! Really. And I dont have problem with my weight either far from I know... But it's like if out of no where some food started to become poop. But it may change day to day ! One day an apple is a poop, but the other it's an apple.
So it was only pancake for me as my taste for them didnt seem to change. But then what happen when you always, always eat the same thing ? You may start to feel sick about it. Yep.
So no more pancake for me ! 
I'm starving
I'm hungry 
It hurt
But I do eat, here and there, what is able to come inside.
Exemple: day 1. 1/2 eggs sandwich, 3 chicken wings and some fries.
Day  2. pudding, pudding, some blueberry, small portion of lasagna
Etc.
But I often feel sick, eating became problematic
And I still feel Hungry, even if I just ate something.

And ofcourse, since 2 years now (I think) üéâüéâüéâ
I have DPDR, well not fully diagnosed, my psychiatrist say  I do have DPDR symptoms...

So mh... Yeah. I'm tired. 
I don't want to die nor hurt myself, don't worry I'm not looking to do that...

But I will be smoking till all my mind is gone, for what is still there"
I could *really* use advice,6,lji1gf,3,"Long story short, I am seeking a diagnosis but I am positive that I am on the autism spectrum. This realization came out of nowhere for me two days ago after extensive research. It was a bit of a ‚Äúlightbulb moment‚Äù in my life. I thought I was fine with it, I spent all day yesterday with a friend. But this morning I woke up and, I‚Äôll do my best to describe this, but it felt like waking up in somebody else‚Äôs body. I spent the entire day in a state of laying motionless as if I‚Äôm asleep but just laying there with no thoughts. It felt as if everything around me was a dream and I was absolutely *not* myself at all. I would have moments where I would get up briefly to do something small and it just feels like my entire head is full of fog and everything is hazy. Everything just feels extremely wrong and I haven‚Äôt been able to pull myself out of it. I feel slightly okay now but the fog is still there and I don‚Äôt entirely feel like myself. Nothing like this has EVER happened to me before in my life. It feels like the moment I realized the autism spectrum thing (I promise there‚Äôs no way I don‚Äôt have it, just not diagnosed yet) I haven‚Äôt been myself since that moment. It‚Äôs just been a never ending hazy, dreamy, trance-like existence. If this makes any sense at all, I would love some advice or thoughts because I am honestly freaking out- as much as I can be at the moment."
Is there a correlation between dissociation and headaches?,16,lj82ar,6,"I haven‚Äôt hit my head on anything but I‚Äôve been dissociating since yesterday (I think anyway.

So...I was in a dissociative fugue for 12 years, completely convinced I was a baby and that my words didn‚Äôt come from me but other sources and you can see how that would regress me and pull back my development by A LOT. Anyway, since I‚Äôve come out of it....I was always a writer and able to write, but it took slow spurts to get my thoughts and my words flowing more and more and more but when I wasn‚Äôt writing, I lost that and I also lost my train of thought. It has been a struggle to write even more than a few paragraphs without losing my train of thought or not wanting to write any further. I have considered getting some brain tests to see if there may be some long-term damage and extra issues going on here. Has anyone dealt with something similar?

Parenting feelings,1,ljaeov,1,"Tw/cw: parent-child bonding, parenthood, co-parenting, feeling numb

When it came to parenthood I always thought id be really physically affectionate and what not but I started co parenting a 5 year old and when they wanna cuddle up I'll let them.... But emotionally and psychologically I feel dead/numb/void. It's taken me kind of aback because mentally I thought if I were ever to be a mom, I'd be 100% into it.

I dunno if this is a side effect of my chronic dissociation or some other thing going on mentally with me. Physically, I don't really want biological children because I have a bad medical history and I wouldn't want to pass it onto biological children.

Gave any other moms felt like this? How do you work through it? It feels like psychologically something is broken and I should be feeling tender feelings... But I just don't. I've been co-parenting this child for almost a year now so it's not like it's brand new. 

I feel like theres a syndrome name for this phenomena but I can't remember it (not post partuem depression) where the mom never develops what we'd consider a ""typical"" bond with a child. 

I'm really scared to bring this up with my husband (who also co parents the child), partially because I see him giggle/laugh/bond with the child and I'm like... I want that, but I literally feel dead/numb/void inside even when I fully try that."
Somethings been happening to me and I‚Äôll try my best to describe it,2,lixfpu,1,Sometimes I‚Äôm unsure about what I‚Äôm doing when I scratch my back I can feel it but at the same time it feels like I didn‚Äôt move it myself could someone explain if this is dissociation?
Is this dissociation?,11,lim7tf,4,"So i‚Äôve been having these weird feelings since sept 2020 up until now, and it‚Äôs me becoming really aware of everything and my surroundings, it makes me zoom out of my body and observe the earth floating in the universe within my head.

Also, i could be staring or just quickly look at something and it would start moving like lava or enlarging then becoming small as if it‚Äôs pulsating. For example, my curtains would look like the effect you get after you stopped driving for a while and stare at the road, this also happens to my body but as if you could feel that visual effect occurring to your body.

I usually get this feeling when i‚Äôm laying or closing my eyes as if i‚Äôm not my body but zooming through air. And i can now do this body thing on command too even if i‚Äôm just walking somewhere. Before this used to feel really calming and nice, but now i get anxious to sleep as it gets bad at night since the feeling occurs most when i‚Äôm laying or closing my eyes, it makes me afraid i‚Äôd drift into sleep paralysis again. (this has happened twice before)

Additionally if i went outside sometimes everything feels out of place like the trees would make no sense to me because of the way they looked, it‚Äôs really hard to explain what i see or feel in that moment, it‚Äôs just nothing makes sense and i struggle to comprehend reality. 

Recently i thought my family came from a different reality it lasted for a few hours, although now it‚Äôs fine. But the way they were acting freaked me out as i got really scared that they were gonna hurt me. It made me heavily uncomfortable as i thought i shifted to another dimension/reality.

I‚Äôve seen people talk about how they look at their hands and don‚Äôt feel connected to themselves this has happened to me a few times, although i‚Äôm just wondering if what i‚Äôve described is part of dissociation as i‚Äôve never seen anyone talk about it before and when i explain to people they usually laugh it off or ignore it, adding to the sense that they too aren‚Äôt real.

i‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety i‚Äôm wondering maybe these two illnesses can induce this feeling."
How to deal with the strong urge to flee/escape/start a new life?,8,limgq0,2,"19, f

About 3 months ago I started to feel extremely weak and helpless like a baby/child due to strong dissociative states (derealisation, depersonalisation, freeze, disconnected from body and emotions) caused by lots of stress (moving to another city, university). Since then this ‚Äöchild‚Äò part of me is telling me every day to just start a new life in another country. But this would also include to forget about my whole identity, dreams, past life and leave all of my friends and family behind. Rationally I do know that its morally not good to do that but still I want to....

Did anyone had a similar problem before? Any advice? I wish I wouldn‚Äôt want to start a completely new life."
If dissociation was a song lol,14,li5isw,2,
There ain't room for the two of us here- New voices in my head,14,li2ox5,22,"I was just wondering if I can find anyone with a similar experience who has been going through this longer to get some pointers... I have (so far) 7 different voices in my head that are related to me in some sort of way (they don't necessarily look like me either, and there is one male when i am female).

I was in bed one morning last week and all of a sudden this voice says ""Hi, can I come out? I don't want to scare you"" and like out struts this teenage girl in my head. She told me she hasn't came out sooner because she knew she would scare me pantless (which is true). Later that day another person appeared and another one that night. The next day two more came out. The next day one more came out. two days later a man appeared. 4 of the 7 have names. 3 of the 7 are nonverbal. 6 female, 1 male. Varying ages from 4ish to 40ish.

I don't hear them audibly- they are definitely just in my head and talk in my thoughts. In this week I have realized 4 are different versions of me (2 past, 1 current/recent past, 1 current/future), 1 represents anger, and two are unknown and make me feel frightened/uncomfortable. They are largely positive, my therapist and I are incredibly grateful.

Naturally of course I freak out and reached out to my therapist and psychiatrist and then hoarded myself away all weekend because I had no clue what was happening. But now, I am coming to terms with it moreso and generally like the ones that are strong and talking. We have a good time together.

Do you guys have any tips on handling these guys? so far they aren't making me do anything, i just feel very strongly (one threw a fit when the psychiatrist prescribed a medicine to make them ""go away"", that was our first fight). What are some terms that you refer to them as? I don't like calling them ""parts"" or ""people"" or ""alters"". Related, do you have a term that you call all of you together? I've heard ""system"" but don't like that either. Have you told anyone? How have they reacted?

Thanks, I promise I'm not crazy. This is how I'm coping apparently from a recent trauma."
Good coping techniques for when dissociating??,11,lhtje7,8,
Idk what I‚Äôm going through,1,li76j1,1,"I‚Äôve had these issues for a while now that I never understood. I brought it up multiple times and people kept asking me if I‚Äôm dissociating. I obviously denied it because idk what that means honestly. I thought dissociation meant like when u actually see yourself like fully out of body. Although I‚Äôve had that feeling idk why I thought it was literal, idek if it is or not. I just want to know what it is I feel. I feel like i have no control over what I think or do or say. I feel like me and the people around me aren‚Äôt real. After a bad day when I‚Äôm filled with anxiety and depression or when I‚Äôm triggered. I would sort of blur out everything and go on random tangents but in my head I‚Äôm like what am I doing. It‚Äôs calmed down because I‚Äôm on medication which limited it but this is the first time it happening again. I‚Äôve seen a video of someone from my past and it gave me so much anxiety and I felt like I was doing it again. I‚Äôm sorry for a better description but I felt like I was going crazy. If someone could give me a bit of insight i would love it. Thank you."

Dissociating due to burnout - Can anyone relate? Feeling alone.,2,lhwybk,6,"I don't even really have the energy to be typing this, so sorry if it doesn't make sense. But I've been very burnt out at work for the past idk how long, which is causing bouts of what my therapist believes to be dissociation, more specifically I would say depersonalization. I'm not myself. I don't feel like myself. And I'm very unhappy. I'm on the verge of tears a lot, and yet I also zone out a lot and have no emotion. I'm angry a lot and not my bubbly self. As I am typing this, I'm sitting at work, after hours because 1. I don't want to interact with other humans who are also leaving the building (I'm normally an extrovert) and 2. I feel like I'm a bag of bricks who just doesn't want to move. I'm so mentally drained that I just want to sit here and not move. I'm scared and just wondering if anyone can relate. I'm afraid if this continues, it will lead to a mental breakdown. I don't see a lot on dissociation due to burnout from work and I'm just wondering if anyone else out there understands."
Dissociation for months that I‚Äôm pretty sure was caused by a bad first experience with weed,9,lhhbi2,11,"About 6 months ago I tried weed for the first time. I must not have been inhaling properly because it didn‚Äôt do anything. So I tried again a couple days later and accidentally smoked way too much.

While this was happening I would tell myself that it‚Äôs not real I‚Äôm just high. But right after telling myself that I would forget immediately and tell myself it again then remember a few seconds later that I just tried to tell myself that, causing more panic because it made the time loop feel even more real.

I think this went on for about 30 minutes. Now, about 6 months later I still don‚Äôt feel right. I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs dissociation. When it‚Äôs worst someone might be talking to me and I‚Äôll be feel completely out of reality and super confused for a second. Like who the hell is talking right now. Completely disconnected from my surroundings. It seems the only way I can avoid this is by distracting myself. If I have a chance to be in my own thoughts, even if I‚Äôm just slightly uninterested in what someone is talking to me about, I‚Äôll feel like this.

It‚Äôs definitely not gotten better since then, it probably has gotten worse tbh. I mean I was talking to my mom about something earlier and when I responded I just got totally weirded out by my own voice and felt like I was in third person for a sec. Has anyone else experienced this as a result of a bad high with weed? Is there anything I can do about it?

Also a side question. I recently learned about kava. Anyone who may have experience with it have you noticed any interactions (good or bad) between it and dissociation? I want to try it for other reasons but I‚Äôm just curious."
Marijuana and dissociation,32,lgwk39,15,"Throughout my entire life I have struggled with various forms of anxiety. I used to have a panic disorder but now I mainly struggle with dissociation. I have gotten way too high in the past which triggered dissociative episodes but I have also had some really good high experiences where I felt euphoric, connected and focused. This range of experiences all happened before I got my medical marijuana card and I wasn't quite sure which strains I was getting I just knew some made me feel great and some made me dissociate (quantity of consumption didn't make much of a difference).

I have my medical marijuana card now and can experiment with strains but I have no clue what I'm looking for. People have recommended indicas but I have found myself to dissociate quickly when indicas make me zone out. With dissociation comes panic. 

High sativas keep me focused but sometimes cause panic from over thinking which then causes dissociation. Argh, can't seem to win here. 

I think I will be looking for a hybrid? I want a mild body high, feelings of euphoria WITHOUT tuning out to the world. I want to know what's going on but perceive what's going on in a very positive way if that makes sense. I want my life to feel better without being so uncomfortably aware that I'm tuned out and stoned.

Has anyone else gone through this? I am looking for strain recommendations preferably with low to medium THC levels and medium CBD levels."
What causes dissociation anxiety,4,lh8x7k,8,"Does anyone know exactly what causes dissociation anxiety,it seems I‚Äôve had it since I was young but it continues to get worse the older I get.is it an effect from always being around people with multiple personality disorders or narcissism?also is quiting drugs supposed to intensify it?"
Vaping & Dissociation/Anxiety,1,lh5hsi,6,hey guys. i am very desperate here lol. so i have never had anxiety but i started vaping maybe about three years ago and the last year i got more heavy on it. my anxiety also has started about a year ago. i am literally scared to go out with friends and really leave my house because i am nervous of the panic attacks and dissociation. i actually just walked my dog and i suddenly felt so dissociated it felt like everything around me was not real and i felt like i lost myself if that makes sense. i am still vaping today and i want to know if anyone else could relate and if i quit will it help reduce or cut out these symptoms? i want to live normally again.
How do you know if you're you?,15,lgmzqh,16,"I had a pretty bad dissociative episode about a month ago and I thought it would go away, but after a therapist appointment I decided maybe I should bring this up here.

So I was in the shower when I realized that I didn't know who I was. I didn't know if I was still...well, let's say my name is Vegas. I didn't know if I was Vegas. It was like he had receded into my mind and suddenly I was left to take care of his body, and had the responsibilities he had, or that I had gotten him into. I didn't know if I was actually Vegas, or if I had just been trained to respond to the name Vegas, and that the real Vegas was in here, somewhere, but just didn't want to come out. And maybe he hadn't come out for years.

It took me about two days to feel like I was back to normal again. I honestly still cannot say if I am Vegas or not, but I still put down this body's name on all of my forms and stuff. So, I guess I'm him now? I don't really know who I am. I feel like I'm a completely different person sometimes.

Well, from that I discovered a new voice in my head. Combined with another one I found the week after, that makes a total of three voices, or more rather presences, in my head. It like I'm flying an airplane, with me as the pilot, one of the voices as my co-pilot, and everyone else is in coach. I try to talk about this with my therapist, but he keeps telling me that I'm trying to describe DID to him. I can't have DID, because nothing that traumatic happened to me. I think? I don't know, every time I try to access any potential memories about it I am met with a big door. And, frankly, I don't know if it's something I want to go through. I mean, it was agonizing when my therapist read all of my texts I sent him when I was not feeling good (possibly dissociated, I don't know), as they didn't really sound like something I would send him.

Anyway, enough about my rant. My question is, how do you know if you're you? What do you do if you don't know your name or you feel like you're someone else?"

Feeling Stuck,3,lghlc0,1,"Hi all,

I've been in treatment for over a year now after leaving a number of abusive relationships. I've spent much of that time alone, both by choice and by circumstance. I'm beginning to feel stuck. Part of what's keeping me stuck is the persistent worry that I need to protect other people from me because I'm: a narcissist, borderline, abusive, etc. These worries seem to emerge as a way for me to dissociate--their obsessive nature and relentless attacks on my person leave me feeling in a daze and disconnected from my body and environment. My therapist has been reassuring and patient--she reassures me often of my empathy, my listening skills, and inherent goodness. She doesn't see patterns of abuse or narcissism. What I'm wondering is: have others experienced this kind of ongoing, obsessional rumination post-abusive relationship? And for *this freaking long*? I hear a voice in my head demanding I keep doing self-help research to get to the bottom of this question (obsession/compulsion). I also engage in a lot of self-blame. I'm not ""better"" yet because I sleep in too late, or because I'm not being honest about my feelings, or because I watch too much TV and smoke too much weed, or because I'm not thoughtful enough... I'm sure many of you are familiar with that internal dialogue. 

This leads to my biggest worry: that I'll never see my way out of this maze. In the course of healing, I've discovered over a dozen people of different ages and genders that live within me, and my thinking is that each part needs to learn the same lessons around self-compassion/healing as the others in order to heal. It just feels maddening sometimes, this stuckness I can't seem to get out of. It makes me feel hopeless at times, and that feeling insists I remain isolated. I suppose I'm writing this to pierce through the isolation, even a little, to see... who's out there. I do eventually want connection with others. I don't know if now is the right time. Have others been through something similar? Do folks have an idea of what made them feel ready to return to the world of the living after healing their wounds? Do you never feel ready and just... do it anyway?"
My coping mechanism is probably unhealthy,8,lg8m0v,4,I developed symptoms a couple years ago and my solution is caffeine and thc.

Any advice or similar experiences with cptsd/ dissociation/ burnout?,3,lgdb9b,3,"female, 19

I suffer from a strong Depersonalisation and Derealisation for about 3 months now due to a burnout (and CPTSD). 

About my childhood-
When I was 12 my mother had cancer and depression and my father moved out (my parents got divorced). I had to take care of my mother alone and started to dissociate because I also suffered emotionally with her. This and other factors led to codependency (shame, feel responsible for others, perfectionism, have no boundaries...). Emotionally I felt like 12 until the age of 18. Then I had a breakdown due to other stress factors and a couple weeks later all of the sudden I started to ‚Äöage‚Äò really fast (don‚Äôt feel responsible for others, confident, high self-respect) like I missed out the years as a teenager to properly age emotionally. Almost one year I only focused on my identity and emotions.
I felt really strong, happy and ready to move out and study at the university. But 2 weeks after I already started to study really hard I completely could leave my old sad life behind me. Because of the high motivation for studying and fast, extreme change of my environmental (moving to a big city) I had sth like a Brun out. I think it was just bad timing. Also I had no ‚Äöpressure‚Äò anymore to have a strong identity because all I did was taking online classes and being alone in my room (due to corona).

From there on I couldn‚Äôt do or feel anything. I couldn‚Äôt move, talk, concentrate, it was like my whole life was gone. My right forehead hurt so much as if my Neurons in my frontal cortex of my brain loses energy. All of my associations were gone (I didn‚Äôt even know what a hand, a lamp, love, a family,.....is). I forget what I did or thought one second ago. Can‚Äôt recognise myself in the mirror. No understanding for time. I almost accidentally burned myself in the shower because I couldn‚Äôt feel anything/ didn‚Äôt noticed.
All I wanted was having my identity back.
Id be scared of anything (loud sudden noises, humans,..)

My first thought that came to my mind was ‚Äölet‚Äôs move to another country, leave your whole life (family, friends, school, dreams) behind you and just become a cashier to have enough money to survive‚Äò
I didn‚Äôt had any needs, desires or feelings. I live in a fake reality in a world with no rules or moral.
Every day I had dizzy spell/ collapse and sleep the whole day. In these moments I felt maximum fear, helplessness, shock/ freeze for hours sometimes.
I had flashbacks and it was as if I lived in the past.

Every day it gets worse
Every morning I forget another thing from my life when I was happy (family, dreams)

After a couple of weeks I happened to function pretty well when I talk to my friends like nothing happened but sometimes I don‚Äôt even know why I would meet my friends because I don‚Äôt have any emotional connections to them anymore.

I already tried so many things...confrontation talking, Emdr, imagination, meditation, yoga, acupuncture, talking with friends, 
And I do have a therapist and a doctor but talking doesn‚Äôt help and talking and explaining is already so exhausting.

Every hour I feel like another person. I cannot acquire new knowledge/facts/behaviour...anything. It‚Äôs like my (aging) process has stopped has stopped.

I really can‚Äôt think of anything that could help me to get my ‚Äöold‚Äò associations and need/will for self-realisation/-fulfilment back. It‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt have any reasons to do pretty much any thing. I only eat because I happened to be a human who needs a certain amount of food and I only stop eating because my stomach hurts so much that I can‚Äôt walk anymore... I don‚Äôt feel full.

Now I function so well that I don‚Äôt even have a reason to go back to my normal life anymore.
And I have a good friend, Food, time, a bed... no social? pressure which is a bad thing

My biggest problem is that the dissociation is so ‚Äöunnecessary‚Äò. It was all due to the timing. I left my childhood behind me when I was already studying really hard. After one year of focusing on my emotions and identity I only focused on Physics and maths.
and I had no social pressure/ confrontation because I only had online lessons and was alone in a big city.

I‚Äòve heard that people who often dissociated as a child easily dissociate again due to overwhelming emotions because the brain is so used to it. In my case it was the stress from university and high motivation and leaving my childhood behind me.

Also I live more and more my fake reality because I suppress/ push away/ forget another thing the next morning. Now I don‚Äôt even have fear or sadness or flashbacks.
Emdr worked from session to session less. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I do I more and more lose the connection to the time/ emotions/ thinking before my burnout.

Did anyone have similar problems or have ideas/ experiences with other treatments? Id be so thankful!
Hypnosis maybe? But I heard hypnosis can help to remember forgotten traumas and that‚Äôs not my case..
MDMA also doesn‚Äôt sound like the right treatment to me... or does anybody think differently?

(I am not fluent in English. Please understand if i made mistakes....)"
Is this dissociating?,4,lg11ed,3,"I remember when I was younger - around 7 or 8, I was in the back of the car and it was dark, I still remember exactly where I was. I began to feel as though I was nothing, I felt like I was a star and nothing mattered. As if I was sort of ‚Äòfloating in space‚Äô, I didn‚Äôt feel human. It happened a few times after that but I have never experienced this again - I am 21 now. It was not scary, it was peaceful. Was this dissociation?"

Found a way to keep things normal,23,lfrlqr,4,"I‚Äôm sure someone‚Äôs had this idea before, sorry if it‚Äôs a repost. 

I‚Äôve written down instructions for when I dissociate. Through therapy I‚Äôve begun to understand what each dissociative state is supposed to function as

So I‚Äôve written down rules and procedures to make dissociation less disruptive 

Me, being the main ‚Äúperson‚Äù, I‚Äôve worked with my therapist to identify the dangers, or the ways my dissociative states function. 

Writing down a guide book really helps, especially when you come back. You can check if the dissociative state followed the rules or if something else happened

So far I‚Äôve been able to go to school, get my work done, and understand what happens when I‚Äôm not present 

I highly recommend writing a set of rules, or having one notebook to write down the events that happen when you‚Äôre you, and when you‚Äôre not you"

Grounding? Flow? Mindfulness? Meditation?,14,lfhr58,5,"I'll repost something here that I originally put in the Meditation reddit. But the answers there disappointed me.

What the title says. I find it difficult to get a grip on the terminology around mindfulness. Everybody says dissociation is bad, OK. We practice mindfulness in order to be more aware, and dissociation is the opposite of being dissociated. But then people say humans are the most happy when they are in a ""flow"" state, like, when they are coding or chopping wood or painting with all their heart, and that seems to me far away from mindfulness, too - hyperfocused attention.

So, physiologically, I don't really understand the difference in what's happening in each of these states :("
"I can't tell if I need glasses, or if I'm just dissociating all the time",51,lewgwp,11,"Whenever I leave the house, things far away seem blurry.

I always seem to zone out and forget what I was doing. I was wondering if anyone else felt this way??"
Attachment Theory,4,letczc,3,"The idea of ""attachment theory"" is popular in dissociation groups and some mental health groups but I think it's important that the idea of ""attachment theory"" is founded on questionable science at its best.

Has anyone else here ever....,6,leotdx,1,"Do any of you guys randomly feel VERY in tune with your surroundings, as if you've made it through the clouds of day to day. Only to come to the conclusion that this newfound feeling is very scary and frightening, combined with the fact that you are somewhat unsure where you are and what you're doing there? Not to mention this happens in only a matter of half a minute for me personally.

Curious what you guys think or if anyone else experiences this at all"
"Physical inability to speak at times, body not responding to input",15,lej5l1,6,"Sometimes I'll really want to say something but my body just.. won't respond. I can say something else but if I try to return to vocalizing the given thought my body just won't respond. Same thing happens while texting, it's like I physically freeze up and can't press the send button no matter how much I want to. It's generally around more emotionally sensitive things or in regards to making certain decisions, it feels frustrating when the moment passes and I end up not being able to say what I wanted to. 

Does anyone else get this and know how to deal with it or communicate effectively when it happens?

When I socialise with people online, I feel more robotic and unreal, but irl? I kind of feel present but also, not 100%. I donno if this is actually disassociation"
"I can be an asshole when I‚Äôm dissociating, and when I come to, I hate myself. How can I begin to apologize?",10,lefwi9,7,"Moreso, I hate the kind of person I see myself as, as others do. It got pretty bad throughout most of 2020 being laid off early into the pandemic. A little off topic here ‚Äî I smoked marijuana for a while to do two things: 1) Mask my dissociation under the guise of being high, and 2) learn to control my feelings during that time. It definitely acted as a mood-leveler; it helped me approach situations with others more thoughtfully, with more empathy, and I can confidently say I‚Äôve retained some of my own self-coaching while under the influence. One downside however, was that I did unfortunately become dependent on it for its usefulness in mediating arguments ‚Äî something I wished to avoid when picking it up for having avoided the prescribed Xanax and the like. I couldn‚Äôt go hours (much less days) without smoking.

Sorry for that. Getting back on topic...

As I haven‚Äôt smoked in over 2 months now, I‚Äôm finding dissociation harder to cope with; arguments occur more frequently and often it‚Äôs not until it‚Äôs too late that I realize I‚Äôve hurt someone. How can I begin to explain the whirlwind/haziness of this disorder and prove that I‚Äôm not cognizent, that I hate myself during these periods just as much as they do?"
Does it sound like I‚Äôm dissociating?,8,le2clr,15,"I have a hard time telling if my experience is actual dissociation or not, so I‚Äôll just describe what I do and maybe y‚Äôall can help me. 
So a few things. I space out a lot and kind of do stuff on autopilot, like I‚Äôll be playing a game or something and I‚Äôll realize that I‚Äôm not really consciously focusing on what I‚Äôm doing and just kinda doing it automatically. I do this with talking too, I regularly trail off into nowhere when I‚Äôm talking because, idk I guess I‚Äôm not really paying attention to the things I‚Äôm saying and I‚Äôm not 100% ‚Äúthere‚Äù if that makes sense. People will ask me things and I‚Äôll give an automatic response, like yes or no, but then I‚Äôll realize that that‚Äôs the wrong answer and correct myself. I‚Äôm also super forgetful, and I regularly forget whether I‚Äôve done things or not, and I assume maybe I spaced out when I was doing it and can‚Äôt remember what happened or something."

Is this Dissociation? Can anybody tell what is this?,2,ldytk2,2," 

It all started Monday, when my cat accidentally scratched my hand while I was washing her, it's a pretty shallow cut but it bled a little, I washed it off afterwards and put some alcohol into it.

After that, I started panicking that I might have Rabies, and I started being paranoid about it, for hours and hours, I researched things about rabies, and even though the data contradicts what I am thinking what I have, I just can't stop worrying and be anxious about it.

I became more aware of my body sensations, especially my saliva inside my mouth, and I swallow a lot and thinking I am experiencing salavation, which is a rabies symptom, even though it's just my anxiety.

After that 2 days of being paranoid about rabies, my anxiety subsided, after learning that even though my cat is still unvaccinated, she is not showing any symptoms for a month now and I've been scratched by her several times last month and my sister too nothing happened, so I am pretty sure the cat doesn't have rabies.

After that I worried that I might have tetanus, but then the anxiety subsided quickly.

I've been diagnosed with depression and OCD but currently, I'm not getting any treatment right now because of COVID regulations here in my country.

That night, while I am watching a YouTube video, I felt sleepy, I think it's caused by depression, and slept after that, when I woke up, I felt weird, I felt numb, like I don't feel depressed, stressed, anxious, happy, sad, anything, I feel numb emotionally.

I noticed that I don't feel that tired too, even I've done something really energy demanding, I can feel physical sensations, but emotions, there's just nothingness, even music feels nothing to me now.

I can still laugh, but I feel nothing, I don't now what's causing this.

I feel a vague mild aching on the rear left side of my head, and it can be prompted by me swallowing saliva, but sometimes it appears and then goes away and comes back again. And it's a little harder for me to think now.

I've been like this for 2 days now, I am pretty worried it might be some kind of nerve damage or brain damage whatsoever, can't go to the doctor right now because of COVID, I need to wait 1 month more for me to be able to get help, anyone felt like this before, anyone have a clue what's the culprit of this or whatever this is?"
Woah?? Advice or any opinions?,3,ldt6rs,5,"I had a really bizarre experience tonight that just freaked me out. I've been struggling with dissociation for a while now and its been getting more difficult to manage as of recent. Things have been incredibly stressful and I've been having to relay a lot of trauma back to my therapist ( being current as well past issues ).  What happened kind of scared me and now I'm just on edge about things, I have a therapist and I'm not going to go off self diagnosing and making assumptions of what I possibly might have but has anybody else experienced just feeling as if you just were observing from over your own shoulder as you just begin to go off and do things? It was weird, it felt like I genuinely wasn't in control but at the same time was, I just really didn't feel like I was there and was just watching somebody else do things I was supposed to be doing. But at the same time I felt like I was that person even though they definitely weren't behaving or thinking like me? I apologize for the format and possible incoherent ramblings, I'm just exhausted and confused. I'll probably delete this after a bit if I look back to it and see that I just sound ridiculous"
Some conclusions,19,ldc39o,1,"Things I‚Äôve realized in the past few months
- detached states can provide security in times of stress and that‚Äôs enough to use it when needed
- there are a lot of complicated feelings around wanting to hide and the pull to be seen, even if a little
- I miss the people I love
- I wish I could love better
- isolation can be the trigger
- isolation needs to be reimagine
- I wish I knew how to better

Hi A Free Guided meditation video to heal from trauma.,1,lcjtke,0,
Looking for advice and/or a buddy <3,2,lbhuol,1,"Hello my foggy friends,

I became aware about 4 months ago about my dissociation. I am undiagnosed as of right now (finally going to a psychiatrist soon though, yay!!) so I am not aware of how split my mind really is but I have found 3 people in my head so far, although I can sense more, and communicated at least a little with each of them.

My therapist has been encouraging me to communicate more with my parts, but I have difficulty reaching them sometimes and I have a lot of amnesia when it comes to my inner world and anything else happening in my head.
She makes it sound so easy, like just close your eyes and imagine them and they will appear and you can talk to them, but it doesn't always work like that for me and it's making me feel like I'm faking...

I was wondering if anyone would be willing to give me tips on starting out with internal communication? As far as I know, my parts only take over my body in times of extreme stress and mostly stay in my mind or act through passive influence so external communication won't do much.

I guess I'm just hoping to connect with someone who has been through similar stuff who can give me advice that I cannot find online (I've been searching...) and share experiences with :) 

DM me if you'd like to talk   ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£üíï"
So I need to ask something,3,lbf1g6,3,"I‚Äôm not diagnosed, but I figure this might be a good place to find out whether or not I should probably go see someone? 

Every once and a while, maybe five or six times a week, I feel distanced. For hours at a time. It‚Äôs a strange feeling. Like if I was watching my eyes doing the things I do. 

So I‚Äôm expected to operate heavy machinery at my job, and I‚Äôve never gotten into an incident where someone gets hurt. But should I be worried? Like I think about it in the moment, how I feel the way I feel, and I feel reckless. 

I feel like there‚Äôs no consequences to what I‚Äôm doing, like it‚Äôs all some kind of game. 

So if anyone has any words to help me out here, that would be much appreciated."

Delete if not allowed (TW: i think?),3,lb4any,2,"I hope this isnt triggering for anyone at all, I dissociate a lot, i feel safer when i do, i live in a bad house with toxic abusive people so when i do i feel free, sometimes i feel like when im not dissociated i feel ""trapped"" in this 'reality' i guess, and i panic, everything feels too real and i want to go back to my comfort but i dont even know how to do it on demand it just happens, so I guess my question is, how does one dissociate on demand? as ive said ive been in that state a lot but its like whenever i want to be in it i cant, again sorry if this is not allowed"
"First time posting, not sure if what I‚Äôm experiencing is dissociation or what. Helpful feedback encouraged :)",13,lajwji,2,"So here we go, all throughout my life I‚Äôve occasionally experienced very strong surges of what I now know is dissociation, specifically derealization I‚Äôd say, but also very strongly depersonalization. It wasn‚Äôt something that would happen very often, but it was prevalent. When it happened it always felt very uneasy and also very depressed, but not sad depressed, it just felt very empty and unreal. I guess the feeling was similar to being in the middle of nowhere all alone and having your stomach dropping.

 A specific incident I remember very clearly was when I was visiting my brother. He lived near a rec center so we went to the pool there and would swim, sit in the sauna, ETC. it was always a very good experience and I always had a ton of fun and I wasn‚Äôt stressed or anxious about anything. And all I remember was the second we left I got a super strong feeling of dissociation, I barely even remembered where I was and such and I tried my best to explain it but I couldn‚Äôt, and I still really can‚Äôt, the best explanation that I have is that it feels like I‚Äôm in a dream.

So this hasn‚Äôt been an issue ever really and it was just something that occasionally happened but recently it‚Äôs been happening more often. Like weeks at a time, I have recently started smoking weed, so I‚Äôm pretty positive that has something to do with it, but I only experience this once I‚Äôm sober, so I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it. It‚Äôs not interfering with my daily life too bad except for mild discomfort and unease, but i guess it does worry me a little bit. 

I‚Äôm not really looking for a cure or anything, I just kinda wanted to put this out here and get some input on to what this may be, and sort of get it off my chest. Any input or comment is appreciated, thanks."
Anyone Else?,5,lanuzv,3,"Howdy! I've noticed a few behaviors in myself during instances over the past few days, and I just wanted to see if anyone experiences these too:

&#x200B;

1) During periods of ""going past the limit"" emotionally, I think of therapy and attempt to talk myself into finding a therapist again. During my spirals of thoughts, I'll imagine a therapy talk session between myself and my inner-voice with my inner voice as the therapist, until I eventually calm down and don't think I need therapy afterwards. (I can't seem to talk myself into therapy; one voice really wants/needs it, and the other refuses to believe it)

&#x200B;

2) Also during periods of ""going past the limit"" emotionally, or during dissociative periods, my mind will play me music. This is usually my current repeat-song, and stays in my head until I calm down. 

&#x200B;

Comment if you experience either of the above, or similar :)

First Derealization Episode?,12,la9o8e,1,"I'm sorry if I misuse terms, this is all new to me.

I have PTSD, panic and generalized anxiety disorders.  I'm no stranger to dissociation but last week something different happened, and I am honestly terrified.

I've been really stressed lately, I won't bore you with the details, but I was driving home and it hit me like a ton of bricks -- nothing was real, and I was completely separated from control of my body.  I kept driving as normal, but on the inside I was horrified (compounded by the fact that I had my dog in the car with me, who is my pride and joy).  Thankfully we were close to home and we arrived safely just via muscle memory, I guess.  As I drove up my long driveway I wondered where we were and why we were there (I've lived here over a year).

Then came another issue: I had no idea how to get out of the car.  It didn't occur to me that I could just open the door and get out; I have no idea how long I spent just sitting there in a haze with my dog whining to get out.

Finally, through the haze I gained some sense of control and very slowly opened the door, let my dog out and went inside.  I sat inside for a long time too, wrestling and trying to figure out what had happened and why; once I became more myself I was terrified that it might happen again and cried just from the memory of it. 

Perhaps the scariest thing: I resolved not to drive until I was more myself, scared that in my derealization or whatever it was I could hurt myself or someone else with my car.  I argued this with myself, remembering that I was going to go ride my horse later that afternoon so I should go.  I didn't *hear* the voice physically so much as hear it like you hear an internal monologue, but something said, ""why would you care? There's nothing particularly special about horses.  Forget about them."" And my entire life I've been devoted to horses, this is very much 100% not me. (Yes, horsegirl that's me)

Since then I've been very dissociated.

This is all very, very disturbing for me.  My panic attacks already make it difficult for me to lead a normal life and hold down any kind of work, but if this is going to be more regular for me I don't know what I'll do.  Am I safe when I have these episodes? Please, if anyone can offer words of comfort I'm really worried."
"Disoriented, needing help",1,lapdbk,12,"I'm breaking down. I'm at a stressful point in my life right now and it's not been good for me. I've had these moments where I go from crying to fine within a second, the emotion feeling stuck in the back, no longer feeling like mine, the thoughts associated with it feel quiet and hard to make out. I've had that for as long as I remember, but recently it's gotten so much worse. I go from panicked, to calm, to having a flashback, to just being frustrated, all after just a moment of zoning out. When there's this rapid cycling, nothing around me feels like mine, my memories don't feel like mine, and I get partial amnesia between these parts, enough that I'd not be able to speak to any of the thoughts or feelings if I hadn't been journaling some of them as it all happened.

Had a bit of a swap just then so separating this out, bit calmer now though I can see that won't last. I'm not going to continue with the smaller details given venting isn't what I want to do here (despite that being exactly what I was just doing, I guess) but I'm still pretty confused and disoriented about all this.

Anyone know  what might be going on? Or how to have this stop? I have a therapy appointment later in the week but this has been keeping me from a lot of important things.  


Edit: The panicked part wanted to mention how reading back over any of the other part's feelings also doesn't feel like it's something that came from them. Realizing myself how weird it is that I'm referring to these separately from myself, I don't think I'd have done that in the past when it's been an issue but it's just so pervasive atm? idk"

Depersonalization Success Story & DPDR Success Story: How Jay Has Won Social Anxiety & Depersonalization,3,l997np,0,"Seeing that so many people talk about negative stuff, symptoms left and right and negative stories, here's some inspiration from someone who has actually overcome dpdr and anxiety ü•∞

Jay had dpdr/dissociation and anxiety, in particular social anxiety and derealization. After our hypnosis & coaching sessions he feels much more confident, way calmer, ""connected to planet Earth"" as he likes to say, much more clear headed, finally feeling emotions and sensations in ""real time"", feeling connected to his real emotions, being much more present end enjoying the moment, finally moving on with his life without worrying how dissociation and anxiety will interfere. üòå

Not only has he solved these core problems, but he has learned core skills in how to manage his emotions and how his mind works so he will not put himself in the same situation ever again (very powerful).

He has faced himself, and now he is here sharing his incredible transformation and change free from unnecessary overthinking, anxiety, dissociation, brain fog and stress and pursuing his passion in music and other creative interests. üòÅ

Jay #1 piece of advice: Stop obsessing over the symptoms and thoughts, the real problem is much simpler than you think, it's always some kind of emotion!

"i think I'm constantly dissociating but im not sure, any input?",16,l8e2tm,20,"sorry for formatting, am on mobile 

to elaborate: i have all of the other symptoms; 
‚Ä¢ life feels like a haze, like a dream; and when i realize it it comes crashing down on me that i'm constantly going thru the motions. 
‚Ä¢ i don't feel alive at all, and i have a lot of trouble remembering things about myself + my memories. 
‚Ä¢ i've had trauma in my childhood but also struggle w identifying it as trauma bc i'd rather put on a happy face to cope :/

i'm unsure if it's dissociation because i don't hear any voices in my head. i'm 95% sure this is cuz of dissociation and cuz if i did, i'd be a hell of a lot worse all the time... BUT idk if it's jus how i am or if it's a rarer symptom :(:( i did research online but couldn't find much about it. 

TL;DR: unsure if i actually am dissociating constantly bc IDK if having constant silence in your mind (not having any internal dialogue) is a symptom."
Nothing feels like me,7,l8ca45,6,"None of my memories feel like mine. Looking back on almost any experience that isn't actively happening in the moment feels strange and difficult to relate to, and the memories themselves are reduced to the same detail as if I was just told by someone what had happened instead of having experimented it myself. Sometimes I'll feel a small ""blip"" where I zone out for a small moment and suddenly everything I was doing moments before feels foggy and distant, like a day had passed by in a second, and I often have to reorient myself to what I was doing afterwards. I can go from a full-blown panic attack to calm and focused on self-care after one of those blips Memories feel like they rotate, I'll forget and then remember again several times over with the same information, from basic details to months or years of experiences at a time..

There's a lot more I could add on, but to keep it short-
Is this normal with dissociation? Does anyone know how to improve memory associated with these issues, or establish any cohesive sense of self?"
Dissociation?,2,l826q3,1,"So last night I had this weird panic/anxiety attack where I was getting loads of shimmering lights in my field of vision. Also my hearing turned into something else. Like everything I was hearing sounded like it was coming through a 1950s radio.

I think I am almost constantly dissociated?,48,l76wqi,13,"I tried to think about the last time I felt real and normal.

Now I feel painfully fake and disconnected from myself and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. But it‚Äôs okay, cause I‚Äôll probably just forget about this soon."
inability to feel affection/bond properly because of dissociation?,23,l7brh6,2,"I've had this weird problem that I'm pretty sure is a kind of dissociation, maybe dissociative amnesia. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem.

It happens with most relationships in my life, but it's particularly bad with my s/o. A lot of the time, I feel strangely detached from him in a lot of ways. I don't feel emotion from anything he says or does. He'll be hugging/kissing me or whatever, but I feel like I'm hugging a lump of nothing, like he's not a person. Sometimes he'll be with me and I feel like he's imaginary, like he's not there at all. Most of the time when he says affectionate things like ""I love you"" they just fly over my head...they have no meaning. Often, I'll also feel like I've forgotten who he is...I don't *actually* forget, but memories feel hazy. I look at him, but I don't see anything familiar. Since I don't feel any affection or familiarity from him, I start to forget the things I like about him and why I'm with him. I also don't feel my own affection for him as strongly because he feels so unreal.

As you might imagine, this makes being in a relationship really difficult. I feel like I can't be a proper loving girlfriend this way if I can't feel affection for or from him half the time. It's like I'm a robot who can't feel affection. This is also hard in friendships and with family members, albeit to a lesser degree.

I've had this issue since I started having ptsd so it's probably from that. It's gotten worse recently, though. Anyway, I'm really curious if anyone else goes through a similar thing or has any insight into this."
Is it weird that I kind of miss my alters now that I‚Äôm integrating?,26,l708b2,11,
"I'm slipping away, very slowly.",28,l6ksuu,13,"I think I'm just slowly losing my grip on reality and my consciousness. It's happening slowly, but it's there.

I don't know what to do about this though. It's like I'm fighting an infection I don't know how to treat. My whole sense of self is being questioned, and often I don't know what I'm doing or how my body is able to do the things it does when I'm not really focused.

I'm really scared. The fact that I have not-alters (voices that until I get a diagnosis or a doctor saying they are actually alters I will not acknowledge as people) going on in here saying a bunch of stuff and just switching between themselves in the co-pilot seat and putting thoughts in the stream of thoughts doesn't help. I don't know what they are. I don't know what's going on with me. I don't know why I'm finding them at this time of my life. I don't know if they're real or just my imagination. I don't know what's going on. I wish someone just had the answer.

My only lead is that it's dissociation, but it's not tied to a disorder yet. But I'm just scared that one day I'm going to lose complete control of myself and just be lost, watching my life go by as someone in the co-pilot seat instead of someone who should be in the pilot's seat. Or worse, I could be put in coach and not be able to see myself doing things and just black out. Completely disconnect from reality.

I don't want that to happen though, but I'm so scared. I can't really do anything concrete with my therapist until we get a diagnosis from the psychiatrist, but I don't know when that's going to happen, if it'll happen at all.

I could use some help right now. I don't think I have anyone else to turn to. I don't know if I'm dissociating or not. I probably am."
Out of Sight Out of Mind - Feel Like People Don't Exist When I'm Not with Them,19,l645qo,8,"TL;DR
People don't feel real to me when I can't physically be with them, do you experience this too? What do you do to cope?

I have only very recently identified my dissociation for what it is. It was relieving when I started therapy a couple months ago.

I have been experiencing dissociation for a few years at least, the biggest contributing factor I've identified so far is the stressful event of my mom moving. Usually, when you go to college, you leave home and home doesn't leave you. My sophomore year, my mom moved from New England to the Southwest U.S.. I was forced to give up my pets, and half the stuff we owned, and then I was effectively homeless for the rest of my undergrad program.

On her travels she was often not reachable because of cell phone signal, and she had hardly done any planning so she was sleeping at truck stops and random places along the way. I would often worry she would die or get hurt and I wouldn't have any way to know because I couldn't reach her.

I reached a point where I realized I was not actively missing/worrying about her anymore because she just didn't feel real to me. I told her this once and she got really upset, which I don't blame her. But she didn't feel real, even if we did manage to talk on the phone she was just a voice in a box, and I felt no connection to her the way I had before she left.

I've had similar feelings when I was in a long distance relationship in college, and again in my current relationship when we were separated because of quarantine.

I used to try a writing exercise where I would write down facts about my life, who I was and who was important to me and involved in my life, but it didn't really stick. I knew the information to be true but just couldn't feel the truth of it.

With therapy I have learned some grounding techniques and for me I'm a super physical/tactile person. To really engage with something I need to touch things, and smell things. I need a lot of sensory stimulation to be present fully which is obviously not possible on phone calls and when there is distance. 

My current partner who I see fairly regularly still feels less real, and he has been kind enough to leave a peace of his clothing with me to cuddle/smell to feel more connected to him.

So, after reading, I wonder if you've had a similar experience? Are there other coping mechanisms that work for you? Especially things you do in public ( I can't exactly whip out a pair of men's underwear in the middle of the grocery store üò≠).a

I'm so grateful to be able to identify this experience and to have this lovely community to be a part of :)

Stay well everyone!"
"I found a new voice today, and it was scary.",9,l5wpq6,4,"So usually with these bouts of dissociation I also get these voices, too. Well, I call them voices, they mainly communicate with thought insertion. I think. I don't know.

Anyway, today I started dissociating and I found a new voice. She was very angry. It just felt like I didn't want to be around her. She kept saying stuff that freaked me out and whenever someone else walked by she would say something mean about them. Since she's just in my head nobody hears them, but it's tiring to have to listen to her.

So I gave it a few hours and now I feel like she's receded to some other part of my mind. I knew there was something (someone?) that was responsible for the anger I felt at times and the bad thoughts directed at me, and I think I found the source. So finding her made it easier for me to identify whenever she acts up in the future, so that's one positive thing. But it was so scary finding her. I was in the thick of dissociation, and I was struggling with whether or not any of this was real. If the voices were real, if anything I was experiencing was real. It was terrible.

I feel like I'm faking it. I really, really do. I don't even know what these voices are. I don't have any kind of dissociative diagnosis yet, so I can't really say they're alters or anything, but *they feel so real for it to be fake!*

But how do I know! I could be imagining symptoms for all I know! Well, that, and I honestly can't remember anything traumatic enough for me to warrant having alters, anyway. Well, nothing I can remember, but then there's memory repression and bleh.

I don't know, sometimes I feel like I'm slipping away more and more each day. Like I'm on a mountain that's constantly being rained on and I keep slipping down. Or like I fell out of a boat and into the ocean and I'm flailing, trying to get back on board.

I don't know what's going on. I just want to get this out there to know I'm not making this up, because I feel like it's getting worse and worse as I keep going. It's also making my urges to self harm go up, too, but I haven't done anything like that yet. I don't know how many voices I'm going to find. So far I've got like three, but I don't know if that's enough for anything.

I don't want to think about this. I just want to leave the voices behind and get to work on getting a proper diagnosis. Except seeing a psychologist is more expensive than the psychiatrist I'm currently seeing, so I *have* to put up with these bouts of dissociation and voices until the doctor reaches a diagnosis (if they even hand those out) and we can start working towards something. All I need is a doctor to say ""You have X,"" and then I'll be able to get to work on treatment without feeling like I'm scaring my therapist with all of the messages I'm sending out of fear and confusion of these voices.

I need help, but it's too expensive."
I feel like I'm constantly looking for dissociation symptoms vs actually having dissociation.,44,l5mu77,10,"If I don't think about dissociating then I'm good and it's like I never had it but if I have a random thought about dissociation then I start to actively look for symptoms of depersonalization/derealization. This then takes my focus off of what I'm doing and I start obsessing about it. My thoughts start getting scrambled(feel like I'm going crazy) but I can also think clearly if I wanted to. When I look in the mirror I don't feel a sense of detachment other than me obsessing over looking for the detachment feeling. When I look around everything looks real but I don't feel very present because of this obsession. I'm kind of a hypochondriac so whenever something happens I obsess about it until I find a solution, obviously with DPDR there is no ""solution"" per se so when it goes away I'm constantly thinking about it and don't really know if it comes back or if I'm just overthinking it. Does anyone else have this issue? Maybe this is OCD? I'm going to see a therapist because it's starting to get unbearable."
I made up a grounding technique for myself after watching the Disney movie Soul that I wanted to share,7,l5u776,1,"The movie had a lot of ‚Äúthis is all you need to be happy in life‚Äù type things in it.
But I took away from it is, I need to stop being in life and start seeing in life.

Now instead of looking at what I‚Äôm saying I am seeing what I look at. Little confusing and I hope I‚Äôm wording it right but pretty much I‚Äôm paying more attention to details to the smaller every day things that‚Äôs around me, even looking at my phone and looking at the edges of it and the color. Just noticing the every day things in life again. 

I read earlier in the day that one thought about happiness is that we get to use to the every day things around us. It said think of an item that you really wanted and think how long it took for you to get tired of it. 
So tying that into the movie I think that just re-seeing all the things around you like new again can help with grounding"
Recently Discovered I have a Dissociative Disorder,3,l5qekx,6,"So as of this past year, I started having regular reoccurrences of persistent vertigo where I felt like the world was spinning and I was consciously spinning with it. I thought this feeling was triggered by over consumption of caffeine intake or drug induced from THC or adderall... I quickly stopped consuming caffeine and any other stimulates throughout the year. As I began focusing more on what I was consuming to gain some control over my psyche, my anxiety symptoms got worse and I started feeling really strange, randomly throughout parts of the day/night. Sometimes this feeling would last a couple of minutes but then it would happen for longer periods of time, like hours at a time. It would be the most bizarre sensation of feeling like I was upside down. It is very hard to describe how I felt with language but I will try my best. I would begin to just feel very strange. I was perfectly aware of my existence and the strange feeling of the world being this foreign land/place but I would be so far up in my own head thinking that I felt like some sort of alien that I couldn‚Äôt think straight. These events of feeling detached would trigger massive anxiety attacks and I would just want to run and hide under the covers of my bed. I have history of adolescent verbal abuse on top of years of benzodiazepine drug dependency. I have spoken with my therapist about it and we have come up with ways to help alleviate my dissociative symptoms when they happen. But there is really no cure for it is there?"

I read that you can feel emotionally disconnected from family et al. I've felt completely disconnected from mine my whole life. I know I should love them, but it's just not there. Maybe rarely, but I often find myself wondering how to love them or connect emotionally. Does anyone have any advice?"

Dpdr from acid,3,l4zu3m,3,"This is my first time really sharing my story with anyone because I‚Äôve just been going through this alone since I feel like my friends/family doesn‚Äôt understand and I have no insurance to get any other help. It all started back in September when a close friend of mine at the time had offered me acid. This was the first and only time I‚Äôve taken it. When the person explained it to me she basically said it was a weed high (it clearly was nothing like that) on top of the acid tab she wanted to smoke weed in which I agreed because I trusted her, I‚Äôm aware I should‚Äôve done my own research first. Fast forward the beginning of the trip was good then for some reason when I heard auditory hallucinations it lead me to an instant panic attack I‚Äôve never had a panic attack before that but in the moment I thought I was going to die and thought I was going crazy. After that I managed to calm myself down and enjoyed the rest of the trip after that everything seemed to go back to normal until I tried to smoke weed again and had an instant panic attack just off one hit and that was the first time I really felt any dpdr but then it went away shortly after when I went for a walk and managed to calm myself down but then that‚Äôs when my health anxiety started because I was scared I have brain damage from the acid or a tumor or something. I would have panic attacks more frequently due to me worrying about my health but the dpdr didn‚Äôt go away. I went to Colorado in December and another friend of mine wanted to smoke so we did even tho I still had dpdr I tried to push through it, but then we did an edible and it instantly felt like an acid trip and I had another panic attack I felt disconnected from reality and I haven‚Äôt been the same since then. It‚Äôs been almost 2 months since I‚Äôve been sober . I‚Äôve went to the hospital numerous times and they said they couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with me. I feel like I‚Äôm dreaming when I‚Äôm awake, I feel disconnected from reality it feels like I‚Äôm living in a movie or tv show, my friends & family, I keep having existential thoughts that I never had before and what scares me the most is I don‚Äôt remember what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feels like. I just feel very uncomfortable and overwhelmed. I‚Äôm so scared that the acid changed my perception of life forever and that I‚Äôll never go back to how I was before it was just one time üòî Please any advice is greatly appreciated."
"Anyone feel like their life isn't ""real"" enough?",31,l4jggo,6,"I struggle a lot with feeling inhuman or as if my life isn't ""real"" and my existence isn't on par with regular human beings. Like there's huge disconnect, like there's people and then there's *me.*"
Dissociating back to different memories?,1,l51zbn,0,"Anyone with similar experiences? Tldr at bottom

I've taken snapshots of moments since I was small. It started with me reverently thinking ""wow, I'm going to look back on this moment and remember it"" when I was at show and tell in third grade. I then started ""saving"" these moments intentionally, cataloging them in my head. Some get lost, aren't as valued, but others I go back to regularly. One I particularly enjoy is sitting on an outcropping on a mountain side. When I was there I tried to memorize as much as possible about that moment: the wind, the chatter of hikers and their kids behind me, the feel of rock underneath me, how my back hurt from carrying my pack, how the air felt in my lungs. Every bit. I have found while the visual is important, it's the little details that pull it all together.

So, by ""go back"" to a moment, what I'm really doing is recalling all those feelings and dissociating. I've gotten to the point where it feels like those moments where you're half stuck in a dream and half awake, you're still interacting and participating with the dream but with some nigling that you're actually conscious. It feels more real sometimes but it's easy to get pulled out of it. Like, I know I'm standing there peeling onions or something, but my mind is a year and a world away in the mountains.

Sometimes I'll react to stimuli that's in my memory like it's happening in real time. I'll say things out loud, move my body, ect. ""Stop! Don't do that"" or try to stop something from falling for example. At that point it kind of shocks me out of it when I'm around other people, I get self conscious that they'll think I'm weird and try my best not to talk outloud anymore.

I have trouble with staying in reality, I really like going back and reliving moments. It's probably not the best but it definitely isn't the worst coping mechanism I could have. I can't handle normal reality so I checkout and do my own thing, but it's gotten worse over the years, to where if I'm not actively checking out of reality I get an anxiety attack. 

Anyway, anyone with similar dissociating habits where they go back to a moment of their life of their choosing?

Tldr: I memorize moments in time so I can dissociate and ""go back"" to them and it feels real enough that I react to it as if it's happening again. Do you do this too? Is it common?"

I struggle with derealization and it gets soooo scary sometimes. I look at my family and feel like I'm imagining it all. None of this is real. I can't feel my body. I self harm to make it stop, but it doesn't work. Need to cry but tears won't come. Feels like I'm losing touch with reality."
My vision became 20/20 for about 30 minutes in the 4th grade. Could it be conversion disorder?,3,l4gl84,5,"I have no idea where to post this considering the main subreddit for conversion disorder is pretty dead. Functional neurological disorder is another name for it, but I don't tend to see any real vision issues when searching it up by that term. Sorry if this is irrelevant but I have no idea where to actually get a meaningful response. I spoke about this to my therapist, but she couldn't really respond because she doesn't know anything about it.

EDIT: Nevermind, I just read the description of the sub lol.

In the 4th grade, something strange was happening. Whenever I would try to think about something, I kept on getting a ton of information from what usually occurs before thoughts. Basically, I was witnessing some kind of pre-processed brain information that I couldn't really make sense of. Even though it seems meaningless to me, for some reason I started to think that I could fix my vision. I couldn't really get an actual grasp on why I thought this and it was extremely frustrating. I was extremely confused about how to even do anything because I didn't understand my lower level mental functions. This still happens today, but if I'm functioning well I can ignore it.

One time, when the teacher was calling on the students to read what was on the board, she asked me to read a few sentences. I couldn't actually see what was on the board, so I started panicking. By panicking, I mean I was crying and hyperventilating. I was able to convert this panic into concentration and in some way I was able to fix my vision. I'm not sure exactly how I did it, but I'm guessing that I ended up interacting with pre-processed brain information in some meaningful way. There was a tiny little blip that I think that I noticed where I kind of understood what was going on but in a very vague, mostly unconscious way.

While I was crying, there were these distortions in my vision. I can't tell if it was just my brain or if it was due to the water in my eyes or both. After they cleared up, I could see in 20/20 and I was so fucking relieved. I read the board out loud and class went on. I had anxiety/panic attacks every week where I would end up crying and hyperventilating so it was seen as pretty normal.

After that happened, I told myself to ALWAYS remember this. I kept on telling myself that this literally happened. I kept on telling myself that this weird sort of excessive introspection CAN actually be accurate and to never listen to anyone who tells me otherwise. I would take note of any possible alterations I made when remembering this memory when I first noticed/learned that it happened. I realize that it could have been a dream, but I've never had a dream that is completely realistic. Everything is telling me that this memory happened in real life.

If anyone knows of any similar stories or any information at all, then please let me know. If anyone knows if it's technically possible for the water from my tears to distort the vision in such a way to make it 20/20 for me, then please let me know. Even if that is possible, I doubt that it would be able to hold for 30 minutes or that it would happen right when I'm trying to alter pre-processed visual information in order to see properly.

Thanks!"

One time my friend's arms started looking like ""things"" instead of ""arms"" (if that makes sense). This has only happened to me a few times and they were in the course of a week or two. However, a few months ago I had a similar experience where I woke up in the middle of the night and everything felt and looked foreign to me and when I would focus on an object it would start to float.

Intense episode... thoughts?,2,l40ig0,3,"(TW if you don‚Äôt like reading descriptions of mental health scenarios)

I had a fairly intense dissociative episode the other day... more intense than I can remember experiencing so far. But there are a couple of factors that make me wonder if maybe it was simply a physical issue with mental side effects... If that doesn‚Äôt make sense, it will in a moment.

I had been looking at houses to rent with a friend for most of the morning. Before meeting up with them I had some coffee, then we got coffee together, so I was decently caffeinated. I hadn‚Äôt eaten prior to either coffee. During the house hunt my anxiety was proving to be an obstacle. Likely brought on by the caffeine, but legitimate nonetheless given the struggle we were having with finding a house. On my drive home my dissociation hit hard. I felt completely removed from myself to the point of needing to strain to focus on driving safely. When I got home, I had to continuously reality check my surroundings and remind myself I was alone in my own apartment. (This part I think was a result of maintaining social normalcy all morning in front of my friend. But I‚Äôve never experienced it to this intensity before.)

I could talk myself in circles about this, but that‚Äôs pretty much the extent of my episode. Do you guys think I was just over caffeinated and underfed? Or is this a new development in my dissociation that I need to keep tabs on? This was the very first time it‚Äôs ever affected my ability to function. 

Thanks for reading."

"Veteran at Dissociation, started with DID at 10, got into NMDA antags later in life -- OPINIONS?",1,l3hpmq,0," Hi all,

After extensive abuse of a huge array of known, and unknown RC dissociatives, I'm looking for other peoples' subjective experiences on it Dissociatives in general. Also a HEAVY benzo user for over half a decade now.

\--

I was predisposed to schizophrenia, and I'm sure using DXM and Disso's made helped develop that with more of a personality

I started my journey with alcohol, nicotine, weed, but DXM is what led me down ""the rabbit hole"", so to speak.

I'm incredibly lucky, and have minimal PHYSICAL side effects from disso abuse; bladder and brain issues, but more psychological than physiological-- I have GI issues, nausea, and sinus issues that I'm sure correlate with DXM abuse for GI, and K for sinus/cramping issues respectively. :

I've noticed, the ""Magic"" is often talked about regarding NMDA antags, and freq. of use, and frankly, I'm starting to believe the ""Magic"", is just your brain experiencing dissociation, along with psychedelia, for as long as the dissociation is ""magical"" to the user itself.

if its dxm or a psych-disso combo, many people have their first experiences are with an NDMA antag, combined with psychedelic properties (EG- dxm! or S+ K for UK bastards). For the first time, similar to how you notice more and more patterns with things like LSD and tryptamines, you notice the ""magic"" of the void and the ""all is one, and one is all concept"", is introduced. It's similar to how you feel the love and introspection with certain compounds, for many people, dxm not excluded, the most impactfully the first time

Fast forward 10 years, I only use Memantine and Nitrous now, as all perceived ""magic"" is gone, aside from MEDICINAL Memantine, and RECREATIONAL nitrous, to help me with serious delusions (eg. If I'm having an illogical conclusion form from an illogical source, a cartridge or two can help me ""step back"" to try and reassess my thoughts in a more logical way--

Memantine, from 2.5-50mg daily, given I keep a consistent blood level of the substance in me, I have an almost immediate improvement in symptoms that have not been cured by SSRIs, SNRIS, MSs', TCAs, Atypical antipsychotics, etc.

The only way it seems I'm able to live a life with ""less weird shit goin on"", to put it simply, I've realized the medication is an NDMA antagonist, the same type of drug that exacerbated my symptoms in the first place, just in a different setting (not using .5-3.5g of k/rcs or 300-700mgs of dxm daily, but instead, using the longest acting and shortest acting NMDA antag I could find, with either very short recreational duration, or primarily medicinal-- eg. 100 whippits p/month and 10mg Memantine average daily = +++++++ in functionality. +++++ feeling better ++++++ Quality of life, vs K/PXc/Rcs. which = ----- functionality BUT even though i was FEELING better++++++, my quality of life was-neg---)

From my research, It seems that low NMDA receptor activity seems to be an exacerbator of schizophrenia, but at the same time is the only actual class of drugs that works when treatment resistant depression like bipolar/schizo/OCD doesn't cut it.

By this logic, HARMING myself slightly in the long term due when my NMDA receptors are blocked with a moderate votage affinity substance, not something that will get me high as shit,like K, I'll generally get more things done. HOWEVER, if I try other forms of anti depressants, INCLUDING CBT, Physical Therapy, DBT, etc, and they don't work, is the best solution to a longer life.

It seems after extensive research in non physiological causes and treatments of dementia and schizophrenia, I've found both the cure, and the curse. I know that every time I antagonize my NMDA receptors, I make my illness worse, but at the same time, its the only way to progress in a way where I won't just rot and die. Any older heads with Dissociative experience and extra input would be appreciated. I don't expect to ""solve"" the answer to SPD/BPD/DID, but I wanted to contribute my experience reports, as there aren't many people in 25-35 age range that use Memantine.

It's primarily prescribed to patients with Alzheimer's, but the effectiveness in people with either an excess or deficiency regarding their NMDA receptors may find relief from this, where nothing else did. I'm trying to get off benzos and stay on Memantine, but I've been on gabaERGICS for so long, and the damage I've done to my receptors is yet to be determined, but I feel either NMDA antags/ antichol / d2 uptake inhibitors give you a sense of ""wellbeing"" and perceived increased cognition, but ultimately, is probably making the disease worse, IF YOU ARE NOT UNDER 65.

Since this med was prescribed for the elderly, long term efficacy is going to be hard to gauge, but I firmly believe that the solution for many mental problems are microdosing the problem... I recognized patterns too much, which led to an anxiety disorder, which led to many more dissociative identity disorder related symptoms, yet ironically, the only thing that's provided me any relief, is probably harming me in the long term.

Then, the question is, are THERE PLANS TO REFINE MEMANTINE for a younger audience, maybe with no COL properties, to see if NDMA, plus a perceived dopamine uptake could help TRD. Just a few thoughts, PLEASE PLEASE CORRECT ME IF YOU SEE MISTAKES OR INFORM ME IF IM MISINFORMED. I WANT TO LEARN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, AND BEING DIRECT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THAT"
Difficulty speaking when dissociating?,3,l3a59j,5,"Hi,

as a disclaimer: I am not sure if what I am experiencing is actually dissociation, since it hasn't been diagnosed, but a lot of the symptoms fit and I just wanted to check if anyone else experiences this or if I am going crazy.

A few months ago I was diagnosed with a panic disorder and I have been struggling with pretty strong panic attacks and self harm for more than six months. Before that, I also had some attacks, but a lot less frequent.

During the past four or five years I have often had situations where I don't recognise myself and get scared of looking at myself in the mirror, almost expecting the person in the mirror to attack me. I also go through phases of feellng like me, then suddenly seeing everything from an outsiders perspective and feeling like I'm floating. It feels like these different states of mind don't fit into one personality, so I don't have a cohesive sense of self. These are symptoms of dissociation that I think are pretty common.

But I also experience things that I have so far never heard anybody talking about

In some situations I feel really exhausted all of sudden, to the point where I feel like I could pass out any second. I am not able to think in coherent sentences and it feels like I lose the control over the muscles in my jaw and face. It is similar to the feeling of taking a long nap in the middle of the day and then waking up not knowing where you are and what time it is. The difference is that it feels like my body is about to give in, everything is cloudy and it feels like I haven't slept in days. I can't really say that I feel or think anything in these moments, it's just very exhausting to focus on conversation and to not space out completely. I could imagine that this is what being drunk is like or being about to have a stroke. I am often not aware of my feelings in these moments and it can happen that I notice hours later that I actually really need to use the bathroom or feel like I am starving. This can be accompanied by sudden pain in the face, head, neck and back. Sometimes I also notice that I forget what I am doing or I come back to my sense of self and don't know why I am doing what I'm doing or why I am going in a certain direction.

Another thing that I experience is quite a contrary sensation. I have episodes of being hyper-alert and having this looming sense that something really dangerous is about to happen. It's like I get sucked out of myself and my sensd of reality and I am scared of things or people around me. This can mean having a sudden feeling of being trapped, watching myself doing things and talking, but not actually having a connection to it. It can also mean that I suddenly fear that a person in the room might have the intention of killing me, raping me or at least manipulating me. 

Often I will zone out and have this weird feeling of being in a dream, or of not knowing what reality should feel like. At the same time, I know that there is something wrong with my perception. Time seems to be warped and I sometimes forget fragments of interactions.

I am not sure if any of this makes sense and there are a lot of other strange things that I experience that would be too much for this post. It might be important to mention that I have had some traumatic experiences when it comes to sexual abuse and I am in the process of uncovering more of my trauma.

I just wanted to know if this fits into the experience of dissociation, especially the part of feeling like I lose control over my ability to speak and think straight.

Thanks :)"

Anyone else just goes about their day and then they suddenly realize that they have no idea who they are?,68,l2f7el,10,"Last week I had a pretty big dissociative episode that lasted a couple of days. In fact, it was the episode that got my psychiatrist to add a note of it on my medical record, and the voices that came back with it may have helped to take it more seriously.

Anyway, now that I'm officially on the watch for any other dissociative experiences and keeping a record of them, I'm finding that it is helpful in certain situations. Good for giving it to medical professionals, and maybe just to find a group of people who can help me understand this relatively new concept.

Anyway, to the topic of this discussion.

I can't remember what exactly triggered it, but I know that I suddenly didn't feel like I was me. My name didn't mean anything to me anymore. It felt weird saying it. It was like it didn't belong to me. It was someone else's name, but it didn't really feel like my name. Looking at my reflection also was kind of weird, but not too terribly. My vision tends to drift away from my whole face and just focuses on my hair or maybe just the blood vessels in my eyes.

Anyway, I digress. I started to panic because I didn't know what was going on that made me unsure of who I was. My brain kept trying to give me a new name, but I kept rejecting it thinking that it was crazy that maybe I wasn't the person who owns this body and that I was just visiting, or that I didn't have a name to begin with and everyone just called me by the body's name.

This made me pretty insecure about myself. I've already got gaping holes in my memory, so I have no idea who I really am or what kind of person I am compared to back then. What if maybe I'm not the one who owns this body? What if I'm not who I thought I was, but a different person impersonating someone else. I was given this name and that's the only thing I knew, but for the first time in a while it didn't feel like mine.

It took me a few days, but now I'm back to normal and am no longer questioning my name or identity. Saying my name out loud didn't feel weird, and looking in the mirror wasn't so bad. I feel like I got through a difficult time, but made it out okay in the end. Granted, I still don't remember much of my past, but I'm glad the thing I do know of a certainty from it, my name, is intact. For the time being, anyway.

To note, I have not been formally diagnosed with any kind of dissociative disorder yet. My therapist says that it's just linked to anxiety, but my psychiatrist said that they were going to do further reading on dissociative disorders to see if any apply. I think. She didn't say that to me personally, but she wrote it down in my medical records, so we'll see what we find in the next few months.

This dissociative episode was noted in my log.

 ""  but I need to know this- I tried to get this answered so many times but I never did and i was thinking maybe this is a ND thing? So, I was venting to my friend on discord and I was extremely mentally stressed: i couldn't let out any of it like usual because my parents would hear me crying and question me- so i was reading somthing they said and then I kind of daydreamed for a bit and then I was like "" you're real "" In my head and then i completely forgot who i was for a split second and started being like "" No, Nooo! "" at realizing im living in this situation as I slowly remembered who I was- starting with basic things like my age and name it felt really slow but i was in a matter of a few seconds. I think at the time my brain felt tingly when this happened- after I fully remembered who I was I felt kinda slow and then afterwards I had some serious foggy brain and felt super tired and after the brain fog and feeling slow it hurt but I wasnt as stressed anymore. The only way I can describe this is my brain manually restarting like a computer so I don't have a heart attack or something. ""

Talking to the core,14,l1zbfg,4,"I had some internal communiations with insiders and what I revealed was there is heavy trauma going inside and I don't even feel it.I am so sad that I can't feel my own feelings.That I vant care for my core parts.that I cent even hug them,The front is not at all aware of what's happening inside like when I stay at home and respect only then I understand what's actually happening.while I am trying so hard to beat the help out of my enemies in the outside world the core part is crying inside and saying ""don't do that"".it was so afraid that it knows how a situation become dangerous and how to avoid them .I don't know but there is a large compartmentalization between my own selves"
I need some advice,1,l2ev7g,2,"Hi, this is my first reddit post. I mainly got on here because I knew there were people who would have experienced at least some of the things I've been experiencing. This post will be kinda long, fair warning. I've been doing some research about different forms of dissociation, and honestly, it feels like I have it all. Right now, I'm currently in a ""confused/scared"" phase. I hope someone can help me find out what's actually going on.

So as far as I can remember, I've felt weird. I was about 5 or 6, and didn't think much of it because I was just a kid. I felt sort of in a dream, or asleep. I'd be in the car and think, ""Is any of this real? Am I in a singular universe where God is testing me? All these people are here to test me?"" But I just shook it off and carried on. Now, school had always been a priority for me. I don't know why, it just has. And right around 5-6th grade, I experienced something WAY out of there. It was second semester of 5th grade, I has gotten accepted to a magnet school for middle school, I had just recently moved to get away from a bad situation, a family member had just passed, and I guess I just didn't really think about it. I'm not completely sure why I let things get to me when they've already passed, but I do. Anyway, I suddenly felt like I was above something, like instead of feeling ""rough"", I felt like I was higher than the people around me. It felt thin almost, and with school being a priority, I used this as a way to feel smart, like I was smarter than those around me. Also, I had constantly been picked on in elementary for various things and felt insecure, so this was probably a coping mechanism in disguise. Anyway, I decided that I didn't/couldn't fit in at a magnet school after attending two of them within the first six weeks, and settled for my local middle school, which was also in a different district then my elementary school, so the environment was still new. But this feeling happened in 5th grade, and I was still remembering who I was as a 5th grader, not as a whole. But then middle school arrived, I had this ""high"" complex, I was in the school I had gotten accepted to, and I was smacked in the face, mentally. Maybe it's because of the way my brain communicated with me in 5th grade, but as soon as 6th grade rolled by, I let this ""light"" feeling take over, and I was also having conflicting and intrusive thoughts. Thoughts about a great grandfather who had passed 6 years before, and I somehow morphed that into, ""I'm just now realizing he's gone."", but I remember that I was 6 years old when he died, so maybe this was my brain trying to wake me up? This is where I need somebody's help/opinion. Is because in 6th grade, I had all the thoughts that still plague my head, but I don't have the ""light"" feeling anymore and I desperately don't want to act like how I did. Instead, now, it just feels like I'm either just not there, dazed, or in a fantasy. I also believe I have Fantasy Prone Personality because since childhood, and throughout middle school, I was BIG on making myself the protagonist or love interest. I think this was used to make myself feel better about I situation I had no control over in reality/ didn't want to be there. But if anyone has ever felt what I've been feeling for the past 10-11 years, please reply. Thank you."
Dissociation and Insomnia,13,l1w9kd,3,"Anybody else with insomnia who's dissociation worsen things? We are prone to dissociation episodes and notice when they get bad again that it only makes our insomnia worse than before. I'd take our sleeping medicine for it but our mom criticizes us for not frequently taking our medicine, and I'm really not looking to deal with her berating us right now. It really makes things ten times more miserable."
head shaking during dissociation,1,l2amgd,0,"So i have dissociation and derealization problems and i've noticed whenever i see this certain type of image (the image type is like think of nostalgia core but with those black shaky marks like a photos been ruined, maybe a blacked out figure and some random eyes with no face) my head start to shake, well, better word is tremble and it triggers me. could this be linked to my dissociation?"
Treatment for dissociation that doesn't involve IFS?,1,l2abe5,2,"I've been diagnosed with OSDD and am experiencing a lot of detrimental dissociation. I spend so much time out of it that I'm finding it hard to function and achieve my goals.

However, I've previously had horrible experiences with internal family systems. Basically thinking myself as a system, ""listening to my parts"" and having compassion for ""them"" was basically what cause this dissociation to run rampant in the first place. It basically increased my dissociation and I lost weeks-months of my time just ""out of it"" and getting nothing done. I It only made the anxieties, sleepiness, forgetfulness stronger. So I've decided to stay far away.

Does anyone know of any methods that don't involve IFS?"

Derealization/depersonalization disorder is ruining my life,40,l0sjfg,16,"Hi. I would just like to vent or maybe seek some advice from people who are dealing with this because I'm going through a really rough patch in my mental health and I don't know if I can carry on like this.
I've been having pretty severe episodes of dpdr for the last 4-5 months following a really bad experience with cannabis edinles. It seems as from that time it just keeps getting worse and worse. I do get a few weeks where I barely have any symptoms to days where I cannot get out of bed.
I really want to talk about my symptoms, maybe someone can relate and reassure me because i feel so alone in this. These days I've been getting bouts of  extreme derealization and dissociation which leads me to have extreme panic attacks (I have a panic disorder). During them I completely lose my sense of self, can't even feel my body, everything and everyone feels flat and unreal. But the worst of it is always feeling like nothing really exists and never actually existed, including the world around me and myself. My memories feel fake, detached and I just keep having an intense fear that everything will just disappear or that I'm stuck feeling like this until the day I die. That's why I'm feeling so suicidal because the only escape from feeling like this is sleeping for hours on end during the day. I feel so alone in this. I don't know what to do, I am going to therapy, but everything feels so unreal that it becomes hard to tell that it's helping or not."
What is the longest dissociative episode you've experienced?,11,l0spo1,10,"Hi everyone.  Im new to this sub but not new to dissociation.  I think I've had a very severe bout of dissocation thats basically lasted half a year.  Everything went away, it felt like my personality was erased and the world wasn't real anymore and so aren't any of the people in it.  I think I'm starting to come out of it but after all thats happened, after having every single part of me change and things that once felt second nature and very familiar to me feel distant and unfamiliar... I dont know I'm having trouble even believing myself when I feel like I've had a connection again.  I have trouble letting go of the trauma.  


Have any of you experiencing something like this after a very long lasting dissociative episode?  If you have, did familiarity ever come back completely and you get back into flow again?  How long was your longest episode?    


Thanks for responding those of you that do.  It helps me a lot to hear from people who have experienced this."
Dead Names,8,l0i947,2,"I have been seeing my dead name so much recently and it‚Äôs sending me into loops. 

Someone on reddit with the name followed me, there‚Äôs people in the news with the same name. Hell, I was invited to a subreddit who‚Äôs About Me page seemed like it was written by my BIO mom whom I haven‚Äôt talked to in years. 

It sends me on these Truman Show loops, like who is trying to get my attention and why. Why the dead name. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just more popular now but it‚Äôs become too consistent within recent days. 

The name reminds me of the times before I had myself. I feel lost when reminded of what and who I was. So detached. But accepting and understanding of everything that has led up to this. 

So, who‚Äôs trying to reach me."
Anyone else freak out about being alive,76,l0453w,11,"Like, most of the time I'm just kinda here existing in a mostly unaware state but at times it's like, *holy shit I'm alive and a Real Human Person surrounded by other Real Human People* and I start freaking the fuck out."
Can menstruation worsen dissociation/depersonalization?,12,l03x8x,7,"Hi, I've been dealing with dpdr for about 3 months now and I've noticed that it really worsens before, after or during menstruation. I've had some mental health problems worsen during PMS before I developed really bad dpdr. So I'm wondering, does anyone else experience this? Every month it's like it gets somewhat better during the middle of my cycle and then suddenly gets worse during my period again."
How do I know if I‚Äôve processed an emotionally stressful event or I‚Äôm just dissociated from it?,22,kzx5xi,10,"I‚Äôve had dissociation for years, made worse my a medication I take. I feel more dissociated this year than I did this time last year. Something quite distressing happened last year in July, it induced a lot of feelings of shame and rejection, (and the incident layered on previous flashbacks). I felt myself dissociating while all those horrible emotions were coming up. I feel less able to cry now, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because this incident increased my dissociation or I‚Äôm less able to cry because I‚Äôve processed more emotions."

Is this dissociation? advice please,1,l0cosh,3,"Hello all! So Im not sure if the symptoms I've experienced on and off are dissociation. My therapist hasn't really given me an answer and she just says its ""brain fog"" induced by anxiety. I have severe generalized anxiety and health anxiety, im not sure if its important. Im gonna try to vocalize how I feel and then will someone let me know if they think this is dissociation or just something else please? I like to understand and know what Im feeling that's why im asking.

So on and off for years, usually when Im under extreme stress I feel like I'm high...like I've smoked weed and I feel detached and just not really in reality. Sometimes I feel like I don't even look like myself and its very strange. I feel just like high... and detached from the world around me. When I've had this it lasts for like a month or two and the subsides. I feel spacey and sometimes things don't look real, like I'll be outside and something just seems off about how the world looks. There's just something off about how the world looks, I don't know how to explain it but its off. It's a lack of focus and like a weird quiet in my brain. Sometimes my vision is involved and it feels like shaky. 

From everyone's own experiences does this sound like dissociation or anxiety induced dissociation? I'm really not sure and im not getting answers from a professional."
Does anyone else experience this?,2,l086iz,1,"I'll get to the point - does anyone else start to dissociate (or at the very least feel like they're about to) whenever they hear fan theories for any media along the lines of ""It was all a dream"" or ""The whole story was just the characters playing pretend""? Even if it's just people talking about fictional characters it makes me feel like it's applying to my life too, which is kind of ridiculous. I dunno, does this happen to anyone else?"
First time in a while,6,kzz24f,1,"Last night starting at around 7:30pm I did nothing but stare at the ceiling in bed until I fell asleep at around 4am, and even then I kept waking up. I did get some sleep before that time thankfully, maybe a couple hours broken up between 8 and midnight, I don‚Äôt really know, but for the most part it was just staring, not doing or thinking of anything at all. Time went by so quickly I hardly noticed when midnight became 3am, I don‚Äôt know why I couldn‚Äôt shake myself out of it. It hasn‚Äôt gotten this bad in so long I almost forgot it‚Äôs something that can happen, feeling completely separate from my body. I didn‚Äôt eat all day because I couldn‚Äôt even connect to that hungry feeling even though I knew I had to be starving. I forgot how much I hate this feeling, or lack of feeling.

Still feeling a little off but I‚Äôm writing this to just remind myself that this is still something I deal with sometimes and to remind myself to try my best not to let myself get past the point of no return, because once I lay down when I feel this way I just can‚Äôt get back up. I feel so pathetic and so stupid and so sad at myself but I just want today to be better. I have to just be better."
The void that is my memory is pushing me towards a cliff,27,kzppca,3,"Im surprised im still functioning. Ive been able to fight the dissociative trances but its becoming tiring. I ended up having a panic attack out of nowhere a couple days ago

My reflection is creeping me out again too, it feels like a seperate person

Im reliving what happend a few months ago, slowely getting worse before i fade away all over again. I dont want to slip away but it just feels so confortable

Im so tired of forgetting, im so tired of the void in my head. Im so sick of the years gone, the faces gone. Im just so tired of this"
A funny story about disociation to lighten your mood,12,kzsl48,1,"Driving really triggers my disociation, like many people I've read about in this subreddit. I suppose it's inherently a stressor? Even if you've been driving for years? Anyway, I get this double vision when looking at this old lady on the side path but there's something wrong with the disociation because each illusion is wearing slightly different clothes. And that's when I realised they were twins! I've never seen identical twins in older people before! Same hair cut, same clothes, just different colours. So trippy üòÇ So that's my somewhat funny story to lighten the mood of this subreddit! Have you had a not-disociation moment that cracked you up?"
Dissociating a lot suddenly?,1,l0711e,2,"Hey everyone. I‚Äôve had episodes of dissociation before in the past, but normally it‚Äôs only been for a little bit every so often.

How do I form a cohesive sense of self with a cohesive life timeline?,32,kzajaj,16,"This weekend I have written in my journal a summary of my life so far. I have just finished writing it and I'm crying and feel empty and hollow and I don't know why.

One thing I am finding upsetting is how disjointed my view of my life is. I feel like my life is in distinct chapters e.g. Primary School, Secondary School, University. As soon as I leave one chapter it's like I completely forget about it and I lose contact with everyone from that chapter. I feel so much grief and sadness at all the wonderful friends I just didn't stay in contact with. Right now I have no friends for the first time in my life as all my old friendships have faded away and I can't make new friends due to lockdown and working from home. Some of those friendships were intense ""best friends but more like sisters"" friendships, I don't understand how I can not have spoken to them again, I just let myself drift away from them.

My chapters are so inconsistent. I went from loud and sociable surrounded by loads of friends who didn't care about school work and would get bad grades to a science ""geek"", top of my university cohort with no friends in the space of a few years. 

My memory is so bad because of this issue where I just disregard the previous chapter. I struggled to remember the names of some of my friends at university even though I graduated just one year ago.

Does anyone have any advice?"
Night in the Woods and Dissociation,4,kzdswa,0,
Confused,16,kz3awb,4,"I'm honestly not sure if what I've been feeling is dissociation or not. It's like, I feel very detached from my surroundings but also very hyper aware of my surroundings at the same time? like I can feel myself very subconsciencly aware of what's happening around me but like, I can't process it. everything feels likes it's playing in the background."

The glaze over your eyes,8,kyg39g,7,"Has anyone ever tried (when dissociating) looking at the glaze over your eyes? Try not to focus on the world around you, but look at the actual glaze, its almost like a vr headset, a hallucination. When you shut your eyes, youll see some sort of static changing colours and flashing. Try opening your eyes, and then looking at it. Completely changes your perception."
"Is this derealization? I need answers, I'm scared",26,ky9fn7,1,"I feel like the world is no longer real. And that its a dream. That I'm going to wake up as a kid and this was all going to be a dream. 

Or today, I had a feeling that I was in a car crash (I was not) and that I was dead imagining the world. 

It takes me biting my cheek (because I was always told you couldn't hurt in dreams or as a ghost) to come back.

Switching and Smoking,4,kygl9u,2,"Yoooo 

So, I deal w BPD daily. Some trauma in the last couple years keeps me on the edge of disassociation and derealization. 

The people around me don‚Äôt help much. Not in the ‚Äúit‚Äôs your responsibility‚Äù way, that‚Äôs literally asking too much. But dude, not even in like a friend way. I‚Äôm just losing hope in the people around me & that‚Äôs not the way I want to make me ‚Äústronger‚Äù or whatever. 

I need a legit friend, dude. I literally just need to vent and be validated that I‚Äôm not fucking crazy. I know I‚Äôm not, but I haven‚Äôt had literally anyone to tell me otherwise. Just different bits of me trying to hold eachother together. 

It‚Äôs all petty little bs, but it can all add up and feel so damning. I just wanna smoke and dissociate freely and talk outloud about all the shit. 

So basically, I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs like a space for smoke sessions and mental instability? Lol  or should I just start a channel on Twitch or something? Is that even something that would help other people just by watching and having daily talks about? I know the outloud, unplanned talks help me work thru my shit. Maybe seeing that will help someone else? Idk man"

Does anybody have worse problems with derealization when looking through lenses ?,6,ky8k1m,4,"Every time I wear glasses or sunglasses, I find dissociating from myself to be a much easier. I end up not bothering to hold eye contact with people bc it feels like there‚Äôs a layer of disconnect between me and what I‚Äôm seeing. I don‚Äôt wear glasses often because of this.  Is this common or is it just a me thing?"
Sometimes I forget who and where I am,45,kxs3yh,15,"For example, I was watching TV with my dad. Out of nowhere I don't know who I am, where I am, how I got here (in the room), and who the other person is (dad). Nothing looks familiar and I don't know what I am. This lasts for about a minute, I don't panic or anything as I'm just trying to put things together in my head. 

Then it comes back all at once. 

Sometimes this happens when I look at myself in the mirror and I LITERALLY don't recognize who I'm looking at."
Dissociation at school ?,5,kxwr5p,2,"Does anyone else dissociate at school, it's more of a derealization I think. I feel detached and non existent, I don't feel anything at all. I'm able to mildly concentrate. Sometimes I have anxiety attacks, I have no friends at school and this is my trigger for dissociating. I am really shy and have been diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder, the more people around me talk and have fun the more I disapear. Does anyone else know what helps, I'm writing this while feeling foggy and gone. I'm studying art by the way.

I don't know what happened to me at school before but I was ignored for most of my life, at school too. I don't know if I have any other traumas because I can't remember my past very well. 

Thanks for being able to share on this forum, it makes me feel better and more visible. 

And my head hurts less, does anyone else mildly hallucinate during dissociation, like a black paint spot on the wall can move and almost look like a bug. I've had this symptom for a year now. "

Started working out Trauma using workbook,2,kxxawp,2,I feel many parts of me arouse from darkness after a long time.it felt like I just entered a room and called out for names based on my knowledge and slowly gradually I was able to hear responses in the form of feelings and emotions and perceptions.I engaged in the process and supported my parts to communicate and I felt my creativity was flowing so that I understand how the organizAtion works.It was great to feel back home after a long time of adult life hurdle.I was in a very stressfull period in external sphere which greatly effects my mental health.And now i get back to the roots and promised every part everything is allrigbt and I care for the inner child or parts.I know I deny them and I sometimes hate them but I affirmed them I love them the most ...that have me some good boost.
Everything is so foggy all the time,10,kxnxyu,2,"I‚Äôve had a bad couple days. Bad couple months honestly but last few days have been bad.

Dating with severe/chronic depersonalisation and dissociation (TRIGGER WARNING),17,kxkfyx,0,"Hey guys. It's been a while.

My doctor recent advised me that be believed the cure to my ailments would be to get laid ('Do you have sex? Do it. It's good for you?.) I smiled and nodded, realized he meant well but knowing little of my story. (I'm no doctor, but I am not aware that intercourse cures CPTDS and DDNOS, but by this point I am open to new ideas 

My first memory ever is being molested. I was coerced into giving this guy a blowjob - nuts and all. He said I did a good job. Guess he must've been 17. He was a juvenile criminal placed at the halfway house my dad worked at. I must have been around age 2. I didn't remember this until a flashback at age 17 after a near-fatal car crash, but I digress.

I don't remember much. It's all flashback and rarely accessible currently, but I remember the smell. That smell of genitals and excitement, which I guess you would call 'the smell of sex'. It's always there. Rather obviously, bodily encounters are rare, and never really at the front of my mind.

Lets move to the more 'romantic' aspect - say dating. Where you get to know each other, flirt, maybe hold hands etc. I will admit, that from the outside it looks terrible easy. 

However, each time I try, every single layer of protection embedded in me somehow takes over, and I am unable for a second to genuinly feel intimaticy. Whevever something resembles, I either fade away or blatantly self-obstruc to eliminate the situation. As you might imagine this bring some problems to the dating department. Probably doesn't help that I'm quite literal and have a hard time decoding body language directed at me, which is really rather stressfull.

When I get a potential female (I'm one of the boring, shameful heteronormative cis-fellows (hope I get that right)) for my self, it feel's as if there's a chasm apart us. I read once that flirting is a continuous serious of question - verbal or not - where the ansnwer is always maybe. I'll admit it sounds romantic and all, and I've seen some James Bond, so I get the general idea, but it's like there's something missing - a void you can't cross. You can easily see what's happening, and part of you know what's expected, but somehow you're somehow unable to reach out and cross that barrier to the world. or Life, if one was a poet.

I'm not sure what my point is here, but it might be twofold. Do any of you ever experience this - not akwardness, but rather distance, between yourself and new partners, and (this one might be for the ladies, and is not intended to offend of stir emoting. I ask as a scholar and a gentleman to understand the mechanics involved in dating/mating.) 

If you, as a woman was approaced by a potential partner, whom showed interest in you, and with whom you share chemistry, but you didn't immediately get a sexual vibe, would you write him off immediately?  Not sure this is a dissociative question per se, but I suffer severe dissociation and I'm the one asking #lawyered"

DAE experience dissociation happening totally unannounced and unexpected?,3,kxog1h,1,"I‚Äôm not sure exactly why this happens. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because my body is so accustomed to dealing with life this way or what, but a lot of the time it seems totally unprompted.

While life right now is pretty stressful, in this particular moment I‚Äôm not that stressed out. I have a three day weekend to look forward to and I have things set up to change for the better in the very near future.

Wearing earbuds the last few days sometimes makes me feel floaty and disoriented,6,kxk29a,1,"Hi there!

So as a background I have GAD, Adhd, and possibly ASD. I have my fair share of experience with different kinds of dissociation (maladaptive daydreaming, feeling like im not in my body and poor memory of childhood because of dissociating) So, my brain has a lot of issues with sensory input. Often I get overwhelmed when there is particularly loud or too many noises around me. This morning I am just at home, sat in the lounge room and I can hear my mum talking on the phone and the person she is talking with, my brother playing videos and commenting, my cats being cats and then various background noise. Brain isn't liking it so I put my earbuds in (galaxy buds+ for reference) they dont entirely cut out all noise but they cut out most background noise if its not right next to me and dampen all the talking a lot.

As soon as I put them in I feel a weird disconnect like I'm no longer in my body or in the real world anymore and its very confusing. Almost like I'm in another plane or like, in the spirit world from Avatar lmao. Then that bleeds into visually looking at my body it doesnt feel like mine, it's doing what I want it to but it's not mine. This started happening maybe two days ago. I take the earbuds out and I can hear all the subtle noises like the fan and my body slightly adjusting and I become grounded again. Turning on ambient mode (where the microphones input outside noises) makes it worse. It's less disorienting when i'm in my bedroom perhaps because it's my safe space and there is less noise to begin with so it isn't as jarring. It doesn't last all day just comes and goes. It's not as bad when I'm occupied by doing something with my hands and watching or listening to something. I'm not incredibly distressed by it and I'm hoping it wont stick around for long, honestly I'm just intrigued by it at this point.

Slept for almost 24 hours straight?,4,kxgmpa,3,"Yesterday, I was up very late, then slept for a few hours before having an appointment with my therapist in the morning, where I talked about my dissociative episodes for the first time. It went well, though it was a lot to process and get out, and then a couple hours after, I became extremely tired, and I slept for nearly 24 hours straight. Like, I've been depressed and just lazed in bed for long periods of time before, but this was literally deep sleep for a 24 hour period with just a two hour break during it.

Does this happen to anyone else? Confronting my dissociative episodes and having a trusted professional tell me I may have DPDR at ""best"" and DID at ""worst"" has just been a _lot_ to process, and I think it just took a lot out of me.

EDIT: I noticed that putting quotes around ""best"" and ""worst"" make it look like a direct quote from my therapist, which makes her look bad because that's kind of dumb thing to say to a patient. Those weren't her words, she did mention DPDR and DID, but I'm the one who put value judgements on them here."
not sure what this is,9,kxcdyu,5,"Hi I am 16f and after a very bad high on 10-1-20 (I have been 100% sober since), I have changed and I don't know quite what it is. I feel like everything around me is planned in some way and that I am dissociating. I often go into states where it feels like my thoughts aren't my own and people are listening in on them, almost like my brain is a wire cage. I also have been hyper aware of everything in my life and how there are just too many coincidences. For example I will do something or say something and the exact same thing will present itself in a video or action sometimes almost instantly. Like when this guy that I have liked for a while that I never see because we have none of the same friends randomly comes to the beach Im at and we talk and he tells me he's an electrician and when I go home an hour later, my parents are watching a documentary about electricity, and they never watch documentaries. Thats just the most recent example but these have been occurring multiple times a day from ranging severity and Im to the point where I can't seem to think of things as coincidental anymore. Everything just seems too connected and I don't feel emotionally connected to anything or anyone anymore because none of it seems realign my head. I just don't know what this is and no one around me takes any of my concerns seriously"
anyone else have feelings of pressure in your neck/head before/during dissociation?,7,kxf5en,4,"hey everyone! i was just curious bc, while im no stranger to dissociation, ive noticed that the last few times ive dissociated, the pressure in my head always feels off?? idk how to describe it really, its kinda like being underwater but only from the neck up? or that feeling when blood rushes to your head when you are upside down for too long? im pretty sure its psychological and not a physical ailment because it's always accompanied by ""normal"" dissociative characteristics, and it goes away once i start feeling more present/calm/that overall coming down back into your body sensation. really curious to see if any of you guys have experienced something similar! thanks n sending peace n love your way!! <333"
I'm having some clarity at the moment,2,kxf05q,0,"And holy shit, I just realised I made a new friend this week. 

I had the sudden realization that the relationship could last as long as I live (very unlikely, but still vaguely possible), and that terrifies me. I don't think I've had the ability to think clearly about the future for a long time, and so this is all so strange. I'm not even sure where to start haha. 

If I'm being honest, I kinda want to go back to being unable to think about tomorrow again. This is too much pressure. My wish will probably be granted soon again anyways.

Sertraline for dpdr questions,14,kwu6ux,9,"Hi, i'm a 19 year old experiencing derealisation which was the result of a weed induced panic attack a couple of years ago.. I have been in this state for 2 years and my therapist and psychiatrist think that I should go on sertraline, starting at 25mg and tapering up over a few months, prescribed for anxiety. I'm very conflicted on doing this. On one hand, these professionals I've spoken to seem confident that it would have a positive effect on my anxiety, and thusly my derealisation, and I've been told that unless there were any hiccups they were wanting to have me off it after 6 months. on the other hand I'm very nervous about taking any kind of meds, especially ssris, for a number of reasons. I am aware that they can have pretty severe side effects, some of which mimic the exact problems I am trying to fix, ie the emotional numbness I deal with from the dissociation. I've also heard some people online say that ssris caused either emotional numbness or murdered their sexuality which is obviously the opposite of what I want. I have a few questions for anyone with experience of sertraline and especially taking it with derealisation.

how bad do the side effects get? I've heard that you can get pretty severe physical effects as well as bad emotional ones, so was wondering how bad being on sertraline actually is, are they horrible and life ruining or just annoying?

what is the experience of being on sertraline like generally?

is there any significant risk of side effects lasting after stopping taking the medication?

does anyone have experience taking sertraline with derealisation (particularly when caused by anxiety) and what was your experience, do you think that it has a significant potential to help

sorry if this post is not allowed, feel free to remove it. If anyone has experiences with ssris other than sertraline that might be useful too :)"

Lot more present bowadays,2,kwa4iz,0,I was able to find dissociation is reduced when I started to practise how to be present.I started to find anchors around me to fixate so that I can remind m mind I am not lost or I am not emptiness.that i exist.That's why I was able to feel this.The brain's way of shutting down consiousness has largely affected my capacity to concentrate on small things without conflict.if I want to concentrate I want to switch between disocciative states.There was no communication inside.but now i am trying to connect the dots.

Talked to my doctor and they said it doesn't seem serious at all,  but I'm still worried.

Have anyone felt something like this? It is dissociation?,16,kuwrys,2,"I have always thougth that I was feeling just dizzy and weak, but now Im questioning if its dissociation. 

I feel like my body is not mine, like Im wearing a suit that is not my size. 
Some times I feel like my body is heavier than it is and I need a lot of effort to move it so that makes me tired and my movements slower; but some other times I feel like my body its lighter than it should so it move faster, like I cant quite control it and Im clumsier. 
Some times its just some of my body parts, like I dont recognise my hands or voice, and feel they should be different like my hands should be bigger and my voice deeper. Some times I even freak out to see myself so weird and alien like. 

Also I tend to feel like life its a dream or simple not real, even if I know it is real. I usually feel like I dont belong to my enviroment, like there is some fog or something between me and the rest of the world, everything looks so distant and plain, like some painting.

I dont have a good grip on time, it just past so slow or so fast some times, some memories look so distant were they happend recently or some look so close but I dont know When they happend.
My memories looks so hasty and fuzzy, like I know it happend to me because is in my head but otherwise I would think it is a movie. It is so bad that I dont longer know the difference between remembering something and just knowing the fact that it happend. 

Have anyone felt something like this? It is dissociation?"

"Wife having weird feelings that she couldn't describe to me, then she googled them",30,ku625m,8,"This is a really long story that I'm going to try to make brief:

My wife(37) has a brain tumor in her cerebellum, and has been fighting with it for 3 years. It started out as a low-grade benign (Grade 1), that was resected, but then it came back much more aggressively.

She had a second surgery that removed a large amount of her right cerebellum, 3 weeks of radiation. Suffered from hydrocephalus that led to a 3rd surgery to install a VP shunt. Been loaded with dexamethasone for the better part of 6 months. We then started a promising new drug that she's been taking for a month. She was basically told that if the drug works, great, but if it doesn't work the tumor would likely return in 4 - 5 months.

Well good news! Her last scan showed that the drug was working with flying colors, and is stopping the tumor in it's tracks. If it work, she can technically take the drug for the rest of her life, there is no toxicity like you'd see with other cytotoxic chemos.

For several weeks she's been complaining more about her mental symptoms then her physical symptoms. She's been through a lot, but she's never shown externally to be in any kind of emotional distress. I downplayed it for a while, telling her ""You're doing great, your symptoms are subsidding, your balance is back, you aren't so dizzy anymore.""

They have a counselor associated with the cancer practice, but she didn't really get along with her.

But even after the good scan, she mentioned that it seemed like there were 2 different universes. The one she is in, and the one that our daughter and I live in. She says that she is aware of what is going on, but doesn't feel like she's part of it. Physically, she is improving. But she is getting increasingly frustrated. She says she feels like her body and mind aren't connected. Like she's controlling a robot.

Her oncologist put her on zoloft. After taking the zoloft she had severe panic and anxiety attacks, uncharacteristic of her. They discontinued the Zoloft promptly and put her on  clonazepam. It helps with the anxiety, but her feelings of detachment are still there.

Today she was googling, and sent me a link to ""derealization"", and said ""That's it! That's me there""

This seemed like the place to ask for some advice.

This post really simplifies things, but it's hard to tell everything without writing a book on here."
First ever truly noticeable Dissociative episode,5,kubh7d,0,"I (15nb) struggled with some pretty mild symptoms up until today or at least I first labeled this today. There was a period of time when I entered my room and felt as if I was intruding and nothing felt as it should. I looked in the mirror and felt like I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in this body and that none of the stuff around me belonged to me. I physically avoided touching and moving stuff to not move and change what I felt wasn‚Äôt mine. There was a small part of me that was connected but about 85% of me was disconnected. I even felt as if it was a Wednesday instead of a Saturday. I managed to talk with a friend and try to explain how I felt and they helped me regain myself. But that experience was very different and new. It felt similar to paranoia except instead of fear it was more being uncomfortable with where I was and who I was. 

I just wanted to share this experience because from what I can remember this is a pretty new feeling. Feel free to comment or add whatever."
Trigger,3,kuc9bv,1,Yesterday I got a message from my college friend and actually I felt a different part of me was activated from the sad responsible guy to a cool college guy.he gave me some photos of our old crushes that a used to look after in college.Like he told me that most of them were married and all.actually I laughed a lot like young college student.I felt so strange about myself at that time.Like where is this personality gone till now? I was all emotionally empty till that time and then something happened and suddenly I act like I am a part of something and then a lot of emotion flooded to my mind .most were beutyfull ones and I felt so greatfill for those memories.I am starting to understand that there is not only depressed 'me' but also parts that are greatfull of who 'i' am.This can help me in healing from compartmentalization.i believe memories and flashbacks are a sign of progress.I start to accept what has happened and then my mind shows me things that it accepts as good in my life.
"One of ""my"" personalities wants to kill us.",3,ku8sfz,4,"I could use some advice.

**Small introduction:**

For as long as I remember, I have been consciously dealing with dissociation. Not DID but a variation where different sides to me are not integrated at all and reason in their own distinct ways. Time and existence play a bizarre role in my daily thoughts and I partially tap out out of consciousness in certain situations. I've always had a very hard time feeling things and being able to acknowledge things like physical sensations, emotions and intuition. I am capable of feeling every emotion, but I have this weird total control over it which makes it impossible for me to have any spontaneity behind my emotions. I basically choose what I feel and how I act, and I can completely turn it all around just arbitrarily from one moment to the next.

**Situation:**

I'm in my mid twenties, live alone and I feel very lonely. Not that I don't have enough social interaction, I've got great friends and I love my job, but when I get home it's just me. I've been in a few relationships but those girls felt that thing that's ""missing"" in my case. (The spontaneous bond/organic development of a relationship.) Aside from that I can't have an orgasm during sex altough there's nothing wrong physically... I didn't mind in the past but I recently realised that this is of course another symptom of this missing element of connection.

Without going into detail about the pieces of my fragmented personality, there's this one of two main ""sides"" to me that wants to stop existing. Not focussing on killing myself (although that would of course be necessary) but really wanting to decide about whether this consciousness should be or not. Feeling trapped as I would hurt many people by committing to that idea... For a long time, this one was my biggest threat that was more of an existential metaphysical way of thinking and not impulsive at all... But an ugly ""minor"" side got more prevalent recently.

**The problem:**

As a kid I've mainly been emotionally abused by my family and heavily bullied. Today I'm not an unattractive guy, I'm also very social and intelligent (IQ over 130, speaking multiple languages and proficient in a few scientific and artistic fields) but the scars from my childhood are still there, and they've heavily affected one side to me that's starting to manifest more often.

I take zoloft daily since abouth half a year now and it works great. However, whenever I forget to take it for a day, when I sleep way too little or get triggered by things related to the abuse/lonelyness in my childhood, this smaller side can come up and it's growing in importance and frequence. This side things I'm worthless, wants to stay alone because everything will fail and hurt me, and most importantly, it wants to kill me. Like practically planning it and reasoning about it. (The way of reasoning differs immensely between these ""sides"".)

When I'm in that state, I of course wonder if I should stop taking the meds and also starve myself. I'll want to end relationships with people to have peace of mind and think about hurting myself very violently all day long.

I have no clue how to go about this. I don't want to be committed to a psych ward cause that would definitely mean the end. For now I'm able to always come back from that dangerous state because I'll always realise I have to take the meds and that it's unnatural for a being to kill itself... but I feel like this grasp is getting weaker and weaker.   


Last week I drew out a play at the office, on how to successfully commit suicide using a bag around my head, asked on here how to stick a needle straight through the palm of my hand, asking on here if I should make my body disappear or be found for the closure of my loved ones, and even thought of a new way of killing myself by making myself bleed out using wide injection-needles. This went away again about two days ago and I think I can hold it off for relatively long since I can heavily influence the chances of it coming back by pausing  relationships with certain friends (although loneliness isn't great either). The thing is that I strongly suspect that when it comes back, it'll keep getting more and more severe.

**What should I do? Any tips? When does one decide that things are getting dangerous?**

(I only got diagnosed a few months back and will get to have my first appointment with a specialised psychatrist in two weeks.)

Thanks a lot.

PS: it might not be apparent from my post but I do appreciate some humour, even in the darkest situations \^\^"
Feeling odd physical sensations when dissociating intensely,21,kty3ph,3,"Today I woke up very late, which is something that makes my dissociation a lot worse. I couldn't feel myself physically being, and my vision felt foggy and objects around me felt unreal. But the weirdest bit was that there was tingling on the bridge of my nose, as if my glasses were there, but they weren't. I sometimes get the same feeling on the side of my head, like the glasses are compressing on my face, but they arent there. I've only started getting this feeling since I starting wearing glasses to help with blue light headaches. (And it becomes less noticeable/goes away when I put the glasses on.) Is this normal with dissociation, or should I be concerned?"
Better understanding,2,ku7tr5,2,"I am in need of some advice/information.
Is one able to ""dissociate"" in a present moment. 
Example: 
'CJ is on the phone with MJ. While on the phone with MJ he is (at the same time) sending MJ threatening text messages under an alias. CJ will later explain this behavior as dissociative. CJ does not remember sending those messages to MJ'.

In this scenario, is CJs explanation of his behavior plasable?

Cannabis use and DPDR,17,ktrdu8,16,"Background: I (20F) have been struggling with feelings of lack of presence my whole life, but in particular since I was 10 years old, when now I know a state of omnipresent derealization set in.

Through a combination of a lot of therapy work, getting myself into a healthier home environment, and I believe cannabis use, I‚Äôve started to come out of this derealization. I can‚Äôt express how crazy, amazing, and horrifying this has been (I hadn‚Äôt even heard about DPDR until late October).

From my understanding though, cannabis is thought to be a potential cause of DPDR. This has definitely been the opposite experience for me though, and the pattern of my emergence from this dissociative state really closely corresponds with a low and healthy usage.

Anyone have any thoughts on this or experience? This continues to be a wild ride and I‚Äôd love to hear some perspectives."

Never came back to my job, just told them it was too much for me and that I was at the hospital...

I don't have a job anymore since some months...
I get a little money from the governement, but it will end soon...

then i ""woke up"" into another dream where i was sitting on my couch, and it turns out the ""dream"" i was having was just a video on my phone????? and i was like. weird i must have been really immersed and i got up to get dressed. but then i had the thought that it was a trick and the guy kept me alive instead and killed the other person there with us. so i knew i had to get addressed and leave. there were baby lizards on the floor (there were several baby lizards or geckos living in my house when i first moved in irl), that guided me a room in my house but no one was in there. i picked up a pair of pants that had a mouse in it and threw the mouse across the room because i got scared. then i just put the pants on as normal and went to open my door (mind you, this all felt completely real and like this was just my life). then i heard a voice say something along the lines of ""what are you doing?"" and it scared me so bad i woke up in real life this time and i swore i heard the voice irl. after that i cried and called my friend to ask her if i was in real life and she said yes, and laughed bc it happens to her (i knew she was the right one to call) and that made me feel better. 

&#x200B;

but after that i just felt weird and off all day and slept a lot (no more dreams like this). im up now and feel like there's always something behind me. i think the gist here is im mentally ill and im having really bad derealizastion in that im afraid im still in a fake reality and i feel detached. i there's also another whole problem that isnt directly related to this about my mom, but i wont talk about it here for length's sake. if you want to hear about it lmk. also if you finished this all, thank you so much i know how boring it can be to read people's dreams."
Whenever I think about my last relationship I get a strong feeling like ‚ÄúI was a part of that?‚Äù,18,ks22ve,8,"Even down to the kind of person I was back then. The things I did then and even before then. I know they happened, but I don‚Äôt FEEL they happened if that makes sense."
What to do..,1,ksdjvf,0,"I have dissociation for the past years. Can't really recall how long it has been haha. I also have some episodes of derealisation between them. As I do now. 

To prevent my dissociation from getting worse I try to walk outside when I'm not totally out of it. And this seems to be working normally :) but this past weeks outside seems to be strange.. unreal.. like I'm not even experiencing it. And it makes me anxious. I think its because I've been inside a lot the past few months due to 2 heavy operations. 

But now I'm like to scared to get outside. Cause a few days ago the derealisation or the dissociation ( not sure) outside made me real scared. Cause nothing of the elements that seem to get me out of this feeling seem to help with that feelings. I mean like that I was fake and the world was fake and that everything outside seems to be like a video game..

So now I dont know whats the best decision to make.. I am kinda dissociated.. and other sensory thing don't seem to help me with this..  but im also scared to go outside. I dont want to have this confusion again.
Should I wait untill tommorow to discuss it with my therapist.. or just don't be so goddamn scared and just try to go outside where I might get in that state..

Thanks for reading :)"
Can music enhance/induce dissociation?,6,ks4g8r,5,I feel like there are certain songs I listen to witch sometimes forces to dissociate. Does anyone else have the same thing? Also out of curiosity what songs? For me its mainly Clams Casino - ‚Äúim god‚Äù some others as well but his is the most consistent one.
Alcohol induced dissociation,3,ks4awr,1,"I don‚Äôt know if this is just exclusive to me or not but after years of alcohol abuse I now get this severe dissociative feeling that is indescribable with my anxiety problem. My theory is that the alcohol effected my anxiety disorder in the long run. I believe this because your brains natural defense mechanism towards overwhelming anxiety is to dissociate I would often use alcohol to escape my anxiety but over years of abuse I started getting more anxious than I was before I even started drinking. after the long binges I would indulge myself in, I would be very anxious after I abruptly quit drinking. I also realized when I was under the influence of alcohol any dissociative feelings I possessed would be takin away because of the anxiety relieving qualities alcohol has due to its gaba antagonism."
Does dissociation prevent you from forming & maintaining relationships ?,21,krmo5s,10,"^ Not even referring to romantic in nature but even just potential friendships - any possible bond in whatever form of relationship that may be. 

Sometimes when in the moment of socializing/‚Äòbonding‚Äô with someone it‚Äôs nice and all..

But afterwards you get the feeling of .. 
‚Äú that was me who was talking to them ? ‚Äú
And a slight guilt and/or wonder of,  
well, if we never talk again ... would I feel any type of way at all ? Not even hurt because I don‚Äôt even feel like i interacted with said person ..I mean, I last talked to them a week ago... to me that‚Äôs what I already consider a lifetime ago / a past life / therefore irrelevant possibly never even existed in the first place ...

Smoking makes me so dissiciative,1,ks1q89,0,"I don't know why but smoking acts as trigger to my dissociation and during smoking I don't have any Idea about the decisions I make I am easily manipulative and I can do anything that anyone says.Like if someone says I must go to anothe country with them so that  I will become rich I may go with them.because that much manipulative I am and also detached from reality during those time
And after when I came back to my senses after stopping smoking I feel so strange that everything appears so different unreal and I may think who is that person who did all 'this'? I definitely think smoking splits me into parts and dissociation makes me have no idea about this.I am ruminating all the time and during smoking I am unaware of this rumination like I don't know passage of time.I don't know anything at all.Stopping smoking gives me a sense of awareness about my own dissociation ."
Sex urges acts as dissociative triggers,6,krn7hq,6,I don't know if someone relate but I dissociate a lot during day time and night time thinking about sex in my mind.Like I go there completely detached from what's happening around me and then stay there like a alternate place of reality.the character there ar3 probably my crushes in college and what distinguishes this from fantasy is I cant easily get out of it.It's like mind is in an autopilot mode a cannot do anything.rather than watch my mind dwell I this place and then become depressed and depressed.I feel so sad for my present state as i know that a heartbreak acted as a fuel to this dissociation.And I feel so hopeless as after working a lot in my dissociation still I am having parts of minds I don't have any Idea about.
not my usual dissociating .. very scary what is this??,8,kri2i8,1,"so i had an intense dissociative episode a couple days ago but i started my period the next day (PMDD) so i knew that was the reason. i‚Äôve been a little foggy since but overall okay. today was actually pretty decent. i was more productive than i have been & everything seemed fine. flash forward to like 8:30pm i just finished eating & was doing a crossword puzzle when i noticed that i was seeing the words of the clues but i wasn‚Äôt really comprehending them. the tv was on so i started watching and again realized that i was seeing the images but wasn‚Äôt really catching what was going on. i immediately noted that i felt off and decided to go to bed. (i normally don‚Äôt go to bed that early but figured i was just tired) so i got ready for bed & noticed that my head felt fuzzy & warm. i tried to lay down & immediately noticed my head & body were not on the same page. i could not control my thoughts they were going every where & some weird images & thoughts were popping up & i knew i wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep. i put on a story from the calm app but i wasn‚Äôt even able to focus on the words bc my mind was going everywhere. i felt like my body was falling asleep but my mind was not. after maybe 30 mins i got up bc i couldn‚Äôt handle it & felt the panic get to me. i have a loft bed & i could barely get down from it bc i was so uncoordinated/ stumbling & went to talk to my mom but could barely get my words out. i tried to lay down again but at soon as i did my thoughts went weird again & now i was physically panicking (trembling, racing heart etc) i tried to just focus on my breathing & do the stuff i normally do for anxiety but nothing really helped & i just feel like i have absolutely zero control over my mind & im probably not gonna get any sleep tonight. this isn‚Äôt what it feels like when i dissociate & the fact that my head physically feels off (like it‚Äôs buzzing / warm / etc) & has me really scared that‚Äôs somethings medically wrong & it‚Äôs not just mental. has anyone experienced anything like this?????? how can i help myself & sleep tonight????"
How to get out of dissociation/derealization,7,krcyv8,3,"Hey guys...

I‚Äôve seen this posted a bunch on Reddit but I really wanted to get my story out there to see if anybody has had the same thing happen to them, and if so, how they managed to cope with it/get out of it entirely.

So about a month ago right after thanksgiving I was in the car with my cousin and we were in a Chick-fil-A parking lot. I got out to throw some trash away and all of the sudden everything seemed very fake, almost as if the world itself wasn‚Äôt real or that I was dreaming. This feeling has continued into this present day, it forced me to be stuck at home as doing simple things like driving a car and going to work cause my anxiety to skyrocket. It never entirely goes away, although I‚Äôve had moments where it seems to get better only to go back to being bad.

It‚Äôs not as though I don‚Äôt remember myself or my memories, I remember them all. I know who I am, it just feels like I‚Äôm almost high and out of it. I want it to end so badly, and I‚Äôve tried a few things such as LENS therapy, talk therapy, and I even went to a doctor who prescribed me 10 MG of Prozac and atarax for anxiety. I stopped the Prozac after two days (I know I should‚Äôve told my doctor) because it made the feelings 10 times worse. Any advice helps! I just want this to end, because I miss being me!"
I want to leave but I don't know where to go,5,kr9kil,1,
I dissociated harder than I ever have before and it frightened me.,36,kqxepk,4,"I was upset yesterday about a fight with my boyfriend. It had to do with a topic that hits me at my very core and deeply upsets me. I was trying to fold clothes to calm myself down and in the middle of folding a towel I suddenly felt my brain get bigger than my skull, my vision tunneled, and I couldn't move or talk. The bed felt like it was moving and I was trying to ask my boyfriend if there was an Earthquake but I couldn't talk. It was like my thoughts slowed down to the point of incoherency. This lasted maybe 30 seconds of me staring into the distance and then I felt like my jaw was going to explode (always my precursor to a panic attack) and it surged a painful energy from my jaw down my spine. This snapped me out of it and I instantly knew I was going to have one. I collapsed and had the worst panic attack I've had in over ten years.

I guess....I just want to know if anyone else who dissociates has experienced it like this. I don't know anyone in my life who can relate to my dissociation."
I think I dissociate?,1,krg61i,0,"Is it more of an action for self distraction or? 

I definitely binge distracting activities to ignore reality. I also often will be in this feelingless fog most of the time and wrapped up in reflective thought always focusing on solving problems that hold me back from feeling things. 

When I try to connect with my emotions and thought, I feel anxiety and generally find it easiest to just allow the passing of time rather than engage. There have been plenty of times in the past where I just tune out the world despite social expectation but I've been giving myself healthy activity and meditation and sobriety and find that even tho I'm half a person, I can still pull off being alive which is good. 

Another thing I do is try to stop thinking and be connected to the moment but that can make.me anxious as well. Not sure what to do with all of my moments so I get wrapped up in another habitual distraction. 

Would like to understand ur understanding of dissociation better plz"
Dissociating feeling like time travel?,3,kr91zg,0,"For background: I likely suffered (undiagnosed) from derealization when I was a kid. I think it stopped mostly around high school, but has started to come back in the last year, but pretty mildly. I'm also a master at dissociating from any and all uncomfortable emotions.

But I've had at least two incidents of total dissociation that I think of as kind of like time travelling or like waking up from anesthesia. They literally felt as though I jumped forward in time by a few seconds. It's like my mind has completely gone. In one of the cases when I 'came to' it bizarrely felt like I'd been gone for months. In both cases, I was only 'gone' for a few seconds in real time, if that.

Both cases involved something traumatic or scary - once when I was the butt of a sexual joke by male family members at age 11, the other when I lost control of my car when I was around 22. (It turned out fine, no one was hurt, no damage to the car).

So what were these incidents? Are they just extreme dissociation? It's been like 4 years since the driving thing and I don't think it's happened again. (There are other incidents that could be this, but I don't have as strong feelings of having travelled through time in them.)"
"What type of dissociation is this, and has anyone else experienced anything like this?",1,krfhnq,5,"From October 2020 to November 2020 I have a huge gap in my memory with the exception of a very small period that I remember (I would be surprised if that period was longer that 10 minutes). To the best of my memory, there wasn't any trigger for this. I was a tad depressed and on guanfacine at the time though. 

The way I would describe the little that I remember is very fuzzy. I don't remember what I was doing, but I know I was having a conversation with someone. I don't remember what I said but I know in the moment I knew I didn't mean any of the things I said. It was really weird, like there were two sets of emotions in my head, one that I was feeling and one that my body (or whatever was in control of it) was feeling. Its hard to explain. I know I didn't feel in control at that moment, and I was frustrated. I couldn't get any sort of control of my body. 

The only time something like this happened was when I was a child at the peak of when traumatic things in my life were happening. That was for about a year  and I regained consciousness while I was getting ready for school. 

I attempted talking to my therapist about this but she does not actively work with those who have dissociative episodes like that. 

What kind of dissociation is this, if it even is dissociation, and has anyone experienced something similar?"
Is There Such Thing As Minor Dissociation?,8,kr0cdn,2,"I was in the car with my boyfriend about a month ago and he was just talking and I was fully listening to him. Then suddenly my eyes lock onto the distance and it feels like everything zoomed out. His words became like blurred, echoing, mumbling and it may have lasted like 30 seconds before I gripped onto his arm like he was my anchor to reality and I was like ‚ÄúHey give me a second I‚Äôm dissociating‚Äù

Literally nothing triggered it, I just, felt so not in my body? Like I was only slightly out of the lines. Like if my body was an outline, imagine another copy of the outline but like half an inch to the left on top of it. Does that make sense? 

This has happened a lot in my life but I thought it was normal. I haven‚Äôt really started paying attention to it until recently.

The only time I hardcore dissociate is during a conflict / I‚Äôm being yelled at.

Does any of this make sense?"
Feeling really sad and alone right now.,2,kr8uus,1,"I know I will likely delete this post (maybe) because I feel vunerable right now and I kinda hate it.

But anyway. My dissociation has been spiraling for the last 3 months now. When I am asleep I have nightmares, when I am awake I am either dissociated or struggling with emotional flashbacks m. Often each cause each other perpetuating the cycle.

I have started assessment for EMDR but it's the NHS and I am not sure what's happening and currently feel a long way from getting help.

I know I am getting worse. I'm dissociating most of the time, I'm miles away from everything and struggling to be human at all. I have a job and a partner, I don't want to lose these things but I am panicing now, feels like everything is slipping away and I can't stop it.

I am sad and I feel very lonely and isolated. I don't know many people IRL who dissociate as much as I do, if anyone and noone gets it. I am just own my own trying not to drown but really not doing very well. I try grounding techniques and stuff but really they just don't work. I am not losing lots of time yet but I know it can get there and I am scared. Last time I was like this atleast I had a therapist. Now I am just on my own."
What is this? :/,2,kr6mto,2,"I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just another person asking about my symptoms, but I can find anything about this on google or anything. So I have experienced most of the lower end of the dissociation spectrum. I have had time where i feel nothing and my body and feelings are numb. I have had times where my surroundings just feel fuzzy. If you add up how much I zone out per day I‚Äôm sure it adds up to hours. I have hyperrealzation moments. But what confuses me is that despite all of that most of the time I generally feel ok, yet I can not remember large portions of my life. Granted I am only 15,but I can‚Äôt remember much from 4-8 grade. I was in not ideal conditions, but I felt fine maybe a bit depressed and anxious but nothing that would cause dissociative amnesia . For a bit it stopped, but when the pandemic hit it started and now I can‚Äôt remember anything from March to now. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a loop and everyday is the same, but that‚Äôs not a symptom of dissociation that seems more like depression.  It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a constant mild state of dissociation that I can‚Äôt seem to break. I don‚Äôt want to be the person who can never recall fond memories, fun stories, or anything bc I can‚Äôt remember. Idk if this might play into this but I do have adhd, depression and anxiety. 

TL;DR: I am in a constant state of dissociation and cannot recall much of my life. But idk if it is dissociation."
Dissociation and Vision,3,kqxlgo,1,"&#x200B;

I am a 19-year-old male who has dissociative and psychotic symptoms and who has recently been prescribed Risperidone. I stopped taking that drug after 3 weeks though.

Long before the prescription, I have had dissociative symptoms which became worse and worse to a point where I pushed myself to visit the doctor (I can safely say that it all started when I was 13 or 14).

There is a particular symptom which I don't hear or read anybody talking about; it has to do with your vision. I remember when I was 14 I asked my sister why does the room look dull. That ""dull"" vision is really hard to describe: colours look much less intense, and there is that sort of detachment as if I am looking at something that is in another dimension, it is as if there is a layer of grey that makes everything look less bright,  it is really hard to describe but it all has to do with my vision. That ""dull vision"" becomes much less in the afternoon and is its strongest at night.

I went to a lot of eye doctors and they gave me pills that ensure that my vision is ok and nothing really changed.

Please reply if you relate or know about this certain symptom, does it have a name?"
Hyperrealization?,51,kqc6s9,12,"So I was watching The Eric Andre show, and when the Lizzo Bird Up bit came on, something about the movement gave me a very similar, but opposite feeling to derealization. I suddenly became hyperaware, like everything around me was *too real*. I‚Äôve had it happen at parties before, usually places with big lighting difference (bright spotlights contrasted with a completely dark house in a theater). 

The feeling is super odd, my brain gets sort of fuzzy, and it feels like I can see the frames moving by in the world like in a video game. Everything seems like it‚Äôs too real, and I snap back to having to do everything really manually.

It has a lot of similarity to the raw feeling of derealization, but the specifics seem to be the exact opposite. I don‚Äôt get it.

Am I making any sense? My train of thought is more of a monkey on a unicycle, so I‚Äôm very bad at explaining. Does anyone else experience this?"
Was I dissociating?,1,kqxis5,0,"I know you probably get these all the time so thank you for your patience. In the last few weeks, especially after talking to someone I'm close with who's a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I've realized that I likely have memories I'm not remembering. I remember a handful of small instances of cocsa and one small event with a grown up family friend. But because of other symptoms I have it seems like there's stuff I'm not remembering. 

Last night I was already not feeling good. My chronic pain was acting up and I was struggling with some suicidal intrusive thoughts. We were laying in bed and all of a sudden I thought of something (which I no longer remember what it was. I have this thing where I can temporarily make myself forget what I'm upset about to help me calm down but this time I didn't remember it later) and my anxiety spiked and I started feeling uncomfortable and restless. I felt dizzy and light headed and when I looked at my arm it didn't feel attached to me. Overall I felt really uncomfortable in my body and anxious.... 

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions and I'll try and answer. Thank you again for helping me when I know what I'm going through is nothing compared to a lot of you. üíï"
Is this it or is it something else?,1,kqx125,1,"Been a while since the last time it happened, but I figured I'm curious about if I may have found what it is on this sub. For as long as I can remember, infrequently but a couple of times per year, I get this. Being that it's so infrequent I have always had a hard time really putting a pattern on it, if there is any to find.

I could be having a conversation with my mother at her kitchen table over a coffee. Suddenly, and without warning, I feel like my awareness detatches from everything (including myself) and I look at things almost with a new set of eyes through my own. My mother looks like a complete stranger, yet I know who she is and I recognize her at the same time. It almost feels like for a split second I have no idea who she is, until an entire lifetime of experiences and memories come surging back trying to fill the feeling of being a stranger. My vision feels like it's slightly vibrating, as though two sets of eyes are competing for the same job.

Likewise, I have had experiences looking at myself in the mirror and bein aware of myself. I have tried to explain this feeling to other people who mostly say ""yeah, I can also see and be aware that it's me there"". But that's not the feeling, I can look into a mirror and see me and know that it's me. But these moments I get, I am highly *aware* of me. As though I was looking at somene else, yet at the same time know that it's my reflection.

Or as me and my SO was out walking, it felt like I was given a reality gut punch. As if hit by an invisible wave just knocked my concious outside of everything. Everything felt too real, I audibly gasped, I was aware of too much, but as a spectator inside myself. I am simultaneously aware of it while never losing grip of what was before. So I could tell my SO to give me a moment and she gets it, but she could tell I was looking at her as though I had never met her before for a second."
Do you experience these or could it be something else.,5,kqnztk,3,"I‚Äôm not sure if I dissociate but it‚Äôs come to my attention lately and I thought I‚Äôd look more into it. I know I have some trauma related to my dad but I‚Äôm not exactly sure what. My mom passed away recently and I‚Äôve had to live with my dad which I haven‚Äôt done since I was 9 I think ,(I‚Äôm 16 now) and some reactions have definitely resurfaced. I knew I was scared of him but honestly I don‚Äôt really know why, I can‚Äôt tell if I just have a weirdly strong grudge against him or if there‚Äôs more but I just can‚Äôt remember. He never did anything that bad, mainly emotional manipulation, but I feel like it wasn‚Äôt bad enough for me to completely forget all of it. I feel like it has to be pretty severe trauma for you to block out an entire part of you‚Äôre life, I could be wrong. 

Anyways, i cannot stop staring at things. I thought I had adhd (that might still be a possibility I‚Äôm not sure, I don‚Äôt know anything about myself and I‚Äôm bad at perceiving myself so I‚Äôm not really able to tell if I actually have symptoms or if I am faking them.) it does not happen most of the time but when I feel really disconnected, I find myself just staring at nothing for so so long and I can‚Äôt stop even if I try. It happens a lot at dinner because we eat dinner as a family, so my dads there. It is happening right now, I‚Äôm struggling to write this because I keep zoning out. 

Also when I‚Äôm disconnected I feel like I can‚Äôt feel things as much physically. I have a heated blanket. When it‚Äôs at full heat it‚Äôs usually is so hot that it burns a little bit, i rarely have it above 5 (out of 10). I can barely feel it right now and it‚Äôs at 10. 

I also get scared of myself in the mirror a lot. I made a joke about it to my friends awhile ago and they were all really confused, I didn‚Äôt know that was out of the normal. Sometimes I‚Äôm very confident in my body but sometimes I see myself in the mirror and get scared because I don‚Äôt recognize myself and it looks like someone else is standing in front of me and moving. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is a symptom at all but I figured I‚Äôd add it. I do a lot of repetitive things. I rock back and forth and fidget and I tend to listen to songs on loop especially when I‚Äôm disconnected, very hyper, or trying to block out other noise. I also go to the same park and go on the swings every day at the same time and I have for almost 4 years, even when it‚Äôs snowing. 

I have no idea which of these are dissociation signs, if any of them are, like I said I‚Äôm not very good at analyzing myself and it‚Äôs hard to compare myself to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù if I‚Äôve never experienced it before. It would help if someone could tell me if they‚Äôve experienced these things before. Sorry if the post is a little unorganized, my brain is foggy. Sorry for the long post, thank you for reading"
I‚Äôm not sure if this is considered disassociating or not.,1,kqp21r,2,"This story still bothers me. 

One time I was sleeping with a guy and during the actual act I couldn‚Äôt feel anything. Like, I couldn‚Äôt feel him touching me, I couldn‚Äôt feel the body kisses and I couldn‚Äôt feel the act itself. I remember my mind just being empty. No thoughts at all. 
We‚Äôve now been sleeping together for 2 years and that‚Äôs never happened again. 

It scares me not knowing what happened to me.

Self harm because of dissociation,4,kq51gq,2,"Has anyones self harm ever been because of dissociation?, When I look back on when I used to self harm alot of it was because I would bee feeling so dead and numb that I just wanted to feel something and so i would harm myself and use drugs, and so much of my erratic behaviour in general was for the same reason, just seeking to do crazy and dangerous things in order to feel something temporarily...now I don't do all that anymore and I feel even more empty now because that was the only way I used to express myself and feel and I haven't learnt any proper ways and strategies to heal from this, music is good but my feelings only are moved slightly from this and they are still all there under the surface waiting to explode and it's only pain and hopelessness and anger and frustration, messed up wanna get better very hard to live each day like this hey"

I feel like I am not here, and have to constantly remind myself that I am real and that my surroundings are real. I feel like I am in a shell, and I can‚Äôt take in my surroundings. My vision is weird too, like sometimes things seem dimmed. There are moments through my day that I feel as if I have ‚Äúwoken up.‚Äù (Things seem clearer and my thoughts seems clearer.) I feel like I‚Äôm moving in liquid sometimes if that makes sense. I experience normal emotion although I feel extremely disconnected from it. I can no longer focus on the things I enjoy doing anymore. Most of the time I can handle this, it has become my new normal and I have hopes that it will eventually go away. Lately it has caused me to have day to day panic attacks, and I was wondering if anyone had any coping skills they could suggest that I could try myself?"

"Psycho,Socio or What am I?",2,kpq1x2,9,"I dont usually feel the empathy to the situations where peoole usually feel it. Like for example, there's this videos where family members was massacred and my friends symphatized to it while I just pretended so they wont see me as a bad person. This is just one example of many situations where Im supposed to feel something.I remember when I was in high school and I saw a child being hit by a motorcycle. Luckily the child survived. The disturbing thing is inside my mind, I grinned a little. Im 27 now. Ive searched the traits of a psychopath and sociopath and now Im confused because I still feel that I would vomit for extremely gory things.(I have a bit high tolerance) I still feel sad and cry a little bit if I read or watch scenes in movies or dramas that will really take ur soul. But in real life, lets say 60-70% of the time I feel empty. I only get emotions if Im with my fiance and in work or with friends, mostly I just show fake emotions to go along but inside my mind, Im just having a poker face feeling empty. I think my situation is disturbing. Can anybody explain something.Please help me."

Posted this awhile back in r/DPDR but that this may relate to a few of you. Happy New Years guys,10,kpeo8q,5,"Read this if you think you‚Äôre going insane. Trust me, you‚Äôre not. This is a disorder within the brain and there are true paths towards recovery. First we must understand what it is we face before we can take proper steps to overcome it. Hope this helps.

I‚Äôve been dealing with DPDR for about 2 years now with a marijuana-induced panic attack serving as the trigger for the dissociation. Over the past 2 years I have learned quite a lot about the workings of my brain and due to the obsessive rumination, have spent plenty of time researching DPDR. The main thing I have found is that DPDR will not go away on its own and although your mind may be bombarded with philosophical, existential questions regarding the state of your reality, you cannot think your way out of this disorder. Trust me, I‚Äôve tried. DPDR is linked with trauma but that‚Äôs merely the surface level. DPDR has many parts and can be described both psychologically and biologically. 

Psychologically, DPDR is a chronic dissociative disorder which serves as a defense mechanism towards the burden of excess stress on the mind. This stress can root from both explicit traumatic events such as car accidents/sexual abuse or implicit trauma from the past. Even though you may want DPDR to go away, your mind thinks it is helping you by putting a barrier between you and reality (which it perceives as a threat). Now, as we go a bit deeper we must discuss attachment theory. Attachment theory has been used to further understand dissociation. Our mind has something called an attachment behavioral system which is a system within our brain which is responsible for our innate desire for comfort from our parents during infancy through childhood. An attachment style is the way an infant thinks, feels, and behaves towards the parent and is influenced by the way the parent reacts when confronted by the infant in need of emotional reassurance of security. There are 4 types of attachment however for the sake of this post, I‚Äôll speak only of the one which creates a predisposition for DPDR. That attachment style is called disorganized attachment. This attachment style occurs when the parent is either frightened of the child or appears frightening to the child which creates confusion within the child‚Äôs mind when it seeks solace from the parent. The innate desire for comfort from the parents starts to clash with the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù part of the mind which results in a disorganized attachment style. (A BIG thing to keep in mind is that the parent doesn‚Äôt always have to be purposely physically/emotionally abusing the child but may be doing so without realizing.) This attachment style then becomes internalized through something called an internal working model which is what influences how we interact with the world on an interpersonal level and affects the way we react both consciously and subconsciously to stressful situations later in life. As the disorganized attached child ages, it will begin to inhibit the attachment behavioral system by either controlling the parent/child interaction through a competitive means or a caregiving means. One uses the social ranking system which mediates the dominant/submissive roles and the other exhibits behaviors such as entertaining, comforting, or giving approval to the parent. These role-reversal behaviors will then form 4 different ego states which is how the child makes sense of the interaction with its attachment figure (parent). 

1.) The Victim Self: The parent is representative as the cause of the fear within the child 
2.) The Persecutor Self: The child believes itself to be the cause of fear within the parent 
3.) The Rescuer Self: The child believes itself to be the cause of security or comfort within the frightened parent 
4.) The Confused and Helpless Self: The child believes itself and the parent to be threatened by an unknown source of danger 

As these ego states internalize, they are used as a guideline for the way in which the child processes future situations. For those with disorganized attachment, these ego states work contradictory towards one another making stressful situations even more so as our brain struggles to make sense of them. I‚Äôm still learning more about treatment however i know that integrating these ego states within the mind is foundational towards recovery from DPDR. 

Now, onto the neurobiological view on DPDR. This isn‚Äôt necessary per se, however for those who are obsessed with finding answers like i am, this helps you understand your disorder a bit better. This is going to be a lot but it will all come together in the end, trust me. First thing you need to understand is something called the Triune Brain Model. It pretty much splits the brain into three parts. 

1.) Brain Stem (Reptilian Brain)
2.) Limbic Brain (Paleo-mammalian Brain)
3.) Neocortex (Neo-mammalian Brain) 

The Brain Stem is responsible for involuntary bodily functions like breathing, heart beat, digestion, etc. Running out of the Brain Stem is something called the Vagus Nerve which connects to a plethora of bodily organs and systems. The Vagus Nerve is split into two separate Vagul Systems. One activates/deactivates the sympathetic nervous system and the other activates/deactivates the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system controls bodily functions while the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù system is active while the parasympathetic nervous system control bodily functions during normal functioning of the body. When one is on, the other is off. This system is involuntary so that means that when the mind perceives something to be life-threatening, the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù (which I‚Äôll refer to as FoF from now on) activates whether you want it to or not. People who‚Äôve gone through emotional trauma often have trouble shutting off the sympathetic nervous system. 

Next is the Limbic System which is responsible for feeling of intense emotions and houses the Amygdala and the Hippocampus (more on those later). Finally, the Neocortex which is split into two parts. The front is responsible for logical thought and planning while the back is responsible for the perception of the world through the 5 senses. 

People with DPDR have parts of Triune Brain that have disintegrated (no longer working together) which inhibits the brain from working properly. 

The next concept you need to understand is the lateralization of brain function which is the separation of the two sides of the brain. The left side is responsible for logical and verbal functions. The right side is responsible for emotional and visceral processing on a preverbal level. 

The next parts of the brain you need to know are the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) which is used when planning or when abstract thinking is necessary and the Hippocampus which stores verbal, explicit memories such as ‚ÄúI went to my grandparents house.‚Äù Memories which you can put into a factual sentences. These two parts of the brain work together to form the DLPFC-Hippocampus Axis which serves as the core of the rational mind, often referred to as the Observer Self when speaking in context of dissociative disorders. DPDR described on a very simple level is a split between the Observer Self and the Experiencing Self. 

Next is the Orbital and Medial Prefrontal Cortex (OMPFC) which serves as the seat of social/emotional reasoning and is responsible for emotions within a social setting and feelings of empathy. This works with the Amygdala, which we‚Äôll talk about later, to help regulate emotional reasoning. 

Next is the Insula or the Insular Cortex which is a small part of the brain which we‚Äôve carried over through evolution and is responsible for any feeling felt within the body (itch, having to pee, etc) also known as interoception. It‚Äôs responsibilities also include the physiological sensations felt that are evoked by emotions. Example: feeling butterflies in your stomach when you are nervous. Located within the Insula are Spindle Neurons which allow us to engage in empathy. These neurons can also be found in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex which is involved in motivation, emotional control, reward anticipation, and emotional awareness. When you journal and bring awareness to your emotional trauma, you are activating the Anterior Cingulate and Insula which is extremely helpful towards your DPDR recovery and can help reduce psychosomatic illnesses. 

I promise we‚Äôre getting close, thanks for hanging in there with me. This next part is extremely important. 

The Amygdala is responsible for our deep emotions such as fear, anger, and lust. It‚Äôs also responsible for housing implicit, procedural memories such as the behaviors we talked about in the psychological section of this post to the process of driving a car or shooting a basketball. The Amygdala is developed within 8 months of pregnancy so that you have a functioning one as soon as you are born. However our Hippocampus doesn‚Äôt fully develop until we are around the age of 2 or 3. The Amygdala also allows us to process and react to dangerous situations using the FoF system. Remember how i said the FoF is involuntary, well, people with DPDR have an Amygdala (which is responsible for FoF) that is misfiring and hijacking the PFC (which is responsible for logical thought and reasoning) and causing the brain to perceive a constant threat which may lead to illogical thoughts or perceptions about reality. 

Finally we have the Hippocampal-Amygdaloid Axis. Both the Hippocampus and the Amygdala work in conjunction and separate from each other to help store memories in our brain. Like i said before, the Hippocampus stores explicit, verbal, factual recollections of a memory. While the Amygdala will store implicit, preverbal, emotional recollections of the same memory. One recollection being ‚ÄúI visited my grandparents house.‚Äù And the other being the feelings, both emotional and physiological, you had while you were there that you can‚Äôt quite put into words. Every memory, whether good or bad, will leave traces in both the Hippocampus and the Amygdala and both traces are used when recalling a certain memory. However like i said before, the Hippocampus does not fully develop until the ages of 2 or 3 meaning that explicit traces of a memory won‚Äôt be stored in the brain (which is why we can‚Äôt remember being a baby). But since the amygdala is functioning during that time, implicit traces will still be stored in the brain during infancy. This directly relates to attachment theory which we discussed earlier. 

Now, if a trauma is severe enough an explicit trace won‚Äôt be stored in the Hippocampus even after the ages of 2-3 due to the large amount of cortisol (stress chemical) released in the brain and the effects of that are seen in patients with PTSD who hit the ground instinctively when a car backfires. Not everyone with DPDR have PTSD and vice-versa. 

In summary, people with DPDR have an Amygdala which is constantly activating the FoF system due to high levels of built up stress over time and emotional trauma that has gone unprocessed. 

The recovery for DPDR is based in finding ways to integrate the explicit memories of the Hippocampus, the emotional memory section of the Amygdala, and the emotional reasoning of the Orbital and Medial Prefrontal Cortex so that we can begin to process the emotional traumas that we have locked away within our brains because we had no one to turn to as we grew and developed over the years due to a disorganized attachment style. 

I really hope this helps you better understand what it is you are going through. It took me 2 years to figure this all out and I‚Äôm still learning more about recovery as you‚Äôre reading this. I‚Äôll be sure to fill you guys in as I go along. Just know, for those going through chronic DPDR (longer than 6 months) that you‚Äôre not alone and that you‚Äôre not going insane. There have been so many times over the past few years that recovery seemed hopeless due to the small amounts of information on the surface level of the internet and my mind has drifted to suicide or some other form of escape from the reality I‚Äôm forced to observe but cannot experience. If any of you are going through this, chasing a reality you once lived, one of normalcy, please contact me directly if you have any questions or just want to talk. We‚Äôre gonna get through this."
I feel like I‚Äôm in the Truman show,6,kpgbpk,2,Lately I have been scrolling through social media and I‚Äôve convinced myself that the people that I‚Äôm seeing (old classmates and friends) don‚Äôt actually exist and that everything im seeing has been specifically  formulated for me to see almost as if they themselves are like the ads that pop up when you talk about a certain thing??? I have no idea if any of that makes sense but I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it. Ive also been experiencing this weird sensation that often occurs when I am in the bathroom. It feels as if I am in a dream and I‚Äôm doing something that I‚Äôm not supposed to be doing but I can‚Äôt wake myself up. I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind.
has anyone else created a traumatic alternative/imaginary life since childhood?,26,kp5l9m,9,"I'm not sure where the right place to post this is but it's the community I've found that is that can be the closest described to what I've experienced.  I have started to feel uncomfortable by the fact that I still am expanding and building on this same alternative life in my head since childhood and was wondering if anyone else has done this? I think for me what is a bit, not shameful, but unsettling is that I have had a happy childhood and adulthood but this alternate life is quite tragic. 

Ever since I was a kid, I developed an alternative life, in which I am the central character. This life is a product of several interests of mine from royalty to travel to whatever. But as the protagonist I go through or bare witness to several traumatic experiences and I often find that I have long conversations with imaginary or often real life people (that I have never met, but have added to my imaginary world) about these events, where I reason out my feelings and thoughts on them. In this life I have a different name, position/status, that don't really bare resemblance to me in reality. 

Also this isn't a fantasy world like Narnia, but rather very much the real world - but I am a made up character in it. It has no effect on my normal life and I find it easy to switch back and forth between my reality and this made up one in my head. I have played at this character since I was probably 10 or so and am now in my mid 20s. I have no other imaginary worlds or anything like that - but this one alternate life has been the one consistent imaginary reality of mine for so long. It's mostly for entertainment but since this alternative life is way more challenging and traumatic than my own I find it unsettling that i do it. I certainly never want to experience the trauma I've created in this alternative life in my own real life, so I can't understand for the life of me if this is okay?"
spent so much money on ACNH & i can‚Äôt even play it anymore,3,kpc947,1,sorry for 2 posts in a row but i just got a switch for christmas & i bought animal crossing new horizons a couple days ago. i‚Äôve been playing it everyday because i was really excited & have wanted it since it came out (ive been playing pocket camp religiously just waiting for the day i could get it). but after having an episode today i realized that playing it is what caused it .... (i know playing for multiple hours a day is also my fault & i should‚Äôve limited my screen time more) but like why can‚Äôt i just be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and enjoy a video game without completely losing my grip on reality because of it. now i‚Äôm scared to even play it anymore because of this association so i‚Äôve basically ruined this expensive game i‚Äôve wanted for so long for myself...why is my brain like this.
Does anyone dissociate while doing routine activities?,30,koy8d5,2,I often find myself dissociating when brushing my teeth or washing my hands and end up doing it for 10+ minutes. My therapist is trying to help me with this. Does this happen to anyone else?
Very annoying dissociation,3,kpasna,2,"Hello guys. I'm going through a real pickle. A few months ago I had a panic attack. Luckily I believe it is only because I was going through a shit ton of stress with college and my new adult life. I was immediately put on Zoloft and since then Ive gotten a ton better. Unfortunately, one of the lingering effects of my attack I keep having is dissociation. Before I got over it but it has come back at full force. Now I'm starting to wonder how reality came to be, where we just suddenly came from, what happens after we die, if there is another state of reality that could exist, and the list can go on. 

I currently have GAD and some slight depression but I'm trying to get a hold on that.

I'm just afraid this is gonna be like that forever and/or I'm just afraid to reality ending or something bad happening to it. Also I'm just afraid that I could be going insane or something.

Any tips or thoughts?"
seeing people post about where they hope to see themselves in a year & im like my brain can barely register that i‚Äôm here in the present & you expect me to think about a whole year into the future LMAO,55,kosy7j,4,i‚Äôm lucky if i can even picture what state im gonna be in tomorrow

New Year‚Äôs Eve was the 4 year anniversary of the last time I did a psychedelic.,18,kofk49,6,"Last night I was thrown into the most terrible flashback trip and dissociated to the point of feeling I was not inside my body, feeling like I was dead. It lasted 7 minutes of panicking hallucinating flashback trip then I just stayed dissociated for hours, I was so out of it I was falling asleep every time I closed my eyes at work and my Schizoaffective disorder symptoms went crazy, I heard singing and clear voices talking to me, at one point I heard a child‚Äôs voice beckoning me inside a giant machine at work, and felt like I was being tormented by ghosts all night. 

This shit is terrifying and I hate my brain and I wish I never messed with any drugs."
Loss of thought,12,koalv0,2,"This symptom started to become most evident in therapy. I can handle being detached from the real world when I'm isolated from everyone and no one talks to me. I can pretend I am functional to people who don't give a shit about me. But in therapy, when I am asked to talk about myself and my life, I start to lose my thoughts. Honestly, it freaks me out sometimes. 

I start to feel like I'm floating, like I'm drunk. Just, confused as hell. My therapist will ask me ""What are you thinking about right now?"" and I will be like ""I don't know. Nothing"". Because I really *have no thoughts*. I check out. It's really getting in the way of therapy. I am desperate to make some progress, discuss about my past, my feelings, but I am so muted. I can't just force my thoughts into my mind. They are BLOCKED. I feel stuck, and frustrated with myself."

Allergies as medical trauma,11,knso6j,4,"I have constant allergic rhinitis( mostly nasal complaints) causing by mites at a high degree from very early childhood and cant get out of it by classic antihistamines like Levmont etc. i have tried sublingual immunotheraphy prior age 10(am 23 now)which didnt work either. Afterwarda, I came to a point which I didnt care its existence anymore, dropped out any kind of treatment completely and lived with it as it was the way I was born. Recently, I have started disaociation theraphy but nothing came feom it since I am even unable to talk with the therapist about my complaints but keep asking wuestions like will I be okay etc. and he prescribed me with seroquel hoping I will get over this panic/ paralyzed state and will start talking soon. Since then, I‚Äôm almost always asleep. 

Today, ehen I was waking up, I realised my serious nasal blockage and that I couldnt breath via my nose ever and reseaeched sleep apnea which can be caused by allergies apparently. Then I have read some articles indicating the relationship between allergies and poor mental health. Since then I am thinking if it is possible that when I was dissociating the fact that I have allergies, would it be possible that I have dissociated myself entirely? What are your opinions as allergies might be the cause of some kind of a medical trauma?"
Drinking while dissociating,1,ko3ny1,3,Quick question: Can I drink while dissociating?
Okay but same,142,kn56kr,4,
Doubting someone's existence,5,kngr7g,6,"Just wondering if anyone else doubts the existence of people in their life. 

My friend and I recently cut off contact with each other. We fuelled each other's mental illness and ended up being too destructive together. It just wasn't going to work anymore and we had to cut off contact abruptly after a major fight. 

I have a constant need to destroy any proof of our relationship because he triggers so much of my worst episodes. At my worst, the combination of my dissociative amnesia, fabricated memories and psychosis makes me sometimes doubt he existed entirely. 

Intuitively, I know he's real (through proof like pictures and others in my life that know him) but the thought of me being capable of fabricating a whole person I've known for five years always brings on dissociative episodes. Losing touch with reality for so long makes me question the existence of a lot of things, but it's always primarily centred around him. 

That's kind of been my experience if anyone has ever went through anything similar."
Dissociation Feels Like Sleepwalking While Awake,5,kn7fjd,0,"I‚Äôve been really trying to focus on staying present/working through my trauma and there are moments where I literally feel like I‚Äôm waking up into my life...I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it, but it‚Äôs almost as if I was sleepwalking and then all of a sudden find myself here...and for a moment I can see everything very clearly, almost from a distance...and then I lose it again....

Which is frustrating because I really like my life...I‚Äôve worked hard at getting to a safe place and I don‚Äôt want to just float through it...

I don‚Äôt want to fog out and have my life disappear on me...if that makes sense....

is there anything you guys can recommend that worked for you...but in some minor details...I know meditation helps me a lot, but I also have ADHD so it‚Äôs tricky for me to do it as part of my routine rather than in the moment, like when I‚Äôm feeling anxious..."
Studying + Dissociation = Forgetting,13,kn1cgc,2,"When I am studying I have massively started dissociating I‚Äôll forget everything that happens and see that the whole day has passed and I haven‚Äôt moved or have no clue what‚Äôs happened, does anyone know what can help change or reduce this?"
Am I the only one who appreciates this sometimes?,2,knc56u,1,"I used to have anxiety when I spoke, because I was afraid to stutter or mispronounce a word.  Standard stuff, but now I can just sort of mute it.  I just stuff it down and speak anyways, without actively...or consciously caring.  It‚Äôs super neat, but I do come off as spacey or high.   This isn‚Äôt even bad, because it sort of fits my entire persona.  People think I‚Äôm a spacey hippie or a stoner, which is only awful at job interviews.  Also, not sure if it completely correlates, but I‚Äôm pretty damn objective.  I can see the pros and the cons of just about anything because I just don‚Äôt know how I feel or what I want enough to be too biased.

Otherwise, yeah it sucks that I can‚Äôt read on command and my memory isn‚Äôt amazing. Sometimes the disassociation to anxiety ratio is unbalanced and I‚Äôm in a spaced out and panicky state. Also, I‚Äôm very indecisive.  


All I‚Äôm saying is that there are two sides to every coin."
"An excellent illustration (IMO) of trauma and dissociation (Stargate Atlantis, S2:E14, Grace Under Pressure)",2,kn6v7l,0,
Scared of dissociating,2,kn4kc8,0,"Ever since I was very young, I would dissociate frequently. It never bothered me and I would sometimes trigger it intentionally when I was stressed. However, I've recently become phobic about dissociation to such an extent that I can't sit in class, enter stores or walk down the street. I become overwhelmed and as soon as I begin to detach from reality, I panic so hard that I can barely walk. My life has become extremely limited. 

Does anyone else experience this? And if so, what helps you?"
The Reaper missed me by a few seconds,2,kn4joi,0,"    I was out of the house to get groceries so there‚Äôs this traffic crossing we have to take after a few other junctions. I was in a dissociative state (a combination of depersonalisation and derealisation ) but my sister doesn‚Äôt know about my condition. My family doesn‚Äôt know.

    So as I was crossing the road with my sister yesterday when the light was green for the pedestrians when a car drove past at blinding speed and narrowly took me out of if it weren‚Äôt for my sister‚Äôs fast agility and speed.

       Thanks sis for saving my life. Sorry you always have to be the one looking out for me. I hope to repay you someday.

     Ps: Thanks dissociation for rendering me into a disconnected shell of a person. :)"
How do I function when whenever someone is talking to me it causes dissociation?,12,kmtccj,1,"I‚Äôm dissociated every day. Probably for years or even since I was a kid. 

My mom and stepdad were verbally abusive growing up. I‚Äôve gone through a lot of trauma. 

Not one single conversation/words from them would ever be positive, even now. 

It feels like whenever anyone talks TO me I fall into a hole and can‚Äôt get out for days.

"Emotionally detached, how to make friends and cope during coronavirus?",2,kn1ojv,1,"Ok so first off sorry for any typos and grammar or lack of it I'm on my phone using voice input as I'm basically impaired.

So I've got a range of mental health symptoms although I've only been diagnosed with depression and anxiety OVO I'm absolutely certain I've got emotional detachment as I've had it for maybe about half my life now I'm 20 DY8 btw.

I'm in England and yeah I'm struggling with the lock down because normally I can just get to a meetup.com group Andover I'm usually very quiet and struggle to socialise you know it's better than nothing but with lock downs meetup.com is only doing online 9 9zoo meetings and like I say I still go with physical social interaction so yeah I don't think I could cope well with zoom calls.

So any advice on how to cope question mark I know that's a broad invade question but I'm really not coping well so literally any advice would be appreciated. Like I say I struggle socially but during normal times I can just about get by by being in a group on meetup.com man in out and there at least even if I don't talk much. Because yeah I struggle to know what to say to people care about them at all all I do care about some people such as family and my best friend my only friend and, but I can talk to them more you know because they get me at least a lot more than the average person.

So yeah any tips on how to cope better or make friends online anything like that would be much appreciated thanks in advance :) .

also I know I haven't gone into too much specifics on yes Pacific things on how my mental health issues affect me socially but I didn't want this post to get too long but she's got any questions feel free to ask."

Dissociation vs depression,16,kmkqja,3,"I can't really tell the difference between the two with myself. Am I emotionally cold because of depression or because I am emotionally dissociating? Am I having a hard time getting motivated to do work because I'm depressed or because I'm not really existing in reality rn?

I'm going through kind of a low point rn and want to work on myself, but idk what to work on. And I don't have access to a therapist atm. Probably in a couple months. My previous therapist is the one who diagnosed me with dpdr, but we didn't get a chance to unpack whether my symptoms of depression are actually dpdr or whatever before I had to stop seeing them. I'm getting a surgery done in a couple weeks and I'm a little concerned about post-surgical depression. Or maybe worse dpdr since my body will be going through a trauma. I'm kinda rambling here...

what are some presentations/kinds of dissociation that people don't often talk about?,5,kmt3vs,6,"so i've been wondering this for a while, but i recently found the occasion to ask because someone suggested that i might be dissociating based on a behavior that i would've never associated with dissociation, and now i just have to ask (which is not to say that i'm looking for anything in particular here -- i have a therapist to talk to about this, and knowing whether i dissociate or not wouldn't make a huge difference in my life; i'm honestly just curious). the question is basically: **we've all heard of the ""feels like i'm dreaming"" or ""there's a wall between me and the world"" or ""out-of-body experience"" kinds of dissociation (classic dpdr-type stuff), but what are some presentations/kinds of dissociation that people don't often talk about?**"
is this dissociation or zoning out or something else??,2,kmpqq9,0,"this thing sometimes happens where i feel like distant in my mind. like i‚Äôm there but i feel like i‚Äôm in the back of my mind?? it‚Äôs super confusing and it feels so weird. i tend to do it a lot more than i used to, usually when i have a headache (it sometimes makes the headache worse), or like if i‚Äôm anxious or scared and stuff like that. it also happens when i‚Äôm in a really like depressed mood. if anyone could possibly give me more information it would be really helpful."

medication?,2,kmkp2s,1,"does anyone take medication for their anxiety, and if so did it help with dissociation? i‚Äôve been dissociated every day for the past 3 months and i am losing hope that i‚Äôll ever feel again. will anxiety medication help me feel again?"
I have dissociated for an entire year,30,km6yxc,14,I have all but forgotten what it feels like to be alive. I don‚Äôt know what to do. This is all I am capable of typing.
"first post, have been dissociating for years.& my therapists have never been super helpful",15,km94xd,2,(disclaimer: i‚Äôm not sure of the differences between dissociation / derealization / depersonalization so i‚Äôm not sure which i experience) i first started dissociating after a major family death my senior year of high school (which also sent me into a major existential crisis that lasted for over a year & was continually triggering) for the next year my episodes never lasted more than a few hours but they were super intense like i would be sitting in my bedroom & would have no idea where i was. the year after that (i was in a really unhealthy relationship that left me constantly anxious & triggered) my episodes got longer & i think at one point lasted months (i also got super paranoid at one point but i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a dissociation thing ?) over the last year ive had three major episodes that lasted a really long time & i have pretty much no idea what to do about it. ive brought it up to different therapists ive had and they‚Äôve all basically just told me to do breathing exercises & stuff i already do for my anxiety which i haven‚Äôt found super helpful. (they also never really explained it much to me & most of what i know has come from my own research) i‚Äôve tried different grounding techniques & obviously there‚Äôs no magic fix but i just don‚Äôt have any sort of plan or coping mechanisms in place & the anxiety that comes from the fear of having an episode is awful.
Can‚Äôt tell if I had break in my dissociation,5,kmc7bu,2,"I swear whenever I come out of dissociation I become hyper aware of everything like when was the last time I looked at my toes, my hands look real, everything looks real and I‚Äôm here?

Something is different...
wtf happened???? Am I dissociating still or did it stop briefly???
What‚Äôs wrong with me???
My words I‚Äôm typing...
They‚Äôre like...idk how to explain it...
Blurry???
Fuck I think I‚Äôm doing it again?? Idk 
It‚Äôs so hard to type that word.
Disassociating??? Ughhhhhhghh
So much anxiety I hate this 
I waved my hand in front of my face and it‚Äôs lagging again. I‚Äôve started dissociating again. My hand when I stopped dissociating was normal. Crap. 
Glitch in the matrix hahahahahahahah no
God I‚Äôm like hyper aware of every sound????
Wtf
I‚Äôm still dissociating but I guess not as hard as before. But it definitely stopped for a bit.
Weird.
Idk what‚Äôs wrong with me.
Too much stress this past year maybe? Maybe...idk.
Everything seems so new...like I haven‚Äôt been here for the past two weeks or however long I‚Äôve been here???

Idk how else to explain it...

Driving and dissociation,10,km80lc,7,"Hi dissocia-dudes (idk, y'all are dissocia-dudes now)! Just wanted to do a quick ""can someone else relate?"" post.
So I am getting my license, and have noticed that driving is just so strange. I constantly am checking the speed indicator because I know I might forget that I might speed. I almost (and got dangerously close a couple times) got in several crashes because I didn't react to what my parents were literally yelling to do. Feels like you have to work twice as hard to pay attention, especially when you (probably) have ADHD like me (ah, mental illness. Fun times, eh).
Isn't it all so weird???"
I‚Äôm sick of this,25,klzafx,2,"My dissociation has gotten out of control due to constant stress and trauma this year. It‚Äôs to the point where it‚Äôll happen pretty much once a day at least. I‚Äôm obviously ‚Äòout of it‚Äô when it happens to me, to the point where I won‚Äôt remotely act like myself because I just won‚Äôt snap back and focus. Honestly its been exhausting enough as is, but what‚Äôs kinda worse is knowing how people view me when I get like this. It hurts when I come home at night, go over my day and realize how many people treated me like I was dumb or childish. It would be nice to chalk it up as anxiety or something but I honestly don‚Äôt even have minor anxiety. It really is just multiple people making it a point to be rude to me because I‚Äôm ‚Äòdumb‚Äô‚Äî strangers, friends, coworkers, etc all treating me different, acting like I‚Äôm high, or even suggesting that I should ‚Äòget checked‚Äô for random mental disorders I know I don‚Äôt have. I try to explain sometimes but I know people don‚Äôt really get it. It‚Äôs so frustrating and honestly just hurts especially when people I care about and respect just talk down to me. Honestly I used to be a very outgoing and happy go lucky person before it got bad. Now I‚Äôm starting to just hate being around anyone because I know they aren‚Äôt seeing ‚Äòme‚Äô. I‚Äôm not sure this makes sense but I guess I just want to know if anyone else feels like this and how you guys handle it?"
Does anyone‚Äôs eyes feel heavy and tired when they r dissociating like I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm tired or dissociating it‚Äôs a werid feeling,2,km9yct,1,
When you are dissociating do you ever ‚Äúgo to sleep‚Äù,34,klk9kj,13,"I dont know how to describe it, sometimes i dissociate to a point where its almost like ive fallen asleep but my eyes are still open if that makes sense.

"Questions, advice and whatnot.",2,klymlt,3,"Hopefully I don‚Äôt sound like a dumbass, but here goes.
So, lately I‚Äôve been feeling really... Weird. Like, periodically I‚Äôll experience feelings where everything becomes super surreal and I feel really small and, almost like a different person if that makes sense. I feel super detached. It takes me a while to come down but when I‚Äôm like that I get really scared and shy.

Does this sound like dissociation? I don‚Äôt even know what to think anymore, I just wish I didn‚Äôt feel like this."
I need advice.,14,kllwsi,9,"I feel like reality is broken. I don‚Äôt even know if this is entirely a dissociation thing, but this is the closest place I could think of putting it. 

So, I‚Äôm 19, my life hasn‚Äôt by any means been awful, but it also hasn‚Äôt been particularly pretty. Ive had a lot of pretty traumatic experiences. My dad was always pretty mentally abusive to me and for the most part caused the majority of my dissociation, along with the death of my cat. I‚Äôve also had numerous suicide attempts, one of them being especially traumatic. 

From around late middle school to high school, I‚Äôve always felt very different from everyone else. I don‚Äôt mean different as in I‚Äôm quirky or unique, but more so in that I just.. didn‚Äôt get it. I didn‚Äôt understand how everyone could be so caught up with such meaningless things. Everything just seemed so basic and uninteresting. I felt like I was just missing some vital key part of being a human. In the more recent years, since I left school, I‚Äôve been realizing a lot of really weird stuff about life that I really don‚Äôt know how to put into words here. Sometimes it just feels like I don‚Äôt know how to assign meaning to things. Everything just kind of.. breaks. Screens become meaningless pixels of light, trees and the beauty of nature turns into organisms just trying to survive. Nothing feels right.


It feels like I don‚Äôt know how to act normal when I‚Äôm alone, like I just never know what to do. Sometimes I‚Äôll just sit somewhere doing nothing but watching the time go by. 

Of course, this isn‚Äôt a constant thing, and I do generally enjoy life, despite me being fairly suicidal. But when it rains, it pours. It‚Äôs like this switch in my brain just turns off and everything just stops.

Picture it like this: your in a party, there‚Äôs flashing lights, people dancing, loud music. But then suddenly, everything just stops. The lights shut off, everyone‚Äôs gone, there‚Äôs no music, no color. It‚Äôs just you in a big empty room. There‚Äôs no emotion, no meaning, nothing. Of course in reality everything is still happening around you, but to you, it just feels like nothing. It feels like your seeing something your not supposed to see, like something behind the scenes of reality itself. This is what it feels like for me.


Adding onto this, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs entirely related but I‚Äôve always felt very uncomfortable looking into my own eyes. Like, it feels like whenever I stare directly into my eyes, I don‚Äôt see anything looking back at me, it feels like I‚Äôm looking at an empty vessel. 

I‚Äôve never really been able to get a good grasp on personal identity in general honestly.. but as I said, that could be unrelated.

Anyways, that‚Äôs really all I can say in terms of explaining my mind. If you actually read this far, then I appreciate you taking the time out of your life to take interest in some random stranger on the internet."

Realizations,2,klqlq0,1,"I turned forty this year and I have realized so much about myself. One being that I have been dissociating for as far back as I can remember, which is middle school, since I have few memories from before that point. I seriously started therapy this year, which is moving along well. I have mentioned to my T that I dissociate, just not to the frequency. I had a major trauma happen a few years ago and some more ‚Äúminor‚Äù traumas since then (which feel way worse as I am still in active trauma mode). I dissociate on a daily basis. Thing is, I‚Äôm totally unsure as to how frequent before and the intensity before this point. I know it sounds terrible that I‚Äôm unsure of the past, but it is what it is.

Am I dissociating?,22,kl4e3d,8,"Hi, I'm new to this subreddit.

I (21F) notice that a lot of the times throughout the day I'm simply not present.

Spending all this time alone in lockdown is making me dissociate so much,37,kkk3d3,4,"My (22F) dissociation is sometimes triggered by emotions like anxiety and anger but it only lasts a short time when that happens.

My dissociation is getting out of hand & I want to find ways I can keep it under control.,17,kke2bj,4,"Hi there- I (17 F) am new to this board. I have been dealing with DD - more specifically depersonalization/derealization - for about as long as I can remember. It has gotten progressively worse within the past 2 1/2 years and is only getting more and more terrible. It first started with the weird ‚Äúout of body, perspective‚Äù type deal when zoning out & then got to the point were I would feel high (not in a good way) without ingesting any drugs. I have a terrible memory and cannot remember nearly anything from the past year that has happened to me and I am assuming that is my DD to blame.

Anyways, more recently I have noticed my DD is starting to mess with my vision. As im talking to someone their face gets all warped, or it looks like my depth goes out in my vision (say person was standing in the middle of the room & the depth perception goes out on me, said person looks like they are up against the wall when they in fact are not). Looking in the mirror makes my face warp, and things look like theyre warping behind me. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this DD or am I mistaking it for something else? How do I make this stop?"
REAL SUCCESS STORY - How Max Has Won 10+ Yrs Of DPDR in 2 Sessions [INTERVIEW],1,kkl6eh,0,"How good does it feel to hug a person you love and FEEL their body, warmth and feel connected with them? To just be present and here with the people you love without drifting off? To laugh and FEEL it's YOU laughing not a robot? For Max that dream has become reality. üòç

He had dissociation and anxiety, more specifically: brain fog, dreamy feeling, a constant 24/7 dissociation ""for no reason"", along with a certain sense of guilt for being happy and enjoying oneself and an overall feeling that the world is unsafe no matter who you are and what you do and achieve.

Despite he done many years of research, read self-improvement books, worked with doctors and therapists, changed diets, used pills and supplements, he still didn't get to the core of dissociation and anxiety.

Like most of my students, he thought ""everything is okay"", I don't have traumas, my past is okay, etc. which of course adds to the frustration in trying to solve a problem that seems to happen ""for no reason"". üòÆ

Being focused, energetic, motivated, excited, feeling emotions, being present, feeling connected, feeling himself - these are some of the improvements that he has noticed in our collaboration (2 sessions total + a few quick follow ups).

So how did we do this? We did this with hypnosis and with my unique understanding of how the mind works knowing what the REAL problem is and what the REAL solution is (not what you think is the problem and what you think is the solution). üíØ

Max #1 piece of advice: You are focused on the symptoms and try to fix them. That's not the real problem!

Enjoy!

I'm a Mess Because of Dissociations,0,kk4ach,0,"Dissociating became more frequent and dangerous for me. If I dissociate bad things end up happening and if I don't my alters go wild.

Lately, I have been suffering from not being able to understand what's happening in my head. I find myself unable to concentrate in my studies nor in my daily life. I don't know... I think it's maybe due to all the problems happening and people not believing that I am living with a mental desease. I found out that I have more Evil alters in my system and they keep on doing things that make it hard for me to live my life normally. Not to mention that I constantly hear all the alters' voices at once. I find it hard to live a normal life. I really need help. I need advice in this. It's getting dangerous.

Also, if someone can explain what is happening to me I would be grateful.

Ps: I found it hard to finish this post as well because of all the noise in my head."
"I feel stuck , long term dissociating",22,kjofpw,28,"Ever since my trauma , at 7, i been stuck in what i a few years ago realized was dissociating. I think possibly before then as well, but im not sure, i don't remember much of my childhood.

I feel depressed as well. I dont know what to do. Is there any way to escape this? I cant comuicate with people or focus on anything, i cant remember most things and im not even sure im alive anymore. I dont ever feel alive. For some reason talking online is a bit easier than irl.

Is this normal?,10,kjhqgc,4,"I dissociate at least once a day, from what I assume is my severe depression and stress. It rarely has a particular trigger.

No clear cause?,2,kiy7th,1,"TW: suicidal thoughts

Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone else has either experienced or knows about this? I‚Äôve been experiencing a lot of dissociation symptoms constantly for the last few years. I feel super disconnected from reality, like I‚Äôm viewing my life but not actually living it. Nothing external feels real, everything seems plastic. I have a really hard time understanding that other people and animals are real, living things. My memory is really bad and my past experiences don‚Äôt feel like they really happened. I don‚Äôt really have a good sense of self, I look at my body and don‚Äôt feel that it‚Äôs my own, I study my hands and feet and limbs or reflection and none seem like they are mine. I feel like my personality is never really the same and changes daily based on some set of aesthetics i somewhat relate to. Basically, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a real person and everything external doesn‚Äôt seem real either. I‚Äôm aware of the fact I feel like this and want to break out of it but I haven‚Äôt been able to.  

I see a therapist and psychiatrist, I have depression and anxiety. I‚Äôve started working with my therapist in sorting this out. Mindfulness practices have helped a bit. The thing that‚Äôs hard to figure out is why I have this. I know a lot of people that experience dissociation develop it after abuse or a traumatic event. I haven‚Äôt had any of that in my life. I had a normal upbringing with a supportive family that loves me. My therapist has even told me I don‚Äôt really fit the traditional mold for someone with dissociation. The only things we‚Äôve been able to come up with is that I used to have constant suicidal thoughts for a long period of time and just really constant depression, and maybe my brain decided to use dissociation as a coping mechanism to escape these thoughts a bit? Other thing is I‚Äôm super type A and high strung so even when I‚Äôm done with work for a day, I‚Äôm constantly thinking about what else I have to do or edits I can make to a project and never really relax. 

Anyways, long winded way of asking had anyone else experienced dissociation with no really clear cause? It‚Äôs frustrating and I hate living like this, but I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve made some progress."
Religious Trauma?,6,kiik15,3,"I‚Äôve been in an almost constant state of derealization/depersonalization for around a year and a half. Probably longer. I‚Äôm not actually sure though, as because of this my memory is absolute shit and I have a hard time remembering everything from doctor‚Äôs appointments to where I set down my phone. 

I‚Äôve been trying to think on what might have caused this to happen, I have pretty bad anxiety and thought that might have been the cause since I don‚Äôt remember going through anything traumatic. Then I saw someone describe trauma as anything the takes away someone‚Äôs sense of safety. 

This set the gears turning and after a bit of research I came to the conclusion that I‚Äôd been subject to some form of religious abuse, or at least major anxiety stemming from religion. A great deal of my anxiety is because of existential thinking and the thought of ‚Äúwhat comes after‚Äù, and as a person who was raised Christian and also LGBT+ I have a constant lurking fear of being damned to torture in hell for eternity. These trains of thought can and will lead to full blown panic attacks. 

The overall point of this post is to ask if anyone has been through something similar, or if this is a plausible explanation for why I dissociate. I‚Äôm going to see a therapist in a few weeks but I‚Äôd like to know what you guys think."

Can trauma come from within?,31,ki2fsb,6,"I have had bad mental health for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve always had persecutory voices in my head that seem very real and graphic intrusive thoughts.

Is it possible the presence of bad mental health could have traumatised me? 

Now, as an adult, I have all the symptoms of trauma but I feel like I‚Äôve been this way for a long time.

Obsessive fear of dissociating,4,ki3v3k,3,"Year and a half ago I had a dissociative episode that lasted a full month. I know that sounds crazy but that‚Äôs what happened. It was triggered over essentially nothing but its led to me having a strong fear about it ever happening again. Everything that happened to me leading up to the episode and during the episode I‚Äôm afraid of. For example I was super into anime and was watching anime when the episode came on (it started as a fuckton of anxiety that turned into dissociation.) Now I don‚Äôt watch any anime anymore, ever, because it vaguely reminds me of being dissociated, and that‚Äôs enough that I can‚Äôt risk it anymore. Pok√©mon Sw/Sh got announced while I was dissociating. My best friend bought me the game for Christmas, and I couldn‚Äôt even play it for 20 minutes without panicking over my fear of dissociating. My friend asks why I don‚Äôt play the $60 gift he bought me and i don‚Äôt know what to tell him. Any music that i‚Äôve listened to while dissociated or before is not ok anymore. If I decide in my head something has the capacity to make me dissociate, it will. It‚Äôs become this stupid vicious circle of fear and negative placebos in which my fear of dissociation itself is what causes me to dissociate. It got very bad this summer. I changed my wallpaper and dissociated for three days. That sounds stupid and fake, right?? Right?? But that happened, due to various complexities and associations I had. And I know all these things have no intrinsic problems. There was once a time all these little things I used to enjoy were normal to me. But now I‚Äôm just so afraid. I don‚Äôt want to depersonalize again. It‚Äôs the worst feeling in the entire world, and I have to hellishly wait it out. I used to try brunt forcing through it, to exposure therapy my way out of this. But that just led to more inescapable dissociation. How do I convince myself something is safe when it‚Äôs my own brain causing it to not be safe?

I‚Äôm typing this post right now because I just very slightly am out of it after ‚Äúwatching‚Äù Princess Mononoke with a friend for his birthday. He‚Äôs my best friend, and I wanted nothing more but for him to be happy, so I watched it, not even watching it really but just browsing the web and occasionally checking on the movie to respond appropriately. And now that Im slightly out of it I can‚Äôt do anything else for the rest of the night. Because, it could cause just the slightest amount of new association and I can‚Äôt let that happen. It‚Äôs too risky. Just the slightest amount of ‚Äúout of it‚Äù is too much. I recently got accepted to an inpatient care thing that‚Äôs supposed to be for people with anxiety and OCD. I don‚Äôt have OCD afaik, but I guess this neurotic fear is close enough to it. But im afraid. I don‚Äôt think my insurance will cover it and I worry it won‚Äôt fix anything.

Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting this. I don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm looking for. Advice? Someone to relate? i don‚Äôt know. if you got this far, thank you for reading."

My dissociative states make me feel like Odysseus when he thinks he has been with Circe for a only day but really a year has gone by outside her kingdom.,13,khsj1g,0,"Sometimes i feel like Circe has enchanted me and played tricks on my mind and my memories. I spend so much time dissociated in my mind that when I finally pay attention to the outside world I realize a lot more time has past than I thought. I worry that one day I might wake up and feel the sorrow that Odysseus feels looking at his ship wrecked from a year of tide. 

Here is a clip of the scene:

Why do I dissociate more at night?,5,khvhou,4,"I don‚Äôt often dissociate during the day, but at night I frequently find myself feeling as if nothing is real, being hyper-aware of sensations/ my body in relation to space, etc. I have anxiety, depression, and OCD but I do not have any dissociative disorder (as far as I am aware) or PTSD. As a kid, I would sometimes feel like I was dreaming and would get very anxious about it, but I didn‚Äôt get it very often throughout my life. Now at 19 I am experiencing dissociation more often, and again, mostly at night. Anyone know why? I will try and get an appointment to talk to my therapist about this because it is not enjoyable haha. Thanks"
This is why I love dissociation.,16,khhsp4,3,"My mind. My sweet beautiful mind can make up some far out ideas that I have begun to believe during the mids of dissociative episodes. 

Hear me out. 

Everything has a nature in and of itself. There are polar reactions, like simple magnetic attraction in every atom and molecular structure that our world is composed of. Simple factual chemistry where our beautiful sense of love is just a chemical reaction. What I love about science is that it shows us the fundamental building blocks of our very being. I love to pair science by complimenting it with the stories that occultists preach - mind over matter, and old teachings, how the bible says that forgiveness is freedom... Mind, body and spirit. Our awareness, our will and the physical realm. 

I don't know WHY I'm stuck in this body watching everything I do in some weird bizarre David Attenborough style documentary, but I am. I am HERE. INSIDE. My mind extends to the very bottoms of my fingers tips and that's where I realise that everything I touch and feel, it is my mind interacting with this strange set and array of compounds around me, causing motion and all of a sudden I'm understanding physics in a new way. My depression lead me to cope through dissociation and dissociation has taken me from a world that had only one insight, to a world where everything is so weird and bizarre, magical... A place where suddenly magic is real.  Our minds are tied to our bodies, there's no detachment from that. No matter if you travel on the astral plane, you will always have your soul return to your body, unless of course you were to be on the verge of death. I don't understand why my consciousness HAS to be tied to being a bloody human but what I do realise is that every damn one of us has a consciousness, no matter how big or small. People with disabilities of the most misunderstood or ""low intelligence"", animals, plants, everything in this cosmos breathes. Everything in this cosmos is interacting with the atoms beside it. We are ALL stuck here. INSIDE. 

So instead of suicide, I travel further down my minds realisation's of this strange place, instead of exploring the outer parts of me such as using my brain electricity to turn on a light bulb, I use my third eye to make all those sparkly colours when I shut my eyes turn into beautiful meditative imagery and psychedelic artworks. In this dark space of the mind I suddenly find my body floating like a stereo typical hippie floating during mediatation and all of a sudden my body is alseep, rested and my mind is awake and free, to do anything I wish. 

And this is when I can leave my body. This is where I meet beings of other places. This is where I cope with being stuck inside of myself. I am not sure if I will ever be able to answer why I, or we, or anybody or anything has to exist like this, but at least I've made it bearable. 

&#x200B;

IF you're watching yourself like a TV, you've just got to change the channel. Raise your frequency, but stay grounded. There's some very important reason we are who we are. Your mind is beautiful, you are art in and of itself, you are radical, capricious and you the fundamental of creation.

Any body out there vibing with this ?"

The Glass Wall (a story of dissociation),5,kh6hvv,8,"I sit with my friends, playing video games at home. Laughing, talking, arguing. All in good fun. But, suddenly, everything felt far away. I can't connect with my friends, and everything I am doing is no longer my actions, but the actions of my body. It is moving, talking, and acting just like me.

But it isn't. It can't be. I'm in here. I'm in my head. Watching it happen. It feels as though there is some sort of wall between me and them. A glass wall, keeping me from controlling myself or my body from what it is doing. I yell, I scream, but all to no avail. I just watch my body move and talk without any input from me.

Logically, I know I'm the one moving my body, and I am the one talking. But it doesn't feel like it, or seem like it. This wall keeps me from coming forward and being in the moment with myself. I begin to question if I was ever actually in control or if this wall was always here.

Then, as suddenly as it was there, it disappears. I'm in control again. I'm the one talking. I am moving and walking and being me. Another episode, come and gone.

And I never look forward to the next one."
Looking for advice,1,khbfwx,6,"Im not sure if my experiences count as disassociation so I'd like to know if abyone else has had similar experiences before getting more serious help. Starting in high-school sometimes I'd driving home and I can't remember anything other the getting in then out of the car. Now in college sometimes I completely blank people around me out. Someone could be walking in my direction and for a second or two its like no one is there and I only see the background. I also occasionally get this really weird, lost sort of feeling like im supposed to be remembering/doing something important but I can't for the life of me remember what it was. One last thing is most if not all of my memories feel like a tv show or movie. Like each memory is its own episode and everyone in them including me is just a character. The feeling was at its worst this past summer, cause on some days it felt like life in general was fake, almost like a simulation. Thanks for any and all help."
Has anyone found relief from anti-anxiety medications?,1,kh35z5,1,"I‚Äôve suffered from DPDR for a little over a year and half, after a bad episode with an edible.  Since then, its been a struggle but I had been MOSTLY okay, able to function, socialize, feel excited about things.  Since April, my anxiety has gotten way worse and I‚Äôve got a lot of depression thrown into the mix.  The past few weeks I‚Äôve been on the verge of panic a lot and have been dissociating constantly.  It was terrible last night, when driving to a cabin to stay the night (only 1.5-2 hours away from my home and family) and started panicking because I was far from home and dissociated hard from myself and the people in the car‚Äîa year ago I roadtripped across the country and was fine and happy!  Anyways, I feel that although my dissociation sucks and comes randomly, it was controllable until my anxiety ramped up.  So I‚Äôm meeting with a psychiatrist this week to discuss going on an anti anxiety medication and depending on how that works and how it affects my depression, possibly an antidepressant as well.  Has this helped anyone?  I sort of see my dissociation as a subset of my anxiety so I hope addressing the anxiety can help control the dissociation?
Edit: never been on any psych meds, have had mild-moderate anxiety for years (generally very high functioning but a few times a year my anxiety gets very bad and hinders my ability to function, occasional panic attacks, a couple depressive and dissociative episodes a year for about 1.5 years (generally depressive episodes lasted a day and dissociative ones 1-3 weeks until the past couple months it‚Äôs constant)"
Gratitude to my body and mind,19,kgid7g,2,"I have been really down on myself recently for struggling so much with depression and dissociative symptoms. Earlier today, I explored what it was like to feel grateful that my body and mind protected me for so long to get to where I am today, to have job stability, a very kind therapist, and genuine love in my life (with a select few). I just had a moment of thanking my body and mind for doing it‚Äôs best to protect me from long forgotten trauma and it brought me to tears. 

I just don‚Äôt want to punish myself any longer for doing what I had to do (even subconsciously) to survive. 

Feeling hope can be so difficult and frightening, but I feel hopeful today."
possible dissociation ?,2,kgpoah,1,"i have severe brain fog, and have always ""turned my brain off"" frequently since my POTS got worse around puberty. 

by ""turn my brain off"" i mean i sit and stare at the floor and just don't think, i don't feel the need to, i have to force myself to have thoughts, and i don't blink and my eyes don't even start to itch or feel like they're drying out. 

i just had this weird moment a couple hours ago where i felt like i had run into jello. and i had to consciously make make an effort to think and move. i wasn't scared, or confused, nothing. i was just kinda like ""huh..."". and even then that ""huh..."" was forced. 

i told my boyfriend about it and he told me it sounds like dissociation. he's no expert by any means and i know everything's different for everyone but he dissociates, so hearing that coming from someone who knows they dissociate is a little concerning to me. 

i have POTS, as i mentioned, which also causes depression and anxiety for me. i also have OCD. also probably worth mentioning i have never experienced any trauma, aside from being ""backstabbed"" n such by ""friends"" lol

this has happened before but i never thought about it afterwards like i have been this time. i don't remember when or how it stopped, but it did. i was just building a house in the sims and i might have been listening to music but i don't remember 

any input would be greatly appreciated, thank you. i will definitely talk to my counselor about this next time i see them"

"Saw my brain while high, tried to regain access",1,kgf8wx,1,"I was hanging out with a few friends playing pong, and had had a little cannabis sativa and caffeine earlier. I was trying to throw the ball but focus was completely foreign to me and I truly realized what that meant as I could not aim a shot. Usually I can compensate for this in the last few moments before throwing a shot, but that ability goes away quick. I was going off on them about how I don‚Äôt have access to like 90% of my brain all of the time, which includes the social parts that help me be myself and connect with them, hoping they would understand. I began trying as hard as I could to think and gain control of my brain and I felt electricity teem up my spine into the back of my head where I felt the blockage, before I knew it I was on the floor spazzing the fuck out with all my might as if I were exorcising a demon. I could‚Äôve stopped but I needed this so I kept going. It ended up being futile. I went up stairs and tried to keep going. I began the same process and it caused me to yell but it seemed like I forgot what I was trying to do and was burnt the out like I had just finished sex. I just sat there feeling kind of satiated probably from the leftover adrenaline but I was also kind of high and I sat there for 3 more hours thinking about reality and bible verses.

Should I try this again?

I would love to hear your guys‚Äô thoughts ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè"
I was out of it mostly and it came back because of self exposure technique,13,kfr76l,2,"Hi there, I am 23/F and figured out I was living with constant dissociation two months ago and started theraphy afterwards. I thought that I had DID kind of a thing because of the constant negative voice with me but there was not any other thing indicating it and nothing came up about it. After a couple of sessions, one night I smoked weed because of another stressor came up and suddenly my brain revealed a memory of a traumatic incident that took place 14 years ago. All of a sudden, I sarted to re feel my body and connected to my surrondings and rverything felt different. I can say that I was reborn and my consicousness have been altered. However, then this grief period hit that I couldnt stopped thinking that I have lost those years and the only thing I was thinking was the event and thought of myself if the event didn‚Äôt take place etc. After a week or so, I wanted to try some kind of a meditative exposure theraphy by myself to get out the thoughts related to it. Then, all of it came back... I am now anle to distinguish these distinct states and I am now back stuck in the dissociation mode. I geel like I have ruined it all over again and trapped in the freeze mode because of what I did to myself. However, there is also this feeling of hypervigilance this time like an anxiety feeling that I didn‚Äôt have before. Do you have any opinions or someone went theough a similar oath. My doctor said that I shouldn‚Äôt do anything about the memory but I disnt listen to him and I am so afraid that it is irreversible."
What is happening to me?,9,kfhy0a,5,"Hi there I really hope someone can help me with a new thing I experienced a few days ago. Now, I am very used to dissociating and have a few coping and grounding techniques for when this happens. I can deal with most of it somewhat effectively because I have really tried to understand and implement the things I have learned. 
However, the other day whilst getting 'intimate' which I know to be a trigger for me, something really weird happened. I wasn't stressed out and the other person is always respectful and kind. I was the one being more open and initiated the whole thing. At some point I heard myself say something like ""she's going to be so pissed"". I said it but it didn't feel like me. Then, nothing... I dont remember what happened after but I do know from what I was told. The first thing I remember was looking intently into the mirror. For a split second I was looking into the eyes of a stranger. Then I was me again. I dont want to explain anything further as it doesn't contribute to what I am trying to understand. 
Can anyone else even relate to what I went through? Is this even dissociation? I realise this is weird, even for me. I have run the gauntlet when it comes to derealization, depersonalization among others but never ever have a felt like I was totally not there. Usually I am at the very least an immobile bystander but not this time. Please be kind if you can, this is really freaking me out."
Is this dissociation?,1,kfohs7,3,When I close my eyes I don‚Äôt know where I am or I don‚Äôt know my orientation in my room. It can be quite scary.
time,6,kfcl0r,3,i feel like time goes by so quickly. this has to be because of dissociation right? i swear i just woke up this morning and it was 6:30 am... now it‚Äôs already 7pm. why does it go by so quickly?
What should I do?,1,kfipwz,1,"When I was younger I experienced being absorbed inside my own body. It has only happened once and I was only 15 so never really talked about it. But lately there are instances where it comes back. 
I was in high school and I lived in the Philippines. 
I remember walking back from school with my friends. I was telling a joke, and out of nowhere I was absorbed inside my body in the middle of my sentence.. It had felt like I was inside a dream, I remember feeling sunken like in the movie get out. Everything was blurred and foggy. And I remember telling myself to not panic. I did not wanted to freak my friends out so I kept walking. I remember I tried speaking but the words did not make sense so my friends laughed about it because I was not making any sense at all. I tried smiling but it didn‚Äôt feel like I was there at all. All I can remember after that was hoping that i go back to my body.. the whole ordeal lasted for good 5-10 mins. It was really hard to tell how long because it had felt like I was there for a long time. I shrugged it off and never even talked about till lately. Couple of days ago I was in a friend‚Äôs house, out of nowhere i felt dizziness and it‚Äôs as it my vertigo went whacked. Then I realize it was what I felt like again. This time it had only lasted for 5 secs. Then again while I was driving a car. And then couple of mins before I wrote this...I‚Äôm starting to get worried. What should I do? Is this normal?
Also I have past trauma when I was a kid. I don‚Äôt remember any of it, but for some reason I knew it happened."
"Exit Light, Enter Night",7,kf44ue,2,"I feel like I'm falling further and further into the void. Every day seems like an eternity. My mind will go black and a millennia will pass. Sometimes I'll look at things and forget who I am, what they are, what it means to be human, and to exist in this world, like ive been reduced to an animal, with no sentience. I'd rather just fall into this vegetative state permanently or make it stop forever, I hate this limbo, I'm afraid it'll happen at the worst possible time like while I'm driving, or taking an exam or something. Why couldn't I be born fucking normal lmao."
How do I know I‚Äôm dissociating?,1,kfdnex,1,"I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my dark humor or dissociation. Really really bad traumatic things have happened to me and I‚Äôm able to tell the stories as if it never happened or even laugh about it. Is that normal? Is something wrong with me? 

Example: I talk about my abusive ex like it happened to someone else and not me. 

I‚Äôm sorry this is hard to explain"
What is this?,1,kf86vd,4,"So I have been on antidepressants for two months now and I think that I don't know how I feel, it's like I am trapped in something and I can't seem to find the exit, most of the time I don't even feel alive, or maybe I can't feel anything at all.

I started writing something because I was fogged up and frustrated,1,kexgfj,2,"But now I feel better and starting to clear up, because I wrote it out.

I was just writing that I'm frustrated, I don't know what to do, and that I kind of inflicted this morning's episode on myself.

And I think I know why I did it, which I'll probably write about over on /r/CPTSD.

It's just...I don't know; ...silly? I've spent so much of my life fogged up that I don't really know how to live any other way. I'm used to it now, and I don't want to be.

I don't want to keep slogging through; hoping to figure out how to live a ""normal"" life. It's frustrating that I've lost so many years already. Where I am now took so much effort, and too much time.

I think, for now, I'm going to look into what other tools I can use to come out of an episode. Today was just lucky, and I can't keep skimming by on luck."
i'm wondering if this is dissociation?,22,kefacv,5,"sometimes i kind of space out and become unaware of my surroundings, i get really confused and sometimes when i move it feels like im moving automatically, like a robot. i am aware of it but sometimes i dont try to get out of it,, as messed up as it sounds sometimes its nice to just be away from everything especially when im in situations that make me anxious. these usually last minutes to hours. is this just normal zoning out or could it be something more severe? 

ive been through quite a few traumatic experiences when i was a kid but as far as i know i have no symptoms of ptsd or anything as a result of it. if other mental illnesses could have anything to do with it, i do have anxiety and depression, but i have been suspecting recently i have been underdiagnosed. i have close family history of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."

"Identity disturbance, lack of a sense of self",8,kdhyd3,5,"Is this something common with dissociation, childhood trauma?, I'm trying to figure out why I am always acting as someone,it's like if I am not pretending to be someone then I feel like no-one, so I choose some character or type of person to be then this gives me enough confidence to go out of the house because I feel everyone is looking at me as this person I have become and they don't see the real me which is just a sense of pain,brokenness,smallness, invisible, nothing, disgusting etc etc, i have been doing this for many many years I will see someone in the street or on a movie and think that I want to be that so I become that in my head then externally dress and act like that and I will do that for as long as a year or as little as half hour but when this identity wears off I crash and feel non existent and am falling through space, existential crises and panic etc, then I start searching for who I can be next and can go through 20 different characters in my head in 30 minutes until I find someone to be, it can take days it weeks aswell and I just feel dead and non existent or I freak out until I am acting as someone else again, I don't know what to do I don't want to do this I want to be one person the real me whoever that is,I don't even know how to explain properly what is going on here it's just basically there is all this sensitive painful stuff trying to be hidden from the world and from me and then there is a hundred masks covering it all up....I don't even know what condition I have what is going on here, what does anyone think"
Feel like I've lost myself to the void of my mind for good,10,kdeavq,5,"I feel like I'm going insane. I constantly have some level of dissociation, and have ever since I can remember. I can very briefly get glimpses back to reality, and the majority of the time I'm able to flow with the disconnect and it doesn't consume my mind that I'm not connected. It gets to be easy to forget that I'm not connected in the first place. And albeit still not great, it's much better than right now.   


For a good month It's been all I can focus on. Anything I do I'm fully aware that I'm not connected. I'm typing this and I keep forgetting that I'm even typing because it's so easy to float off from it. My hands don't feel like mine. I'm watching the world from a hazy screen, and I'm so aware that it's a screen. And I feel so locked out from living, and it's driving me insane.   


It's affecting my relationship because I can't feel as connected to them, and I just want to curl up and cry, or even harm to at least try and ground myself to anything. I just want the floating to stop. Or at least dampen since it's not like I was connected fully to begin with.   


I'm trying to keep myself busy so I can ignore the feeling but it's incredibly difficult. My memory is so jumbled and I can't focus. It makes me start to panic and I can feel my breath quicken and It's terrifying. I know it'll pass but right now It's so hard. And makes me feel like I've finally lost myself to the void of my mind for good."
Does anyone experience this?,15,kdamnq,6,"I know it‚Äôs common when people are falling asleep but trying to stay awake that they feel like they‚Äôre actually ‚Äúfalling‚Äù and then bolt upright/awake. I have experience with mild dissociation, but this feeling of ‚Äúfalling‚Äù happens to me a lot during normal conversations and it doesn‚Äôt feel like the average dissociative episode. My vision seems to rotate and I often feel dizzy, stumble from a standing position, and get intense vertigo. I don‚Äôt think this stems from hunger, tiredness or anything else other than the general mental illnesses that I have.
Does anyone else understand this or know what I‚Äôm talking about? Is it a form of dissociation, and if not what is it called?"
SSRIS what is everyones experience,2,kdje4o,3,So pretty much i've had on and off dpdr for 4 years now but its become much worse this year after a break up and covid19 etc etc. I am getting very mild FND symptoms and some dissociative seizure like symptoms. I've had the tests done to rule out any formal neurological issues. I've been reccomened to go on ssris by my doctor but im worried it'll further exacerbate my dissociative symptoms. Just curious to see what everyones experiences are w meds and dissociation
Never dissociated before and don‚Äôt know if this is what i experienced,3,kde9fq,2,i‚Äôm not entirely sure what i experienced but i‚Äôm wondering if i was dissociating. i was at target with my best friend and her friend. it felt like i was there but wasn‚Äôt almost like a foggy dream. i heard everything from far away almost like an eco and after someone said something i wasn‚Äôt even sure if it was real. like if i imagined the entire conversation. i didn‚Äôt even feel like i was controlling what i was saying. it kinda felt like i was on autopilot. this has never happened to me before and i‚Äôm wondering if this sounds like dissociating?
Friends and family are important,5,kd7872,3,"I‚Äôve struggled with dissociation since I was 16(22 now), and I‚Äôve learned how to live with it, what my triggers are and what my healthy responses should be. It‚Äôs not always the case but the most important thing I‚Äôve learned for how to cope personally is to keep trying and be conscious about how to respond when I am in a depressive and dissociative state. The biggest thing I‚Äôve also learned about myself is that I need people around me (friends, family) to keep me grounded, because when I don‚Äôt talk to anyone or put an effort in that aspect of my life I ultimately feel like I am not real, while when I am consistent about having people around me it reminds me that they see me and they are real so I am also here and real. Even putting my hand on theirs or giving them a hug when it‚Äôs appropriate helped me a ton. This was extremely hard for me to accept and work on because instinctively Im a person who likes being alone and it was def not natural for me to talk about how I feel or be affectionate to those around me, but pushing that away only made my dissociative episodes that much harder. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to tell everyone you know about it because a lot of people don‚Äôt understand, but continue to have positive affirmations with yourself even while in a dissociative episode. I hope this helps anyone who reads this and just keep a constant reminder in your mind that the feeling is temporary and learn what your triggers are.

Edit: I also want to add that I know it‚Äôs all easier said than done I know how severe it can be, this is just my personal advice and experience, and maybe give a light of hope for anyone on this sub"
Did dissociation go away or did i get used to it?,35,kcujbt,18,"Well; it‚Äôs all in the title. A few weeks ago I has some really shitty intense symptoms of dissociation/depersonalization. Then at one point, I stopped fighting it, I just accepted it, and now it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much. I still don‚Äôt feel connected to reality or my body, nor do i feel fully present, but I‚Äôm wondering, has it gotten better or have i simply gotten used to it? I‚Äôm asking because im scared that if i keep ignoring it, it will just get worse. im in therapy and just started medication (20mg of celexa) but im still looking for some opinions."
I'm really scared,2,kd8ow2,1,"So basically I had panic attacks a few months ago and the panic attacks stopped but then I started developing what seemed like DPDR - it feels like it has been getting progressively worse over time. First my vision just started feeling very foggy and weak, and I was scared that I was going blind. This persisted over the following weeks, but then I started getting increasingly worsening fatigue, sleepiness, and brain fog. It started feeling like nothing was real and I was living in a simulation or something, which I know is typical of DPDR, and I was pretty sure it was just DPDR. Recently though it has been continuing to get worse, and it feels like I'm too deep into it at this point and I will never get out of this. Now it's starting to feel like I'm forgetting my family and forgetting my life - like, I know the names of my family and know they are my family, but I feel like I can hardly process or remember them if that makes sense, and I feel a sense of terror throughout my body and just feel horrible, like I'm forgetting them and developing amnesia and will never be able to remember them again. I remember that I used to watch movies with them and stuff and have a good time with them and stuff,, but I feel like I hardly remember them anymore, like the memories are really weak and I look at them and feel like I barely know them, and I try to remember them more in my head but it just feels blocked off and like I'm stuck like this. My vision is also still very messed up and I still feel extremely sleepy and fatigued all the time, it took a lot of energy to even write this. I'm just really scared what's happening to me and I'm scared I'm losing everything and losing my life and won't be able to remember my family or anything with my life again. I really just want my life back, it just feels like I've lost sense of my life and everything. Will this get better? I'm not really sure what to do right now, I'm struggling with doing pretty much anything because of my severe brain fog and what seems like severe dissociation, just feeling lost and really horrible. I don't even really know what is happening anymore, but I really just wanna have my life back."
Grounding,3,kd0o6z,2,"I‚Äôve been trying to feel the floor and practicing deep, slow breathing for grounding but I‚Äôve been having a lot of trouble. I know exactly what‚Äôs happening as soon as I feel the warmth of my feet on my floor. I know exactly where I‚Äôm heading and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a great place to be. I‚Äôve flirted with that place so many times to see what it feels like and it felt good for the most part. But that‚Äôs all it was... flirting. It wasn‚Äôt the norm and I haven‚Äôt allowed it to become the norm. Sadly, I haven‚Äôt accepted that place as my permanent state of being. I need to figure out how to accept that place. Does anyone have any advice?"

Anyone ever feel a pulsating sensation throughout your body?,6,kcqakg,2,"I‚Äôve been in a state of dpdr 24/7 for 2 years now. 

I‚Äôve started therapy a couple of months ago. My mental state has been rough lately and I‚Äôve been feeling so many emotions that I haven‚Äôt felt in years. Lately, my body does this sort of pulsating with every movement. For example, I walk a few steps and it feels like how a heart beat is but throughout the whole body. 

I‚Äôm not during if I‚Äôm finally feeling present in my body again or if it‚Äôs something medical. Any thoughts?"
Struggling with dissociation,3,kcs4ad,2,"Hi, I‚Äôm 18 and am struggling with dissociation disorder. When I was 15, I smoked weed for the first time and had a somewhat traumatizing and overwhelming experience. Ever since then I have been in an altered state of mind and feel like an entirely new person. I do not have periods or episodes of dissociation. Instead, I am in a constant dissociative state and can‚Äôt seem to find a way out. I found myself smoking a few more times, and then a few more times, and then I quit. I know it was stupid of me to smoke again but I found myself caving under the pressure of others. I stopped using for about 6-8 months however my dissociation did not get any better. As the egocentric young kid I was, I thought I was the only person who ever felt this way and figured I was doomed. I would never be normal again. I took on smoking again and I now smoke consistently (few times a week) with my friends. When I smoke or drink, I put myself in a stronger and more intense feeling of dissociation than when I am sober. It can be comforting as I feel I am the one associating myself with these feelings which is why I continue (it‚Äôs also fun). I am lost and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Stoping drinking and smoking would separate me from my friends and parties where I would meet girls. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore and I don‚Äôt recognize myself in the mirror. Nobody knows this beside a few of my friends but they don‚Äôt seem to care or take me seriously. I know I‚Äôm making my friends seem like dicks but without them I don‚Äôt have anybody.  I haven‚Äôt told my parents because I think they will react the same as my friends. Probably a bad time to bring this up but I have struggled with social anxiety for most of my life and I feel the dissociation goes hand in hand with it. The more anxiety I feel, the more dissociated I am. One can imagine how horrible I am at presenting in class. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story and if you have any thoughts or advice it would mean the world to me :)"
Self harm & weird thoughts,5,kcr9lr,2,"I'm scared I'm going to end up hurting myself dissociating. It's happened a few times now it was really bad and I was experiencing auditory hallucinations, tunnel vision, and feeling like I was in a bubble (?), plus that everything around me was fake. It's been three times now over a period of a few months and I'm really scared because I just freaked out and self harmed very badly during one of them. I intially thought it was some type of shortish psychotic episode (things like manic depression w psychosis & schizophrenia run in the family) but my psychiatrist said it was just bad dissociation episodes. I'm still not fully convinced since it was a hundred times worse than any dissociation I've ever felt and I wasn't even aware I was disassociating like usual, I couldn't form any thoughts. My parents aren't allowing me on meds, I'm too scared to talk to friends or leave the house in fear of it happening again, I'm really freaked out, especially since both visual and auditory hallucinations are the norm for me and I feel even more trapped. Plus when I'm normally disassociating, not like during any of those episode things, that thought that nothings real or I'm the only real being keeps popping into my head and driving me to do reckless things, I'm p scared nobodies taking me seriously."
Never been this bad,13,kckg4e,3,I‚Äôve never dissociated this hard. I‚Äôve never felt this far away from my body or sanity. I feel the intense tv ambient screen filling my head.

NEED HELP: Am I dissociating?,3,kcq5u0,6,"Hi people of reddit. Sorry for weird formatting, I am on mobile. To starting this post, I am going to say this: English is not my first language, so...
This started this year and is causing some trouble to my daylife. 
My (17f) boyfriend (18m) started saying that I don't show much atention from him. I don't think that is true. But he say that he ask me something and I ignore him. But I don't hear him. I started to believe that is something different. One day, while we were at his house, I asked ""what we are gonna have for dinner?"" And he said: ""I already told you, even my mom asked you if you like guiso, and had to ask you twice till you answered. You looked at her, and after that you looked back at your phone"". I was speachless. I didn't even remember that. Or, in my own house, when something was said, I didn't heard that and ask about that, all I get is ""we were talking about that a minute ago"" And I DON'T LISTEN, OR REMEMBER. This is a problem? I am distracted? Is a possibilty dissociation?
I want to clarify: I was abused. And I don't know If this may be a sort of consequence. I read about dissociation but I can't nor want to diagnose myself. I just wanna know If is a possibilty and maybe try to get some help"

"Can someone give me advice pls? (question OSDD, DID)",2,kcm9qv,1,"I have been questioning whether I have DID or OSDD or neither (or something else). My therapist has suggested the possibility of DID/ OSDD but more in a ""maybe think about this"" kind of way. I have read a lot about dissociative disorders, and while many of the symptoms resonate with me, I started to get freaked that I was making it up / appropriating the symptoms subconsciously. Being fully honest, there is a part of me that wants to be diagnosed with DID/OSDD because I feel like it would explain a lot in my life. I am heavily depressed and dealing with my MH for years, and I just want to know what's going on.  


Anyway, a few days back I decided that I must not have a dissociative disorder, and instead the voices in my head are just my levels of thought/ versions of my thoughts, the way I think or I am subconsciously making them up. Last night I got really upset and had a big panic attack/SH episode (regular occurrence for me). While I was on the floor debilitated, the voices in my head started talking to me and helping me through it saying thins like ""you are going to be ok, take your time"" ""we are going to get up when you're ready and get a glass of water/take a shower etc"" I could visualise the person behind the voice holding me and rubbing my back etc. At one point I even started talking back aloud (I do this regularly too). I wonder though if this is just because I have been thinking about systems more and know that they usually have roles etc? like only since I've read about it have I been able to locate the voices in my head, know their names and their roles etc, which has led me to think maybe I just am making it up because I know that's what it should be like? idk  


ANYWAY my question is:   


to what extent is this behaviour (eg instance above) ""normal""?  


to what extent can one parrot / mimic this behaviour unconsciously?  


if this isn't DID/OSDD, what could it be?  


Any help greatly appreciated. Thanks"
Does this come under Dissociation?,4,kcf551,0,"I was in the shower when this happened. I realised I was banging the back of my head against the wall, and the ache is what brought me back.

Quitting nicotine with a dissociative disorder...,1,kch0cn,3,"Was vaping around 160mg of nicotine a day, give or take ~20mg. So like the equivalent of 4 packs of cigs a day. 

I‚Äôve tried to stop in the past but have managed to lose my mind every time. Borderline hallucinations, paranoia, intense dissociative episodes, flu symptoms relapses with  bulimia, weird insomnia where my dreams get blended with real life. 

I‚Äôm on SSRIs finally, and this time quitting hasn‚Äôt caused a relapse with the bulimia and so far no overt hallucination shit. I‚Äôve been tapering down. But still I‚Äôm as sick as a dog and loopy. 

I guess my question is, does anyone know why this might occur, like the mechanisms behind nicotine‚Äôs effects on dissociation specifically? Or maybe this has a lot to do with how much nic I was having? Thanks!"
Is this dissociation or am I just noticing things?,2,kc6r7r,5,Like lately I weirdly can see my own eyelashes and my nose at times? It seems to be when im anxious. Could it actually be the opposite and be hypervigilance?

Homicidal urges while intense dissociation?,3,kbyrss,4,"  I‚Äôve had this problem for years where when I get too far gone due to dissociation I feel like an entirely different person and all I want to do is hurt or kill someone. I lock myself in my room when this happens because of how intense the urges are, at one point I threatened to kill my father and was about to push him down the staircase he was in front of me but luckily I punched the wall next to me instead. I‚Äôm scared of myself when I dissociate and feel as though I lose all power mentally, it feels like a possession. I honestly feel as though I have the ability to kill someone while in that state without a doubt. I‚Äôm an EXTREMELY calm and laid back person when not dissociating (practically nothing bothers me) and only want to help people. Does anyone else have homicidal urges while dissociating?

Sorry for the crappy grammar, I was dissociating heavily while typing this up."
Why won‚Äôt people just read about this,2,kc0xgp,1,K is pissed at me bc the angry aggressive part came out. I have no idea what happened. He just won‚Äôt read the things I give him. I want him to understand. I am upset and hurt about what she did too. But instead I get him blaming me for something I didn‚Äôt do. I think we would have less issues if he just read the books and articles. He‚Äôs got time to read everything else. Why won‚Äôt he do it?
I hate the reflections,32,kbckqb,5,"I don't see reflections as myself anymore. I haven't willingly looked at one in about 3 weeks. I don't want to remember what I look like as I've slowly forgotten the details overtime.

I hate any reminder of my normal self, any reminder that I'm just *me*. It is the most disappointing feeling to see that face staring back at me, even for a second. I completely avoid it, it never feels like me anymore. I just want that part of me gone entirely, I don't want to be myself. I don't want to be seen as myself, no one needs to know me."
I dissociated through a presentation and it was horrible,4,kbkn0p,1,"I gave a presentation today. I'm a grad student, so we have to give them fairly frequently. I've never been the best at presenting, but I think I gave the worst presentation of my life today. Sometimes dissociating can be nice through presentations because my nerves don't get to me as much, but that was definitely not the case today. A quarter/halfway through it, I dissociated hard. My mind went completely blank, I forgot where I was and what I was doing. I couldn't focus. I could no longer form coherent sentences. I couldn't remember a thing about the paper I was presenting on. Needless to say, I couldn't continue, but I did anyway. There were long breaks and nothing I said made sense. Words were coming out of my mouth, but I didn't know what they meant. Language, grammar, vocabulary all escaped me. I should feel so embarrassed. That was absolutely atrocious. But I don't feel anything. I have completely ceased to exist."
Sex helps me with dissociation,7,kbha2e,6,"Sooo I know it's usually more like the opposite, but 3 of the 4 times I've felt mostly present in the last few years have been either mid or immediately post sex. Mentioned this to my therapist and how I can actually feel my body when with my partner intimately and she seemed to think this made sense (he's my first truly safe person). Anyone else? No? Maybe? Why? How?"

Noticing myself dissociate is exhausting,10,kb2tz1,12,"I've been working on catching myself dissociating in therapy atm and I'm finding that I'm feeling even worse than usual.
Basically I'll notice I'm in the dissociative state and bring myself back to the moment many times throughout the day and doing this feels very difficult and like I'm constantly dragging myself away from the dissociation.
It's almost easier to just 'be in' the dissociation and not realise if that makes sense, when I'm aware of it it's like the dissociation loses it's purpose and am just left feeling empty and exhausted from fighting my brain all day.
Hope this makes sense to someone."

Dissociation,5,kazhyb,2,"I just want some input on this 

I feel like I‚Äôve been experiencing dissociation or some type of dissociation. It started in my past relationship. My partner was VERY mentally draining and somewhat of a narcissist. She would make me feel terrible constantly. When she would make me feel these terrible ways I felt like I would completely zone out and feel very foggy headed. Like I was high almost. Towards the end of our relationship I would have these feelings everyday all day. I‚Äôm certain I was also depressed during this time. I would go throughout my days on auto pilot almost like I had no emotions or feelings. I would also feel very disconnected from my partner like I couldn‚Äôt connect to her anymore on any level or to anyone. 

Now I still experience these feelings. If I get into an argument with someone I first will feel upset then a couple minutes in I just feel numb like I can‚Äôt even focus on what the other person is saying. I also will go through weeks where I just feel like I‚Äôm coasting through my days with no emotions. Just an overwhelming feeling of emptiness to the point I can barely have a conversation. 

If anyone has ANY input I would love to hear it."
How did you learn you deal with dissociation?,4,kb038w,2,"CW: panic attacks, derealization, brief allusions to childhood abuse without specifics 

I have been going through trauma therapy for the past year for things that have happened in my adult life, and I am really lucky to finally be in a place that feels safe with good social support. A few months ago, I had an intense panic attack/derealization episode that I first thought was a psychotic break. I‚Äôve since learned the difference between intense dissociative experiences and psychosis. (I highly recommend the Dissociation vs Psychosis episode of the System Speaks podcast for more info on this. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm a system, but it‚Äôs a great podcast). 

But basically during the derealization episode, I realized a lot of what happened in my childhood was not the idyllic version I had kind of convinced myself I had for most of my adult life. A flood of new, very scary feeling memories came back that I had no idea about. And it felt like there were more ‚Äúin the tank‚Äù that I was not letting myself know, if that makes sense. It‚Äôs weird because at the time it felt somewhat out of my control but also still in my control. Ever since then I feel like I‚Äôm much more present, but also really struggling to figure out the true narrative of my life. It still feels like a lot is unknown. And now, the memories don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúas close‚Äù if that makes sense, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve fully processed them. It feels very confusing. I‚Äôm not sure if this is normal ptsd or if I‚Äôm splitting in a more severe way. Also my memory loss and dissociation have been more severe. Everything feels very contradictory.

Basically, I‚Äôm wondering how others have come to realize they experience dissociation. And how you‚Äôve handled it moving forward. Thanks for reading!"

Paid Dissociation Research Opportunity (1 hour online survey!),34,kahzoo,19,"*Study is now closed*

Research opportunity about dissociation!

Hello, my name is Shae (they/them)! I am a graduate student studying clinical psychology at Towson University and I research trauma and dissociation. I am conducting an online study examining self-compassion, social support, and barriers to accessing mental health care among individuals with dissociative symptoms. Dissociative symptoms can include things like feeling detached from yourself or your surroundings, having flashbacks or intrusive memories about your trauma, or feeling like you act so differently at times, you feel as if you are different people. There is little research on dissociation, so I am hoping to highlight our experiences with dissociation through published research.

We will be compensating everyone who completes the online survey with a $15 (USD) Amazon gift card.

To participate, you must be 18 years of age or older, read English, and have dissociative symptoms. You will then take an online survey which will take approximately one hour to complete, at your own pace. After finishing the study, you will receive a $15 (USD) Amazon gift card. 

Please DM for a link to the study.

Feel free to pass along the study details to others you know with dissociative symptoms."
Does my condition qualify as dissociation?,1,kb0xsp,1,"I‚Äôve been going to a psychiatrist but I haven‚Äôt been getting much help knowledge wise. I just got put on some medications and he booked me for a skills based therapy in 6 months so I‚Äôm looking for a sub where I can read from others so I can learn more about my condition.

So essentially my emotions are just pretty numb. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm not myself or anything like that, although when my emotions were really numb I felt as though the people around me didn‚Äôt actually exist. Actually, when I look at old photos of my self I feel like I‚Äôm looking at a different person but that could be because of how much I‚Äôve changed. So I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm dissociated in the sense of I don‚Äôt feel the pain I should be feeling. I‚Äôm detached from 90 percent of negative feelings and couldn‚Äôt care less about anything."

Honestly I was doing great in college, I always start strong then mid semester I literally disappear. I have no memory of how I lost so many weeks, and always have to play catch up.

does anyone else feel like this?,1,kauu18,1,"i [18f] am diagnosed with major depression and BPD, i used to dissociate a lot around age 15-17, but last night i had a pretty bad episode, one of the first i‚Äôve had in a while. often in these episodes i form a pretty strange sense of‚Äî longing, i guess? to be places i‚Äôve never been and be with people i‚Äôve never met. i get really attached to random cities/places/ even something as insignificant as a gas station or field sometimes and i just feel like i NEED to go there. sometimes i get attached to ideas of places i‚Äôve never seen and feel like i need to set out and find them. weirdly when i dissociate although things around me don‚Äôt seem necessarily real, i feel like the realist version of a being i‚Äôve ever felt. sorry if this is all over the place, just wondered if anyone else ever gets these bursts of longing?"
"Would ""They"" Ever Understand the Frags?",14,kaaqlt,0,"There are *several* riders on this bus. 

One is forever in his abusers' clutches screaming to no useful purpose. But he never gives up hope. 

One -- a little older -- has imaginary friends and all manner of elaborate scenarios about them. 

One is forever wary and vigilant, believing his *extensively* educated ""radar"" is his only real means of survival. 

One can explain it all. But who else (other than some $200-an-hour professional listener) could possibly understand? 

And one sits out in the audience watching the others on the screen, fully aware of his inability to help the first four out of their mutually mystified straight jackets.

The explainer is the topic for today. He seems to have been [conditioned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fixing-psychology/201402/explaining-behaviorism-operant-classical-conditioning), in-doctrine-ated, in[struct](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+construction+of+reality+sociology&oq=social+construction+of+reality&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0l4.7012j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)ed, [imprinted](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_3784), [socialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), habituated, and [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology)) to believe that ""if they could just understand why 'I' am fragged, they'd let 'me' off the hook for all the crazy s--t the others say and do. 

But, of course, the explainer ""knows"" better: ""The 'corrective relationship' with *another* is as pie in the sky as reincarnation and 'another chance to get it all right.'"" And wonders if the corrective relationship really *is* ultimately an ""inside job.""

If it weren't for the guy in the balcony, the explainer would chew *eternally* on his mental toenails... terrified of what all the surrogate parents and bullies and potential lovers will think when they start to ""wonder."" The guy with the popcorn *knows* it's all just a movie that ends at some point. After which the others in the theater get up and leave, never having spoken to -- or heard -- each other. *Ever*.

Wouldn't it be great if the ""detached understanding, empathy and compassion"" the popcorn muncher has for *others* was enough to give *them* room enough to let go of their terror, their protectors, and their addiction to being comprehended by someone who really mattered. They *do* chill out when they know they're seen, heard, felt and *sensed* that way. But the shadows are still out there waiting for their cues. 

Mr. Popcorn calls those moments ""flashbacks."" The others call them ""intolerably frightening,"" ""unmanageably embarrassing,"" ""extremely tiring,"" and ""invariably disappointing"" (respectively). 

Life *is* far better than it used to be when the man in the audience didn't yet exist. The body has not attempted suicide again in 18 years. The fear, the embarrassment, the fatigue, and the sorrow are all manageable now. The feelings and sensations are just there to be *felt* One More Time before the clouds break and the weather clears again.

*""The feeling is always temporary.""*

Life on life's terms."
Dissociation through Philosophical Thought,12,ka96yj,7,"(17,M) I noticed that extremely metaphysical thought patterns began with me at the start of the quarantine era. Whether this was from stress, being bored incessantly, or the seemingly homogenous nature of each new day‚Äî I do not know, because all three were present. Perhaps they intertwine in a complex series of cause-effect and positive feedback relationships. However, as time passed, the influence these thoughts had on me personally increased rapidly. I suddenly grew an unbreakable fascination with the universe and especially space time. But things took a more disturbing turn when I thought about infinity. To be clear, I had always understood the concept of infinity, but it hit different this time when I realized that physical space as well as time was just that‚Äî Infinite. 

Nothing and simply nothing (not a single thing I have ever fathomed) had occurred more non-real to me‚Äîthe idea that something could follow a direction forever and there would still be ahead‚ÄîTime would never stop‚ÄîThese two realizations led me to the massively disturbing (practically, self-destructive) hyper-meta question: ‚Äùhow is existence a capability?‚Äú That is‚Äî‚Äúhow, conceptually, can existence occur?‚Äù

I feel it is this that marked the beginning of my chaotically abstract descent. It felt as if the definition of ‚Äòreal‚Äô became very subjective which, consequently, cursed me with a severe ‚Äúbackground anxiety.‚Äù 

Since then, I feel like I‚Äôm on a decline. I struggle more and more with paying attention in school. Motivation has fallen, and therapy doesn‚Äôt seem to be very effective. When something representing ‚Äúthe human condition‚Äù occurs, it has left me with a sort of existential pessimism. Is there hope? The Wikipedia articles I‚Äôve seen to answer this don‚Äôt read indicatively so."
Anyone else find waking up really hard sometimes?,7,kaaj4w,1,"I'll wake up, mildly aware that I'm on my face or side, and that my mother is standing over me and shouting because I overslept.

I sometimes try to move. It usually feels like someone's pressing down on me. Like my arms are made of lead, and my muscles of tissue paper. I'm not exaggerating, I've felt what it's like to have my limbs pinned down by bullies

And so I'll lie there, not moving. I'll try to open my eyes and blink, and resort to fighting to keep them open. Sometimes I can move slightly and my mom decides to leave me, and so I get a lot more time to get up.

But other times, she needs me to hurry for some reason. And so she tries to shake me, talk to me, and she once pulled me out of bed thinking I was faking and would catch myself, but I landed smack on my face.

It always ruins my day, and I honestly don't remember how I manage to get up at all after all that."

It‚Äôs been months since I last posted here on reddit talking about my mental health issues, because the truth is, I was actually feeling better. So I tried to stay away from reddit and all mental health talks. Amidst the locked down and virus, I was actually feeling good til the recent unfortunate event. 

I think it started around the same time when I learned about the death of one of childhood here... Usually when I have episodes of dpdr or dissociation it would only last for a few minutes to hour... Or sometimes it would last for like half a day.. now its been a week.. and no matter how many times I have experienced dissociation/dpdr the feeling is still overwhelming and scary... 

Lately I haven‚Äôt been able to express emotions, I feel like I am losing my mind, I am having vivid imagery whenever I close my eyes, having hard time sleeping, and would feel everything around me isn‚Äôt real. I really feel like I am having schizophrenic/psychosis episodes. I really don‚Äôt want to go crazy or lose my mind.. i‚Äôm scared. What shall I do? Help me please"
A morning to dissociate,0,k8ekfo,2,
Dissociative seizures?,15,k7qig1,5,"I developed PTSD as a child through severe abuse. I wasn't able to get help for it until I was 19 due to people covering the majority abuse and not being allowed to talk about the bad stuff. I had a severe mental breakdown while at college. I forced to talk to a new therapist in the middle of the night by the police. I explained everything and they started getting me the help I needed. The therapist told me that based on my symptoms, I started dissociating as a young teen as well as hallucinations while I displayed classic childhood trauma symptoms which has been reconfirmed by 5 different therapist/psychologists. My full diagnosis is Dissociative PTSD (Depersonilzation and Derealization) with trauma based hallucinations, GAD and major depression. I have been through... A lot. I talk about it a lot in my post/comment history if you want details, but I don't feel like getting fully into it at this moment.

Anyways.

When I was 17, I started having these really weird symptoms. It started as just a normal dissociative attack... But my brain got super fuzzy and numb. Like, the tingling you get when your leg falls asleep but on my brain. My eyes wouldn't focus and I began stuttering. I... Just couldn't speak. Nothing past a single syllable. I got a neurologist but nothing came of it. Yet, my symptoms grew worse. 

I start off dissociating, just the typical, ""I don't recognize myself. Nothing looks real. Are these my hands."" My brain goes numb and tingly as do my fingers. My eyes won't focus. I start stuttering. My body starts getting heavier and heavier and I lose the ability to speak all together. I go into a stupor. I finally can't keep my body up anymore and I collapse. My body stiffens. I hyperventilate. I'm unable to move but my body is stiff. Other people can move me, but I can't. I go back and forth between hyperventilating and just constantly taking in air until I just gasp for air, choking. I start shaking while I just stare into space. 

It lasts... I don't know how long. But, I snap out of it when the fog is lifted off my brain. I still can't move or speak but I slowly I am able to move. Once I'm back up and I can talk, I go into a manic phase. I get super hungry and I end up acting very childish... Like... One day I started screaming and crying and throwing a fit because my sister wouldn't hand me my food... When... Normally, I wouldn't care. My brain is still fuzzy, just not like before. It wont go away until I sleep, which I'll sleep for 12+ hours.

I've spent 5 years trying to figure out why these happen. When I was in college, they would go from 1-2 a week to 3-4 times a day, 6 days a week. I ended up at the hospital so many times. I've had a lot of physical tests done and nothing came up.

This year, I came across dissociative seizures and I thought it made sense. I'm in the process of getting back into therapy... But I wanted to know, does it sound like dissociative seizures? Or something else? Does anyone else get something like this?

EDIT: I forgot to mention. In the past, very rarely, I have also would completely forget moment in time. I would just remember lifting my head up, not collapsing, just lifting my head. Then, a span of time would be gone... Normally a couple of minutes to a few hours, sometimes days. Its happened during conversations which is highly upsetting. Yet, there was once in college where I completely forgotten who I was and where I was. I was eating a candy bar and i lifted up my head. I had no idea where I was. Then I realized I didn't know who I was. I started panicking and looking around. Luckily I had my student badge on the table. I read my name over and over and studied my photo until everything clicked. I now carry my ID around my neck everywhere I go."

is this another form of dissociation?,4,k7jcd6,1,ive experienced depersonalization and derealization a lot through out my life but this particular instance felt different? idk i was at work picking groceries and listening to my podcast when suddenly there was just nothingness. my mind blanked and it had to have only been a few seconds but when i came to i was confused with where i was and what direction i was heading in. i just stood there a for a few minutes so disoriented and confused. it didnt feel like my typical zoning out moments where im stuck in my head.
what does it feel like when you‚Äôre getting out of dissociation?,4,k7fem1,3,I was just wondering what the transition from being dissociated to not being dissociated is like for you.

Dissociation is so scary sometimes and I've only just realised I've been dealing with this for years.,5,k7844p,3,"I want to know if its normal to hallucinate, like, my vision goes all weird and things move when I know they are actually static. My body feels like its falling backwards into a hole and I feel detached from my limbs, like they're not mine. This has been getting worse lately probably due to the stress of my recent suicide attempt and generally higher anxiety worrying about my treatment plans and starting recovery. I just hate my brain why is it doing this to me!?!?!?!"
question,9,k6zgjo,9,"So, whenever I watch a tv show that i really like I basically become obsessed with it.

Dissociating after being in control for sometime,5,k6xej0,0,"Fuck me. 

I have that weird feeling that life is fuzzy and unreal. Maybe I‚Äôve been sitting and staring at my screen too long."
not in control,3,k6zzo9,2,"honestly, i haven't dissociated in a while, so i had thought it had gone away. but the other day, i went to pick up my sister from school and i decided to walk instead of taking the bus. the first few minutes were fine, but after a while i kept getting this feeling that i can only describe as kind of like chills but staticky?? and after that it felt like i wasn't in control of my body. usually, when i've dissociated before i just felt a bit disoriented because it felt like i wasn't in my own body. however, this time, i really felt like i wasn't in control of my body at all. real sunken place stuff. i'm not really good with words so i can't really explain it properly, but it was really scary because i haven't felt like that before, and i was somewhere i wasn't very familiar with. luckily, they only lasted a couple minutes each, but i've had episodes that have lasted days. 

as i'm typing this, i've realized a lot of episodes happen while i'm walking. i mightve just stopped dissociating for a bit because of covid and quarantine idk. i guess my scariest episode was when i was walking down a subway platform, and i didn't know if my body would just drop onto the tracks or what. to top it off it was pretty crowded that day too. i'm kinda rambling sorry, but has anyone felt that weird staticky kinda feeling? and how do you deal with episodes of dissociation? also i've seen some people say that they're in a constant state of dissociation, how do you deal with the feeling of just not being in control?"
Really struggling right now,3,k6zlkn,1,So a couple months back I had a really bad acid trip I steadily recovered and was basically ok. And now I smoked some weed and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm back to where i started. Struggling with death and thinking I‚Äôm in hell while I sleep in a dream. It‚Äôs like all the time I‚Äôm having an existential crisis. Obviously I‚Äôm gonna recover but still it‚Äôs like when nothings wrong with me I crave drugs I think i really need a hobby.

Hey everyone,6,k6oj48,5,"I've been dissociating as long as I can remember, which isn't very long if I'm being honest. I'm pretty sure it's dissociation, as the other day I felt ""normal"" and could note the differences matched the description perfectly.

I could google this, but for some reason I prefer actually interacting with people. If you know of any good sources with the answers to my questions, could you please link it? 

What makes dissociating worse? What causes it? Is the memory loss permanent? In what way is it a bad thing? What is therapy like, and in your experiece, is it effective? What does the therapist do to help? Does it cause you to enjoy or seek pain more?

EDIT: forgot to ask, how does dissociation link in with PTSD and CPTSD? 

Thanks"

Dissociation almost completely gone after starting Wellbutrin,3,k6e3wl,0,"Hey guys!  Title essentially says it all.  In May of this year, after a really awful break up (plus the pandemic, living alone, and working like a dog) that left me with crippling anxiety and depression, I started experiencing hardcore dissociation symptoms (mostly derealization) to the point where I was afraid to leave my apartment and/or drive. It was truly crippling and horrifying. I could only describe it as it felt as though I was in a constant dream, or watching the rest of the world like a movie. I didn‚Äôt trust myself to speak because I didn‚Äôt know whether other people would be able to hear me.

I kind of just lived and dealt with it until July, when I started experiencing panic attacks almost daily.  At that point I finally saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Lexapro.  The lexapro worked miracles for my anxiety but actually made my dissociation symptoms a LOT worse.  I complained constantly about this to my psych, who urged me to keep going with it.

After 3 months of lexapro and worsening dissociation, I switched psychs, and my new psych prescribed me 200mg generic Wellbutrin (Bupropion,100mg SR in the morning and afternoon). I kid you not, the second day I was on bupropion the dissociation symptoms completely went away. 

I have no idea why this was the case. I do know that the lexapro worked wonders for my anxiety but did nothing for my depression, whereas the Wellbutrin is tackling both. So maybe my dissociation was caused more so by depression? I do still occasionally get slight dissociation, but it‚Äôs nothing like it used to be and I can usually snap myself out of it. Whereas before, I was straight up dissociating 24/7 from May - October.

I‚Äôm also just such a happier person on Wellbutrin and have had absolutely 0 side effects. I went from hysterically crying daily to telling my dog how beautiful he is every time I walk by him.  Just wanted to share my success in case this may be helpful for someone. Dissociation is a mother fucking bitch!"
General tips to help with dissociation?,2,k6dacz,0,"Hi! I‚Äôm the guy who made the post about ADHD medicine earlier this week, thanks for all your answers! :) 

I since then stopped my meds and i‚Äôm doing better, should be scheduling an appointment to try something new on monday. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm a bad dissociation case but I really hate it and want to stop it, especially since I know I can go full days without dissociating. Does anyone has tips to help/stop dissociating? Usually if i don‚Äôt think about it or take my meds it‚Äôs good but unfortunately i do think about it. It‚Äôs also pretty bad the days I have family therapy cause of addressing childhood trauma.

Thank you!"
First day not dissociated in months,23,k5u3rc,6,"Hi guys
I guess I'm just looking to see if someone can relate?

So yesterday I had my first day in months where I was not dissociated at ALL for most of the day. And it made me realise some things about dissociation...

1. Dissociation is the main reason I do (or don't do) all the things i hate about myself. When not dissociated i get dressed properly, brush my teeth, feel full after eating, stay hydrated, don't binge eat all day, and keep the flat clean. 
2. I'm a better boyfriend when not dissociated. 
3. Dissociation DOES severely impact my quality of work and ability to stay focused at work. 

But the strangest thing for me is that there is definitely a ""negative"" to not being dissociated. I'm trans, and found that when not dissociated my dysphoria is a lot worse  and really bothers me (usually its just background noise). I also found my anxiety to be slightly higher. 

I've realised now that my dissociation IS an issue - previously just got so used to it that I accepted it as normal. Is there hope for treatment to have more days like yesterday?"

dissociations and seizures,3,k5y28c,4,"I went to a psychiatrist yesterday for all of this. She said i need to see a neurologist because I have a history of concussions, migraines and headaches and she said the dissociations might actually be seizures. she also mentions it might be parasomnia as well. Has anyone else had this theory given to then? Even if not I hope this narrowed down some of your searches for what the hell is even going on"
I just realized something..,34,k5hwbw,10,"With how detached from ourselves right now, when we eventually figure out how to reattach everything will feel that much better, and we will actually have a deep appreciation for it. Maybe others are enjoying life more rn but we will have unlimited joy when we finally are healed, because of our vantage point from pain.

You only know how good you feel when you have been used to feeling bad."
Dissociation reality checks?,3,k5u6ed,0,"So...a night ago I was talking to my husband, and there was a moment where I looked at him and almost started crying because he was real. 

But then I guess I had dissociative amnesia because he said I started asking if my ex was coming back. I started asking if I had to go home because husband and I were long distance for the longest time. I regressed to a year ago. I‚Äôm only diagnosed with Bipolar 2, Autism, and PTSD. 

This has apparently happened a few times with other people. Does this sound like dissociation? I don‚Äôt know why I thought it was a year ago. 

Also, my dissociation manifests as my legs won‚Äôt move once it starts."
"Dissociation of some kind, but I can't figure out what?",3,k5sdqq,1,"Okay. So, for awhile now, I've been having sudden changes in my.. entire mood and self, where, I'll suddenly almost feel like I'm reliving an entirely different version of myself, except, it's not me? It's kind of like, I enter an entirely different persons mindset, except that ""mindset"" usually holds extreme vivid memories of different periods of time. I'm not me anymore when that happens. It feels like I'm a different person, in a different time of my life. I don't know how to describe this. By talking to people, I've come to think it MUST be something dissociation related. I have a friend with diagnosed DID, and they said it sounds similar to that, but I feel like that just.. can't be true? I feel sort of like I'm lying to myself. Another thing is maybe depersonalization/derealization. I just don't know, and it's honestly so frustrating.

For some more background, I'm female, 20, diagnosed PTSD, among some other stuff but I feel like that might be most relevant."

Thirdly, I have posted this to multiple subreddits because I'd generally love to see different people's opinions on this, show this incredible piece of art to more people, spread awareness about dementia, derealization, dissociation and depersonalization and generally share my point of view to start a discussion of this incredibly interesting yet morbid topic, and also share my experience with how I felt and a direct description of my derealization and dissociation episode that I got during around minute 18 in this video: [https://youtu.be/l\_x08kbj-Fk](https://youtu.be/l_x08kbj-Fk) ,which is a detailed description of the 6 hour album.

**Now to talk about the album and the subject matter itself**. To note: I'm not in any way shape or form trying to belittle dementia by comparing it to derealazing, but it's the only thing I have actually experienced under the umbrella of losing one's self and that is why I'm hugely referencing it. The music itself, even if I didn't get to the end of the 6 hour masterpiece is an incredibly beautiful piece of artwork really. It felt like it hit so close to home even if what they were portraying was a long life struggle the 20 minute format the video was in was the best representation in words I've ever seen describing someone lose themselves. Maybe because it was so short it hit so close since my episodes usually never last more then a few hours, even if its supposed to portray a disease that eats slowly at someone on the matter of years. Even if dementia is memory related, and I might have dug to deep here, I feel like the loss of that ones memories is directly correlated to the loss of ones self, what makes them them, the them loses itself and I believe that's why it felt to me at least like a walk I've done 100 times but this time the road was twisted to a destination that I couldn't remember, but of which I knew.

I am sorry for not being able to add more to the subject, but I greatly feel that saying more about the piece would mean much much less the intended. Even if I would want to talk more about hoe i see losing ones self in art, the piece should be let speak for itself. That is why I really recommend the video to be watched and maybe even the album been listened to in it entirety, because its worth it, it leaves you speechless the good kind of speechless and its an experience that's worth living.

&#x200B;

**My own experience with listening to the 20 minute video about the album:**

I usually listen to documentaries in the shower, the burning water hitting my skin caresses with soft spoken voices of things that otherworldly, world or so much resembling one that it switches to the other. Never had I felt the need to stop a video unless I didn't understand a sentence, but this time I needed to stop it because it felt like life flashing in front of my eyes while I was seeing dark, when all it was were my hands flickering into a void cause they felt the need to be held, while I was carelessly watching not nurturing like id usually do. The moment I stopped the video that moment my tears from the words heard before had stopped. That moment the panic settled in. That moment my hands went sporadically to scratch myself, as the me that's me when I'm not here was trying to itch the outside layer of myself off from my inner self to protect it, like a dog at an owners gravestone after the panic of loss had settled, they feeling of a knife at their neck while sobbing numbly. While the harsh finger nails were digging deep into my back and although what I was actually watching with my very eyes was a blurry representation of what was in front of me, I felt as if I was in my head or as if my brain was making me choose to also me in the back of my head. Watch myself from a 3rd person perspective in my head on a chair in a large room as large as many men greater then me had been driven mad at the thought of its size before. I was watching a horrid yet unusually calm video being played on a wall with a projector. The mini film playing was of me in the position my body had been seemingly stuck in for the time being as a young woman on a wooden stool, that made the decision to turn herself into stone, at the end resembling a Greek statue, in fear that the rodents at her feet would eat her up. The shots of the movie playing go as follows, the woman on the stool, the rodents come to her feet, she makes no change in expression. Following shots are zoomed in on each part of her body from the feet to the head. You can feel her fear as soon as you'd think the human eating mice would touch her flesh, then her feet turn into stone, what follows is a chase, a chase inside her mind, a chase of her being turned into stone while the rodents go up her petrified self, she makes no change in facial expression, but i feel her experiencing a courageous breakthrough as before her right hand is turned into sculpted marble she waves it in the air, leading to her final stone shape as an angel reaching for heaven. The movie playing then goes back to a full shot of the woman. The rodents that were on her frail body before disappear as fast as they came. They didn't puff in thin air, they didn't care what happened next their goal was defeated. With a glitch of the movie tape being played the switch from one frame to the other leads to their disappearance. The movie felt like was in slow motion, but my mind was making me watch myself watch it in a speed up manner so much that it seemed so distorted.

I am rarely able to state what happens in a derealization/disassociation mind set but this time it cut off right before amnesia kicked in. It cut off in a way making me feel complete, like if one second less or more had happened it would have all been shattered. It left me feeling complete, as if I had finally understood that I am what reality makes of myself, that is if reality even is, which I have not making that feeling even more strange yet familiar at the same time.

This YouTube rabbit hole has to have been the best one I've ever fallen in. I am deeply sorry for my lack of better words in which I didn't add much to the original, other then my experience and that is simply because during my listening of it I felt as it spoke for me.

Thank you for listening to my rant about this topic, its highly appreciated if you did get to the end, but now i have to ask you, how did it make you feel?

Is it dissociation?,22,k3y1o8,2,"I was pretty certain that I experience dissociation, but a conversation with a mental health nurse today has made me very confused and unsure.

I experience periods where I scroll mindlessly on my phone, not registering what I'm looking at or what is around me, just scrolling and thinking, but not knowing what I'm even thinking, time is just passing - the nurse says that this sounds more like ""avoidance"" than dissociation, which has thrown me, because I found that grounding techniques such as rolling ice cubes on my head, having a hot bath and using hot smells could 'snap' me out of it, so I'm now paranoid that I've been making the whole thing up - I know that probably makes no sense.

I also get into a 'self hatred spiral', where I am attacked by derogatory thoughts and am unable to focus on anything around me, all I can do is curl up with these thoughts and it's so difficult to get out of; I also believed this might be a form of dissociation, but now I'm not so sure.

To your knowledge, does this sound like dissociation or just avoidance?"
trying to describe how dissociation feels for me,4,k492dv,0,"i havent been feeling like myself lately. ive had these symptoms as long as i can remember (which isnt a lot) but the intensity and frequency has been may more since maybe march. i had started zoloft 50 mg and had been taking it very inconsistently, sometimes taking more than needed if i wanted a change in feeling. it was a bad time for me. 

i feel disconnected from almost everything. myself, people around me, places, emotions, school. i feel like i cant feel my body but i can? or like its in a different place than how im feeling it. my emotions feel more like a physical sensation in/on my body rather than a feeling. when im sad its like a feeling in my chest and face. like light pressure. i dont feel the same as how i used to when i‚Äôd cry. hell i can barely cry anymore without listening to music. i find it hard to even focus my eyes on things, unfocusing my eyes just feels easier. 

i‚Äôll see moving shadow figures and random things moving that arent even there, especially in the dark. ive almost tripped over nothing because i thought i saw my dog walking between my legs. it just affects everything and everywhere. i dont remember most of my day bc i spent it completely disconnecting from my surroundings. i just feel like im just in my brain. with one blink it feels like im in a new conscious mind and nothing i just did even happened. the memory is so bad. i feel like i cant remember anything. i often see things around me as 2d or that the objects around me are images on a flat plane. i have a hard time recognizing anything anymore, sometimes people. all my memories have no meaning to me. i feel nothing when i think of good memories, when i think of bad memories. i dont know what it could have stemmed from. i dont even think i remember all of my trauma i just wanna know the root. theres just static when i think about the past, the future, the present. its just all static and fog. i get really paranoid when i look at myself in the mirror. nothing even stands out its just another thing. no definition, no significance."

Has anyone dissociated for anything longer than a few days?,14,k3q038,17,"&#x200B;

My ex-partner *accidentally* drugged me and this caused me to have dissociative seizures, where I faded in and out of consciousness. tw- >!he then took advantage of me.!<

That was in march, and I'm coming on 8 months now where I've been continuously dissociating, specifically experiencing derealization. I have a therapist but I ditched him because he never talked about my dissociation when I did, and I have a new appointment on december 3. 

I've been in multiple car accidents (5/6 were with inanimate objects and 1/6 was with a guy who hit me on purpose), had 2 suicide attempts and been in and out of the hospital for some physical abuse. I'm saying this because it has severely impacted my dissociation and, I think, prolonged it.

I experience derealization due to a prolonged freeze + flop response that I've been doing since I was 10 years old. I just don't know why its gone on for this long.

 I've been doing research, after not doing so for months (I thought thinking about it more would make it worse but I've since then started DBT), and I've only read personal stories of people saying they've dissociated for at most, 4 months. 

**tldr; Most people seem to dissociate for days even? I'd like to know how much of an outlier my experience is so let me what your longest episode has been.**"
Questioning what happened here,14,k3h4sp,3,"Did anyone experience feeling like a new being in their body, hearing demeaning voices and child voices, age sliding, etc and an amnesiac barrier beforehand? And being stuck in that state for longer than you should have, though the voices and visual hallucinations ended?

And believing that you weren‚Äôt the person you were before and didn‚Äôt have the same identity
As that you 
And when you realized what it was...(me through research) your brain rewired to include the past you And their associations 

Because I had emotional amnesia, delusions that I wasn‚Äôt the same Amanda and I was a baby...i believed that my thoughts and words weren‚Äôt my own...
And obviously I split off from that consciousness     And formed new neural associations i guess But then regained my personality and all those old associations when I realized that I was the same girl"
ADHD medicine making me dissociate?,15,k3h40z,10,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve had some sort of dissociation for a pretty long time now, most probably as a result of childhood trauma. I‚Äôm not ongoing family therapy to address that trauma which of course, makes me dissociate more. For reference, as a kid I had the feeling of being in my own bubble, like if I was isolated from everyone around me, especially in crowded or school settings. I smoked weed a couple times from the age of 13 and started getting bad dissociation when I smoked, so I stopped and continued trying it a few more times but soon realized that most of the time it resulted in me dissociating, last time I smoked is September (made me see weird, kinda delayed in a way, feel isolated from the outside world, hard to move and feel like I kept waking up and drifting back to a sorta sleep while still being able to interact with my surroundings). Weed definitely triggered this sort of dissociation and I don‚Äôt plan on touching that shit again. 

Anyways, I got back on ADHD meds beginning of october (Vyvanse 20mg) and seem to be dissociating more (short periods but pretty much everyday) since i started. I made a test and stopped for a couple days this week and almost didn‚Äôt dissociate at all. I took them today and it started again. The thing is, I can‚Äôt just not take ADHD meds long term, as my grades suck in school and i have no motivation whatsoever without them. 

Anyone has similar experiences? Any other meds that didn‚Äôt do that? Stuff I can do to help it? I took an appointment with my psychiatrist about the meds but i‚Äôm curious to see if i‚Äôm alone in this and how i can help it."
Do y‚Äôall know what caused your dissociation?,5,k3gpfn,19,"I‚Äôm thinking about this a lot, when and why it started. I once consumed too much weed and had a lot of traumas happening in that time, so I think it‚Äôs a combination of everything.

How you're CREATING dissociation/dpdr by feeling in REVERSE [MIND-BLOWING],18,k0bcw4,2,"Trying to find an explanation for your emotions and understand what they mean before you feel them? üòè

The paradox is that you want to be spontaneous, quick, go with the flow, but at the same time you still want to have the control on how you feel and you get frustrated when you don't feel what ""you should feel"", you should feel more, you shouldn't feel this, it doesn't make any sense, it's not the right time etc.

Finding an explanation, cause, meaning, answer, story, justification for your feelings before you immerse yourself in them. And on the long-term you start to feel numb. You start to feel detached from yourself. And what do you do? You try to ""mentally fix it from above"". How?

By TRYING to feel, checking in, double checking, trying to so hard to feel, idealizing your old self and how much life was good back then, a constant mental effort in wanting and trying so hard to get your emotions back - and at the same time discarding spontaneous feelings when they come out of nowhere because they do not meet your logical criteria of how you're supposed to feel in this moment - and instead of just feeling without knowing why, you REACT with fear, anxiety and panic.

It's not a problem of not having emotions, it's a problem of - you guessed it - CONTROL. üëå

These are quick mental fixes from above to an unconscious problem. The answer is found not in trying so hard, but in RELEASING that control! You don't realize that you have the answer right in front of you, however uncomfortable it may be, the moment you stop trying so hard!

This constant mental effort of trying to change how you feel and editing your internal experience to another ""more pleasurable channel"" and forcing it to be different creates even more stress, overwhelm, chaos, distance with yourself. You want to be spontaneous but you're not willing to 'do' what it takes be really spontaneous: LET GO OF CONTROL.

I call this ""reverse feeling"" and it's a dissociative mechanism whereby you're putting logical prerequisites before the actual experience of the emotion.

Learn how the solution lies not in 'getting rid of it' but understanding what this mechanism is doing for you and if you really need it, keep it! No one is forcing you to get better, you can always stay where you are!

Getting used to feeling WITHOUT KNOWING WHY and BEING OK with it is one of the biggest favors you can do to yourself. Funny enough the moment you stop looking for the why, precisely when you don't care about it, that's when the answer comes to you.

How to Focus While Dissociating?,7,jzmqjb,2,"I've been dissociating for most of my life, whether it be daydreaming throughout my entire fourth grade math class or forgetting weeks or months as they pass by. Yesterday, however, it was like a reached a whole new level of disconnection from myself. My vision kept un-focusing, I couldn't read anything longer than three sentences, and my friend's voice (which I'd been hearing/talking with for about hour before this hit) basically went in one ear and out the other. It felt like any weak connection I had to my existence had been totally severed; my brain and my body were legitimately two separate entities. I've pretty much been stuck in this state since yesterday, and it's preventing me from getting any schoolwork done. I'm majorly behind in one of my classes and have a bunch of essays and assignments due tomorrow, so I need to find a way to work. 

Unfortunately, grounding myself is not something I can afford to do right now. I've never been able to deal with my emotions well, and I'm not in a safe enough space to process all of it. I've grounded myself through breathing exercises and the 5-4-3-2-1 thing before, and because of the flood of emotions that crashes onto me when I'm back in my body, I usually end up more miserable than when I started. For me, not feeling anything is the best way to deal with things for the time being. Not necessarily healthy, I know, but it's what I've got. So besides grounding, is there anything I can do to get my work done?

Again, I'm totally dissociated as I write this now, so none of this is really making any sense to me. Feel free to point out any typos/grammar mistakes/literal nonsense.

**TLDR;** Without grounding myself, what can I do to focus while being dissociated? Do you guys have any helpful techniques?"
DAE not know what they are saying as they are saying it?,52,jzbkg3,20,"I just want to know why. In my head I keep repeating, ‚Äúit‚Äôs because you‚Äôre crazy‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou just think you‚Äôre going crazy for the drama‚Äù but even those thoughts seem not-mine. They‚Äôre in English, my second language. I find that when I have thoughts in English, they‚Äôre about what I think I‚Äôm *supposed* to think, the right response, the predictable narrative outcome. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm not crazy. I think, ‚ÄúI must be making it up for attention‚Äù, but even that thought is in English, so its source isn‚Äôt truly me. English is such a fictional language and this goes beyond English. 

I‚Äôve tried to type so many posts only to backspace. In short, my biggest fear is that I will be found out. It‚Äôs like if your friend sitting next to you was playing an online competitive game, one you barely understand, and suddenly he hands you the controller and tells you to take over while he goes do some things. When I respond to my mother and I am in the middle of a sentence, the controller is passed to me suddenly and I stop in the middle of the sentence. I don‚Äôt know what thought I was saying or what our conversation is about. But I somehow utter the words that someone put in my mouth as though awkwardly turning the gears in a wind-up toy. I slur words or mix up syllables or sounds. Say the wrong word or sounds out of order. I am afraid that she will ask if something‚Äôs wrong and I will have no escape. She will know I‚Äôm not who I‚Äôm supposed to be. 

Sometimes, I‚Äôll replay a mind recording of the conversation I don‚Äôt remember choosing words for, and determine that my answers do in fact make sense despite everything. Other times I fear I came too close to the being found out part. 

Please. Does anyone else feel this. I‚Äôm so tired. My thoughts are everywhere and this is my fourth attempt at this post. Thank you

Can someone help me with doubts about DID and dissociating? (long post sorry),5,jxprkg,4,"So, I've been searching a lot about DID and it fascinates me, but I've noticed some things about myself as well and I'm not really sure if I would fit in the spectrum?

From the start, I think I might dissociate but I'm not really sure because sometimes, not sure why (my main theory is stress so far) I blank out. Like, I start staring at nothing and my vision gets all blurry and I feel extremely lethargic and simply stop moving or move slowly in repetitive movements if I was doing something like drawing (the lines get thicker and more pointy), but my brain, my mind, keeps in there very aware and hyper-focused on my hearing and my thoughts as if I'm not there and there at the same time.

I've been going to a therapist as well lately and I discovered that I don't feel emotions, I can still read a situation and know if I should be happy, sad, angry or whatever else and I may notice more subtle ones like stress when I notice a lack of appetite and hair loss during my daily or weekly routine. And there are cases where I think I feel something as when you're happy you feel your chest heating up, right? I think I felt that once in my life when I was little but that's everything I got. I don't feel it anymore, if anything, I may laugh or smile in front of others to keep appearance or even alone (but when I'm alone it happens only after something funny that was unexpectable happens and a second later it's gone, and it's all numb, no feeling at all, just a change in expression that disappears just like that).

I mentioned my therapist because yesterday she asked me to draw myself when I was little so that we could work on that (I can draw with some confidence as I've done it for six years now?) and I did it, but the thing is, I drew myself as five different characters.

The thing is, all those characters are the same, at different ages and using slightly different clothes and have different names and one of them has a nickname.

First, I drew Sara, she's a teenager, I think, and she uses a green-bluish sweater with a hoodie over her head, the hoodie has cat ears stitched on it as well as a small cat face that has stitches for eyes and mouth (it looks sad as the ears and mouth are downwards), and a button for the nose, the hoodie as well as a long ribbon attached to it on the back as if it was a three-coloured tail with another button at the end. The hoodie is big, but not overly big, and she has very short shorts and a three-colored pantyhose wherein one leg the strips are small and the other the strips are really big. She is sitting on a staircase, that was where I used to sit at my school, and she looks really sad/bored. I didn't draw her shoes. Her hair is really long with a single pink stripe on her long fringe and the end of her long hair dyed as well.

The next one I did was Alexa (Kat is her nickname) she seems slightly younger than Sara and her hair is significantly shorter, while Sara's go all the way to her back Alexa's stop on her shoulders. She ties a portion of her side and fringe back and she has the hoodie tied to her waist, she has a small blouse that one short sleeve while the other side only has a strip, the shorts and pantyhose are the same, and she uses braces. She has the same stripe of hair dyed on her long fringe. Oh, and as she has the hoodie tied to her waist she was the ribbon tail as well as it is lifted in the air as if it can move on its own (Sara's ribbon is mostly stagnated and acts like a normal ribbon should). She seems to be really happy and energetic as well as confident in herself.

Then there's the older, she really doesn't like a name as, after I drew all of them, each time I saw one a name popped up in my head and she really didn't want one so she's just called the older. She uses glasses and, as her ""name"" says she is the older one with the most mature face. Her hair is really short, above shoulders, and she doesn't have the stripe, but she does have some dye on the ends of her hair, a very light dye but no idea what color. I only drew her upper body and she used the same shirt as Alexa but she does not have the hoodie on her and I have the impression she uses normal jeans and plain shoes. She just looks like a responsible adult taking care of the others.

Then there's May, she looks to be the smallest of all of them, she likes to use a heck ton of makeup and her hair is as long, if not longer, than Sara's. I have no idea what clothes she is using as I drew only her head but it looks to be the same pink shirt and her his is dyed in the same way as Sara's. She seems somewhat confident and slutty but something tells me she's a crybaby and too cocky for her own good even if she's really small, not sure of her age tought, she seems to be eight, but her expression says fucking cocky and dumb adult.

And lastly, there's Mia. She was the strangest one to draw as I started ""blanking out"" A LOT when I was doing her. She seems to be the older's age and she uses the hoodie, but the ears are not there as horns seem to have grown on her head torning the hoodie in the process. She has huge and heavy shackles on her wrists and her hands have long black claws. Her mouth is shut by what looks to be metal bands of some sort and her hair is shoulder length but it's not curly and well taken care of like the others, but it still is dyed in the same place. She has a huge ""X"" scar on her face and she has blood on the corner of her eyes and mouth. I drew her three times, one was only her face, the second she screaming as her claws gripped he head e through the hoodie so hard she broke her skin and it started to bleed as her eyes are closed and her mouth opened in a silent scream while the metal bands that previously kept it shut shredded her lips and blood started to pour out. The third one is her with her head on the floor and her hands in front of her.

The strangest thing is, I blanked out a lot when drawing her, I totally remember drawing her and I did it with my own hand but I would start blanking out and more thick and rigid lines appeared and I remember doing them when I was on the back of my mind, but just looking at the drawing so I can write about it makes me start feeling like I'm baking out again.

And I really don't have too much memory of my childhood, for me, it is a common thing but maybe not? Like, I just remember bits and pieces here and there but it's very fuzzy in a lot of points and I really remember nothing with certainty before my 13th anniversary?

I think these blanking outs would be disassociation, right? I know people say they can see themselves when it happens but I don't, like, I can if I want to even when I'm not disassociating but I simply don't, I keep in the blank out state as it's comfortable, I feel at peace? Maybe it's the only time I really feel something and my chest feels strange and I simply like to keep on that state, but I know I shouldn't so I relish on the feeling for a few seconds, sometimes some minutes, before coming back and fighting to not disassociate again.

Keep in mind that all these ""alters"" for lack of a better name, are very alike if not the same person in different ages or states of mind (I think this is the case). They all have different personalities and qualities and different names, or lack of, as I do have a name, but nome of them answered to it as even I'm not very fond of it, like, I don't have problems with my name, I just don't care?

And sometimes I've felt like other people talked to me in my head, like, the voice is the same as mine, but slightly different at the same time depending on their personality? For example, sometimes I'm just hearing a lot of bullshit like ""You're an ungrateful brat, idiot, worthless"" and all that fun stuff before another one coming and being like ""stop this shit already, just ignore it"". When this starts I feel like my head is in a hurricane of bad thoughts until this other voice comes and I just stop listening to it and, eventually, it stops and all feelings are gone.

TLDR: I think I may have alters but I do not switch, or at least have not switched for a long time as before my 13th, or 12th, birthday I remember nothing other than bits and pieces, and I'm just not really sure what it may be. Or I'm just stupid and crazy... Oh well.

I'm really afraid of telling my therapist this shit ,-, I already have enough problems as it is with my emotions, or lack of, in this case."
dissociation and how it affects me i think?,5,jxkioe,2,"sorry for mentioning bts if that triggers some of you that may read this aha. i just thought itd be good to include an example of how i think or something idk. the song is also called ""life goes on"" :)

bts's new song came out and the bridge/chorus really made me think. 

it goes: ""there's no end in sight, is there a way out? my feet refuse to move oh. close your eyes for a moment, hold my hand. to that future, lets run away"" 

i dont know why but it makes me want to cry. i eventually did cry while watching the mv again lol. it made me think of myself. like how i dont think there will be an end to my dissociated consciousness and feelings. i dont know if there'll be a way out of it or a way to help me. then the rest just like really idk. lol. 

idk how it makes me feel but i just think its like. idk. do i want that? someone like that i mean. someone to grasp ahold of my hand and help me move forward? i just want someone with me that i can talk to and be comfortable with and maybe with them being there it'll help me. their warmth will help me maybe. 

i wasnt really sure what dissociation was awhile ago and looked up something that was similar and saw dissociation and clicked it. i read it and it seemed pretty accurate to what i thought was going on with myself so i self diagnosed myself aha. reading some peoples' descriptions and definitions of it helped me realize certain situations or episodes ive had were a part of dissociation. 

i forget pretty much the whole day, i cant remember anything from past days, i cant even remember what day of the week it is even if ive asked multiple times within 30 minutes, nor keep track if the day of the week is or mistake it for a different day. 

my memory has gotten significantly worse and i often find myself zoning out while thinking about nothing. my brain feels so blank even as im writing this. my body feels so blank and empty. i cant feel emotions anymore but i might be able to subconsciously know how im feeling sometimes, but not physically feel anything related to emotions. everything i do seems so empty. 

i read about the grounding but im unsure on where to start and how to do it. im glad theres a subreddit on this aha, i didnt even know there was until my friend showed and told me about a post they made awhile ago so they could try to help me."
I(19F) need help/advice about how to ground myself,32,jx7qes,10,"I never knew that what I was going through had a name. When I was younger I would go into movie theaters and watch movies/read books and be completely immersed in what was happening. By the time I had finished the book or the movie was over I‚Äôd feel very off and not like myself. It‚Äôs like I was in the world, I just thought I was connecting to whatever media I was interacting with. But lately it‚Äôs been caused by my dreams. I‚Äôd have such vivid dreams and I‚Äôd wake up feeling differently about other people and my own reality. I just can‚Äôt grasp what‚Äôs happened was fake and it‚Äôs like everything in my reality is now in another perspective. I zone out and it‚Äôs really hard for me to concentrate on whatever I‚Äôm doing or what reality I‚Äôm in. Honestly I could freak out but right now I‚Äôm kind of experiencing it. But I have work to do and I want it to stop. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to ground myself? I‚Äôm trying not to freak out but it feels so weird and I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs changing my perceptions of people and even myself and surroundings. Thank you so much"
First episode after a long while,3,jxjeia,0,"So I've commented here and there the past few months, trying to help others without actually dissociating myself. My last episode was at the beginning of quarantine in like, April. Anyway, I'm in a very odd state right now. My long term partner has been visiting but the only way she could get here was by her other partner bringing her, who is pretty new and someone I hadn't met yet. At first, she had family she was going to stay with but somehow it turned out she is staying here as well. I thought I'd be fine because I'm not a jealous person and I was grateful for her making the trip happen. But I've been very emotional and angry, as has the other partner. That has led to us all 3 being emotionally charged. It came to blows today and now I'm completely drained. I had a panic attack because I made a big decision without thinking about it enough. Since then, I've dissociated. I think I'm still scared but I can't actually feel it."
Does anyone else experience these symptoms too?,9,jxehr1,1,"I‚Äôve been struggling with dissociation for over two years know and I‚Äôm still not sure what caused it. However I‚Äôve been able to identify some recurring symptoms. Whenever i start dissociating, my vision becomes blurry, i have this feeling of vertigo and my hands become sweaty. I can‚Äôt concentrate on simple tasks and everything sounds very loud. My head tends to feel heavier too and sometimes i need to lie down.."
i‚Äôm just want to be happy again,17,jx3syl,19,"I cant stop the thoughts that make me dissociate. It‚Äôs like my mind only wants to be numb. I‚Äôm so tired and i‚Äôm so scared because i‚Äôm not getting better and it‚Äôs been 2 months. I‚Äôm only 16 and i feel like i‚Äôm missing out on so much. The last couple of months felt like a blur. I don‚Äôt even feel like myself anymore. I try not to cry but i can‚Äôt help it. It‚Äôs a never ending cycle of thoughts, dissociation, getting scared of dissociation, more dissociation and then just living the rest of my days feeling that i‚Äôm so not real."

Question for people with bad memory loss going back to childhood,37,jwpg2f,16,"I have dissociative amnesia to where I can‚Äôt remember a lot of parts of my childhood and even pass that going into elementary, middle and high school. 

What I‚Äôve been questioning to myself now that I‚Äôm older is, 
Was I disassociating through all those younger years of my life? 
or
Have I only been disassociating after my high school years and that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt remember my past?

Does anyone with childhood memory loss have a guess to which one sounds more accurate?"
Struggling to Let Go,21,jwgqlb,10,"Does anyone feel like they have trouble letting their body take over itself when trying to ground for an extended period of time? Every time I try, I keep stopping. I notice the changes in my body and I begin to get uncomfortable. I know I‚Äôm heading towards a good place(home) and the changes are positive but what‚Äôs next once I get there? How will I feel? Will I feel depressed, excited or just plain normal? Will I return to the awful realization that brought me to where I am now? How do I live my life in a place I‚Äôve been gone from for so long? I don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs very frightening for me. Does anybody else feel this and if you do how‚Äôd you break out of it once you did?"
Sometimes Movies Feel More Real Than My Reality,67,jvyuwr,6,"ive (17F) had dissociation from a very young age due to childhood trauma. it feels like as time passes it‚Äôs just getting worse. I often lose myself in movies and shows and books just to feel alive. When i‚Äôm reading or watching films it feels real, it feels More real than reality. Then when i step out of that world, my life feels even more fake. At this point nothing feels real and everything looks as if someone turned the sharpness setting a little too high. Watching series after series and reading books are the only thing keeping me sane at this point, they make me feel alive, but i‚Äôm so scared of wasting my life away. time passes and passes and i still feel the same, i still feel wrong. Do you guys feel that way? do movies and books often feel more real than reality? I‚Äôm scared and wish this feeling would go away. I can‚Äôt even remember what it felt like to be normal."
Is this ‚Äúnormal‚Äù?,2,jwflbi,5,"My SO gets angry with me or bored And about every 3 to 4 months will cheat on me in one way, shape or form. They won‚Äôt tell me that they did it And if they do it‚Äôs in the reference that it was my fault. Something I did made them act this way. Claims they want to be monogamous, but they don‚Äôt act as though this is their goal. Is this ‚Äúnormal‚Äù?"
Hearing screams when dissociating?,10,jw7vb9,13,"hi i (F16) dissociate sometimes, and sometimes I hear screaming in the back of my head. It feels like everything around me is suddenly very loud, and I know through my ears it's actually a normal volume, and if someone is speaking it's never in a yelling tone, but in my head the volume is way up and it feels really overwhelming. I can hear this far away scream in the back of my mind at the same time, it feels like i'm hearing the sound and making it at the same time. Ive had a recurring dream with the exact same scream in the background in the sense that it feels the same. This doesnt usually last too long, never longer than about 10 minutes id say, and i cant pinpoint why it happens, sometimes itll be during a test other times its just listening to music on the bus. Has anyone else had this experience? frankly im a bit scared but ive never had an episode of any kind or been diagnosed with a disorder"
Does looking the mirror help anyone else?,7,jw12hx,10,I'm thinking of buying a small mirror to carry with me to look myself in the eyes ever so often. Anyone else do that? Anyone find mirrors helpful?
so what exactly is dissociation?,4,jw3ncd,2,"so what info i got about dissociation, is that dissociation is basically detachment from reality, ive seen people say that foods lose taste and fun activities arent fun anymore so therefore its anhedonia / depression guaranteed, another thing is that its caused from a trauma /panic diaorder and also causes us too become detached from your own thoughts and feelings - therefore we are unable to truly realize whats causing Dd , which makes it even harder to fight it .so to summarize - we space out alot, activities arent fun anymore , nothing feels real, we are constantly stuck in our head with anxiety that we cannot even fight, .....

Had a bad weed trip and have not been the same since,4,jw0bp9,8,"About a month ago I decided to smoke some weed with my friends. I‚Äôm not a regular smoker but that day I felt like it - WISH I HADNT. My friend gave me a hit from his pipe and I really didn‚Äôt feel anything so I took another big hit and kept it in for very long. At first I got giggly but before I knew it I felt like I had to get up and started to feel my heart racing. That‚Äôs when my friend told me this strain of sativa had the highest THC content at the dispensary- no kidding! I told them I wanted to walk, I needed to move so we did and btw we were outdoors. And then as we walked a million thoughts went through my head in the span of two minutes and I had to stop. I had a mini existencial crisis. My life felt meaningless like I was just part of this big simulation like it wouldn‚Äôt matter if I died but if I did would I just be another kid in the news that others would forget about? I felt like my fight or flight was on and I felt like an animal trying to run away from danger. Why was I the main character in this situation? Am I the main character, but why me? And then I just felt like there was no point to anything and that this is what people who are about to die feel and then I FELT LIKE I WAS DYING. I thought I was going to die. My friends told me they were gonna walk me home and I felt safer but I was still gone. My mind was elsewhere and I could see my body walking. And then I decided that I would let go that that was it. So I threw myself in feb grass with my eyes closed and prepared to die. And then the sunlight hit me directly and I knew I couldn‚Äôt just let go yet so I stood up and began to yell ‚ÄúCALL 911‚Äù. My friends tried to calm me down but I kept saying I needed to go to the hospital so they finally called 911. The ambulance came and the paramedics took my vitals and assured me I was fine and that I was just having a bad trip and that my friends would take care of me. I live in a very liberal college town so no one got in trouble. Then my friends took me home and we got pizza and I was fine.

But since then my depression has come back, I‚Äôve had lots of anxiety, I feel like I‚Äôm literally going insane. I‚Äôm a bit of a hypochondriac and having my brain play tricks on me about dying has made me more scared about illness and death because now I feel like I know what dying would feel like. I‚Äôve been sleeping less.

The only moments when I feel like I can truly escape my mind are when I drink with my friends.

Since that day I feel like I need to be doing something to escape like eating, or smoking cigarettes, or taking adderall , or drinking, or smoking hybrid strains (those don‚Äôt give me paranoia) or just walking. Worst is I‚Äôm thinking of doing other drugs like Xanax that can just help me.

I feel dissociated from reality in a way and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real or not anymore. I have a lot of existencial questions and I‚Äôm very scared every second of the day and have an awful gut feeling. I wanna cry and scream. I just want to feel normal again."
"TW//death. My parents are angry I don‚Äôt have my license, but my dissociation is too bad",3,jvz324,3,"TW// mention of death

My parents got me (17F) into drivers ed when i was 15. I passed the class, but i put off getting my license for a month, then two months.. then a year, then two years. My parents remind me every day that I should have my license and how irresponsible I am (mostly my step mother.) The thing is, when i was in my freshman year of HS my very close family friend died. He was a few years older than me, and we were very close. he passed away on his way to work when the driver fell asleep while driving, and they went off the road. This was extremely hard for me to handle, and I couldn‚Äôt even get myself to go into a car for months. I would have panic attacks whenever i was in a car or if my friends or family were in a car. Eventually i got myself to be comfortable enough to be in a car, but even to this day I restlessly watch the road and panic. Well, I also have dissociation from a young age, and when i drive not only do I panic because of what happened to my friend, but I get so dissociated that i feel like i‚Äôm not there. i could close my eyes and nothing is real, that scares me when it comes to driving. what if i dissociate while driving? what if i panic? what if i fall asleep? my dissociation is so severe I cant even feel my body when i‚Äôm driving. I‚Äôm scared i will lose control of the wheel. I want my license one day, but right now i am so bad mentally i can‚Äôt do it. my parents do Not understand. every day they talk about it, i‚Äôve even offered to pay them back for the Drivers Ed money. they know I have PTSD and they know i have dissociation, but still they don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt just ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù and get my license. I‚Äôm not sure what i‚Äôm looking for here, maybe just some encouraging words? i‚Äôm tired of being told i‚Äôm lazy and irresponsible."
thoughts and experiences,1,jw74gy,2,"Hello all

I (20f) have experienced certain aspects of disassociation for a while now, and am doing a research project on Disassociation/Depersonalization/Derealisation for uni. i thought this would be an interesting and informal way to gather information on how different people experience Disassociation... If you would like to participate, simply comment some of your experiences -past or present-, thoughts, feelings, etc. as someone who experiences Disassociation. you can be as detailed or non-detailed as you‚Äôd like, and likewise share anything you feel comfortable sharing."

What does dissociating while driving feel like to you'll? Trying to make sense of my experiences.,1,jvq2z7,4,
This time is different,3,jvkvb1,0,"First let me say my therapist is aware of my situation and called me today. I see her Wednesday as well. My psychiatrist also has a call placed in to her about my state of mind but hasn‚Äôt gotten back yet. 

I‚Äôve dissociated off and on since I can remember. Of course I didn‚Äôt understand or know that‚Äôs what this feeling was. 
From ages 2 (my first memory of it or anything really) to age 17 I was sexually abused and assaulted by my grandfather. I lived with him for several years of this period and stayed nights and sometimes weeks with him. I have been diagnosed in hospital (mental) with severe depression disorder, severe ptsd and anxiety disorder, later on with bipolar 2. 

I‚Äôve never cared for the dissociative state (it‚Äôs never lasted more than 30 minutes average.) 
It always seemed disconnected and not ‚Äúme.‚Äù

However I‚Äôve felt on a downward spiral for a couple of months (headed toward depressive episode, but I was fighting it) and my adoptive mom died on November 12th. I thought I was ok, handling it well. 
Until Sunday. In the middle of church I felt an almost literal jerk feeling and a switch had been flipped. 

A warm blanket felt like it had been wrapped around me and and I sank into it‚Äôs beautiful comfort. My emotions (happy, sad, anger, grief, all of them)...gone but what was left felt so good. Silence. Relief. I smiled just thankful it was peaceful. 

My only complaints are a few memory issues. (I have trouble with stuff I really should KNOW) and feeling a bit more tired. 

I really want to keep this feeling around for a long while. It‚Äôs very familiar now that I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôd like to stay. [blank stare](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHrN_RkFYtS/?igshid=3h80cicm6uky)

Included is a pic of me between ages 4-7. I had the same facial expression that I feel now after the switch.  It‚Äôs odd. Maybe I was switched off there too. It‚Äôs more the far off look in the eye that gives it away. I stayed kinda in a distant state at a young age."
Can we talk dissociation and sex?,28,jv6679,7, Sometimes I have a normal drive but mostly I don't want to be touched. My skin gets so overstimulated so easy it almost hurts when my hubby rubs my legs or back or whatever...   But other times its like Im manic and lets just say its the opposite lol. Im very new to this journey and Im not sure if the two are related. Anyone else experiencing something similar?
Society Confuses Me,3,jvix6t,0,"Hi guys! I'm newly (within the past 3 years) diagnosed bipolar 1, and I think I have been disassociating for a long time. I have always thought my memory is broken, or that I may have ADHD, but I am now thinking I disassociate almost constantly. When situations become too stressful or emotional, my body and mind goes numb or blank. I can be really into an argument, but it seems like once I hit a certain point, I just go blank and numb and can't find any words. In periods when this goes on for months at a time, I become basically catatonic and find myself questioning society and losing hope in humanity. When I am really depressed, my mind also goes ""blank"". When I am manic, I am an ordinary person again; I love being social and I am productive at work, etc. I do see a therapist and psych, and I am going to talk to them about this, I just wanted some input for anyone who already struggles with this. Does this sound like disassociation? Has anyone had any similar experiences or feelings? Thank you so much in advance :)"
Despersonalization and weed,1,jvn642,1,"Hi, i need help please. I had to quit drugs because of the despersonalization, but i miss them so much. At the beggining i had this dissociative episodes by smoking weed and doing extasis. They weren‚Äôt frecuent at first, but with time it got worse so i had to stop smoking. Then I started having desrealizations without being high. My question is, Im not going to be able to smoke weed or use drugs no more? The desrealization may be consecuense of the sudden sobriety? Im 273 sober now, do u think its safe to use again without going craizy?"
Can isolation cause dissociation?,5,jvf7tv,2,I‚Äôve been isolated for around 8 months and for a while now I‚Äôve been feeling very strange and couldn‚Äôt describe it well at all but after looking into it I‚Äôm almost sure it‚Äôs dissociation. I think I‚Äôve been like this for a while but I‚Äôm realizing it a lot more now because I went back to school last week. Can isolation cause dissociation?
"But the psychotherapist said ""you don't need therapy."" - Lessons learned from a functioning dissociated person.",4,jveqqs,5,"During the last year, I learned a lot about myself.   
I learned that this feeling of numbness and my inability to feel my own emotions is called ""dissociation"". I also learned that Psychedelics might be the best way for me to relearn what it means to be fully human, fully alive.   
 

A year ago, when I went through an especially dissociated phase, I pushed myself to see a therapist. After three appointments, she basically said that I don't need therapy. I told her about my dissociation but she said that she only knows that symptom from ""big T Trauma"" patients. And because I seem to have had a good childhood and no traumatic events in my life, she did not know what to do with me.   


What I since learned: 

* Being a ""functioning"" person does not mean that I am making my dissociation up out of nowhere.
* Small traumas exist. Not only complex PTSD, but also smaller events can cause dissociation. 
* **Dissociation caused by ""small t traumas"" are not well-known among psychotherapists**. If the person is able to keep up with her daily life, many mental health professionals assume that there is no problem to treat. (My response often was something like ""But I do not *feel* anything, isn't that a problem?"" and they pointed into the vague direction of ""maybe you have a too tight schedule, maybe its just a phase. Did you try meditating?..."")
* **Meditation made things worse for me.** A very helpful resource to know where this was coming from is this: [Mediation-induced dissociation](https://www.cheetahhouse.org/hyperarousal-and-dissociation). (They also have a monthly support group, although I didn't try that)
* I was afraid of getting talked into having a ""big T trauma"" when I digged deeper into my dissociation. Now I am fine with acknowledging that **I probably have some ""small t traumas""** that might be coming from comparatively innocent childhood neglect experiences. I do not have to make it bigger than it is, however, I also do not have to ignore them. 
* **Psychedelics, if used carefully, are probably one of the most effective ways of getting out of dissociation** (for me). See also this podcast by a professional psychotherapist, who tells the story about his own way of coping with dissociation caused by ""small t trauma"": [Spotify - Back from the Abyss](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7CnRbabZPNs1dzxcBIcbpS?si=8f1fZ0hhRmqDeO-UCpDbUg). For me, psychedelics were incredibly helpful. I was able to get in touch with emotions I did not have for *years*.  


Hope this was helpful for some if you. 

**DISCLAIMER**: If you are planning to experiment with psychedelics, please be very very careful - they are insanely powerful substances. I only tried them for the first time after I read a book and lots of articles about psychedelic experiences and I hope you will do so as well. See it as yourself being the doctor **performing surgery on your own conciousness** \- you would want the doctor to study medicine really well.

I need help,1,jvjr6c,0,I‚Äôve thought of so many things that could be causing what I‚Äôm feeling but I can‚Äôt figure it out. I thought maybe I just had to much caffeine and my body was having a bad reaction. But I noticed while I was sitting on the toilet after brunch with my ex step mom that my legs were feeling weird and then when I stood up it felt like I was having delays. I got so scared I was drugged because when I was younger I used to smoke and it felt like I was having delays and super sensitive yet numb skin like only physically I don‚Äôt hear auditory delays or delays when watching a video but only body delays like when I adjust my head on my pillow ect it felt so much longer to do so and sensitive yet felt numb idk how to explain it is it possible to only have bodily functioning delays due to dissociating. I have been diagnosed with GAD but stop taking lexapro because I hated the side affect hellppp
People think Im gaslighting them...,5,jv7vow,4,  People say that I am gaslighting them because I will say a sentence and they will argue until they are blue that its not what I said.  THIS DRIVES ME MAD. Or they will tell me Im not listening because I cant repeat word for word what was said or just plain forget whole conversations as they are happening and ask the same thing again.  Im very very new to this as my therapist just introduced me to this last week. I just want to know im not as crazy as I feel. It so lonely.. I can feel my whole inner being just shift anytime I want to have a serious conversation because I know its going to turn into a fight.  I try grounding myself but I thought it was just anxiety and I can't recognize Im not myself till its to late. Every single fight especially lately ends with me having a panic attack. That's another thing I was accused of faking.  I just want to understand myself so I can help others understand Im not trying to do these things on purpose....

turning dissociation into music,1,jvavez,3,"I've struggled with dissociative issues since I was 13 for 3 years now, and honestly it's still a huge problem but if there's 1 thing that's helped it's writing and producing music. Doing something creative is such a good way to feel connected to something and grounded, I would strongly recommend finding some kind of creative outlet like this, because it's helped me so much. Yesterday I released my 1st EP called 'spaceout!' (get it lol) and if you're interested here's a link to it x"
Is this dissociation??,9,jv1cph,1,"Long story short. 

Left a 10 year physical/emotional abusive relationship. Didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave time‚Äù for therapy as I was raising a baby by myself, worked 2 jobs, and went to school, so I basically pretended to the best of my ability to focus on the present moment. Fast forward over 2 years of learning the depths of mental health, consciousness, self love, spirituality, etc, experienced great highs but also kept relapsing with anxious lows. I haven‚Äôt given up as my mental health is extremely important to me, but it seems to be a vicious cycle of fear, anxiety, and ptsd. Tonight I realized the extent of my distraction/avoidance coping mechanisms, so I tried pinpointing when it started and found it was 3 years ago from the day my ex tried to kill me. I went to work and school continuing my day like it didn‚Äôt happen. I thought I was making progress by accepting the past and focus on the good things in life, but after analyzing this I feel it makes sense why I haven‚Äôt been able to connect or even give a chance to connect with my closest friends/family, or the fact I have no interest in doing so because any alone time I get, I spend learning about things that benefit my mental/physical health. I tend to wonder all the whys and how‚Äôs in all aspects of life, and the more I learn, the more each system doesn‚Äôt make sense to me! I feel as if we‚Äôre living in a simulation, and I‚Äôm just the odd ball out observing. 

Also, in early childhood I had major commitment issues which stemmed from fear of abandonment. I learned to suppress my feelings until I a few years ago so it‚Äôs been a riiiiiiiide lol. 

I am currently receiving psychotherapy, which we mainly focus on meditation, breathing, and skills on thoughts which have helped immensely. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to stop having flashbacks of those thoughts and feelings of fear. When I experience anxiety, 90% of the time I can use skills I‚Äôve learned and it helps, but certain triggers really have me going 0-100, quick! I can manage panic attacks, but they always seem to attack me in my dreams lol. My apologies on the unorganized mess of my thoughts! I am desperate to overcome this unhealthy pattern. 

Thank you in advance"
Everything loses color and gets significantly darker when I feel like I‚Äôm being verbally attacked or critically examined,55,jum5e2,8,"Ever since I was younger I‚Äôd have a specific response to being reprimanded or criticized. An offhand remark doesn‚Äôt bother me but those moments where the person is locking eyes with me and either telling me my faults and wrong doings or talking about me and my character at length, I will start to lose my surroundings a bit. Kind of like tunnel vision but everything, including the person I‚Äôm looking at, will lose color and everything seems significantly darker. I can kind of control it too, I can‚Äôt turn it off but I can make the feeling intensify or lighten slightly when I focus on it. 

Does anyone know what type of dissociation this is or experience this?

I find it an interesting response and to add more detail, I have a difficult time managing appropriate eye contact in a normal context. When I‚Äôm at my best I don‚Äôt struggle too much that I feel it‚Äôs noticeable but I find eye contact to be intimidating as a rule. And when on the spot with no way to appropriately end the eye contact, I feel trapped."
I don't know. Am I dissociating?,12,juqzgo,4,Sometimes I can't feel my arms. I forget about some parts of the day. I sometimes am like... There? But its not me. Or at least I don't remember. I say things I would never say. Reality feels different sometimes. Harder or softer. Sometimes the lights are so bright. I don't know if any of this makes sense. I just need some clarity...
Not 100% sure if I am experiencing dissociation but these feelings are pretty much 24/7.,1,juzda4,4,"I feel stuck and helpless. I used to be funny and witty and make everyone laugh, but since I began to feel depressed, abuse drugs, etc. I began losing my sense of self. I feel I have no personality and am the shell of my former self. I just go through the motions in the blandest of ways. I have lost my sense of humor and ability to make others laugh and enjoy being around me. I have had strong hypochondria delusions(thinking I have schizophrenia, cancer, etc) I feel perpetually lost and often question whether or not I should end my life."
Everything triggers me,3,jutdsb,14,"Idk how people can be so tolerant towards the quirks of this world when everything always ends up making me dissociate and hit another psychosis, every single day. I can literally feel how writing this is unlatching my mind from reality and have it take off into a safer delusional world. I just hate existence, being inside of a body disgusts me so freaking much. I just hate how I can feel my bones and flesh around it and the thought alone makes me squirm. And other people disgust me so much and how apparent their primal urges are to me. How they spot someone they like and feel the urge to procreate. Like it just doesnt sit right with me and I dont want to live right among it where it happens. I would rather sit with corpses because they dont have those urges. I hate when people look at me because they absord my terestial body with their primitive brain and it makes me uncomfortable. Their pesky eyes, and their ulterior motives it is all very ugly. I want to die and live as some kind of fluid that keeps having dopamine rushes without the influence of something else. That would be pure, clean, and without any annoyances. I even thought about becoming a crack addict because that comes pretty close to it. Mindless, if not bodiless at least...."
Lost sense of self?,34,jub987,5,"I don‚Äôt really know who I am at the moment. I have no ambitions, no dreams, and no motivation to do anything. My schoolwork is piling up which could be so easily avoidable if I just did it on the day it was handed out. When I think about myself I can‚Äôt define my character, everything is just a jumble in my mind. Why am I so lost?"
Dissociation vs anhedonia,11,ju8hh3,13,"Anhedonia is usually used to describe a reduce of pleasure and or motivation. [wiki ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia)

Im not so sure if I‚Äôm dissociating or just being anhedonic. I‚Äôm not exactly sad there‚Äôs just a void of feelings. When I‚Äôm ‚Äúhappy‚Äù it‚Äôs more like I feel nice, instead of happy if that makes sense."
Is this dissociation?,2,judvby,4,"I had a major anxiety period last year where I couldn't sleep or eat for almost 2 weeks, and I had zero energy left and couldn't feel anything but fear and exhaustion. After this, it seems like I can't feel like I did before. Or sometimes, it suddenly returns to how it felt before, for some days, before going back to feeling out of place. It's like I don't feel the rays of the sun, the mysterious feeling of autumn rain, the great feeling of waking up to sunlight, etc. 
I feel like there is this pressure in the front of my head, and I often get a dizzy feeling, especially during stress. It's like being drunk without being drunk, I guess?
And it often feels like I have a gloomy or uncanny feeling that something is wrong. It feels like I'm walking in a fog. My head feels foggy. This has continued for almost 2 years now, and it scares me.
What is it?
Is it dissociation, derealization or depersonalisation? How can I stop it?
It feels like I'm back to feeling everything on rare occassions, like if I am completely calm in my head. But how can I get back to feeling permanently?"
Pressure/heat in inner ears a physical sign of dissociation?,2,juar47,5,"I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever experienced a warm or hot sensation in their inner ear, correlated with dissociation?

I've never been able to figure out why I get that- and any doctor or therapist I've asked has never had any clue what it is- but I thought it might be similar to the feeling of pressure that some people get in their head before or during dissociation. I've had way more stresd than usual (Covid19 + coming out of denial about my parents' abuse), and I've noticed I'm experiencing that hot inner ear feeling WAY more.

I'm gathering from forums that there are actually MANY more physical sensations of dissociation than the basic ones I usually read about in books (i.e. eyes fluttering, blank expression etc.)

Does this sound like it could be a dissociation symptom?

*(I know no one can say yes or no definitively, I'm just curious if it rings any bells for anyone.)*

Any chance anyone else has ever experienced it?"
Does it sound like dissociation? (conscious naps + episodes of fatigue),2,ju951c,8,"So I tried to describe my experiences in comments in another subreddit. I was suggested it could possible be dissociation. Currently my psychiatrist believes that it could be chronic fatigue syndrome possible caused by undiagnosed adult ADHD.

Could you please tell me if it sounds similar and if you can relate? I do not think I have dissociaction, but it seems to be such an unusual disorder that is difficult to describe. Following is a compilation of what I feel *(sorry that there is so much text)*:

**Weird naps**

These naps always last 20-40 minutes.

When I nap in  sitting position at my desk, I stay conscious of what I am doing,  roughly where I am and what is going on around me. At the same time, I  forget some details about the world, see dreams, lose sense of time  (although I know if I just started napping or getting closer to the end) and feel myself getting refreshed. I usually feel great after such a nap for at least 30 minutes.

The more I try to remember things about the world, the more I start waking up, and the more I let my mind wander and show me images, the deeper I get into this sweet state. When someone speaks to me, I can roughly understand what they are talking about and decide if I want to wake up in order to answer, or I can just acknowledge that I heard them with a grumpy sound instead. I like to think that I somehow invented meditation without properly  learning how to do it.

I feel surprised with my surroundings when  waking up from these naps, as if I was teleported from a different  world, even thought I knew where I was the whole time I was napping. World seems much more detailed than I remembered it while napping.

The dreams are random objects that are constantly shifting and moving. They can start as shifting shades and become more real the deeper I start napping. For example I might see sunset, then in a couple of seconds a tree in the sunset, then an apply might fall from it, and it could transform into a baseball ball flying horizontally only to be hit by a bat which might turn into a sword.

**Fatigue**

The episodes a few times a week and  usually last 3-6 hours, but sometimes up to 24 hours. They usually start when I am bored, for example, when I am commuting or waiting in line,  or when I just have a boring task at work.

Mentally  I continuously lose focus, willpower, emotions and sense of boredom.  The world seems less dynamic/sharp/tangible *(probably because of lack of  focus)* and time moves faster *(probably because I do not feel boredom*). I  enter the state of tranquility, peace and indifference. It is kind of  pleasant as long as I do not have any responsibilities to fulfill.  Working in this state is extremely difficult and unpleasant. I just want  to relax and not move a muscle, to stay alone with my thoughts, trapped  inside a turned off body. I find it easier to just give in than to try  and fight it which does not work anyway. I am usually a very energetic  and positive person when I feel fine.

Physically  it starts with inability to dance, run or smile genuinely. Trying to do  a light jog for a few seconds feels like I am doing intense sit-ups as I  lose breath and will to continue very fast. When my episode deepens, my  walking turns into stumbling, it becomes very difficult to walk uphill,  my arms get heavy and work with a delay, my facial expression gets  numb, I start speaking slowly, catching breath mid-sentence.  I need to  plan every movement in advance and then execute them consciously. One  time it got so bad that I had trouble following mouse pointer with my  eyes.

For some reason, one of the first things that I can notice when an episode starts is relaxed feeling in  the frontal part of my brain. As if there is some object there that  should firmly stand upright, but instead was toppled backwards and it cannot get up. As if center of mass of my head shifts towards back side.  I assume it is just my eyes muscles getting to relaxed.

""Testing""  myself if whether I feel normal or not often makes me feel worse.  Thinking about this state makes it worse. After putting these memories in words, I had the biggest episode today in a long time of taking bupropion.

The experience also feels like I am half asleep. I am even drawn to darkness and somewhat uncomfortable staring at bright light.

Music that I like becomes annoying and feels like noise.

These episodes end very suddenly in a matter of minutes or even seconds. It feels like I just  wake up from a dream. I instantly notice a feeling of solid ground  underneath my feet. My body becomes responsive, the world becomes  tangible and real. I often feel a surge of energy.

If there is anything that can snap me out of this state reliably at least temporarily, it is an interesting conversation, as long as the other  person is willing to spend a few minutes trying to engage me in  conversation.

Edit: 

So I tried some common grounding techniques like touching things but it did not help at all, probably even made it worse. I often try to convince myself that ""I have the power to move my leg with force exactly the way I want it to move, and feel it hit the ground"" but it is usually very ineffective, but seemed like it helped a couple of times. Today I started trying to look at my body and think ""These arms and legs are not just meaty tools that my brain/me uses to sustain itself. They are part of my identity, part of who I am. If I were to lose an arm, I would lose part of what makes me myself"". At the same time I imagined that my ""life spirit"" fills up my body like a liquid. As a result, that weird feeling in the front of my head evenly ""spreads"" across my body and then my arms and legs feel responsive and light again. Hopefully this is not a placebo. Whenever my fatigue gets worse, I start feeling like I consist of just my brain that is pulling all the strings to move my body."
Forgetting things?,36,jtr1b7,9,"Does anyone experience this, I feel as if at times I will forget what I used to like doing, For example someone might ask me my favourite movie, I could normally name 10 but at times I feel like I barley can name one. 

I feel as if at times, I truely forget myself?"
Has COVID19 made your dissociation worse?,22,jts2ta,0,"Because same. I don't know why because I'm not a germaphobe or anything. But being in public, I'm VERY aware of people breathing on me (maybe triggering my trauma?)"
Describing people is awfully difficult,6,jtxhgl,1,I have an awful time of describing what kind of people e.g. my close friends or family are (their personality etc). Is this a dissociation thing or something else? Maybe it‚Äôs just my character?
my experience with dissociation,2,jtuvhl,1,"cw: weight talk

i just wanted to share my experience with it, maybe there's someone else out there that relates?

dissociation to me is having your emotions and thoughts be muddled, i can still feel emotion and hear my thoughts but after they showed up; it's quickly forgotten. i don't have lingering thoughts or feel a feeling for too long, it's just empty. 

i dissociate to the point where my body is numb, numb to the point where i don't feel hungry. so i eat once a day, i don't even feel hungry for the first meal, i just eat so my body won't collapse. for some reason my body didn't lose weight, i don't know the science behind it but i maintained my weight during this whole ordeal."
I had my first significant dissociative episode today. Trigger Warning: Detailed Description,24,jt9kaw,10,"Today, I was triggered by something. I do not know what it was, but suddenly it felt like my mind was lagging behind, I could not think inside my head, my vision was tunneling, things looked 'off', I was going through everything like a dream, my eyes were wide open, I was hardly blinking, I was unable to introspect or contemplate, I was blanking on the events between getting from point A to B, my movements seemed jerky, I felt disconnected from my body, etc. It was weird, and lasted two hours at least.

I have had something similar before, but never so prolonged, and usually accompanied by vertigo and tremors.

I just thought to put this out there. I am sure someone else can relate."
"Hi guys, this is getting very tiring and i feel like i'm all alone with this",26,jsxxiz,4,"I have had dissociation for almost 7 years now and it's getting more difficult. I often drift into a whole another world, in another reality. i can be there for hours without realising the time and during that time i just lay on my bed feeling absolutely nothing.

it randomly starts with me not being able to speak, then not feeling anything. then i just disappear from this world. sometimes i end up there on my own will and sometimes it just happens. once during a class i suddenly felt like i was flying above the classroom and just couldn't really do anything.

i have forgotten years of my life. i don't remember anything from my age years of 9-13. sometimes i get flashbacks from somewhere in my life that are triggered by smells, places that i don't really remember visiting before that etc. and the problem is that i can't even tell if the memories are real.

i found this group in hope of others with the same kind of problems as me...so...how are you doing?"
Help me!,3,jt7pjy,2," 

Hey guys theres one symptom that really is beating me up and i really need some help!

Because my mind feels so blank, To remember things i have to picture it, For example to remember to make my bed, I have to picture my bedroom, To feed my fish i picture my fish tank, Is this normal?

Has my mind adapted to picturing things due to feeling so empty?

But because im so dissociated all the time, It feels like it's not me picturing these things?"
Mine feels like two movies at once,3,jt3py2,3,You know when you pause a tv on for a long time and the image gets burned into it? And then you play another movie but you still see bits of the burnt image? Reality is the burnt image and the movie is what‚Äôs happening in my brain. But it‚Äôs less like a movie and more like flipping channels quickly. Ya know what I mean?
Anyone else having an extra hard time right now?,3,jsyl5n,1,"I work at a place that makes us wear masks all day everyday and seeing everyone‚Äôs faces covered, seeing my own face covered in the mirror all the time, it‚Äôs not helping. I feel like it‚Äôs making everything worse. Humanity doesn‚Äôt even look like humanity anymore. 

On top of that I am also very clumsy and I often find bruises, scrapes, and scars that I have 0 recollection of how they happened or where they came from."
Is this a symptom of dissociation?,21,jsq2iq,3,"I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm experiencing is a symptom of dissociation or a slow on-set of what could one day become dissociation, or something totally different - let me know any thoughts.

Fairly often (maybe once a week or so) I get this sudden and random feeling that I refer to as the ‚Äúdaycare feeling.‚Äù The best way I can describe it is it feels like when your parent dropped you off at daycare as a young child and everything felt foreign and a little uncomfortable and you wanted to go home (mind you, this feeling has come over me before while I‚Äôm at my parents house with them there too). Basically it‚Äôs like everything around me and where I am at the moment doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúright.‚Äù
It‚Äôs happened at home, at school, at work, at the mall, you name it - it doesn‚Äôt discriminate. The feeling always comes randomly and goes away as quickly as it came...typically within a few minutes. I‚Äôve never thought too much about it, just assumed it was generalized-anxiety based (which I take medication for) - but recently learned about dissociation and wondering now if I‚Äôm experiencing a slight variation of that.

Thanks for any input."
I'm going mad,5,jsrxmq,0,How to you cope?
DID presentation? (Regressive states),11,jsk9ol,3,"I lurk in this sub because of my own dissociation related to mental health problems, but it's usually the dissociative states and derealization type. 

I just had an epiphany though. 

My mom was diagnosed with BPD many years ago. But when I was younger and her condition deteriorated, she would have episodes where she acted and sounded like a scared little girl, about 4 years old, she'd rock in the corner and ask about the 'bad man' and I'd bring her a teddy and she'd be like that a while. When she finally went to sleep she would wake up more like herself and deny any memory of what happened. 

I was 10, so I wasn't sure if she was acting or not, but I erred in the side of supportive because I wasn't sure what else to do. 

She suffered horrendous abuse for most of the childhood until she finally left home. 

I've always felt confused by how I feel like my mom is ""two different people"", sometimes she hated my guts and we wouldn't get on. Other times she'd want to hold my hand, do things together, be sweet. I put this down to the BPD. 

But the regression to childhood never made sense in terms of how it worked. 

Could this be DID (which I know is very rare so I'm sceptical)  or perhaps it's something else? I don't know what it's actually like as I feel there's some disinformation out there. 

Just curiositt really when I randomly remembered those times."

A ‚ÄúPoem‚Äù From a Vision of hell,4,jryh7i,2,"
Days flash by like slugs in salt
All is quick, and slow and aught
They called me nothing, but that‚Äôs all I feel
A cracking husk hiding blackened zeal

I am it all, and none and other
Life and vision invaded, smothered
I writhe from sights and fathomed horror
My mothers fury is in my gutter

I can‚Äôt control this hypno-hell
Save me, Lord let all be well
Or rather not, leave me at bay
Take me home for this I pray

Let my body match my heart
Let the coma never stop
Let my soul regain its rest
To leave my body as it has

(I just wanna say I know nothing about poetry and I wrote this while being dissociated. Also I‚Äôm only 16 so please no hate lol. Also this is just from my perspective. My therapist believes I have some sort of post traumatic disorder and the majority of my symptoms are bad dissociative episodes, fragmented emotion, and intrusive images. Also I want to say I‚Äôm NOT suicidal, as in I don‚Äôt have a plan or a desire to kill myself)"
does anyone else deal w this?,3,jrybaa,6,does anyone else thoughts just run on an endless stream in the back of their head? for example i was just sitting and watching tv and drawing and all of a sudden i was like ‚Äúhmm what is my brain even thinking about?‚Äù its almost like im thinking unconsciously? maybe that‚Äôs normal ive just been super hyperaware lately
It‚Äôs 6AM & I‚Äôm dissociating hard right now,31,jrj2yb,10,"Haven‚Äôt slept. Been up for awhile.

Anybody else gone through this? 

Can somebody talk to me?"
am i dissociating or dying,4,jrnqdb,5,"for brief context, i have had anxiety my whole life and have dissociated for varying amounts of time since jr. high/high school but never too intensely

this last year i went through several traumatic events in a short time span (dog died, car accident, bad situation made me leave home, lost home i lived in my whole life, ex/close friend commits suicide, longterm relationship ends abruptly right after) and i felt.. strange ever since. like i was numb and careless and life had no meaning. then covid hit and this resulted in me having a terrible panic attack worse than ever before and i ended up in the ER. four times in a month. which resulted in a 3 month span kn which i would not even leave my bedroom out of fear. its been a lot lmao.

THANKFULLY i am able to leave my house now and other than my general anxiety things are mostly peachy. but the other day my boyfriend and i had a tiny discussion that reminded me of a traumatic relationship i was in 4 years ago and a BIG issue that caused a lot of stress.

almsot immediately following i started questioning jf my name was even my name, because it didnt ""feel"" like my name. my face didnt feel like it was my face, even though i knew it was. i feel like i dont connect to my identity or my life evn though i have all my memories and i know technically that thats my life and my name and my face, but none of it feels emotionally like mine. and i couldnt emotionally connect with my boyfriend or my cats or any new things in my environment from this last year. its been three days and i still feel disconnected from him as a concept and its genuinely the strangest thing ever.

am i dissociating? ive disconnected from surroundings before, and thought people were robots, but never quite like this. it triggers my anxiety and has be convinced i have brain cancer."
I need help please,5,jrjnlt,1,"Hey this is my first post here 

I need some advice or someone to tell me that it‚Äôs going to be okay

I‚Äôve always been a stress head all my life until three years ago I had a panic attack while working at McDonald‚Äôs and since then I‚Äôve never felt the same 

I feel like I don‚Äôt control my body or mind, my short term memory is absolutely terrible, I don‚Äôt have a appetite but I still can force myself to eat, I just feel like I‚Äôm almost dead, Like I‚Äôm in this body somewhere but I‚Äôm not sure where. I feel as if I have no control of anything, Even when I think it feels as if it‚Äôs not me thinking.

I‚Äôve tried anti deppresants but they made it so much worse with my mind. I don‚Äôt know if this is Normal because I don‚Äôt know what normal is but when I think for example, like going to my brothers house, I don‚Äôt have the thought I just picture his place and go there, I feel as if I have no thoughts at all, I just picture things to remember things, for example to water my veggie garden, I will picture it and that reminds me to water it. But I don‚Äôt like the feeling of having to picture things, I wish I felt like I used to.

It feels as if my brain has damage to it or it‚Äôs scrambled, I don‚Äôt think I have schizophrenia or psychosis as I don‚Äôt hear voices, or have beliefs or anything like that, I just feel completely empty but terrified.

I also have no cares about anything, I used to take pride in my job but now I couldn‚Äôt care less if I got fired. 

But I don‚Äôt allow for this to beat me up, I‚Äôm starting to eat extremely healthy, I drink heaps of water, I set goals everyday, I take vitamins and now I‚Äôve started the gym and going to workout to my body drops and this may help me hopefully.

Can anyone give me any advice thanks!"
Not being able to hear sounds properly?,10,jrfimb,5,"hi, i‚Äôm in a pretty bad bout for the past while. i‚Äôm trying to figure things out but recently i‚Äôve had a newer symptom where i can‚Äôt hear things? like i‚Äôll physically turn up the volume on my phone to the highest volume but it feels like it‚Äôs super far away from me and i‚Äôm drifting away from it, kindve like through a telephone call. (my ears are physically fine lol so it‚Äôs not a external issue...)

does anyone else have this symptom? wondering if someone can explain it better than me, i‚Äôm not very good at putting things into words. 

i‚Äôve had issues with hearing when people talk but not as much with things such as music which usually grounds me."
Phrase I‚Äôve been telling myself to get through the past few days,3,jrkd0j,1,"(Copy and pasted from a comment I did and thought it could help more people, little long but helpful. OP from other post had problems sleeping and getting to that point where you‚Äôre being too aware, I‚Äôm sure we can all relate)

‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôve been going through this lately and it‚Äôs been driving me crazy. It happened the hardest when I was socializing and just getting depressed randomly when I‚Äôm suppose to be having fun.

I just get in my head so much that I forget life is still moving on around me. This isn‚Äôt harsh advice, but it‚Äôs been the only thing I have been able to trick my brain with.

My phrase for the past 2 days has been ‚Äúso, now what?‚Äù It‚Äôs like so what if I dissociate, so what if don‚Äôt remember things, just so what! I have to keep living my life and keep being depressed and having fun at the same time. I‚Äôll figure my brain out one day but I‚Äôve been letting being in my head stop me to much on things I want to do or something I‚Äôm currently doing.

So try that phrase for your situation. You‚Äôre up and thinking and....so, now what? What are going to do with those thoughts, write down any productive ones, discard the negative ones, the ones that have you questioning life just ask them so now what are we going to do with all this awareness that I‚Äôve figured out. If the answer after 10 mins end up being nothing, then you just have to stop dwelling on it and tell your brain all this thinking is leading to nothing. Fighting dissociating is a mental battle for sure, I hope I still feel this way later this week lol, but I hope this helps someone today."
Was this dissociation?,7,jrgbm7,1,"In the middle of my session, T asked me ""where did you go just now?"" I never thought I dissociated before but now I'm wondering after that incident. I don't know ""where"" I went, but just felt like I got distracted by my own thoughts. I also can't exactly remember what we were discussing right before she asked that. 

Was this some form of dissociation? I will of course bring this up with her but just curious if I'm just over thinking this entire thing."
How much is too much?,24,jr7699,3,"I am finding myself very frequently dissociating (daydreaming, derealization, zoning out, going onto auto pilot ect.) and I was wondering how much is too much? Like, where is the line drawn between healthy dissociating and a dissociative disorder?"
"Who here has lost hope, and motivation? If so why?",8,jr5vfx,1,
Hard to listen to other people share their experiences,9,jr4vhu,1,"Does anyone else find it difficult to hear others share their experiences or express a thought? I‚Äôm unsure if this is a dissociation thing, but I can feel myself taking on the thought of others or almost feeling like I‚Äôm experiencing their experience vividly by just listening to them share a story or idea. I‚Äôve found myself more in a dissociative state for the past 11 months and it‚Äôs been harder and harder to sift out what I actually think about situations or what I actually want to do. Sometimes I feel like I take on the lives or thoughts of others and this didn‚Äôt really happen before I experienced other dissociative symptoms. Just wanted to see if anyone else felt similarly with how their dissociation manifested itself."
üôÉ the dissociation has returned & I want OUT üôÇ,334,jqjavz,6,
is dissociation on a spectrum?,3,jr4grj,2,i believe i have been suffering from various degrees of dissociation for most of my life. there have been short periods of time where i completely experienced derealization and depersonalization after traumatic events but most of the time its my brain denying reality or questioning if i even exist. does dissociation exist on a spectrum?
Is this dissociation or something else?,2,jqn7b8,2,"Hey guys. I‚Äôm looking to get a little insight onto stuff thats has been going on lately and am trying to, basically, find out what the heck has been going on.
For starters, I am working with a therapist but it can be very difficult to see her on a regular basis. I also have an intake appointment scheduled with a psychiatrist in a month. 
Here‚Äôs a little background (TW abuse/death/drugs):
I‚Äôm no stranger to mental illness/abuse/traumatic events, and have been clinically diagnosed with depression and GAD. Ive been abused in my youth by my brother, father, and mother (who almost died from a drug OD when i was 14). I have also recently (july 2019) witnessed vehicular manslaughter. Most of these things I have received therapy for in the past.
Recently, though, due to COVID/losing my job/risk of eviction, I had a really nasty depressive episode that lasted well over a month. I was able to eventually get a great job though and am working on financially recovering!
While i think i am recovering in some areas, i have moments where I feel like im slipping in others. If i have a REALLY busy day compared to what im used to, it can leave me questioning the events of the day, debating wether or not they actually happened. A lot of times, too, when I drive, i end up having episodes of anxiety (+fuzzy vision/dizziness) that make it very difficult to focus on the road and leaves me feeling shook up for an hour or so. Today, however, was a tipping point. I got in my car to go to work, and while i knew i was driving, i had a really hard time processing what i was doing. It felt like i was going slower, then faster, then slower. I was fully convinced for just a moment there was no way i was awake and was dreaming. I pulled over to call some friends just to make sure, went home, and called off work. It took me a while to, i guess, feel grounded again. I feel much better now, just mentally drained from the event.
So thats where Im asking you guys, is this dissociation? Or could it be something less or more severe? (Also, if anyone has any ideas/advice to fight driving anxiety that would be great!)
Thank you so much for reading what I have to say! I hope I do not offend anyone here."
I just woke up from a dissociative episode and have been running multiple Reddit accounts with all different variations of my life and now I don‚Äôt remember which one is real??,29,jq7tq9,10,"
I‚Äôve deleted the accounts I‚Äôve finished reading and like holy fuck some of them are 100+ days old. For the record I have been diagnosed with DID, CPTSD, Borderline with Narcissistic tendencies, ASPD, mild agoraphobia and Generalized Anxiety. I‚Äôve been fucked up and ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù since I was little. But I‚Äôve also been a genius when it came to humanity for equally as long. I understand the brain in such a complex but it is a double edged because I cannot live with humanity and so I‚Äôm always inside my own head or trying to dig my way into others. I came from monsters and I learned to weaponize it. 

My specialist disappeared when COVID first happened and she was the only one who knew ‚Äúus‚Äù. She‚Äôs said there‚Äôs four. I know of their basics but I never know when they are around. Weird. Like a car I have no control of. I can feel my cracks and I know what I have to do. 

My ears are ringing I can‚Äôt see or feel anything. All I know is that I‚Äôm pregnant. That is confirmed via messages with my worker who is real. 

My head is spinning and my mind is a mess 

I can‚Äôt believe this but bless Reddit for allowing the alters to have their own pages to express. We used to keep journals when we were still seeing the specialist. 

Have you ever felt your brain working? It‚Äôs like I can feel every bit of it. 

Maybe it‚Äôs the 50% more blood pumping through my body because of the baby. 

Will I keep it? 
That seems up in the air with the others.

How to date with dissociation?,26,jq2frd,14," How do I stay present and relaxed while talking and being on dates and everything. Everytime I get a good feeling it doesnt feel real, I am so confused and dissapointed with the way life feels(like a dream). Its supposed to be enjoyable, tangible. But to me its not even real."
Tell me,0,jqdkgf,3,Why does it sound so easy to breathe
is this real?,7,jq1a0c,5,"The dissociation has been so bad lately, I just feel numb all the time. I feel like the lines between reality and fantasy are becoming more and more blurred and because of this I've become extremely suicidal. 

It's to the point now where I'm catching myself seriously considering ending my life multiple times within a single hour and I'm not even really sad about it. I think it's because I kind of just feel like I'm constantly dreaming so what does it matter if I'm alive or not. I know this isn't healthy but I don't know what to do about it, I don't trust myself with my own safety anymore. 

At this point I'm just biding time until the moment where the dissociation becomes so strong that I'm not able to hold onto any sense of reality anymore."
im terrified of my own head,13,jpvvxc,8,"this is exactlt how i feel now. ive had dissociation for a while but this is the worst its ever been and i‚Äôll think to myself ‚Äúwell at least im noy paranoid or delusional because that would be bad‚Äù and then instantly i‚Äôll start overthinking all of yhe thoughts ive had, everything feels so far away. im convinced i have a brain tumor and it scares the living shit out of me. ive always had really bad health anxiety but this is the worst its ever been and out of no where. im so scared of it, the past few days have felt like a dream or a nightmare im so anxious and paranoid. i feel like  a little kid, im scared to be alone im scared of my health and im scared im going to die. im only 16 im so scared i feel so helpless and vulnerable and im so scared somethings wrong"
is it accurate to call my situation dissociation?,3,jq0gsc,7,"hey everyone! i‚Äôm in need of some feedback here. i‚Äôll try to explain as best i can.

i have been sheltered my whole life. i did not go to public school, i had very few and short social activities, and my life was built on games/movies/internet. 

for as long as i can remember i have felt ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù.  i do not feel connected to this world or its people or my body. i simply drift through life, floating through day by day. my memory is terrible. i used to treat people like video game NPCs because it didn‚Äôt occur to me that my actions had worldly consequences or that other people actually existed with hearts and minds. 

i am often apathetic because i do not feel ‚Äòpresent‚Äô. in fact, i don‚Äôt know the last time i was fully present, if ever. i literally just exist, i don‚Äôt LIVE. i don‚Äôt know how else to explain it other than i‚Äôm just not connected. i lack a connection that everyone else seems to have.

but i don‚Äôt want to use dissociation incorrectly so thats why i‚Äôm here. do you, dissociaters, think this counts as some constant mild dissociation? thank you so much in advance!"
Warping of time and the perception of ‚Äúlives‚Äù,10,jpqnwg,5,"Does anyone else have a screwy sense of time? Most days I get to about mid afternoon and try to think about/remember what I did that morning and it always feel like it happened yesterday or the day before. Alternatively, sometimes I‚Äôll fall down some kind of rabbit hole and whole days just disappear as if they were mere minutes. I‚Äôve started looking at the clock constantly to try and ground myself, try and keep a grip on reality, but I am often still shocked by how much or how little it moves. 


Also, if I try to think about anything that has happened over a month ago it feels like an entirely different life, like I died and was reborn in the same body, or like I‚Äôm remembering someone else‚Äôs life that they told me about, second hand memories.

Advice!!,5,jppp76,9,"So I‚Äôm 16 years old and I suffer from dpdr and I‚Äôve had it for alarmist 3 years now 24/7 and only really started permanently when I transitioned into high school and not one therapist or doctor knows what could have caused it. Like normally it‚Äôs trauma but I don‚Äôt really remember anything happening and I suffer from severe anxiety as well and school is a massive tigger for me like it causes me so much anxiety and makes my dissociation worse, idk if this is far fetched but could school have given me trauma?

Is this dissociation?,9,jpn334,2,"For the past couple of years I often feel like I'm not really here if that makes sense. It's like I'm numb, and I often glitch for a while, while doing something. Or i might be walking for instance and I dont really feel that I'm there, it's like I'm not doing it myself. It's like I dont feel real, that I'm in a dream. Sorry I know that this is a confusing post. It's just, it's quite frustrating. It's preventing me from ""being in the moment"" and connecting. I dont know."
Has anyone else ever cycled between dissociation and panic relatively rapidly? Kind of like a feedback loop?,54,jpazbk,12,"If so, how would you describe your experience? I recently had a session in therapy where we were covering some traumatic material, and I started getting agitated and experienced panic attack symptoms. And then I think the panicked feelings and feeling triggered got to be too much, which caused me to dissociate. Things started not seeming real and my therapist's face looked like it was melting, and I was getting tunnel vision which really freaked me out and sent me back into panic. It went on like this for a bit before I managed to calm down.   


Has anyone else experienced anything like this, or is this strange? Usually the dissociation is my 'primary' symptom (I spend most days dissociated to some degree) while the panic only happens when I'm startled, triggered, having a flashback etc. I've never felt such a mix of both before that recent session. Are you guys able to feel scared or freaked out while dissociated, or are you often too detached to feel any of that?"
I‚Äôm not sure if I dissociated & I‚Äôm scared something is wrong with me.,3,jpkr4d,2,"TW: RAPE AND DATING ABUSE

Hello. I‚Äôm not sure how to go about explaining this so I‚Äôll just be as transparent and honest as possible. Almost 6 years ago I was in a emotionally, verbally and physically abusive relationship for a year. A few months after that his best friend raped me. Fast forward to the beginning of 2020 I am having a hookup with a friend of mine (friends with benefits if I‚Äôm being honest) and when we had sex for the first time I literally felt nothing. Nothing. On my drive back home I was terrified. I thought (and still think) something is wrong with me. I felt nothing emotionally and physically. It felt like I was there for a couple of seconds. We had sex many times after that and it was amazing but that one time really really scared me. I know it sounds lame but it really freaked me out. Is that normal from past trauma? Can I prevent that from happening ever again? Please help. I don‚Äôt ever want to feel that again."
Near Death Experience,4,jphvkc,1,"Hey guys. I recently have started having some sort of episode. Relatively recently I had an episode where I blacked out. I felt like I was hopping through time. I felt like I was no longer in my body. I was touching my arms and hands and it seemed as though nothing was real, I couldnt hear, I could barely talk, and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt understand anything. I was shaking and my heart was racing. I kept losing my memory and couldn‚Äôt remember how I ended up in one room verses another, I couldnt remember the last thing I said. 
I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack or a stroke. 
It was by far the most terrifying experience of my life. 
I have struggled with childhood trauma, depression, and anxiety. Panic attacks have happened to me before- but nothing quite like this. 
**Trigger Warning** 
I genuinely thought I had killed myself, or maybe someone else, and was trapped in a sense of purgatory trying to figure out what I did to get there. 
Finally, I was able to spit out to my roommate that I thought I was dissociating. Thankfully she could understand my stuttering self, looked up what it meant to dissociate, and tried to ground me. 
I have never dissociated before- or not that I know of- nor do I know if THIS is what THAT was. 
But finally I was able to take a breath and feel like it was actually giving me air, and thats what brought me back. The breath I took felt like the first breath after drowning. 
I was so hot, yet so cold, shaking, shivering, and felt like I was going to get sick. I was so dizzy I‚Äôm surprised I didnt pass out. I thought I did, because there were moments I blacked out and dont remember anything at all.

I guess I‚Äôm just sharing my story and wondering if anyone else has ever felt this way? Is this dissociating?"
Therapist wants me to use stress ball,3,jpi3kd,2,"I scratch myself constantly in therapy. Otherwise I can't stay present. Even when hurting myself I can't stop the dissociation from happening. My therapist made me use a stress ball instead. It's less effective and I can't fully be ""there"". She wants to leave me a choice in wether I use it or not. Said it was mostly to protect me from myself. I tried but I had intrusive bloody and violent images in my head and it's disturbing. I have tried grounding techniques, focussing on a part of my body where I don't feel stress, describing an object in the room.... most of the time I am also frozen and can't speak. How can I continue therapy?? I don't know how effective it can be in this context."
Fighting Lows after Reaching New Peaks,6,jpcxsy,2,"I‚Äôve been going to therapy for about five and a half months now and I‚Äôve been going through the same pattern the entire time. Every time I feel like I gain a deeper understanding of my situation and my attitude slightly changes, I go through a low period that lasts up to a week. A newfound sense of courage is followed by weakness and hopelessness. I‚Äôve been trying to break through this pattern with grounding techniques but I have trouble keeping focus. I become afraid and begin to doubt my chances of ever breaking free. It takes a real toll on my body and my mind as it‚Äôs bogged down in negativity. Has anyone else felt this?"
Do you keep having flashbacks of past trauma? Trauma is a disease that robs your ability to be present. And when we lose control over and over it‚Äôs easy to become ashamed of ourselves.

Cosmic dust dissociation,6,joycdh,2,"When I was younger I often had these strange anxiety attacks before falling asleep where I would zoom out from my head and into space. It was scary because I thought that‚Äôs what would happen when I died and feared losing all my senses/consciousness while simultaneously floating in space as cosmic dust rather than my own body (try to imagine yourself drifting thru the milky way). As a kid the phenomenon was frightening, it all felt very real to me. Recently, I‚Äôve experienced something similar usually when im stressed/anxious/depressed ill feel as though an anxiety attack is forming but instead of continuing to feel overwhelmed by thoughts and emotions I‚Äôm met with the Milky Way again. I feel sort of numb to my surroundings and my mind draws blanks (quite literally spacing out). I‚Äôm surrounded by distant stars and darkness with the sensation of floating. Usually my mind and gut returns to their anxious state after this weird sensation, but for a moment it feels kind of peaceful. Hopefully somebody has experienced something similar"
"I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know how to make it stop, please tell me I'm not alone and someone else is going through this. Im scared.",13,joszjw,3,"I've been going to therapists for years for my childhood and teen trauma. I feel like, especially recently that my dissociation has gotten completely out of hand. hours in my day are flying by and I can't remember what I did. I just remember facts. ill know that I did something for example today I made mac and cheese. I have no actual memory of making it, getting it out. but I know I did. the containers are out and my kitchen is a mess, not to mention the leftover mac and cheese. sitting here while writing this I feel as though I'm inside my head. I don't even know how my fingers are moving to type this out and it's scary. It's like there's an invisible wall that is keeping me detached from everything and anything. I recently got a new dog with my partner. I picked him out and paid for mostly everything. but I feel no connection to this dog. I don't love him, I care for him as an animal but I feel as though if I left him and my partner, I wouldn't miss him, id be sad but I wouldn't miss him. it's like my brain is stopping me from making a connection. not only with him but with almost anyone. being in a relationship has been so hard. I love the person and I'm finally in a healthy relationship with someone who deeply cares for me, but when I think about him the first thing that pops into my head is that ""it won't last"" ""he's going to leave"" ""I won't even remember this relationship one day"". AND I DONT KNOW WHERE ITS COMING FROM. I know they are completely unreasonable thoughts but they feel so true. It's making it hard to care or think about our future. I can't even begin to think about just mine. My mind is all over the place. my thoughts are sporadic and I find myself staring into space for unknown amounts of time. everything feels so slow and fast at the same time. my thoughts are rapid. I haven't been able to watch anything with dark subject matter otherwise my head fills with a fog. It's almost as if my mind holds onto it and pulls things out from past memories as if I'm being triggered. it especially happens with mention of child abuse or yelling at children. but it's like I can't even clearly remember what im being triggered over and I sit there in an anxious/depressed/mad mess.  I can only seem to remember the horrible parts of my life or my biggest triggers. if anything negative happens my brain correlates that instant to something that's happened in my past. I've forgotten many amazing memories and times with friends and people who have passed that I'm later told about and have no memory of. it makes me sad to not remember such great things. it feels like I was never there or existed in the first place. I know all of these thoughts are irrational but everything in me wants to believe. I feel like I'm battling over my brain. I feel like I'm going insane. I just want it all to end. I just want it to be quiet. I need peace... please someone tell me I'm not the only one going through this. I feel so alone and scared"
I have been stuck in dissociation for about a year and a half,9,jorj98,4,"I have not felt completely real at all in a year and a half.

Disassociating on anniversary of trauma every year... has this happened to anyone else?,4,jorlps,1,"About 4 years ago, I was drugged and sexually assaulted.

I showed up to work yesterday and just felt completely unfamiliar with my job, a job that I absolutely love. No one seemed real and I felt like I was faking my entire self talking to my co workers. They ended up letting me go home because they told me I looked ill and was acting strange. It‚Äôs just embarrassing I HATE this so much and I don‚Äôt know how to snap out of this. It‚Äôs a nightmare every November. I feel detached from literally everything like I feel empty inside right now. What usually makes me happy and excited currently has no emotional effect on me.

Hello to you!!!"
Dissociative psychosis,8,jojoqf,1,Had anyone had a severe dissociative event that was sort of like psychosis or similar to what I‚Äôm gonna describe? It was where my physical body wandered around a nearby city and took multiple vehicles (taxis and trains) all around this city but my mind was somewhere else entirely. In my mind I was vividly experiencing an acquaintance‚Äôs birthday party ( at their house ) . I only know I really took taxis cuz I saw the trip route on my phone and the train ticket . I also went to a mall with my grandpa he claims that day but like I say all I recall was a birthday party at a friends house that apparently did not really take place but it felt totally real and I really thought it happened until a few days after I began to question aspects of it. I‚Äôve asked this question before and some people said they had some things vaguely similar as i recall but this still worries me cuz not many people seem to have it like this. It ties in with a lot of frightening recurring hallucinations I‚Äôve had that scared me so I‚Äôm trying to see if anyone has had this before where it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre dreaming while awake. Almost like sleepwalking but dreaming during it. Like I described above. It still worries me to think about a logical explanation or if anyone else has had anything similar. I know about it dissociation but I‚Äôve not heard of where many people have it this vivid ( this experience lasted the whole day my the way )

Finding out I disassociate has made my train of thought worse,28,joasm6,11,"I‚Äôm 28 and I‚Äôve been disassociating for 10+ years and it hasn‚Äôt bothered me because I‚Äôm still here enough to keep a job and be responsible. But my memories over the past 10+ years are very limited and I have the disassociative amnesia where I barely remember my childhood. 

I‚Äôve been working from home since the quarantine back in March and I guess being alone this long and not seeing people everyday for work has put me in my head a lot more and has been giving me way too much time to think about how much I zone out and barely remember things and can‚Äôt stay grounded (I‚Äôve been going more crazy knowing that I disassociate than before I knew)

My post for today is about it‚Äôs gotten worse to the point where I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs derealization or depersonalization. But I know that I‚Äôm real and that I‚Äôm here on this earth and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm leaving my body or anything but my psyche currently is stuck on a train that I‚Äôve been noticing that I‚Äôm too real...
Like I‚Äôm noticing that everyone is a individual and that we‚Äôre all stuck on this planet together just ruling ourselves and everyone‚Äôs trying to be normal when there is no normal. 
I just have been questioning the meaning and mysterious of life too much to the point where I don‚Äôt know my purpose because I can do anything because we have the ability too but also not wanting to do anything at all because there‚Äôs no point  

*sigh* it just sucks being stuck in your head. Anyone got any coping for this?"

I feel nothing it‚Äôs all bland

I‚Äôm back where I belong, in bed 
Because everywhere else feels like it‚Äôs not worth my time

If her life is just a fraud
Is it all a simulation or is she going insane 
I‚Äôm watching her from a chair with tissues and handlebars 
As I get high because I can‚Äôt even watch her life pass her by 

I think she might have gone insane
She‚Äôs sitting in an empty tub 
While she plays music really loud
To block the sadness and the pain out 

She still doesn‚Äôt even feel real 
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard to watch her try 
When every step she take is just 
Another failed effort in vain

If her life is just a fraud
Is it all a simulation or is she just going insane 
I‚Äôm watching her from a chair with tissues and handlebars 
As I get high because I can‚Äôt even watch her life pass her by

How do I help my girlfriend?,3,jmznnj,1,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm pretty new here and am seeking some advice/help.

My girlfriend is currently dealing with some bad depression and anxiety and a lot of stress from her job. She‚Äôs been through a lot in her life and suffered a fair amount of trauma as a child and teen, dealing with abuse and neglect at times. Lately she has moments or periods of time where something is triggering and she disassociates entirely from reality. She is very upset with me, believes I‚Äôm going to abandon her and that I don‚Äôt care about her. It becomes really, really hard for her. She wants to talk to me to know I‚Äôm there but also is very upset with me at the same time believing that I don‚Äôt want to be with her. 

I love her dearly, and I‚Äôve gone through my own dark bouts of depression in the past but I find myself so helpless and unsure of what I can do or say to help. 

Any advice or help you can offer would be very much appreciated."
This sucks :(,17,jmpsex,5,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't think I've experienced much trauma in my life, but for months now I've been struggling with feeling like I'm not actually real/in control of my own body. It feels like I'm invisible and I keep getting freaked out when I look in the mirror. I know that it's illogical, but I just can't connect to the idea that I'm looking at myself in the mirror. It's like I'm not real. I exist within my head but my body is doing its own thing and I can only watch. 
It gets better and worse, but last night everything felt so hazy and weird. It was like everything including my body had been swapped out for almost perfect replicas. Nothing was real? I don't know how to explain it without sounding mad. It was like a waking dream, I got so paranoid that I didn't exist anymore. I felt like I was outside myself and it wasn't pleasant. 
This is really starting to interfere with my life. I can't concentrate or hold normal conversations anymore. I think I'll have to see a therapist or something to see how I can make this stop.

Advice on how to deal with dissociation and marijuana.,23,jmhovh,14,"Hello, I‚Äôm 18 years old and am struggling with Dissociation Disorder. I am diagnosed with anxiety and have dealt with it my entire life. I do not currently take medication but have in the past. When I was 15, I tried smoking weed for the first time. I didn‚Äôt like it very much and was pretty nervous the entire time. The day after I smoked, in school, I had experienced what I would consider to be a panic attack. My anxiety shot through the roof, my body felt warm, and I felt what I now know as dissociated. Finding myself in social situations where I smoked a few more times, I realized I had dug myself into a hole to which I have yet to climb out of. I stopped smoking for 8 months and didn‚Äôt notice any change in my thoughts and perceptions of the world around me. I still felt dissociated and disconnected from reality. I took on smoking again as I thought, at the time, I was the only person who felt this way and things were not going to get any better. I now enjoy smoking weed as I have learned to seek its benefits. However, my dissociation has remained the same as when I first started experiencing it. I am conflicted as what to do as I enjoy weed and don‚Äôt seem to get better when off it.

I have struggled with anxiety and depressive disorders since I was a kid but never have felt any of these feelings until recently when I have started to get relatively better at controlling my depression and becoming more happy. I dabbled with acid quite briefly and my friend had told me it wasn‚Äôt smart since my brain isn‚Äôt fully developed and I was taking it rather frequently, but stopped once I had a particularly bad trip. These random flashes didn‚Äôt happen until a couple months after that though. Are these random bouts related to depression / dissociative disorders? They aren‚Äôt even bad feelings (except sometimes i zone out a little, but that is just me as a person - i daydream a lot) but the fact theyre happening is bringing me anxiety thinking that something is wrong with me."
Don‚Äôt freak out from dissociation thinking you need help,0,jms6k2,12,It‚Äôs literally a mechanism to make you feel better if you let it happen it‚Äôs literally your brain helping you lol it‚Äôs a beautiful thing üò≠ Idk what‚Äôs going on anymore but Ik I need to dissociate hard and I can‚Äôt anymore without literal dissociative so you people who post about it daily are lucky tbh ):
I think I died last year and this is just me venting about it,32,jm5o1a,6,"Around this time last year i was not in a great place. I was incredibly reckless and I didn‚Äôt care what happened to me, and one night in particular at a college party i filled my system with as much cocaine, weed, and alcohol as i could get my hands on and then chased it all down with about 5 energy drinks, as one does. When i told this to a few of my friends months later, they all looked at me like i had 5 heads and told me i‚Äôm lucky i‚Äôm not dead. Ever since then, i feel like i‚Äôm in purgatory and the universe has been testing me to see if i should go to heaven or hell (the state of the world over the last few months and how i respond to them is my ‚Äútest‚Äù of morality). It kind of scares me because i think the US presidential election might be the final test of morality and i might not see my family anymore after this week. I try to avoid thinking about it too much because it immediately sends me in a state of full dissociation and it takes a bit for me to kinda come back but sometimes i‚Äôll see something that triggers thoughts of it (happened this morning). Sometimes I think i‚Äôm just being insane but i still use it as a way to justify my irresponsible behavior (‚Äúit‚Äôs completely fine that i just don‚Äôt submit any assignments for 4 days i‚Äôm dead anyway‚Äù). My therapist hasn‚Äôt really offered any
solution for this so i guess it‚Äôs just gonna be a part of me for now."
Should I ask my therapist for medication?,2,jminc8,1,"Recently, while I was venting to my friend about how I‚Äôve been dissociating 24/7 for the past 6 years. she suggested I try meds. I‚Äôve been going therapy every week for about 5 months now and I don‚Äôt really see a difference, should I keep waiting for something to happen or should I ask what she thinks about meds for me?

Edit: I‚Äôm 14 btw idk if that matters lmao"
it feels like a constant existential crisis,5,jmdi7r,1,"It‚Äôs so hard to describe but this is the best way i can. I never had any crazy trauma in life so i dont know why this is happening to me because that it was dissociation is tied to. But sometimes i just think about how am i here? and how are we just floating on a ball in endless space? and then it just feels like i‚Äôm falling. my chest cavity gets all warm, my eyes go a little blurry and then i panic. I wish it would stop. but my mind is always racing and life and questions of how. like i am 16! i don‚Äôt want to feel this way anymore. I hate it. I want to be happy. even in times where i‚Äôm with my friends and family, it‚Äôll just happen and i get sad and it ruins my mood. I feel so small and vulnerable."
Could dissociation be mistaken for autism?,20,jm0y0y,9,"I've learned that I dissociate a lot, space out, feel numb, have almost no memories from my life, and so on. Could those symptoms be mistaken for autism by someone who knows very little about dissociation (and is, perhaps, biased towards an autism diagnosis)? Especially when the patient is a child/teenager?"

Does anyone else ever feel like they might be faking?,3,jll1et,1,"I don‚Äôt mean for this to come off the wrong way, because obviously no one would be able to fake something like this, but I guess what I‚Äôm saying is like. Okay. So when I first started having really bad episodes (my grandma calls them seizures, but they arent. Apparently they look like seizures to her though) my grandparents (who I live with) thought I was faking this and would always tell me to just snap out of it or to ‚Äústop playing around‚Äù. They understand that it‚Äôs nothing I can control now but they‚Äôll still tell me stuff like to snap out of it or whatever. But when I have consciousness during these episodes (I don‚Äôt all the time, usually when I‚Äôm fighting my very violent fragment) I feel as though I should be able to just snap out of it, and I feel like I should be able to move my body, but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like I can will myself to move, but I can‚Äôt actually move until I come out of it a certain amount and still then my movement is very slothful and janky. But I guess what I‚Äôm asking is does anyone else feel like they should be able to control it or like they are faking it at times?"
myselves‚Äôs ‚Äúbirthday‚Äù was yesterday. this is the first time I have googled this word,8,jlcvdj,25,"and i feel like one of myselves has decided now is the time. 

im making this because im triggered and in great need of reassurance and reality confirmartion. 

i feel an unamable fear and shame

im not sure of my name - but when we feel the emotion we call ‚Äúgrey‚Äù (thanks DBT/BPD) - when we feel we can speak English, we call it euphoria in mania, or bliss othwrwise. 

We dont think we have been less than hypo manic. we fear we have gone beyond mania - but are geounding with smell. sticks and spices (smokes and insence)

but time is missing... and things are not where i left them. sometimes i trust my housemates, but sometimes their faces are that of strangers. i wonder if the thee of us share the trait of dissociation, and if we are similar or not. 

this is all we can say, we have begun to release the tension - thank you for creatinf this safe space. 

if we felt grey, we would introduce iurselces, but we arent sure right now. 

When I have finished grounding, I will feel like the two/three names I *choose* to be, accpeting that these stories are helpful in me living the life that brings me happiness. but we get triggered and dissociate so much that we are scared that we are much less in touch than we appear to be. 

Its weird holding white and black, instead of grey. I belive that i want to integrate into 3 persons within my mind...

off to the sidebar i go, I would really appreciate any recommended reading for someone who is scared, condused, easily triggered, newly accpeting, and who is able to get out of thus painful headspace when others are able to provide feelings and thoughts of safety. 

much love to anyone who feels or has felt as i do. this is... interesting to say the least.

edit a moment later: Making this post has allowed is to begin to ground. If we felt bliss, we would also add that the reason we are not accessing MH support in our local community is that every healthcare professional has (re)traumatised us and our life has always ended up worse than before - except for one, but they are currently not available to me as a therapist."
Why i dissociate more when Im with my family than when Im with friends or alone?,22,jl4fcf,12,
Disconnected,1,jl5aci,0,"I was confused about why I was so confused and then it hit me that I am probably dissociating.  Everything felt strangely wiped out without anything connecting and it made me feel disoriented, alone.  Just a weird feeling overall.  Makes me think I got a serious brain damage from breaking down so much, which wouldnt be surprising.  But the world just seems, off."
A positive-ish tale,15,jkqwq0,10,"I met my gf online and we met in person about a year later. I flew across the country, where I'd never been, to see her. We had also never video chatted or talked on the phone, the closest being a few brief snapchats. When I saw her, it was magical and beyond what I had ever imagined. I quickly fell into a rare, euphoric dissociative state. I stayed a week and the whole thing felt like a dream. When I got home, I was still residually dissociating so I quickly wrote down what happened each day in a journal because I know I wouldn't have remembered any of it otherwise."
Holding onto emotions and feeling like past is real,14,jkgp4m,12,"Hello. I've been working really hard to feel safe and have emotions come up as a couple months ago started with a great therapist to work on complex trauma. I've been able to cry more and my thoughts have become more noticeable as well as occasionally getting emotional at reading or thinking of things. It seems to come in waves, and in the past my memories have not come back until I've been able to stay consistently in touch with my emotions, which hasn't happened yet. I'm still having a hard time in the appointment feeling and having emotions while talking about things that had me crying and being processed between sessions.

Sometimes the day before the appointment, I start feeling more grounded and that my emotions are not as accessible and wonder why I do not feel as reactive. Wondering if my body and mind is unconsciously ""getting ready"" for therapy and tucking my emotions back inside me. 

I also keep having random moments that last a few seconds that my past is not real and things weren't so bad and life feels unreal and wonder why I'm even doing therapy. Wish these moments would stop.

&#x200B;

What has helped everyone stay in touch with their emotions? To combat the feeling the past isn't real? And hang onto and feel emotions for therapy appointments?"
Listen up!,4,jkdoi4,3,"I had a shit childhood, abusive father, divorced parents, living in the hood, and all that came with a lot of trauma. We eventually worked our way up to the middle class and now I‚Äôm 14 years old and have DPDR/Disassociating. I have NEVER ever had anxiety or panic attacks. But then I got this out of no where, from my research and tests, I believe it‚Äôs from the fact that I didn‚Äôt relieve stress and realize my trauma because I never cried, never released my stress, and never came to realize all the pain I have been through. During this entire experience of torture that still effects me now and has been for 4 months, I‚Äôve noticed over time it will SLOWLY fade away. Little by little, unless you make a big deal of it, constantly think about it and don‚Äôt let yourself think positively. By me crying when I feel like crying and doing other things to relieve my stress I have noticed it works. It feels like an endless journey that will LITERALLY never end, but I promise it will, wether your journey is for years or weeks good luck, and remember this is a solo mission. Only you can help yourself."
Little gem from Tumblr,22,jk5c09,2,
was dissociating hardcore last night and drew this to cope :),161,jjuwok,5,
I think I'm finally coming out of it?,18,jk5ll9,10,"Hey everyone, this subreddit has been really great for having people to relate to about what has been the most difficult experience of my life.  Ever since it first started (dpdr) when I was 20 (26 now), I found it really hard to cope.  But gradually over time I got kind of used to it, of course with episodes in between.  The fog never really left though, and even as I'm writing this I do feel it a little.  But today when I was getting dressed for work I just had this moment of extreme clarity, like I could see everything in hd.  Just this feeling of calm wrapped in a subtle happiness.  After all this time and after having accepted it, thinking I would feel like that/this for the rest of my life, I feel like I'm rising out of the fog.  It's like I've come to this realisation that everything will be ok.  Dunno just wanted to share my good feelings, but also that even when you've completely given up, you can still get better and feel like a real human being again.  For those of you still in the fog, hang in there, you can do it!"

Am I dissociating?,6,jk1zlm,1,"Hi I'm sorry if this isn't allowed, but I'm wondering if I'm experiencing dissociation? I feel like this every so often but today I was really wondering if I was dreaming or not, and I just felt very ""off."" Pretty numb, like I couldn't feel everything wrong going on. I'm wondering if it could be related to regressing a lot more recently, and my brain could maybe be like confused about who I am? Also maybe being a bit tired and not eating enough so my mind was kinda foggy. It got a lot worse when I got home from school today and was talking to my mom again, kind of reminded of everything that's ""wrong"" and things that are stressing me out and making me feel depressed. Things are also going to be changing a lot, I'm working on high school applications, I might be moving, and just things about growing up in general. Anyways, I just felt very weird and disconnected, and very much like I was dreaming, listening to music helped a bit, and it lasted a like two and a half hours at its strongest maybe? Also I suspect my mom is gaslighting us, intentionally or not, and sometimes it makes me feel just insane. And I've struggled with a few different mental health issues including a trauma diagnosis if there's any correlation there? Anyways I'd really appreciate some input as to if this sounds like dissociation or not. Thanks for reading!

Edit to clarify: I feel like the main factor is maybe the things that are ""wrong,"" relatively small things like my mom taking away my phone (kinda my entire life lol) again, indefinitely, her cancelling my Halloween plans, and stress over things like planning about high schools, my plans partially going to hell, things changing a lot, but honestly mostly just losing my phone. I'm not sure why it always affects me so much. Someone please help I don't know what's going on"
if this is a coping mechanism.. can I get a new one?,24,jjrwdd,11,"I know thats a goofy question. 

I told my therapist about my dissociation and traumas, we traced it back to where we are  pretty sure i've dissociated since childhood and that its just gotten worse since other traumas have entered my life. 

she described it as a coping mechanism, which until now I thought coping mechanisms had to be something you do on purpose to some extent. where I feel like I don't dissociate ""on purpose""

so okay, my brain is doing it. but like I forget stuff all the time, I lose interest in everything I care about, I feel like I have to pretend to be me? 

it affects my job, my relationship, my safety??? 

how does this help? 

I always thought I was open, I always thought that i was the type to deal with things emotionally early on so it wouldn't prolong but my brain is like lol no. 

what gives?"
Is this an alter?,2,jk288x,1,"16 M here. I‚Äôm very dissociative. I‚Äôm almost always in what I call ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù and when I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm full on dissociating as in I‚Äôm not moving, completely not there almost like I‚Äôm hypnotized. My memory is also very bad and splotchy due to the varying degrees of dissociation throughout my day. But I‚Äôve also had a lot of weird episodes. I had a current ‚Äútraumatic event‚Äù happen recently which has caused a lot of my dissociation and paranoia to get worse (as well as intrusive thoughts) and also it has unlocked some very repressed memories from my childhood and it‚Äôs all been unfolding and getting worse over the past two months. Another thing that has happened though is I have very random moments where I‚Äôll go into a ‚Äútrance‚Äù or deep dissociative state and suddenly I‚Äôll get really mad at my grandparents (whom I live with) over virtually nothing. It‚Äôs never gotten physical (it almost did once) but I will have the worst most sadistic thoughts towards not only my grandparents but anyone else I can get mad at. It‚Äôs unlike any other anger I‚Äôve ever felt. Apparently I start cussing and getting all up in their faces over whatever nothing I decided to get mad about that day. I also remember none of this afterwards. My memory of any of this was only jogged by my grandparents recounting everything afterwards to me, and only then I can only really remember what I thought and how I felt. I really don‚Äôt want this to progress and the last thing I want is to hurt my grandparents. I am beyond heartbroken that I could even have such terrible thoughts about them. Oh, and oddly enough it comes up whenever I hear my grandpa specifically chew. Anyways I was at an emergency therapists appointment (i know, 9:00 pm is pretty late for that) and it happened while all four of us (me my grandparents and the therapist were in the room together) twice and it was directed toward my grandma both times. It wasn‚Äôt awful, but it came fleetingly, for about 2 minutes each time. I told her to shut up or whatever apparently, but it‚Äôs weird. My body physically gets angry. Like my heart starts beating, blood rushes to my face, and I have that feeling on my feet like I‚Äôm about to pounce on someone. I think it didn‚Äôt come out as much though because I was in front of someone other than my grandparents. The second time, however my therapist did have to calm me down somehow by making me do some sort of breathing thing. I remember gaining and un-gaining that sense of being there, almost like a light switch being flickered on and off and my therapist said it didn‚Äôt look like ‚ÄúI was anywhere there‚Äù. Anyways, they‚Äôre currently looking for somewhere inpatient now to help me get on some medication that will ground me or something if any of y‚Äôall know anything that could help with that that would be amazing. But I guess right now I just want to know if what I‚Äôm experiencing is what they call an ‚Äúalter‚Äù and what type?

Also, I‚Äôm gonna give some background on my childhood or whatever to see if that helps:

So I was born to my mom and my dad (obviously) who were recently married and 19 and 21 respectively. My mom is undiagnosed BPD (Borderline) and my dad‚Äôs always been off at work for most of the day and emotionally absent when he was home. They were very strict religious folk and my gay ass was literally testing their limits since kindergarten. I had a couple experiences in my life that my be considered ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù but nothing that sticks out to me as that one traumatic event to push me over the edge. A lot of beating from my dad and emotional manipulation from my mother. Some sexual experiences that weren‚Äôt rape but still left a mark on me too from as early as 3 years old. I also have two younger brothers and as soon as they were born my ‚Äúgiftedness‚Äù (I‚Äôm not gifted, just kinda smart imaginative and emotionally sensitive from a young age. It‚Äôs the only thing my mother could brag about regarding me was how ‚Äúgifted and full of potential‚Äù I was) was put on the backburner for them. And I‚Äôm not saying that to be a brat. Literally, my parents would lock me up in a room all day while they nurtured those two.  My mom went really off the hinge when I was like 10 and started fucking one of her friends from the gym. I got into a ‚Äútherapist‚Äù at that time who wasn‚Äôt really a therapist by any means, since she was cheating on her husband as well and told me that it my and my dad‚Äôs fault for her affair, since she had to get married at such a young age and quit her life she had planned. I started being suicidal around the first time then. Then my parents reconciled and got only more religiously staunch afterwards. It was during this time that I totally lost it, cause I started coming into my sexuality (and by that I mean laying the foundations to a pornography/masturbation addiction that I‚Äôm just now starting to try to control). I also sat in church for at least 7 hours a week with a preacher who constantly talked about how terrible gay people were and basically preached hellfire and brimstone if you know what that means. I also went to a Christian school at the time and was very sheltered my whole life. Eventually, my parents catch me watching porn (on my Nintendo 3DS browser) at about 12 years old and beat the literal shit out of me (I had bruises and bleeding wounds). So I kind of got treated a lot different for a while and wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave my room for a long time afterwards. Then at around 14 my mom found out I was gay (officially) and we had a repeat of the episode, we eventually ended up moving halfway across the country to Texas, where they continued to do everything they were already doing x10. I ended up attempting suicide three times during that six month period and ended up going to a hospital twice. The third time, my grandparents who I‚Äôve always spent lots of time around and who have been the only ones who have shown me real love found out and demanded that I come live with them back in South Carolina. I‚Äôve lived with them since and after having being raped my second week down here I started seeing the therapist I‚Äôm seeing now, who has helped me so much over the past two years. Oh and I saw another ‚Äútherapist‚Äù after my mom outted me. He wasn‚Äôt really a therapist but my dad got him for conversion or whatever. Anyways I hope it doesn‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôm complaining about my life I‚Äôm just trying to give some insight. Anyways so the rape never bothered me really other than the fact that the guy never went to prison for anything since it was never able to get ‚Äúall the way‚Äù. But anyways so yeah I‚Äôve been with this guy for the past two years and he‚Äôs helped me so much, but he won‚Äôt really tell me too much of what‚Äôs going on with this stuff that‚Äôs just coming out.

Anyways I‚Äôm sorry for all that. And I‚Äôve been very out of it while writing this in case you can‚Äôt tell. Also I‚Äôm sorry for writing SO much about my past but it honestly did help me to be able to get it all out for tonight. But yeah if you know if that was an alter please do let me know."
Is this this disassociation or something else.,2,jk226a,2,Hey y‚Äôall I have a question. For the entire month I have been feeling really out of it. Like I just woke up and haven‚Äôt shook off the sleep feeling. I have like this tunnel vision and bright lights are way to bright. It‚Äôs also like I have a heavy foggy head. My head feels like it weight a lot. I feel mentally slow too. This is stressing me out and scares me. I know I am real and I know that everything around me is real too. I have no question about that. It‚Äôs really weird I‚Äôm constantly tired and feel like something is not right. It gets worse sometimes but also sometimes for a brief moment I ‚Äúsnap out of it‚Äù and everything goes back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but right back to the fog after. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I have tried grounding too and that does not shake it off.
Using Archetypal energy to manage dissociation?,2,jjyp8j,0,"

So I am reading this book right now about archetypal psychology and it talks about a basic dichotomy where people either over identify with archetypes too much or disidentify and detach from them.

The one I'm reading is about primal masculine archetypes but there's a lot of different archetypes , still it seems the more primal ones (King/Queen, Warrior , Magician, and Lover) are important to this concept.

But each arcthype has a bipolar shadow form, that is basically shaped like a triangle, and there's a triangle that shapes childhood and builds in to adulthood.

So 4 triangles makes a pyramid, and the entire structure is a pyramid within a pyramid.

So it says people get identified with certain aspects of the primal archetypes, and that causes pathology. At the same time , they can become so detached from some that they forget that exist completely, though those energies may still manifest in neurotic or other ways in certain situations.

Still, when dissociating I wonder if it is possible to tap in to any of these archetypes and find a sense of balance or purpose to ease the disconnect?

Thoughts?"
Is this Dissociation?,2,jjrjom,3,"I just remembered this one time when i was like 8? I dissociated (this used to happen to me a lot as a kid and I'm just learning the term for it, or if it counts?) while watching tv with my family, apparently my grandmother had been calling my name? she was next to me and  I didn't hear anything(no tv, conversation, nothing) I don't even remember watching the actual tv.
The only reason i snapped out of it was because my grandmother threw a heel at my face and it hit near my eye, right after she threw it she started screaming at me for being ""embobada""
(Closest English translation is dumbfounded)
Thats the last memory i have of dissociating near anyone."
"I'm trapped in a loop of depression, anxiety and dissociation. What I thought would help me has left me feeling worse than ever.",40,jj6cg9,10,"My entire life I've felt dissociation/depersonalization and I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. When I was young I was extremely shy and anxious with no healthy way to cope. I feel dissociated all the time and that makes me even more depressed, being depressed all the time makes me constantly think about suicide, constantly thinking about suicide makes me anxious about what that entails and traps me even deeper in a disconnected state. The only person who has ever cared to take what I have to say seriously has told me I potentially use dissociation as a coping mechanism for moments of extreme anxiety.

I had hoped my whole life that if I got my act together and found someone to love that I would feel fulfilled enough to break the cycle, but now I can see that the cycle is independent of any outside force. No matter how perfect my life is on paper I have a unrelenting nagging in my head telling me I should just end my life. I think that if I could get a grip on reality my other problems would fall away. It's so hard to feel happy and satisfied when I know it's just a fleeting emotion I can't truly feel, everything just slips away and passes through my brain without ever feeling like its mine. 

I'm constantly reminded that only I can fix my own problems but I genuinely don't know if I can do it alone right now, I'm getting closer and closer and I feel like I'm going to have a breakdown or worse. I just need someone to rely on even for a moment but instead it just feels like no one is rooting for me, not even the people I would give anything to help."
What are some tips that has helped with your dissociation?,5,jjf61e,8,
Please lmk if this is dissociation,1,jjizlh,0,"Ok so I‚Äôm not rlly sure where to start cause my brain is constantly jumbled up and I can‚Äôt form things correctly. I think I dissociate mostly all the time every day. I can‚Äôt drive anymore cause I feel like I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs going on, I can‚Äôt get a job cause I‚Äôm so checked out and my social anxiety and anxiety in general sky rockets. I have ocd and now somehow everytime I dissociate (often) I think it‚Äôs something in my food or drink or something I‚Äôve touched causing me to be high or out of it. The only way I know how to explain it is that I feel high, out of control, I don‚Äôt even really know what I‚Äôm saying most times it scares me so bad. I can‚Äôt remember things, time goes so slow, I ask people to repeat themselves 1 minute after they say something cause I realize I have no idea what they even said to me. I‚Äôm questioning if I have an attention disorder like adhd or if it‚Äôs just my dissociation. I‚Äôve been on Zoloft for my anxiety, ocd, depression, panic for about 2-3 months and on 50 mgs. It‚Äôs not helping if anything I think it might be making me worse? Idk. It‚Äôs terrifying when I realize I can‚Äôt recall what I‚Äôve said or what is happening around me, I don‚Äôt want to do something weird or irrational and not know it.. I don‚Äôt really feel like I‚Äôm in a dream or anything, I know I‚Äôm real but I just can‚Äôt think. Grounding doesn‚Äôt work for me and at this point I just feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. Sorry this is long there‚Äôs so much more but I just need to know what this sounds like, I want to be in full control but I just feel out of it 24/7. Thankyou."
Do I dissociate?,2,jjemdr,6,"This is ultimately something I‚Äôll talk to my psychiatrist about, but I also wanted an opinion from those who deal with dissociation. I don‚Äôt know too much about this because I just discovered the term, but I thought it would be helpful to hear from people that struggle with it first hand. Forgive me if some of what I describe is totally unrelated, I‚Äôm just trying to learn. 

I‚Äôve had several things happen that make me think I may have a tendency to dissociate. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll suddenly feel like the world around me isn‚Äôt real, like I got teleported into another universe. Things around me feel different and strange even if I‚Äôm in my own home. This doesn‚Äôt usually last more than a few seconds. My sense of self feels strange during these times, I wouldn‚Äôt say I detach from my body or anything but I don‚Äôt feel like myself. 

This one is particularly weird to me, but say I become very immersed in a book or some sort of story telling from a first person narrative for an extended amount of time, I begin to feel more like that character and less like myself for a period after. Like my identity fades to the background and a false identity comes to the foreground. 

//TW: sexual abuse//

In addition, according to my therapists over the years and just based on my behavior as a child, I have experienced some sort of repressed sexual abuse that I honestly remember absolutely nothing about in terms of the actual event(s). I remember when my behavior changed and I exhibited some very obvious signs of sexual trauma, and I became incredibly distressed and haunted by something I couldn‚Äôt pinpoint, but I don‚Äôt remember anything else. I think I must have dissociated during whatever it was that happened to me, and locked the memory away. 

//End TW//

Other than that, I often have an incredibly hard time focusing on my surroundings and even what people are saying to me directly (I don‚Äôt have any diagnosed attention related disorders) and don‚Äôt process audible information well at all, I have to see it visually and even then have times where I just can‚Äôt process information.
It‚Äôs most likely due to this that I have terrible memory, and sometimes even something someone told me seconds before I simply don‚Äôt recall. During these times I feel stuck in my own head and like I can‚Äôt get out of it and into the real world where everyone else is. Everything outside of my own thoughts and consciousness doesn‚Äôt make it through. My fianc√© will often times ground me a bit by telling me I‚Äôm spacing out again, because I‚Äôve either stayed completely silent for extended periods of time because I‚Äôm stuck in my own mind, or because it‚Äôs clear that I‚Äôm just not present. 

I‚Äôve also experienced a severe loss of personal identity over the years, and feel there is a different ‚Äúme‚Äù I separated from to form whoever i am now. I have a lot of issues with my overall sense of self.

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I was just hoping to learn some things and maybe find out if I should bother my psychiatrist about some of this. I really appreciate any opinions or observations!"
Dissociation and sensory issues?,15,jj116c,2,"I‚Äôve always kinda wondered if my dissociation is linked at all to my sensory issues, or if they‚Äôre just seperate problems. My sensory issues are no where near as severe as my dissociation, though. 


Could it be something like because the connection, the tethers, I like to say, between my mind and body are not as secure as they should be I then process any input from my body in a weird way. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how it links up, though, because I‚Äôm too sensitive, so if anything it would mean that I‚Äôm too in my body... I dunno...


One of the worst ones for me at the moment is a constant tingling/ticklish sensation, I‚Äôm constantly twitching as if I‚Äôm a horse/cow covered in ants or flies or something. I‚Äôm constantly having to shake or move limbs, clothes, blankets, etc., accompanied by a fuzzy, blurred, stuffed-with-cotton feeling in my head. 


Just something I was thinking about recently"
help,21,jiv1s9,2,"i really am at a lost right now, i have been experiencing dissociation for quite a while now, like while covid had just begun as it happened after i took edibles while i was in a state of stress. it really affects the way i think and feel. some days i just feel completely out of it like i‚Äôm not in touch with my emotions and surroundings and it causes constant stress and anxiety. i‚Äôm constantly tired and just feel numb. i went for my road test today and failed it because i just couldn‚Äôt think properly and it affects how i think all the time now. i really am just at a loss and don‚Äôt know what to do."
Experiences,17,jis8vb,9,"A big part of dissociation for me is the anxiety that comes with it, or preceeds it. What are your experiences with dissociation and anxiety? For me, I feel like I'm about to either lose my mind or start tripping out. I'm not sure if my anxiety causes dissociation or the other way around. It seems like it goes both ways."
Hoping To Educate About DID,2,jivbqu,6,"In light of, um, the glaring ableism on r/DIDCringe: 

If you actually want to help DID systems combat stigma by learning about this disorder, please feel free to ask us anything. 

DID and OSDD are very real disorders that impact thousands of people's lives. Not your ""cringe.""

I won't entertain questions that are just trolling. I'm happy to answer anything for those who are genuinely interested. 

We aren't professionals but maybe our experiences can be useful for something. Sometimes the stigma gets really tiring and I feel the need to do something."
Why do people not ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù dissociation?,44,jid5ro,8,"Having a tough time wrapping my head around how it‚Äôs possible to define mental illness.

The mind can‚Äôt be measured, the DSM isn‚Äôt about neurological damage or physical pathology. 
If anxiety is real it‚Äôs an abstract sensation dependent on an individual‚Äôs interpretation of what COULD be something perceived totally differently in another‚Äôs mind.. how can one understand their own mind well enough to gauge what is occurring, whether bad or good? I  don‚Äôt understand what makes a feeling ‚Äúbad,‚Äù or why drugs treat what can‚Äôt be measured? 
I‚Äôm scared of the mental health field tbh 


Having a tough time. If dissociation isn‚Äôt real enough for people then what mental illness could possibly be? Sorry if this offends, I do not mean for that I just want meaningful discussion and to possibly be enlightened üí°"
need some comfort/reassurance. Please. i just want to know if any of you could relate to this to take stuff off my chest.,3,jiqswf,5,"Hello. I posted here about a month or two back, possibly 3 but, i really need some comfort and reassurance (a response/reply is highly needed rn.) I struggle everyday with severe/extreme anxiety, OCD,  panic attacks, and dissociation. I hope somebody can relate to these but here are a couple of symptoms I suffer from below:

- dissociation.
- neck tension. (my posture is not the best and my mom has always told me to hold my shoulders and back up more.) 
- headaches. (mainly either in the back of my head, on one side, or just like a band on my head.) 
- possible new symptom from today: eye pain. (reminder, i was wearing my glasses for long distance and i squint alot.) 
- feeling dizziness when walking or getting up. (possible slight vertigo.) 
- feeling like a robot/fear that im gonna loose control of myself and anxiety. 
- somewhat hard to swallow because of anxiety. 
- forgetful.
- sore temples.
- and rarely feel as if my arm (or leg, foot,etc.) isn‚Äôt apart of my body.)


I really just need some support right now. I‚Äôm really sorry if i posted this in the wrong thread but, i just had to reach/seek out some comfort. Also, My therapist said this is dissociation but my anxiety is going haywire. My health anxiety has come back at full force and im just so mentally tired. Can any of you relate to any of these symptoms? :("
awful,4,jiig6s,5,"so i just took a walk and i realised that im not really aware of my surroundings as if im not paying attention to them and are stuck in my head, like i just filter out every noise that i hear and almodt everything visually , like i see stuff but im not paying attention to it . i just wanna know if this is something that dissociation causes or if im just extremely anxious because sometimes i question myself if i really have this"
Not sure what I'm expieriencing.,0,jioj9q,0,"I have bpd, and I'm regressing right now. Previously I was in recovery , until probably covid hit. 

There are other comorbid diagnosis, but I've never understand if what I'm expieriencing is dissociating or something else. I spend alot of time day dreaming, and when I think about myself I don't think of my physical image, I think of like a skeleton with a mass of black air inbetween the bones instead of organs and skin and what have you. 

Like, I logically know I'm a real person and I'm here, but it doesn't feel like that?? I'm really a nice person, but my inward narrative ( I do have one going in my head constantly ) is super negative, and basically when I'm alone with my thoughts it all just turns to... That.. thinking I'm some kind of entity trapped in a skeleton more then an actual human being who is horrible and a terrible monster. I've also had long periods of time where I felt ' my soul was rotting ' which was a really weird feeling. 

I know that's really weird, and I have been having short term memory loss issues also ( just forgetting stuff alllllllll the time, thoughts, specific words, what I'm talking about when I'm taking about it or forgetting my destination when I'm driving there ) and I function normally I should say. I've been isolating for the past two months really hard except for working and games and this is all I think about. I've expierienced this feeling a few times over the past several years and I'm just wondering if it's dissociation or if I'm missing something."

Feeling Anxious For No Reason? How YOU Are Unconsciously CREATING Anxiety & BLAMING It [UNIQUE],0,jij6e1,0,"These are most people‚Äôs answers when I ask them why they feel anxious and what they believe about anxiety. I don‚Äôt know why I feel anxious. Anxiety is ruining my life. Anxiety is a demon I have to fight. Anxiety just happened to me and I‚Äôm just living with it. Anxiety is genetic.

The reason why I can‚Äôt achieve this goal/move forward in my life is because of anxiety. Anxiety is not letting me live my life. Anxiety anxiety anxiety is the problem right??

You see, in all these labyrinths of explanations, one thing is sure: You are not taking responsibility of how YOU have created and contributed to the anxiety. üò¨

You‚Äôre not seeing how you are unconsciously CREATING anxiety, then unconsciously UNDERPERFORMING in your life so you can retrospectively (meaning, looking back) BLAME the anxiety as the ‚Äúreason why‚Äù you couldn‚Äôt succeed, achieve your goals, start a relationship, date, have a partner, start a family, start a new career, and do all these wonderful things you want to do with your life

and then, unconsciously focusing your analytical/intellectual mind to find EVIDENCE and proof as to why anxiety is not letting me live my life/is genetic/can‚Äôt be overcome/etc. so you collect more ‚Äúintellectual proof‚Äù that strengthens the excuse of why this artificial self-created problem called anxiety can‚Äôt be overcome and IT is controlling your life and you are just its unfortunate victim right? Sure! üòè

And how do we feed our excuses? Well we feed them with theories, statistics, intellectual explanations, research papers, becoming intellectually stubborn and not wanting to give up your explanations,

being secretly affectionate to the explanations, using explanations as your fallback plan and carefully preparing them in your mind by rehearsing them so you deliver them in the most articulate way possible so that ‚Äúit lands‚Äù and ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù in the other person‚Äôs minds and in your own, making the explanations so seductive and logically coherent and backing them up with so much proof and logical coherency so that the excuses have a more serious and ‚Äúofficial tone‚Äù, etc.

See that? Believe it or not, you have created all of this. üëå

Consciously or unconsciously, to protect yourself, to avoid responsibilities, etc ‚Äì whatever the reason, you have created your own cage so stop blaming the anxiety and take responsibility. Regardless of the why or when, you have done this to yourself and the sooner you face this harsh reality the sooner you get better. If you prefer to keep lying to yourself and avoid reality, don‚Äôt watch this video.

My very recent experience with driving,8,jgybtb,2,"I‚Äôve been in a state of 24/7 dpdr for two years now. For the past year, my family constantly pestered me about driving but I knew that if I did I would space out and crash. 

After getting recently a job, the topic was more brought up. I practiced a bit and had to drive on my own very quickly. I drove to and back from work 2 times so I thought I was ready.

Just about an hour ago, I crashed into a pole. I was making a turn and completely spaced out. I went too fast and I couldn‚Äôt stop. The moment right before my eyes closed because my head hit the air bag made me truly believe I was about to die. I was so shocked that I just grabbed my phone and got out. Thankfully there was a group of men who were very nice and pulled the car into a lot. I honestly can‚Äôt imagine myself even getting into a car right now. Let alone driving again. Man, my therapist is going to have a blast hearing all this."
I‚Äôm Only 16 And My Life Is Going To Shit,35,jgnt0x,21,"16 year old M here. I‚Äôve been in therapy about two and a half years now, and I‚Äôm just now starting to be told I‚Äôm dissociative. I don‚Äôt know if I really am though, because I don‚Äôt really have any ‚Äúalters‚Äù. For me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a constant haze and my conscious mind has little control over anything. I don‚Äôt think coherently, and I would say I have different personality states. It feels like I‚Äôm in a constant muddy fog, and every sort of emotion or thought my conscious mind has stays repressed. I also have constant intrusive thoughts and images of sexually violent things. They originally started about a month and a half ago, and it was really bad at the beginning, causing panic attacks where I would move and do things outside of my control. Now those don‚Äôt affect me, but I have these really weird other types of attacks that I don‚Äôt know how to explain. It‚Äôs like randomly, I‚Äôll stop dissociating, and I‚Äôll begin feeling a sudden rush of one emotion, but I‚Äôm still not able to control my body consciously. I‚Äôll get really angry, and start acting just like any other angry person would (nonviolent with excessive violent thoughts), or really sad, or paranoid, or anxious. And I‚Äôll switch between one emotional extreme to the other, with brief periods of dissociation, where it‚Äôs almost like a hypnotist snaps their fingers and I‚Äôm suddenly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, how I got where I am, why I‚Äôm crying etc. All I remember is the immediate moments right before. I‚Äôll also be ‚Äútransported‚Äù occasionally to different made up circumstances and be affected as such. For example, yesterday I was being operated on without anesthetics and I could feel everything inside of my body and I couldn‚Äôt start screaming. And this all usually happens back to back, like multiple episodes at a time, then it just stops and I can barely remember anything. Right now, ever since I‚Äôve been unable to think clearly at all (I could at least remember things like 2+2=4 beforehand), I can‚Äôt hardly remember anything, and I‚Äôve been really angry and snappy towards everyone. I never had any one sort of ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù experience as a child that I can think (I don‚Äôt remember being raped or any sort of other thing) but I was forced to take showers with my dad at a young age and it has been one source of trauma for me, as well as growing up in a religious extremist household with two very manipulative parents. But other than that I can‚Äôt think of anything that could have scarred me, even though my therapist wrote a letter to my doctor about me having PTSD. I‚Äôm also really paranoid. I‚Äôm scared half the time that my grandparents (who I live with) are going to kill me, even though bless their hearts they love me more than anyone else and have been here for me through everything, or I‚Äôm scared that the governments watching me and is going to take me away (for what I don‚Äôt know) but I recognize that it‚Äôs all crazy paranoia. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve always had mental health problems to some degree, but I was still an all A‚Äôs honors student. I‚Äôm not that anymore. I can‚Äôt even sit down to do schoolwork or I dissociate so far that I‚Äôll end up just sitting there, often staring at something and doing nothing else. Please tell me someone knows what‚Äôs going on. I can‚Äôt think of any other sort of community to reach out to."
Risperdal and Wellbutrin for Dissociation?,2,jgzhne,3,"My doctor just put me on 1 mg of risperdal (risperdone) a night, with 150 mg of Wellbutrin (bupropion) in the morning. I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for about three weeks already, and haven‚Äôt noticed any positive changes so far. I was taking CBD oil, for about two weeks along  with the Wellbutrin, and it did help with anxiety to a degree, but caused an increase in dissociation. I guess what I‚Äôm asking is has anyone had any experience with any of these and does anyone know if they actually help?"
I'm kicking the cult of my family out of my head and it feels good.,9,jgnrmi,0,"I have some thoughts in my head that won't stop. 

I'll say, ""no stop"" to triggering feelings and physical flashbacks of being raped. And hear ""you don't mean that"". I used to just disassociate, and go back to being numb (I've always called it death), but now I'm, fighting back. 

All I do is yell ""no"" back. My brain apparently knows narcissists well, because my subconscious will cycle through various narcissistic answers for *hours*, but just like arguing with, the only thing that matters is *I said no*. Thassit. Anytime I try to reason with it, it wins. *i said no""

And I'm starting to believe it too.

I deserve bodily, mental, and emotional autonomy. Family is only family of they recognize, respect, and nurture, your autonomy.

It gave me new strength to yell down the voice. 

My family (that spawned the voice) doesn't care about *me* they love a fabrication of me. And I refuse to die for them. I refuse to die for it. 

It will die. 

It's just a piece of shit rapist voice that can't respect consent. Like rapists it calls rape love. It deserves to die. 

It deserves to die. 

And yeah, I know meds are available, but this is really the first time I've acknowledged that I can't just expect the ""running commentary"" to just disappear unless I'm actively, viscerally countering it.  So im trying that first."
Feels Like Brain Damage,39,jgcmov,6,"**the only reason I can articulate this paragraph is because I have ocd tendencies and can‚Äôt stop ruminating over my symptoms and researching them. I want to stop thinking about this but nothing successfully distracts me from it besides sleep. 

My brain is VOID of thoughts, ideas, words, consciousness. I literally CAN‚ÄôT THINK, process, reason, plan, create new ideas, think critically, have any sense of judgment or insight. Can‚Äôt wrap my brain around any complex thoughts anymore. Takes my brain so long to process reading books, watching TV, and listening to conversation. I forget things seconds after they occur, my memory is like a goldfish. I can barely maintain a conversation aside from responding with the most basic phrases because my verbal recall is terrible now.  I can‚Äôt write like I used to or make art. I feel like I lost my entire personality and sense of self. I‚Äôm emotionally numb. Light and sound sensitive. Music doesn‚Äôt make me feel alive anymore. I make stupid mistakes all the time. I‚Äôve been socially isolating because it takes so much energy to figure out how to respond to messages or conversations irl and I‚Äôm embarrassed because I probably sound stupid and boring. I‚Äôm training for a new job and barely can comprehend what‚Äôs going on- I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to keep this job. This condition has turned me into the opposite of who I used to be‚Äî intelligent, charismatic, highly creative, social, passionate, great critical thinking skills, unique, artistic. Now I‚Äôm diminished into a mindless robot who can barely take care of herself. Prior to all this I had finally found my calling and was just embarking on my passions and now those dreams have dissipated. I‚Äôm beyond depressed- this has taken everything from me that I‚Äôve ever cared about. My soul, mind, heart, and personality are gone. There‚Äôs a pressure in the front part of my skull that has been there for 4 months. No medical professional has alleviated these debilitating symptoms, which all started after quitting weed, experiencing extreme anxiety/panic, and going through a very stressful life event. I can‚Äôt stand this much longer, I‚Äôm stuck in purgatory like a sick joke. No one deserves this 

I might‚Äôve experienced a weed-induced psychosis this past year, and now I‚Äôm afraid that after quitting and going through severe stress I have all the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (cognitive decline, anhedonia/depression, and anxiety are key factors). Friends and family keep saying that I will recover, which I desperately want to believe, but if I do have the negative symptoms of schizo, it‚Äôs a degenerative disease and most psychiatrists don‚Äôt know how to treat negative symptoms. I just want to cry all the time and run away from this hell of an existence- I wish I could press a button on in my brain and turn ‚Äúme‚Äù on again. I‚Äôm scared, debilitated, and devastated, feel like I‚Äôm mentally disabled now, and don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this. I was finally pursuing my dreams this year and then it all fell apart when I lost my brain capacity within weeks"
Feel like an airhead/ robot,29,jg7i75,5,"My brain just constantly feels empty because I can‚Äôt remember anything.

In a blur. If only I could live like everybody else‚Ä¶

**HAZY DAZY**

Walking around in a daze  
I want to be in the moment, the right now, all the time  
But I can‚Äôt be, because if I ever finished a day‚Äôs to do list, rather than thinking about doing things  
Then what would I do?

I‚Äôd have *too much* time to think  
Because nothing I do can be in the moment  
It‚Äôs all in preparation for not ticking those things off‚Ä¶

And I never admit or deal with the real me  
If I could just live in the right now I‚Äôd finish typing  
Then I‚Äôd do the day‚Äôs tasks before relaxing

I think the relaxation is what I crave  
Proper chill time, and me time,  
Not dissociated, out of body slumps

I want to feel free, like I‚Äôve dealt with it all  
And when something comes up I can move through it  
Conscious relaxation would be amazing

I think about abuse; the physical and emotional affects every second of everyday  
Yet I process nothing, or very little.................

This ruined my life,5,jgecsk,3,"I am an 18 year old girl who has gone through incredibly traumatiic life experiences. Last year around midway through 2019 I fell suddenly ill and had to drop out of high school because I was deteriorating so fast.  I spent the entire year bedridden , hardly able to be productive and in constant torment 24 / 7 due to my symptoms , all of while having my friends abandon me in my time of need. I spent many days in tears , screaming at the top of my lungs to make the torment stop while everyone else was in school applying to their colleges while I suffered alone. Fast forward one year of HELL I am now in disassociation. I was naturally a once a highly intelligent person, with great introspective skills and gifted creativity. I always had a knack for innovation and was starting a cool idea I had come up with as well, and exceptionally analytical abilities. I was very passionate and emotional too, capable of being both left and right brained . I had passions in many fields, ranging from cooking to music , to philosophy , history, and sociology/psychology, various sciences.  I was seen as someone who would ""go places"" , and genuinely really wanted to help people in my life with the skills I was born with. I had spent my high school years feeling like I never actualized my potential enough due to not putting myself out there , having severe depression and generally being lazy . And when the huge turning moment of my life was to occur (graduation and moving on with college ) , I had to fall fucking ill. And then after that I had to develop this fucking disorder. I have lost all of those abilities. I have head pressure and have lost my executive fucntions. I get little twitches over my body and don't experience normal body sensations like appetite, thirst or sleepiness. Music is dead to me yet I used to be the type that LIVED for music, and genuinely wanted to share my own with the world.  My emotional blunting has stunted my creativity, and I struggle to carry basic conversations. I have severe trauma and am STILL unable to graduate high school, and I hardly do anything in the day. Living in my body has been torture and the people I thought cared about me had left and abandoned me, failing to respond to my messages or even talked behind my back . All of those people are now self actualizating their potential after treating me like fucking shit, while I sit here and suffer . Nobody even wished me happy birthday. I used to once feel connected to the spirit of the world but I now fucking hate it. I have developed severe misanthropy and don't even feel like a person anymore due to the way I was treated. I am so sick of peoples pathetic behavior and my life and the amount of suffering I've endured,  that I've disassociated completely . I had great hopes for the future in my teens, and was a naive and innocent kid. and THIS is what my life ended up like at 18. What a fucking joke. I dont know how I will get my brain back ever again, how I will get my creativity , my higher level intelligence, my humour and my love for life back. I can't. Because this place absolutely destroyed me. I have to completely rebuild my foundation in life and I dont know how."
Any resources on mild/moderate dissociation? Can't find anything so far :(,8,jg5mpe,0,"TL;DR: Resources for learning about moderate but not severe forms of dissociation? I'm processing some trauma I didnt realize I had and am trying to figure out what's going on with me.

---------------------
Is anyone familiar with any resources on dissociative symptoms that are more on the mild to moderate end of the spectrum? 

Most of what I've been able to find out there makes reference to how everyone dissociates a little bit, like the example of spacing out while driving, but I'm more interested about what's in the middle- still of ""clinical significance"" but not necessarily inducing amnesia? (I have blocked out some memories- mostly from childhood but some more in more recent years as well. I suspect it's from dissociation because it's all stuff where my parents were mad at me.)

Like... maybe just emotional amnesia? Or feeling like I'm aren't part of the real world, but not really with any visual disturbance?

Is that even dissociation?

If this isn't the right place for me I really apologize. I'm realizing I'm not as healthy as I thought I was (I was in denial about how abusive my parents are for a long time, and that extended to denial about how their actions have affected me.) I've got a solid therapist, supportive partner, went NC with my parents when they ramped up their abusive rather than listen to me when I tried to confront them...

...but if anything I feel worse, like my I'm cracked open or disintegrating or dissolving or something. 

Sorry now I'm rambling and I don't even know if any of this makes sense, or if it's even relevant to dissociation.

Thanks for taking the time to read this! I appreciate it!"
I just want someone to talk to.,4,jg8ohj,4,"
I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm posting in the right spot I guess but I‚Äôm just desperate to find community because I‚Äôm just getting worse with each day and am so terrified. 

I‚Äôm diagnosed with CPTSD and DDNOS. I was initially misdiagnosed with BPD years ago but then when I saw a trauma specialist she was like nope that‚Äôs night right and everything fell into place. We tried doing EMDR twice and during the second session she stopped and told me she felt I had serious issues with dissociation and diagnosed me with DDNOS. That was about 3 years ago. I lost my health insurance so I couldn‚Äôt see her anymore and now things are so much worse, especially the dissociative symptoms. A lot of the symptoms I‚Äôve started experiencing seem to be a lot like what DPDR looks like from what I‚Äôve been reading and seeing on here but I don‚Äôt want to diagnose myself but regardless, chronic dissociation is completely destroying my life. 

I am dissociated to some degree 24/7 and it‚Äôs been this way for about almost two years now but it‚Äôs just slowly crept in and gotten worse. I feel so alone all of the time and like I‚Äôm suffocating due to a lack of connection with anything and built up emotions that I cannot release or feel but I know they‚Äôre there. I‚Äôm stagnant. I can‚Äôt connect with others. It‚Äôs ruining my relationship with my partner. I can‚Äôt be sexually active or romantic at all because any feeling of connection or vulnerability sends me into a panic causing a more serious dissociative episode. Grounding doesn‚Äôt work for me because I‚Äôm so terrified of my reality that it sends me into a panic attack and I go into a full blown dissociative episode. The only thing that keeps me calm is looking at my phone or the tv. I guess because it‚Äôs not reality and it‚Äôs distracting. I usually close myself in my bedroom with the lights off or low because lights fuck with me. I look around and everything overwhelms me. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm overstimulated all of the time. I avoid being outside during the day at all costs because looking around and seeing all of the details scares the shit out of me. I get overwhelmed knowing all of the tiny leaves are real and I can‚Äôt handle it. Sometimes I go to the bathroom in the dark when it‚Äôs really bad. Sunglasses help. I have roommates and the sound of hearing them downstairs freaks me out. I avoid going to the kitchen to get water or food unless my partner is here with me. I guess the thought of having to be ‚Äúon‚Äù and presents fucks with me. It makes me overspend because it‚Äôs just easier for me to go through a drive thru rather than connect with anyone. 

The only thing that helps me is my cat. He‚Äôs the love of my life and is the only one I can be vulnerable around and feel safe. I have one really good friend and like two others that are okay but none of them experience dissociation. They‚Äôre supportive but my situation is so bad that I can‚Äôt just rely on them to be able to handle this heavy amount of shit all of the time. I need community that understands what I‚Äôm feeling. I was laid off in March due to COVID so being stuck in the house has made it so much worse. I‚Äôm about to go back to work next week and I‚Äôm so scared to interact with people because of my anxiety and having to try and snap out of it all the time. 

I don‚Äôt really daydream anymore. I used to nonstop as a kid to escape my trauma and some as an adult but now it‚Äôs just like static in my head. Sometimes I just drive around for hours at night to keep myself busy. I‚Äôll just come home and sit and stare at a wall or my phone for hours and hours. My whole existence is just waiting for night to come so I can feel safe then fall asleep. And even then the nightmares still haunt me sometimes. I‚Äôm on sleeping meds due to chronic insomnia. 

My chest hurts constantly because I just want to feel so badly and let loose. I have fibromyalgia too which is probably from childhood trauma and all of these pent up feelings just exacerbate my chronic pain. 

My stomach hurts because I don‚Äôt eat properly. I‚Äôm scared to go downstairs and cook if other people are around so I just won‚Äôt eat or eat bullshit take out that I can‚Äôt afford anyway. 

It wasn‚Äôt always like this. I used to feel like a person. Even now I have snippets of passion but they‚Äôre very brief my brain usually shuts that down really quickly. 

I‚Äôm just so lonely and want to be able to connect to someone who feels this pain. I just need a friend. I want to feel whole again but I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. 

Sorry this is a huge ramble. I‚Äôve never posted before. I‚Äôve always been too embarrassed but I know I shouldn‚Äôt be. 

TL;DR: dissociation is fucking awful and I want community. I feel like it‚Äôs my only hope."
New to DPDR Diagnosis,5,jg2lig,2,"Hi I wasn't sure i believed in this stuff, but I was diagnosed with DPDR recently and don't know what to make of it. Ive been pretty free from it since quarantine since I think mine is tied to sex and to crowds. But does this ever go away?"
Therapists are not helpful,39,jfrrf1,15,"Hello,

I am struggeling at the moment to find a therapist for trauma and dissociation. I have different forms of dissociation dp/dr being one of them and at the moment chronic. For me no matter how bad I feel or how dissociated I am its not very visible to anyone else...my problem is that therapists i go to dont see me. they cant see behind the appearances. I told one I was seeing about my chronic dissociation and she said ""you dont seem dissociated to me"". she i think meant it as a helpful statement but it was completely devastating. i mean why would you invalidate someone like that when they are trying to tell you how they are feeling? also is dissociation really something that is alway perceiveable to others?"
Fed up trying to get help,1,jg4y5x,1,"I have DID and derealization/depersonalization. My psychiatrist has been encouraging me to seek further therapy as our appointments have slowed during covid but everywhere I‚Äôve called won‚Äôt help me. He gave me a list of places to call.

I called them all. No one has counsellors with training in dissociative disorders. Literally zero of them. Just got off the phone from a centre for trauma and abuse he referred me to. I told them I have DID, described my symptoms, the secretary hesitated and asked, ‚ÄúIs that an official diagnoses?‚Äù 

I told her it was. Immediately she said ‚ÄúSorry, we can‚Äôt help you with that.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm so tired. This was the last place in my city that I hadn‚Äôt called so guess I‚Äôm shit out of luck. I just want someone to help me. And nobody will."

Do you sometimes feel better than people?,20,jfjly2,7,"Moment of honesty here, i'm not sure if its because I dissociate or if I have another problem I need to figure out but. I feel because I can dissociate and that's why things really don't bother me at all (because I forget the drama anyways) and people think i'm calm/collected but really I just cant connect to me my emotions enough to react like a normal person.  

Does anyone have this sense of 'nothing can bother you' attitude sometimes and it makes you feel better than people because they get worked up about such trivial things?

(I know this sounds a-hole-ish, but I really am a nice person, but I know that I have this above side to me also and im trying to pinpoint if my dissociation has created some A-hole ego or something)"
i just spent an hour staring at a point on my wall unresponsively thinking about how my actions in this world will lead to the death of myself and perhaps others. apparently i was also listening to the spanish flea for 45 minutes. i didn‚Äôt hear it. was i dissociating?,44,jf0f9s,5,
Not my face,6,jf5j1g,7,"I used to say I spent most of my life with my head in the clouds, I think that‚Äôs an almost romantic way of explaining near chronic dissociation. It‚Äôs like my life is a dream. Not a nice dream or a bad dream, just simply not real. I‚Äôm always thinking that any time now I‚Äôm going to wake up. It ebbs and it flows, I have some days and weeks that are clear, I think, as far as I remember, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I didn‚Äôt dissociate very much as a child. First time I remember it happening was halfway through high school, and it was one of those out-of-body types. For the most part I just carry on, it doesn‚Äôt freak me out too much, I don‚Äôt think I really feel enough for it to freak me out. 

For about three years I was very suicidal. I‚Äôve lost count of the number of attempts I‚Äôve made. I was in and out of the mental health ward, spent a whole month there at one point. The rooms were quite nice, you had a bed, some shelves, an armchair by a window, and your own bathroom. I had to ask the nurses for some newspaper and sticky tape. I had to cover every reflective surface. My face was ((is?)) not my face. I still struggle with this. I have days where I can‚Äôt stop looking in the mirror, I want to put makeup on, I fluff and I preen. Other days I want to scream and cry just catching a glimpse in the back of a faucet. 

I‚Äôm getting better with it. These days the problem is mostly just ‚Äúslippery-ness‚Äù. Trying to grasp reality is like trying to grasp a wet bar of soap. The harder I squeeze, the further it gets away from me. It‚Äôs most concerning when I‚Äôm driving, I tend to not even remember getting from A to B. When I try to tell people this they dismiss it as just ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù, saying that everyone does that with their regular drive. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs really the case, I‚Äôm always questioning if I‚Äôm just imagining this all happening. Is this really happening? Am I just imagining it, making it up? 

I‚Äôm foggy at the best of times, and in conversation I‚Äôve noticed I sometimes say things without realising I‚Äôm saying them, that words are just happening, or alternatively I‚Äôll have to ask people to repeat themselves because I didn‚Äôt realise they were actually saying something. I watch them talking, trying to focus, I see their mouths move and I hear noises, but my brain doesn‚Äôt actually register the words. 

I think I was ok for a little while, I don‚Äôt remember anything bad happening, except for the ‚Äúslippery-ness‚Äù, the ‚Äúditzy-ness‚Äù, the ‚Äúhead in the clouds‚Äù or ‚Äúoff with the fairies‚Äù type thing. Lately though I‚Äôve been having trouble getting to sleep. I get comfy, the lights are turned off, I‚Äôm warm and feeling calm, but then everything morphs and twists. Black shadows appear, patches of dark that are darker than everything around them, my body feels like tar, different parts of me feel like they swell or shrink in turn, pulsate, ooze. I can‚Äôt move. I can‚Äôt speak. I can‚Äôt open my eyes. Sometimes I cry, but it‚Äôs only tears dripping down my face. I fight it. It feels like eternity, but eventually I manage to open my eyes, and then I find a patch of light in the room, turn on a light or reach for my phone. I‚Äôm simultaneously terrified and numb. I get up and go for a snack or a cigarette, drink some water, read for a bit, and then try to sleep again, apprehensive, but knowing that I must. If I don‚Äôt go back to sleep it only gets worse. 

Sometimes, in the dark, when I‚Äôm trying to get to sleep, instead of the shadows, I simply forget what my face looks like. I try to remember photos of myself or looking in the mirror, but I only remember all the other faces I‚Äôve seen and never my own. If I try to look at photos or turn on the light and look in the mirror I only feel nauseous and uncomfortable. That‚Äôs not my face. Again, if this happens I get up, try to clear my head, have a snack, drink some water, and go back to bed. I‚Äôve never tried to kill myself during one of these episodes, but if I don‚Äôt go back to sleep I will try to in the next few days, and I typically won‚Äôt sleep until I make that attempt. 

I don‚Äôt really know why I wrote this, perhaps to see if anyone can relate, if anyone is real, to scream into the void, to put non-existent words to non-existent paper, I don‚Äôt know."
Relationship With Someone Who Also Dissociates,6,jf4szl,1,"My boyfriend and I have recently discovered that we both dissociate. He‚Äôs been doing it for most of his life while it‚Äôs somewhat new to me (at least at this level). I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has also been in a relationship like this? Tbh I‚Äôm relieved to feel like we can understand and hopefully support each other. That being said I‚Äôm curious of what I should look out for as potentially negative things that could come from this? Even if you haven‚Äôt had the same experience, any potential problems you could think of, I‚Äôd love to hear. I‚Äôm not even considering ending the relationship but I like to be prepared."
question for people who have gotten therapy help before and have dissociative amnesia,7,jf20eu,2,"Hey everyone! my name is Saizon I‚Äôm 27, married and trying to live as much of a normal millennial life as I can. I did have a traumatic childhood and just found out I have dissociative amnesia. I know that I‚Äôve had it for a while, but seeing a high school friend and hearing the stories he brought up as if they were new definitely brought back to my attention that I need to deal with this and stop avoiding it especially before I start having kids. (Other big signs are barely remembering my wedding, not remember raising my baby sister or any moments that I‚Äôve had with family members/friends). 

I‚Äôve reached out to Reddit because I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research, but I can‚Äôt find anywhere about people‚Äôs results from getting the different types of therapies out there done. 

After getting any kind of therapy done or using medicine, did you actually notice a difference with your memory? 
I don‚Äôt notice when I‚Äôm forgetting something until I get questioned or I question myself, did something like this change for you after getting help?"

Vent,4,jeupmn,2,"Just realized I have been dissociating since childhood. I remember feeling like being in a dream when I was in elementary school. And an intense episode of feeling everything‚Äôs not real in middle school. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs why I have very limited memories as well. All of my memories before highschool just feels like facts instead of memories. I remember places and snippets of scenes but I don‚Äôt really feel like they are MY memories. Not according to the scientific definition of episodic memories anyways. Not sure what to do with this information. My dissociation has slightly improved after being on adhd medications, i still feel out of it most of the time but it‚Äôs comparatively much better now."

How do you know you're dissociating?,5,jec505,2,"I've been extremely tired for almost three years now (I'm 18) and sometimes it gets worse for a couple of weeks/months, like the last couple of months. It often feels like my visual range is really small as if I'm only aware of what I'm directly looking at. Most of the time I feel like I'm far from reality, as if I could do anything without any consequences or repercussions. Finally, when my moods get bad, if I'm really sad for no reason or if I have a mental breakdown, everything feels really heavy and I'm not able to clearly see how people see me or how my life is going. Am I dissociating? I have no known mental health problem because I never felt like seeking professional help or getting diagnosed for anything, so I don't even know if I have anxiety, depression etc. What would you say is wrong from experience?"
Pretty sure i had my first episode,1,jekmus,0,About 2 weeks ago I got high and did not have a good time. I have been slipping in and out of the state for a few weeks now
for any scared Newcomers,2,je9he5,0,"Listen to me, this is for any new comers, I‚Äôve had this feeling of dissociation for awhile now, from the fact that I was abused physically and neglected as a child. This has been going on for only 3 months for me, but it by far is torture, it‚Äôs the worst and is only going to get worse if you let it, or you can stop being a sad depressive piece of shit like how I was for the first month and start your path to gettin back to normal, because the only thing keeping you from getting back to normal, IS YOU! This is a form of anxiety that just has gotten way to out of hand, try your hardest to control it, Ik you probably can‚Äôt, but try because that‚Äôs the only thing you can do, I wish you luck!"
Just realized how deep this actually goes,11,jdyf4g,13,"It's so crazy that the only thing connecting me to reality is my cognitive knowledge that this should be reality. All the other aspects of the human experience seems to be less real than a dream to me. It feels like I'm in a coma and even my senses are only understandable to me, but not ""feelable"". If I get out of this it will be quite a shock to actually feel again that this is and always was in fact reality. Sometimes I do things which have a quite a negative effect on my life or others, but I can't seem to stop and while others would regret these deeds afterwards, I just watch neutrally."
I'm scared I shouldn't be driving anymore.,1,jeb2td,5,"Please don't judge me for this. I know I need help.

I have a job and I need to keep driving to keep it. I work part time, flexible hours, and sometimes called in. The cabs are not reliable where I live, and the bus even less so.

But here's the problem - I dissociate while driving. Frequently I will get in my car, turn it on, and switch off in my brain. I drive on autopilot. (Tw!! - if it's related, I lost my virginity through rape in a car. I'm mentioning this because I think this is why I switch off in the car.)

I got in a couple fender benders when I was younger, all due to me dissociating while driving. I tried to do grounding techniques and only drive when necessary and avoid driving in bad weather if possible. Things got better for a few years and I drove with very little incident.

But then I got a job and I'm not stressed out at the job, but I got in an accident in July. 2 weeks later a bump in the parking lot. And just this afternoon, a very rainy fall day, I got in a fender bender and I have serious damage to the front end of my car.

If I didn't have the job I would give up driving. But I like this job and I want to keep it. I'm proud of the fact that I'm working again after a breakdown where I never thought I would work again. I'm getting off disability and my coworkers are nice and I feel useful. I don't want to be an r/neet again, but I might have to if I can't drive.

I don't think I'm a danger on the road? Maybe, I'm not sure. Nobody has been hurt, it's mainly just been bumps. The last 3 accidents, I'm off in my head and I'm not paying attention because I'm dissociated and I bump into the back of another car at a slow speed. Nobody has had to go to the hospital and actually most of their cars haven't been damaged at all. My car has taken the brunt of the damage.

Tbh I'm in a really stuck situation. I'm feeling lost and hopeless after this afternoon. I wish I could just be normal."
been dissociating for a bit,4,je0cc4,2,its scary reading the posts on here that say they‚Äôve been going on in dissociation for years. i‚Äôve only been severely dissociating for a month and a half and im scared???? i hate it so much and sometimes i feel like im better than i start thinking about how i used to be carefree and not have to constantly worry about if im here or not. im so jealous of my past self when i just had depression or anxiety this is so scary

Am I Dissociating?,10,jdlmj9,3,"I've been feeling very off lately. Is it dissociation? I've been trying to find the best way to describe it, and I guess I would say it feels like I'm on autopilot. I cant get out of my own head, I cant focus on anything, and I feel very distant from everyone and everything. It doesn't feel like I'm in my own body. When I try to observe my surroundings and be present in them, it feels as if I'm looking back on a memory. I don't control anything. It doesn't feel like things are actually happening to me, if that makes sense. I just feel cut off and I cant connect with people or engage in activities. I've been trying to help this feeling by doing things I don't normally do. Yesterday I made tea and sat outside, which I don't normally do. I think it helped, but when I woke up this morning I was back in that state of detachment. I'm not sure if this is dissociation or not, it's never happened to me before."
Question about visual symptoms,2,jdstn0,1,"I was dealing with severe panic disorder and intense dissociation for about 6 months. I am now 4 months into Zoloft and my anxiety is recovering very very well. Dissociation as well! Basically the only thing I am left with now is some weird visual symptoms and I am wondering if anyone else can relate? I get quite bad after-images, have quite a bit of sensitivity to light and quite a bit of sensitivity and visual snow in dark places. Anyone else been through this and does it get better or am I kinda stuck with it? It definitely is worse at some times than other."
is this dissociation?,2,jdovi6,0,for the past month i started having focusing and memory problems and kinda distancing myself from reality by watching movies /streams / other peoples lives. i feel like im too scared to actually live irl and constantly need something to distract myself.. i kinda dont think anything about my irl and create a fake reality involving youtube if that makes sense? also i feel like im out of it all the time

Question,7,jd1ysd,5,I had a question for those who tend to dissociate: do you a lot of the time have to talk to yourself to keep yourself from dissociating again? I was in a dissociated state for 12 years and feel like I have to keep doing that to stay in the present and not start doing that again. I had a dissociative split and was in a dissociated self-state for waaaaayyy too long and got way too used to the nothingness state. Thanks guys.

My thoughts everyday,1,jcwao8,2,"This is a comment I posted on a YouTube video about dissociation but I wanted to share it here as well.... It sucks dealing with this in your head because my mind keeps telling me that this is all made up and that even when I try to get help that's made up as well and not really there so like I could of made this whole video up. Part of me knows that's not true but like whys the other part push me to believe that all day then? I constantly dissociate and have the worst exestential ocd you can imagine. Sometimes I feel like im literally nothing at all, not even happening in my own head so like what even am I and what's going on what did i Create? What do I do? Do I listen to these ""words"" or whatever I'm saying to myself? Is history real am I actually not alone and there's been a life and world before me? I couldn't have created this right? But like nothing can convince me other wise when I feel like this and it's the scariest thing ever and I don't wanna kill myself because what if I don't even go anywhere I'm still stuck dealing with it? Im not suicidal I'm just lost. Sometimes I wonder if this language or whatever these  "" words"" I'm using even make sense to myself. Whys my brain so powerful and it controls me. But I am my brain so who the fuck is asking this to myself?"
idk what‚Äôs going on,4,jcoz8b,4,"I can‚Äôt remember things, I‚Äôm not here, I can‚Äôt do anything right, I can‚Äôt feel anything for too long, I‚Äôm far away and I don‚Äôt want to be. everyone feels it, everyone tells me.

Why I personally feel like my consciousness of thoughts and the way others perceive me are disconnected,5,jcltv9,0,Does this happen to anybody could someone please explain to me what I constantly feel on a daily basis a lot of people perceive me as a weirdo but The complexity of my thoughts and personality can‚Äôt be explained through words and ive realized that mabye this is why I‚Äôm dissociated from myself and other people and can‚Äôt be the person I want to be and be social and have a problem communicating because words are created with my voice box which is apart of my body and my words are perceived by other people and heard by other people in reality and that is what is perceived by other people and my consciousness is what actually holds my actual thoughts and this is why I feel dissociated because the overwhelming feeling of realizing that nobody will ever be able to realize who I truly am through the English language is what makes me dissociated
Dissociation & a struggle to be present or do anything but dissociate 24/7,7,jcesf6,5,"So I‚Äôm diagnosed with a dissociative disorder. At first it was just depersonalization & derealization, which is bad enough. But It‚Äôs gotten progressively worse since then & it‚Äôs probably more of a fugue now or even progressing into DID. I have a long history of complex childhood trauma, & I guess I‚Äôm stuck in this freeze state pretty badly. So my question is where do I start. I feel so lost and I really struggle with being mindful for even a few seconds, like extremely resistant, especially due to all the traumatic feelings under the surface. I know it‚Äôs necessary though if I ever want to recover. Besides the mindfulness what else can I do to go the other direction instead of it getting worse (don‚Äôt know if it can get much worse than this). I appreciate any input, thx in advance."

Is This My New Forever?,1,jcmyeg,1,"Last week I had an awful panic attack, which led to the worst dissociation episode. I was dissociating so bad that I would blink and every time I opened my eyes time would skip. It was like I was blacking out over and over. I started tasting metal. I couldn‚Äôt stop shaking. I couldn‚Äôt physically feel anything (but that happens nearly every time I dissociate). I ended up leaving work in a hurry. I got home, called my mom (she‚Äôs my rock) and begged her to come home from work. I‚Äôm 23.... I shouldn‚Äôt have to beg my momma to leave her job, but I was terrified. I had no idea what to do. I don‚Äôt even remember the drive home. I blinked and I was on the couch with my mom next to me.

Ever since that day I‚Äôve been living in a constant dissociation state. I am left to question if this is real or not. I hate labeling it, but it‚Äôs almost like I have PTSD of this panic attack: That‚Äôs how horrifying it was. I‚Äôm in constant fear of having another one, which makes me so on-edge that I‚Äôm never feeling like my true self. I‚Äôm going on vacation with the in-laws next week and I‚Äôm terrified. I can‚Äôt be in the car 3 minutes without freaking out. I don‚Äôt know what happened in the car that day, but I get so scared being in the car. Actually, I‚Äôm scared, period. My mind is constantly racing around my panic attacks. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm going to call my psychiatrist on Monday, so that will hopefully calm my anxiety, but that won‚Äôt stop me from dissociating, it‚Äôll just hopefully make my panic attacks happen less...

Also, I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with any dissociative disorder, but I‚Äôve been having spell like this, almost daily, since I was 13.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am scared to go into work, scared to drive, scared to be anywhere that‚Äôs not my bed... I‚Äôm even scared of sitting in the living room. 

This is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me. I am so lost.

Is this my new normal? If so.... I absolutely hate it."
Dissociating on nicotine?,2,jciqka,1,"I vape occasionally and though I hate doing it habitually, it is really really helpful in relieving stress at times, and can be really helpful in certain social situations. I enjoy it half the time, it used to make me pleasurably dissociate. But now it doesn‚Äôt seem to hit the same, it tends to just make me sick. I took a break and that made it hit harder, but made me feel more sick. It also gives me that dissociated feeling like i‚Äôm slightly in front of my body, or i‚Äôm feeling everything slightly offset to my body. It also makes it extremely hard to get things done since I can‚Äôt really comprehend myself doing anything. Do I have to just quit? Is there any way to relieve the nausea?"
Can you tell me what dissociation feels like to you?,4,jc9upg,6,"I'm sure you guys get this question all the damn time so I apologize but I'm currently working on getting a psych assessment and I feel like knowing if I'm dissociating is important for that. I'm pretty sure I dissociate during intimacy for totally unknown reasons. I find that I blank right out and then just come to and I'll be trying to make eye contact but my eyes are out of focus. 

However I don't get like that in any other situation. I do still space out a lot but I'm usually deep in thought. I'm wondering how else dissociation can present itself. Can you dissociate and be thinking still? Does everyone who dissociates feel kinda the same way while doing it? Help please"

how is any of this real? like... is life real? loll i cant even feel emotions or anything. i just feel so cold. its so cold in this room. i am safe rn but i keep hearing stuff and i get scared by little things. for example, if i hear a cupboard close? i get an anxiety attack. i think im scared of the dark now too..."
Dissociation after car wreck??,3,jbu6lj,1,It‚Äôs taken me a few months to figure out what‚Äôs going on but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs dissociation. I will suddenly feel like I‚Äôm not in my body. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt see my feet moving but I don‚Äôt feel myself moving them. I can even literally pinch myself and barely feel it. I have a hard time bringing myself back. What‚Äôs crazy is most of the time no one can tell. I‚Äôll be at work (retail) and be checking customers out like a fully functioning human but in my mind I‚Äôm screaming that I can‚Äôt feel anything. It has sent me into panic attacks because I start to feel like I must be really sick or something?? The only thing I can think of that could have started it all is a car wreck I had in June. I wasn‚Äôt critically injured or anything but I was trapped inside my car for about 20 minutes while the car was laying on its side. Idk. I just learned about dissociation recently and found this group today so I‚Äôm not even sure if I have a question I‚Äôm just trying to get through the day.
"Forgetting, then finally remembering again. My experience",34,jb8vd2,4,"So I didnt realise it fully at the time, but for the past year and a half I had essentially forgotten almost anything emotionally significant that had happened to me before that point.

 I was aware I had forgotten and it distressed me to a point because I felt separate from myself and didnt understand why I am like I am, it was confusing and distressing. Like I didnt know myself at all. But apparently I didnt put much effort at all into trying to remember which looking back is a bit odd sinse that was what was distressing me.

I could recall events mostly, like I knew certain things had happened. But it was like I was recalling a story someone else had told me. I had no emotional awareness of those events, things that hurt me deeply at the time, when recalling, didnt even slightly phase me. Again, bit weird when I think about it but at the time I legitimately didnt notice. 

I was struggling with how forgetting made me feel. I felt conflicted, I felt separate from myself, I felt angry at myself because I thought I had made up the fact I'd ever had problems. I wasnt sure if I ever had genuinely struggled, but it felt like I had. I felt like I was lying to myself and to others but I didnt know what I was supposedly lying about. But weirdly I never tried to remember, and if i did i was just completely unable to recall any of the emotions.

Then yesterday, after about a year  and a half of blissful ignorance, it was like someone opened the flood gates. All of it came back, I never had a specific significant trauma, just significant prolonged pain. I sat there in shock, both at how far I'd come in that time and at how id ever managed to forget the defining features of my life up until that point. I honestly was in shock, for about 4/5 hours after it all came back I just sat there and remembered, gobsmacked. It was jarring and overwhelming, my ears were ringing and I felt like I'd pass out. What I remembered wasnt objectively that bad , but to remember how I had felt for years, remembering the emotions and the pain, truely remembering... was surreal.

But i wasnt sad or upset. I was sad to remember my suffering, but me now wasnt sad. It was liberating, almost felt euphoric. Like it all made sense again, I knew who I was again. And for the first time in years, I dont hate who I discovered I was. I was proud of how far I'd come, proud of my progress, proud if my strength and resilience. I wasnt having an identity crisis anymore (like I'd been having sinse I apparently just fucking forget everything one day). I wasnt conflicted, I recognised myself again. I'm me again. And who I am does include the bad, but only as context, not as a constant. Both the pain I felt before forgetting, and the fear that forgetting brought me were each torture in their own right. But as I remembered, it felt like seeig it in hindsight. Like it was all in the past now. 

I was understandably confused as fuck and a bit concerned that before yesterday I had no real memory of almost anything past primary school. I looked it up and it seemed to fit the category of dissociation. But I'm not too familiar with the concept so I might be wrong, but it seems to be the best definition I can find right now. I think after a certain point It just got too much for me, I dont think anything triggered it really. Just a long time of a lot of things and it got too much. 

I'm kind of greatful though. It's like I emotionally checked out and went into autopilot for a while. But in that time I chnaged my life so much, chnaged it for the better. Things that held me back and overwhelmed me for years just one day I forgot about and took that clarity to sort my shit out. I've managed so much in that time that I'm so proud of myself for, in that time of having forgotten I truely turned my life around and had fun doing it. 

The only truely difficult thing I was able to acknowledge in that time was how lost I felt. Despite turning my life around and achieving a lot of amazing things, I knew something wasnt right. It felt like the person doing things and the person judging those things being done were separate somehow. The person I saw in the mirror I didnt recognise. Not metaphorically but literally. It was a scary feeling. I felt like a liar and an imposter, not knowing what the lie I was telling was, or what the truth I was hiding was either. I felt like I'd lost myself, but i didnt know what I'd lost. I didnt know who i was or why. But despite that, superficially i thrived. 

Looking at the big picture now I feel greatful and sad. Sad that the person that felt that pain was me, it's always been me. But im so greatful that one day I just unknowingly separated myself from that and bettered my life permanently and effectively. Both stages came with their challenges sure, but somehow I dragged myself out of my self dug grave. I feel at peace now, I can benefit from the changes I have made comfortably and I can know and love myself for the first time. I know myself again, and i love myself. I'm so proud of myself. Forgetting was fun but it was blissful ignorance. Now it's just blissful. Knowing myself again, feeling in control and whole.

 I didnt know this kind of thing existed, forgetting, let alone how someone could be so complacent and unaware of it. I knew I'd forgotten but that's about all I knew and I rarely addressed it. I think it makes sense though, like the brain I've hated myself for having... protected me. I couldnt have done it all knowingly, I was in too deep. So I just... forgot. And now that I'm at a place in life i never thought I could EVER get to, a place im beyond proud and a bit astounded to be, my brain let me remember. I'm at a place where the pain is long enough ago and different enough that it feels unfamiliar for the first time in my life. I can handle it now, I can cope on my own this time. I can remember and thrive, not just one or the other. 

That's my story. I'm sorry it was so long and I highly doubt anyone cares or is reading this far but i dont really care. This has been really therapeutic to get out and it feels like a conclusion. Like that chapters over now. I'm not sure if this is right for this sub, I'm not well versed in dissociation and what happened to me might not even be that, but it's the best fit I can find. I'd love to talk or chat with anyone who has experienced this phenomenon, or someone that might be knowledgeable on how and why this happens. It's new and confusing to me and It feels a bit surreal to know it all happened, it sounds mental because it is but i jsut never realised I guess. So yeah thanks for reading if you did. This has been my experience. My story and struggles are far from over, but I feel a peace and calm I've never felt before and for that I'll forever be greatful:)

Books about dissociation?,6,jb8jf5,2,"I'm trying to write a story loosely based on the experience of dissociation and was wondering if anyone knows of any fiction where the main character dissociates and/or doesn't experience time in a linear way.

Driving with dissociation,17,jb16x4,7,"Hey guys
I‚Äôm currently on my 10th driving lesson and my dissociation is preventing me from doing as well as I could do. Some days it‚Äôs worse than others.
It feels like my eyes glaze over and everything stops looking real. I desperately try to zone back in again, but sometimes I can‚Äôt, so it‚Äôs like my fleshy human suit is doing the driving for me & then I panic. I also have trouble retaining the information that my instructor tells me because of it.
I reckon music would help to ground me a bit more, but I‚Äôm not allowed it on during lessons, so I‚Äôd like to know if anyone has any other suggestions? I would really appreciate it, because it can be scary and frustrating 

Thank you <3"
How to ground yourself and get out of a dissociation when you're working?,3,jb3o4e,1,"I had a scary moment yesterday and start dissociating really badly in the middle of my shift at work. I was aware I was at my job, but I couldn't convince myself it was actually happening or I was actually there, it's hard to explain. I couldn't feel anything and I had extreme tunnel vision, but at the same time I still couldn't really see or process anything. I struggled to hear or understand others and have conversations, I could only get about 5 words out.  The only way I ended up grounding myself and getting out of it near the end of my shift was when my friend hugged me for like 20 seconds, rubbing/patting my back and his hand on my head, but it caused me to have a bit of sensory overload for a second since that's the first thing I felt the whole night. I got better from there. I don't know what triggered it, because it started at an anxiety attack, and then it turned into dissociation. What are some.ways you ground yourself while dissociating, because I genuinely could not get out of the episode?
TL;DR: what are some methods you use to ground yourself while dissociating and help you get out of the episode?"
Happened yesterday... Anyone has any idea what that was?,0,jb05d8,257,
Need help understanding my own experience,25,jaedix,11,"I had a really weird session with my therapist today. The time felt very distorted and on several occasions, I was heavily dissociated. I'm not very familiar with dissociation, but it seems to happen frequently. I feel like I'm not really there or like I'm watching myself or like time is paused (I guess would be my best way of describing some of what it feels like)

I also felt a weird experience. It's hard to explain, but I have a set of many (I think around 8-9) inner voices. One of the inner voices is incredibly sweet and acts like a caretaker to me in moments of stress or challenges. Well today during the session, after a period of dissociation, it was as if she took over and started doing the talking instead.

I feel like that doesn't make much sense - but yeah it was very strange. My memory of the session is patchy and I was having a lot of difficulty remembering things during the session. But my overall impression leaving was good. I'm just confused about what happened. 

Wondering if anyone can help explain my experience at all. Thank you if you can - sorry if this is the wrong place for this"
Are these symptoms of Dissociation?,4,jakg9f,1,"Hello! The other day I was going through my pictures on my phone and for the first time in my life I had a very weird feeling. I was looking at pictures of me yet I felt like I didn't know that person. I really couldn't identify with them. For  a few minutes it felt like I was so lost and I panicked a bit because of this unsure empty feeling I got. I really didn't even feel like I was in my body, that was the really shocking part.

Some days have passed and I still get that feeling from time to time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and it is very hard to connect that image with myself. The logical part of myself is saying ""Well you are looking in the mirror, it must be you"" but it still feels odd. Sometimes when I walk in the street I don't really feel like me, more like a hollow husk that I am trapped in.

Now that I am thinking about it while writing this, I always had moments where it was hard to place myself in the image in the mirror.  I had these for as long as I can remember . But they felt minor and now they are more common.

I have to add that I have some body image anxieties.

I am just posting this here because I want to know if what I am feeling is familiar to what people with dissociation are feeling. Of course I am not doing this as a diagnosis, I just want to have an idea of what is going with me. If not do you know anything my situation reminds you of?"
Is this dissociation?,3,jajde0,1,"So this has been pretty much happening since I was around the age of 12-13 and I always brushed it off up until recently when I friend suggested that I was dissociating. It's really difficult to describe but randomly I will very suddenly feel like all my surroundings are foreign to me. For instance, I'm walking towards my lecture hall and suddenly I'll feel like I've never been in the building before and have difficult remembering where my lecture room is. I know that I've had lecture in this particular building numerous times but suddenly I feel like it's really foreign to me. 

Fortunately muscle memory guides me to the room but otherwise it feels very new. Every time this happens it lasts like 5-20 minutes long. Can anyone relate?"
Therapist says I'm dissociating due to burnout @ work. Similar experiences??,1,jaqgih,6,"A little background: My job has been stressful since day 1. I started out doing two jobs with basically zero training. Things got better for a while after we hired someone else, but one of my other employees quit, so I'm back to doing two jobs during my busiest time of the year with no supervisory support or even empathy/encouragement. I also have a trauma history and GAD/illness anxiety.



Recently, I was explaining to my therapist how I felt at work and how I haven't felt myself lately. I wondered about burnout.

For example, when working on a task at work, I completely forget what I'm doing or what I'm working on and cannot get the thought to come back. I have to completely start the task over or just start a new task because I can't remember what I was trying to accomplish. 

Today, I had a pretty scary thing happen. I restarted my phone and I absolutely could not remember my passcode for about a half hour. I haven't changed it recently or anything either. My mom and partner try to normalize this by saying similar things have happened to them, but I'm beginning to thing there's something seriously wrong with me. I also had a headache during this episode, so my immediate thought was ""brain tumor.""

I have also been quite short with people and I say things that aren't like me. My personality is very bubbly/smiley, and due to my anxiety, I am not usually confrontational. I feel like I've been quite opposite, at times, more recently. I say things I regret, and I just hope no one holds the door for me so I don't have to force a smile (under my mask) and polite ""thank you.""

I also have these experiences where I picture myself drowning underwater, and I can't get to the surface. These usually happen when I'm driving home from work. I have also thought that maybe I want to get an illness so I have a chance to breathe. That is very odd for me, considering my illness anxiety. 

Has anyone dissociated due to work stress, and does my experience sound like burnout/dissociation?"
Who in here has overcome dissociation? Even if it was just for a finite time.,3,jah513,2,"What works for everyone? I've always felt like I was in a dream after a traumatic experience when i was 1 and 4 y/o. I dont remember anything about it and most of my childhood in general, but i was told by my mother that something happened those years and i was never the same after. How do I get out of this 'dream' state and start enjoying life again?"
i dont know what‚Äôs happening to me,21,ja4vb7,16,"for the past few weeks ive been stuck in a dissociation episode, a few weeks ago i started therapy for my trauma but haven‚Äôt made any major breakthroughs, havent relived THAT much? i feel like im constantly high but not in a good way. the kind of high that makes you feel like you‚Äôre doomed or you‚Äôre out of it. the days feel so slow and so long at the same time? my dreams and reality feel mixed up and i dont know whats wrong with me. im scared im dying or maybe im going insane. nothing feels real but at the same time it feels so heavy. earlier i tried grounding myself and it worked for a second before falling back into dissociation. how do i get out of this? im so scared. absolutely nothing feels real. the days are starting to blend together. i think abt last week and i dont remember what i did or how i felt or if that was a dream. is that normal?"
I feel lost in all this,2,jab30i,1,"Not sure how to format/word all this so sorry if I jump around a bit here. I'm in a chaotic spot in my life and it's forcing me to look at symptoms that I'm having just to be able to function properly and I'm trying to make sense of it all. I'm pretty sure it's dissociation, and I'm already diagnosed with cPtsd but it's all hard to talk about so I've never shared much of this outwards before, so I'm not really sure. Some of it feels like it's been there forever but I've just not noticed it for some reason or another, while other parts have simply just felt worse recently.


The first and most constant feeling- I feel like in any given moment I'm living knowing that by the end of the day I either won't remember what I've been doing or it won't feel like it really happened at all. Life is lived in a haze where I never feel fully present, I feel nothing towards anything I've been around for the past 2 hears at my current house and I have little memory of things before I lived here. In that fog I feel so unaware of my surroundings that my gf has to grab my arm to keep me from walking in front of someone, or my eyes will blur over while I'm playing a game (makes certain genres incredibly hard to play), and generally I have to keep my living environment very consistent and things I want to use in a place I can see them or else I'll just forget something exists entirely for days, weeks or months. 


Secondly, I feel like I have no solid sense of self. Something I'm interested in today could be something I don't care for tomorrow, and if I try to list out recent interests I feel like I have no emotional connection to anything I've been doing. And when interacting with others, I feel like I'm always talking through a mask, and I feel like I'm never really there and the one talking. Sometimes I want to say something and it feels like my body freezes up when it comes to sharing those words, and by the time  I could the moment has passed and I have to say something else to fit alongside the conversation. Other times I lose all awareness of what I'm saying, and when I catch myself I worry about if I was coherent or not, but when I've stopped to ask specifically for those moments I've been told that I'm well spoken even if I had no idea what I even said.


Lastly, lately I've been getting a sudden sensation of ""waking up"" even though I'm already awake, my energy tanks and moments even seconds before that sensation feel distant and dream-like when trying to orient myself to what I've been doing. I find after that sensation I feel like I act 'off' from what I consider normal for myself or that moment, and if I'm around people I worry that they'll notice, even if nobody's ever seemed to. The worry of others noticing usually fades, even if I feel the shift in behavior isn't, but it somewhat ties into a feeling that I get where I don't always feel like my actions are really my own.


Anyways, I had a rare moment where I was more able to describe my experiences so I took the opportunity to type some of them up, and I'd love to hear thoughts. Does any of this sound like dissociation? I plan to bring this all up in therapy at aome point but it's really hard to take that step when I've never really talked about any of this, and it's easy to invalidate myself when nobody's really noticed anything from me. I already don't feel like I went over what *actually* matters to me over all these issues but I've already edited this over about 4 times and cut out a bunch, so I'm just going to hope that what I have here is good enough, it's late and I'm tired."
Alternativs to mindfulness?? (self harm TW),1,jabgcm,2,"Tw for self harm

So I have complex PTSD and I'm fairly use to dissociating, and I've got to the point now where mild-moderate dissociative apisodes don't really bother me too much, I mostly get frustrated because I can feel that I'm not really myself or being as productive as I need to be.

Because of this, I've never looked much into how to stop dissociating. I used to see a therapist (not an option rn, like at all) and we realised pretty quickly that any kind of mindfulness makes me dissociate far more, and adds a good dose of panic into the mix. Instead we focused on other things and eventually the dissociation improved on its own to the point where it was having minimal impact on me, so I paid it very little attention.

Recently its gotten so much worse, I'm dissociating most of the time to the point where I can barely move, and I have a lot of periods of blank/missing memory. This on its own isn't ideal, but a few times after 'coming to' after these episodes I've found that I've scratched my arms or dug my nails into my skin. Not enough to do any real damage, but it's not a trend I'm keen to continue and definitely not one I want to get any worse.

I think basically what I'm saying is does anyone know any other ways to 'snap out of it' (ugh I hate that phrase) that don't involve mindfulness? (or therapy to address the cause since that isn't possible rn, and likely won't be for some time, if ever)

If you got to the end of this then thanks for reading üòÖ"
Dissociation or mania?,8,j9yuqv,3,"So I go through these ‚Äúphases‚Äù where I can‚Äôt really remember anything about my life/past and I have no emotions, like I‚Äôm on autopilot.

I didn‚Äôt know how dissociated I was until I finally felt grounded,112,j2jllx,4,"I‚Äôve been severely dissociative my entire life. The severity of the sexual, physical, emotional abuse during my childhood. I was so dissociated all the time always floating above my body i thought it was normal and everyone was like me. 

This past year I‚Äôve truly been forced to deal with my trauma and all of the chaos,harm, instability, and dysfunction in relationships it has caused me. I‚Äôve been in therapy for years but this year I‚Äôve been living off of my savings and just finally having the courage (or rather feeling like I have no other choice) to face- to dedicate most of my
time to the trauma that causes me to leave my body. 

After a year of many many daily sessions of body based somatic therapy, especially using Dr. Peter Levine‚Äôs somatic experiencing method and others like it, a lot of journaling, crying, reading, therapy sessions, meditating I finally have been able to have moments of grounding. It doesn‚Äôt take much to trigger me back into dissociation but up until this point in my life I didn‚Äôt even know you could be grounded. 

I never knew that most people always feel this way. It feels really good to be in my body sometimes. I just wanted to share this."

Everything looked with the exact proportions it should be.

"Thanks to therapy, I finally stopped dissociating all the time as a primary coping mechanism. I am mourning the loss of the years I don't remember.",105,m8l8l8,10,"I'm not well-educated on dissociating as a whole so please forgive me if I don't use the correct language to describe my experience. I'm eager to learn more. This is mainly a ramble but I'm really interested in talking to other people who've had a similar experience with dissociating.

I started dissociating about 10 years ago after an extreme trauma as a teen and... basically never stopped until 6 months ago.

I assume it's normal to live within a spectrum of dissociation because that was my entire adult life until recently. I had the severe ""stares at a wall for a week but it feels like 20 minutes"" after major triggers but for the most part I was functional in every way except emotional. I never felt my negative emotions. The few memories of therapy are being asked ""why are you crying, gryff? What do you feel right now?"" I'd honestly shrug and say ""I feel fine, I don't know why I'm crying."" I spent years experiencing the physiological actions of grief and trauma without ever connecting to it emotionally, and most of the time I wouldn't remember my session the next time I went in for therapy.

I spent 12 months in a residential treatment center for trauma disorders and I barely remember it. A whole year of my life that my brain never bothered hitting 'record' on.

I started seeing a new therapist after moving across the country a couple of years ago and she's the first person I remember using the word dissociating to describe what I was going through. We spent literal years working on it, most of which I don't remember but I know we must have because I don't do it much anymore. I haven't dissociated for longer than a day since October, which is huge for me. I was so out of touch with it that I didn't even *notice* I wasn't dissociating from big emotions anymore until she pointed it out to me.

I spent the last fucking decade thinking I have a bad memory, that I'm just naturally the most forgetful twenty-something on the planet, but the last 6 months have totally changed my view of myself. I remember shit now. I remember being upset, I can identify why I'm crying for the first time in a damn *decade*.

I'm starting to feel grief for all the years I don't remember. College, first jobs, first girlfriends. Deaths. I used to think I wasn't bothered by death, but now the grief of those losses is seeping into me for the first time. Most of them have been dead for years - I can finally feel the sadness and loss those people deserved. 

So many memories, at best, hidden in heavy fog. I'm so glad to be back in my body but I feel such immense grief for those lost years, along with all those heavy emotions my brain was keeping at bay. I was raped 3 years ago and really felt my grief around it for the first time last night. I've cried when talking about it before but yesterday was the first time I could identify *why*. I'm simultaneously grieving for all the shit I couldn't before, and also feeling grief for sleepwalking through my entire young adult life.

Electrical impulses in the brain firing, sure - but what makes that into a ‚Äúperson‚Äù? What makes them different from someone else? We‚Äôre all just like lumps of cells being guided around by some weird unexplainable ‚Äúthing‚Äù.

"Does anyone ever just think: wow, this *random, super normal object* really exists? That's crazy!",72,dabndg,16,"I don't know if this has anything to do with dissociation or not, but when I am dissociating, I often become amazed that things I am exposed to everyday exist. Like yesterday, my mom was sweeping the kitchen, and I just couldn't stop thinking about how amazing it was that brooms exist, and all because one person just happened to think of that idea one day. I do this with countless other objects all the time: phones, toilet brushes, tennis shoes, light bulbs, stereos, toasters, energy drinks, acid, etc. It's a very childlike yet lonely experience.

It's weird to acknowledge that other people are living in real life just like us,72,hg305u,9,"We always see people. We see people walking down the street, we see them going into stores, driving cars, and it's so normal obviously to see and acknowledge that they exist because they're just another part of our experiences on earth. However I've had a few times recently where I really think about it with another line of thinking where it's like , wow, this person is actually alive and doing something different than me. They're doing something right now that they're destined to do based on the things they did before this moment. They have had a whole life too and they're existing in the same time and space as me. What if I were them right now?

I do it with animals too. Sometimes when I see an animal in front of me and I look at it's face, or its eyes, I realize the same. Strangely mostly when its eyes shift around. It's like it reminds me this creature is ALIVE and experiencing, not just ""there"" or ""an animal"" or ""my cat"". This soul has just taken into another body. This could be a human in front of me, yet it isn't. All of this doesn't really phase me unless I'm in the right mood. If that makes sense.

I know it sounds straight out of I'm 14 and this is deep, and I worded it crappily but it gives me an existential crisis. Lol."

Sometimes Movies Feel More Real Than My Reality,69,jvyuwr,6,"ive (17F) had dissociation from a very young age due to childhood trauma. it feels like as time passes it‚Äôs just getting worse. I often lose myself in movies and shows and books just to feel alive. When i‚Äôm reading or watching films it feels real, it feels More real than reality. Then when i step out of that world, my life feels even more fake. At this point nothing feels real and everything looks as if someone turned the sharpness setting a little too high. Watching series after series and reading books are the only thing keeping me sane at this point, they make me feel alive, but i‚Äôm so scared of wasting my life away. time passes and passes and i still feel the same, i still feel wrong. Do you guys feel that way? do movies and books often feel more real than reality? I‚Äôm scared and wish this feeling would go away. I can‚Äôt even remember what it felt like to be normal."
I can't get over how bizarre it is that anything at all exists. It's freaking me out,67,i5rclf,11,"I wish I could entertain this thought without feeling like it's coming down on me like a guillotine.

It just doesn't seem real. Dissociation, derealization or not. It's like I keep expecting to see the world to be just shorn apart around me at any moment. As if the fakeness of this world will give way to whatever/wherever my consciousness actually is. In objective reality. Because this doesn't feel like it.

I think I'm going to lose my mind over this s****

It actually kind of feels like reverse dissociation. Like I feel like I'm very real, but nothing around me does. It's like I feel as if I'm the only thing that really exists."

Anyone else just goes about their day and then they suddenly realize that they have no idea who they are?,67,l2f7el,10,"Last week I had a pretty big dissociative episode that lasted a couple of days. In fact, it was the episode that got my psychiatrist to add a note of it on my medical record, and the voices that came back with it may have helped to take it more seriously.

Anyway, now that I'm officially on the watch for any other dissociative experiences and keeping a record of them, I'm finding that it is helpful in certain situations. Good for giving it to medical professionals, and maybe just to find a group of people who can help me understand this relatively new concept.

Anyway, to the topic of this discussion.

I can't remember what exactly triggered it, but I know that I suddenly didn't feel like I was me. My name didn't mean anything to me anymore. It felt weird saying it. It was like it didn't belong to me. It was someone else's name, but it didn't really feel like my name. Looking at my reflection also was kind of weird, but not too terribly. My vision tends to drift away from my whole face and just focuses on my hair or maybe just the blood vessels in my eyes.

Anyway, I digress. I started to panic because I didn't know what was going on that made me unsure of who I was. My brain kept trying to give me a new name, but I kept rejecting it thinking that it was crazy that maybe I wasn't the person who owns this body and that I was just visiting, or that I didn't have a name to begin with and everyone just called me by the body's name.

This made me pretty insecure about myself. I've already got gaping holes in my memory, so I have no idea who I really am or what kind of person I am compared to back then. What if maybe I'm not the one who owns this body? What if I'm not who I thought I was, but a different person impersonating someone else. I was given this name and that's the only thing I knew, but for the first time in a while it didn't feel like mine.

It took me a few days, but now I'm back to normal and am no longer questioning my name or identity. Saying my name out loud didn't feel weird, and looking in the mirror wasn't so bad. I feel like I got through a difficult time, but made it out okay in the end. Granted, I still don't remember much of my past, but I'm glad the thing I do know of a certainty from it, my name, is intact. For the time being, anyway.

To note, I have not been formally diagnosed with any kind of dissociative disorder yet. My therapist says that it's just linked to anxiety, but my psychiatrist said that they were going to do further reading on dissociative disorders to see if any apply. I think. She didn't say that to me personally, but she wrote it down in my medical records, so we'll see what we find in the next few months.

This dissociative episode was noted in my log.

Thank you for reading."

"Mirrors feel like windows. Will stare for extended periods of time to figure out who's looking back. Don't recognize myself anymore. Have been dealing with this for a while, haven't told anyone. If anyone has any songs that have helped them please drop in comments. Who is ""I""",66,ec1g0o,46,
MRI came back - not what I expected,63,gxhqmh,23,"I've been experiencing strong dissociative symptoms for nine months since my first tonic clonic seizure out of the blue. Some days the dissociative symptoms are more bearable, but other days it felt incredibly physical - not psychological - like having to pause every few seconds walking my dogs so that I don't pass out. But they are always there.

Symptoms like visual distortions, panic/adrenaline, floaters and visual snow, hard time reading faces, Alice in Wonderland syndrome, vertigo, and feeling like I'm living in a staged video game or movie.

So many doctors told me it's stress or anxiety. Even Mayo clinic passed it off as psychosomatic a few years back (I've had the symptoms for a long time, but they have gotten much worse since the seizure). During my seizure I stopped breathing for almost four minutes and did some (probably reversible) brain damage. I figured maybe it was just PTSD or something from that event.

 I recently saw a neurologist who ordered an MRI. Yesterday I was diagnosed with a chiari malformation as well as a brain tumor on my pituitary gland. So basically - it *is* a physical issue that manifests as psychological. Two sperate physical brain problems, and either one in their own could cause these issues.

I have been put on medication to manage the symptoms while the doctors decide if the symptoms are worth surgery. I have also signed myself up for therapy because I'm living though an uncharted event in my life.

So I guess the moral of the story is that if you feel bad for a long time, and people tell you it's just stress, it may be true. Anxiety can cause a lot of issues that manifest as real physical problems. However, if you have any kind of anxiety or depression listed anywhere on your chart the doctors *will* use it as a cop out, so you need to push hard to be heard. But if you get a gut feeling that maybe it's not entirely psychological - it is definitely worth getting it looked at, because no amount on antidepressants, benzos, or therapy will cure chiari malformation and a brain tumor.

Thank you. I hope all are well."
Do you ever feel like you are not allowed to get involved?,66,fkkpxs,13,"The way I would describe it is the feeling of hijacking someone else‚Äôs life. Like you are not supposed to get involved or like you have to stay on the outside. Whenever you do begin to participate you get this feeling of wrongness or a sense of ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt for you, you‚Äôre not supposed to be doing this‚Äù. It feels like playing house almost, with varying levels of awareness. 

A good metaphor would be feeling like a time traveler who is temporarily replacing a member of someone's family and they all think the person belongs there and maybe you even think you do too, but something in you tells you that you don't. You can't interact with people too much because it feels so incredibly wrong and off-limits. It feels ""against the rules"". 

This feeling doesn't deter from actually getting involved, but it never feels like getting involved. It's like pretending to fit in. When people begin to show signs that you‚Äôve made some kind of impact on their life it gets even more confusing because you were just pretending to fit in. But somehow now events are happening due to some kind of action you've taken. At this point it feels impossible that anything is actually happening that involves you, but instead it feels like something is going on in a fantasy world where things happen to real people. 

The more impact, the more jarring, to the point where hearing something like ""I love you"" gives rise to an immediate sense of ""I'm not supposed to be here"". 

I've felt this on varying levels, sometimes not too noticeable and I can forget about it, other times it's overwhelming. I couldn't find anything about this feeling specifically online but it seemed related to dissociation so here seemed like a good place to see if anyone else has felt this."

Psychologist Told Me I Dissociate Constantly,64,idhtz7,8,"I see my psychologist for my autism and my trauma. He's helped me quite a bit, actually. But something he noticed and made sure to tell me is that I dissociate a lot during our video calls.

I've been reading more about dissociation and depersonalization and dissociative amnesia, etc. And honestly, it all really clicks with what I've been experiencing for a long time now.

I go into these daydream-like states...except...they're not pleasant at all. I'm either just...off in space thinking about my trauma or my brain just feels like a jumbled mess all the time. I also can't remember everything about my trauma, just core moments.

I just have bad memory in general. Both long term and short term. My partner actually likes to bring it up a lot. I have no control over it, though. I just don't remember most things. 

I feel like I've lost a sense of identity within myself. I feel like I don't know who I see in the mirror half the time. I just don't identify with who I see in my pictures. It feels like that person is apart from me. I don't even know who ""me"" is. Like I know about that person, but I don't know if I exist? If that makes sense?

So...yeah. I feel lost. I just feel lost."
Does anyone else feel like realizing you‚Äôre a living being can be overwhelming?,62,gdvnad,8,"This is what often triggers my dissociations. I make the realization that I am just a single person in a sea of people, which are on a rock floating around in a never ending space, held within one of many other galaxies and universes. I realize that my body is temporary and my health will one day plummet, that my body is made up of many living and dying cells and that the only reason I‚Äôm able to think and move in that moment in any way of my choosing is because of a single organ in my head, which too could technically die out at any moment with the wrong triggers. Yesterday i was standing in the mirror getting ready to wash my face and I realized I‚Äôll never be able to see my own face without reflective surfaces to recording equipment, which for some reason freaked me out. Then I thought about how my hands could go missing in an accident one day and my life would completely change, which lead to me dissociating and feeling like I wasn‚Äôt real, like my whole body was going to fall to the floor and I‚Äôd float out of it. 

I understand it‚Äôs overthinking and I‚Äôve worked really hard over the past six months to try to stop myself from letting those thoughts get into my head. However it can get very overwhelming at times to just be alive in the giant system of things."

Some of them are pretty creepy, but it‚Äôs clear that the people pretending to experience this don‚Äôt genuinely have to deal with it.

You ever get a feeling like other people aren't real?,62,csi6tu,22,"Not like *all* people, but just maybe 1 or 2 occasionally. Like they're an imposter, or were somehow retconned into your life and memories or something."
I feel like I 'woke up' today,62,btx3tl,2,"Occasionally, this will happen. I'll suddenly realize that the wind feels nice, I'll realize I'm listening to my favorite band and remember why it's my FAVORITE. I'll realize I've loved that band since before high school and feel a giddy kind of joy and awe that I've made it this far. 

I'll look around and really see, I'll see the sun and nature and feel an urge to be creative. Like a lock was opened in my brain and suddenly the shapes and colors I draw make sense, like I can now picture something in my mind and make it appear on paper, my colors now make sense and don't clash horribly.

I realize that I'm funny. That people notice me. That I'm dressed in a weird outfit that doesn't match, one I built before I wandered out the door out of comfort; a bracelet that feels nice and reminds me I exist, shoes that don't hurt but are worn to bits, mismatched socks that just happened to be clean.

I look in the mirror and I see a person. I see my body the way others see it, not just a blob, a mass of delusional flaws.

I can talk, but it's almost harder because now I'm AWARE. I realize how late in the year it already is. That there's new shows coming out, kids are going on summer break, there's new products to be tried and food is something that should be eaten more than just once a day in a daze.

I mourn a little because I know this won't last. I fear a little because I don't know if I would even want it to.

Is this real life?"

The State of Dissociation is where we spend our lives,58,i2h0j2,20,"We the citizens of Dissociation demand our independence.  

Well, I do anyway.

I want out.  I realize now that this is where I have spent the majority of my life.  It has robbed me of everything, and I want out.

So much of my life has been spent constantly
dissociating to avoid the constant abuse of domineering people.  I grew up with physical abuse, and then graduated to emotional abuse.

I must break out of this prison now.  No more.

Please don‚Äôt tell me I can snap a rubber band on my wrist and smell perfumes to fix all this.  It‚Äôs not that simple.

I took adderall and so far it has changed everything.,55,mb66vn,18,"Again, I only just took it for the first time an hour or so ago, but my intrusive thoughts are gone. My dissociation is gone.

Feeling like you can't move and speaking takes great effort?,57,iiv0b8,5,"I sometimes feel so dissociated that I am stuck wherever I am and like I can't move my body or speak for hours. My limbs felt so heavy, trying to move would take tremendous energy. Sometimes there is a sense of fear with moving too I think. I felt like I was on the verge of blacking out, idk. 

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you get out of it? Is this concerning or a normal level of dissociation?"
Not being dissociated is scarier than staying dissociated,58,fatbnd,5,"Dissociating is just this constant thing for me I guess. I didn't know that before this year. It's all very subconscious and body-rooted for me. Focusing on parts of my while (trying to) keep them perfectly relaxed has been a godsend since discovering it yesterday. 

First it's this pressure, like my skin is dancing. Then the muscle tenses out of defensive reflex (they never relax willingly). If I get it right, there's this flood of emotion and feelings, with tingles lingering for as long as I can keep that part of me from dissociating again. 

I guess the problem Im running into is just how overwhelming it feels. I'm trying it on my thigh right now and it's really just... a lot to feel. No memories returning, but just the feeling that's there is a lot to process. Because it feels good. Genuinely my thigh feels sensitive again; I can finally see how people would get turned on getting touched here. I can't overstate how insane that is to me (for most of my life, I didn't believe in my own humanity, and dissociation wrecked my chances for any positive sexual experiences before now). 

It's really overwhelming though. Part of me wants to go back to crying, since it's a lot of feelings out of the box. But also the feeling keeps causing more dissociation. I've had to bring the feeling back like 4 times now in the time I've been writing this.

I'm excited to finally be able to feel my body again, but I'm also really scared for myself. This whole situation makes me feel so vulnerable, and if I try shooting for intimacy again then it'll be a mess trying to explain to them what's going on in my head. I can't even explain to my best friend what dissociation is, much less a potential partner who doesn't know why calling it a 'date' scared the ever living hell out of me or why touching my body might make me stare at a wall for a while. Jus the idea of being vulnerable like that scares me, to the point that I think I scare off people who are genuinely interested in me. 

How do you guys manage the terror/emotional flood that comes from grounding? How do I manage the fear of being vulnerable without pushing people away by accident??"
Lack of Identity?,56,f8blfa,11,"I don't know if this is the best place to post this. I just feel that maybe people who also struggle with dissociation will be able to understand. I just found out that I struggle with dissociation, but I think I've been struggling with it for as long as I can remember. I just didn't know it wasn't normal.

Anyway, I want to talk a bit about identity, especially in the realm of LGBTQ+ things. So, please be respectful, and if you truly don't understand something, you can ask. Just don't be rude about it.

I don't know if this is dissociation or not. For a long time now I've identified as aromantic and asexual. So, I don't feel romantic attraction and I don't feel sexual attraction. For just over a year now, I've identified as agender, meaning I don't have a gender (he/him or they/them pronouns please). I've always felt this overwhelming lack of Identity, especially when it comes to gender identity.

Going back to my sexual orientation, that is the thing I'm most sure about. I am asexual, and I don't think it has anything to do with dissociation. However, when it comes to my romantic orientation, I feel like whenever I try to be romantic or people try to be romantic with me, I just feel like everything is fake. Like reality is just a cliche movie. I feel fake, like I'm acting. But I guess that's not really my biggest concern here.

My gender identity is what I really want to talk about. What if I've been so dissociated for so long, that I don't feel like I have a self anymore? Gender feels so fake to me. Can't I just be me? But who am I? These are questions I come back to often. For the past year I've been exploring my gender presentation. I've been wearing clothes that I actually like, going by pronouns I actually like, and going by a different name. I think I started to feel a bit grounded for once. I felt so good recently that I started taking hormones to make my body look more like what I wish it would look like.

I've only been on hormones for two weeks now, but for the past week, I've been completely dissociating. Nothing feels real. I'm so inside my head that everything outside of it doesn't feel like reality anymore, even though I know it is. It's like I'm watching a movie of myself while my mind narrates. Or like I'm playing a video game, controlling myself.

I used to feel like this all the time. It's been less so recently, but this latest episode has got me thinking, probably too much. There are all of these things that I don't feel: romantic attraction, sexual attraction, a gender identity. What if I don't feel them because I have dissociated for so long in the past? I have a really hard time understanding my emotions, and I have noticed that when I feel anything, I dissociate. I've been called a robot before, and sometimes I feel like one. I lack so many things that most people would say are things that make someone ""human."" What if I do have these things, but they are so far repressed that when they even slight try to come up, I dissociate? But what if I'm just thinking this because of all of the hate I have received from people saying you can't be human without these things?

I've been told that many trans* people dissociate because gender dysphoria can be pretty intense sometimes. Do I dissociate because of my dysphoria, or do I think I have dysphoria because I dissociate? I don't even know where to go with most of my rambling here, so I apologise if none of it makes sense. Maybe I'm just crazy. Anyway, any advice is welcome."

Anyone here also has moments where you snap out of it and have a huge breakdown/panic attack when reality hits?,55,i07vwl,8,"I‚Äôve been dissociating for years on and off, but sometimes i‚Äôll have these random moments that last maybe an hour where i suddenly get hit in the face with reality and get a huge panic attack and faint 99% of the time and sleep for a long ass time too from exhaustion. 

Its so weird but those moments feel really nice/good somehow. Its the only time i feel like im an actual person and not just some invisible ghost. I suddenly realize my family are also real people with feelings and their own ideas/thoughts, its really weird and kind of scary.

Oh and lastly, i also randomly remember weird things i said/did while dissociating lol. I do so much weird shit when dissociated and only realize days or weeks later wtf i did"
DAE dissociate while having sex?,55,fagsp0,12,"It happens to me sometimes. I'm in the act and suddenly I realize that I'm not longer here, but it can take a few minutes before I do. I feel like I'm watching myself by the inside. Also I no longer feel any sexual pleasure nor arousal.
When I realize I'm dissociating, I wonder if my partner can see it. I don't know if I suddenly stopped moaning etc. or if my body just kept doing it, mechanically.
Sometimes I barely remember how I got here.

When it happens, I usually let my partner finish it's thing. Then I'm quiet af and I'm sure I look weird af. And it's the beginning of a disassociating session. 

Maybe it's due to my sexual abuse PTSD. 

What do you think?
Does it ever happen to you? Share your experience below:)"
This is INSANE,53,ly4l2q,14,"I (20F) lived in a state of derealization for as long as I can remember. About five months ago, after a big and very weird road trip alone across the entire US, I started to come out of it. 

Everything feels SO REAL now. Space looks different, trees are beautiful and dimensional and familiar rooms feel like new spaces. Everything I saw used to seem two dimensional. I‚Äôm so cognizant now of other people‚Äôs separate life experiences... it‚Äôs hard to explain, but before, it was almost like people didn‚Äôt exist when they weren‚Äôt around me. Life was like a movie, there just wasn‚Äôt anything else to the story besides what the camera captured.

I can look in people‚Äôs eyes now. Empathy has a whole new meaning. I can communicate more effectively, advocate for myself and my needs, and be so much more authentic with others. 

I am also horrified. My childhood, my teenage years... I never felt the weight of so much of that. My first love, the joys of family, losses, accomplishments, mistakes. It‚Äôs horrifying how far away my brain put me.

I thought I would share this here in case anyone could relate or had similar stories, or in case this might help anyone. Because coming out of this is beautiful, but it‚Äôs also messy and very VERY scary. I simply can‚Äôt believe we all exist on this big beautiful and messed up world.

In the beginning of this journey through DR, it was just moments of clarity or presence. I could sense something was changing. But it took a lot of faith to believe this emergence actually might be happening and that I wasn‚Äôt just imagining it. And every day now, I feel more and more grounded, more and more present, and more terrifyingly alive in a continuous nature.



Much love to all of you in this community! Brains are whack, and I‚Äôm grateful to know through this community that I am not alone, even if I‚Äôm the only one piloting this particular brain."
Everything loses color and gets significantly darker when I feel like I‚Äôm being verbally attacked or critically examined,54,jum5e2,8,"Ever since I was younger I‚Äôd have a specific response to being reprimanded or criticized. An offhand remark doesn‚Äôt bother me but those moments where the person is locking eyes with me and either telling me my faults and wrong doings or talking about me and my character at length, I will start to lose my surroundings a bit. Kind of like tunnel vision but everything, including the person I‚Äôm looking at, will lose color and everything seems significantly darker. I can kind of control it too, I can‚Äôt turn it off but I can make the feeling intensify or lighten slightly when I focus on it. 

Does anyone know what type of dissociation this is or experience this?

I find it an interesting response and to add more detail, I have a difficult time managing appropriate eye contact in a normal context. When I‚Äôm at my best I don‚Äôt struggle too much that I feel it‚Äôs noticeable but I find eye contact to be intimidating as a rule. And when on the spot with no way to appropriately end the eye contact, I feel trapped."

Has anyone else ever cycled between dissociation and panic relatively rapidly? Kind of like a feedback loop?,51,jpazbk,12,"If so, how would you describe your experience? I recently had a session in therapy where we were covering some traumatic material, and I started getting agitated and experienced panic attack symptoms. And then I think the panicked feelings and feeling triggered got to be too much, which caused me to dissociate. Things started not seeming real and my therapist's face looked like it was melting, and I was getting tunnel vision which really freaked me out and sent me back into panic. It went on like this for a bit before I managed to calm down.   


Has anyone else experienced anything like this, or is this strange? Usually the dissociation is my 'primary' symptom (I spend most days dissociated to some degree) while the panic only happens when I'm startled, triggered, having a flashback etc. I've never felt such a mix of both before that recent session. Are you guys able to feel scared or freaked out while dissociated, or are you often too detached to feel any of that?"
Does your dissociation get in the way of your learning?,52,hwgyxv,8,"I always have such a hard time absorbing and processing information for University whether it's written or spoken because I'm always in this state of nonexistence.

Anyone else's mind just goes blank when asked by someone in real life what it's like?,53,habhii,6,Does anyone else's mind just go blank sometimes when someone in real life asks you what you've been experiencing?

DAE not know what they are saying as they are saying it?,52,jzbkg3,20,"I just want to know why. In my head I keep repeating, ‚Äúit‚Äôs because you‚Äôre crazy‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou just think you‚Äôre going crazy for the drama‚Äù but even those thoughts seem not-mine. They‚Äôre in English, my second language. I find that when I have thoughts in English, they‚Äôre about what I think I‚Äôm *supposed* to think, the right response, the predictable narrative outcome. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm not crazy. I think, ‚ÄúI must be making it up for attention‚Äù, but even that thought is in English, so its source isn‚Äôt truly me. English is such a fictional language and this goes beyond English. 

I‚Äôve tried to type so many posts only to backspace. In short, my biggest fear is that I will be found out. It‚Äôs like if your friend sitting next to you was playing an online competitive game, one you barely understand, and suddenly he hands you the controller and tells you to take over while he goes do some things. When I respond to my mother and I am in the middle of a sentence, the controller is passed to me suddenly and I stop in the middle of the sentence. I don‚Äôt know what thought I was saying or what our conversation is about. But I somehow utter the words that someone put in my mouth as though awkwardly turning the gears in a wind-up toy. I slur words or mix up syllables or sounds. Say the wrong word or sounds out of order. I am afraid that she will ask if something‚Äôs wrong and I will have no escape. She will know I‚Äôm not who I‚Äôm supposed to be. 

Sometimes, I‚Äôll replay a mind recording of the conversation I don‚Äôt remember choosing words for, and determine that my answers do in fact make sense despite everything. Other times I fear I came too close to the being found out part. 

Please. Does anyone else feel this. I‚Äôm so tired. My thoughts are everywhere and this is my fourth attempt at this post. Thank you

EDIT: I did not expect people to actually respond thoughtfully and now that I'm less scatterbrained I feel very grateful. Thank you again"

Does anyone feel as though dissociative disorders allow us to access the subconscious mind to a greater extent?,53,f7v3nd,18,"I have been suffering from dissociation for years and I believe I am nearing the end of this quite harrowing episode. I think my mind intentionally subjected me to dissociation to uncover the source of my anxieties and to process unresolved trauma. My mother died when I was a five year old boy - I never truly grasped the concept of her death, the meaning of it, and the idea of never seeing her again. Since embarking on this meandering journey of derealisation, depersonalisation, and its accompanying suicidal thoughts, I have found myself in the midst of my subconscious mind. Dissociation, in my opinion, is a gateway to that hidden underworld of our psyche, I have experienced memories from the past in the present day - my subconscious has seeped into my conscious mind. This might be difficult to comprehend, but I have felt emotions and have assumed the state of mind I had at different stages of my life whilst going through this episode. During my mothers passing I felt a certain way, fast forward 16 years, and I re-experienced the event as if it had happened yesterday, as well as the corresponding emotions and lens of perception. I also stumbled across memories that I had repressed. 

Bottom line is, well, in my case, dissociation is a mechanism used to search for the part of the psyche that is consuming you. The ruinous and metaphorically corrupt and traumatised inner child that is wanting its peace. Again, this is in my case. Please, if you are going through this awful disorder or symptom of anxiety, undergo some introspection. Your mind could be intuitively telling you something, the answer could be right under your nose. 

I hope what I said was not complete nonsense. Take care all, it takes a certain quality to persevere through this.

Edit: I would like to add that dissociative disorders break you down into pieces as iterated in a response below, they also serve to magnify and almost dilute your perception of reality and reaction to it. This is a mechanism used to rebuild your mind from the foundation upwards. By exaggerating your responses to stimuli it makes you considerably aware of anxiety inducing facets of reality and what to avoid in the future. Furthermore, it pushes you into the abyss of your subconscious mind and gives you access to memories that you might have unintentionally forgotten (repressed) and indeed memories that could have conditioned you into reacting a certain way to ‚Äòx‚Äô stimuli or ‚Äòy‚Äô - it offers an explanation so to speak. It unearths the unobservable when in a normal or non-dissociated state."
"""Emotional Dissociation""",52,bix1ck,2,"Has anyone felt emotional numbness in situations of high emotion?

Hyperrealization?,50,kqc6s9,12,"So I was watching The Eric Andre show, and when the Lizzo Bird Up bit came on, something about the movement gave me a very similar, but opposite feeling to derealization.

I‚Äôve had it happen at parties before, usually places with big lighting difference (bright spotlights contrasted with a completely dark house in a theater). 

The feeling is super odd, my brain gets sort of fuzzy, and it feels like I can see the frames moving by in the world like in a video game. Everything seems like it‚Äôs too real, and I snap back to having to do everything really manually.

It has a lot of similarity to the raw feeling of derealization, but the specifics seem to be the exact opposite. I don‚Äôt get it.

Does anyone else feel like they dissociate for the majority of the day?,50,fnqovw,5,"I feel like I don't remember the majority of the day and I just forget the smallest things.  I misplace items, forget where I am, and even dissociate while driving.  Now, many people dissociate while they are driving, but I'm not sure if my case is...""normal""?  I'll remember thinking of getting in my car, then suddenly be in it, then be at my destination.  I don't remember ANY of the drive and half of the time I don't remember why I left/where I even came from (sometimes I stay with my boyfriend's family because it is closer to the college I attend and other times I stay with my mother).

I also notice that I dissociate more when I'm stressed- it makes sense since I had a rough childhood (to put it lightly) but I find it difficult to get projects done for college because whenever I get overwhelmed I just...black out?  I don't know how else to describe it.  

There are times I can't speak, move my body, or even blink.

Other times I feel like I'm not in my body and I'm looking at myself in a different perspective.

And sometimes I just don't remember dissociating at all but HOURS have passed.

I find it more annoying than anything considering I can't focus on important things.

I'll be looking at my partner's face like the concept of me being in a relationship with that person isn't real even though I know it is.

I snap out of these episodes in less than a minute and they're the only dissociation I experience somewhat regularly."
Finally coming out of disassociation and numbness after 6 years.,49,fxr4om,6,"I‚Äôm so happy to write this post. I hope it gives someone hope. I have a past history of trauma that I‚Äôve experienced from a child up until I moved out of my parents house last year. I‚Äôm 22 now, and disassociating and numbness began when I was around 15/16. The episodes would seemingly last for months upon end, and occasionally I would come back down to earth. Nothing could grab my attention for long. It felt as though I HAD to disassociate, and I guess I did. It was a coping mechanism that I HAD to use in order to stay alive. At the time, I hated it, but would I rather experience the tormenting fear of abandonment, my mums narcissistic behaviour and alcoholism or numbness and disassociation? It wasn‚Äôt what I wanted but looking back it was how I survived. And I‚Äôm finally grateful for that. I used to just beg the universe to let me feel an emotion, to just let me care about something. And now I do. I care for the inner child within me that fears being abandoned and I soothe her because she deserves unconditional love and respect that she didn‚Äôt get (I‚Äôm crying, hello emotions). I‚Äôm going to defend her fearlessly like shes my own child."
D√©j√†-vu when dissociating,51,d8diet,12,"Does anyone just get a random strong sense of d√©j√† vu and dissociate? Idk if i'm creating fake links to the past because in the moment i'm so sure i've either predicted this moment in the past, dreamed it, thought of it possibly happening or experienced it before. It also doesn't help that occasionally I'll see or hear something and freeze and tell myself ""that is important!"" then later it will come up randomly and i'll freak out. Can't tell if i'm just getting in my head or if i'm actually delusional."
I think I am almost constantly dissociated?,48,l76wqi,13,"I tried to think about the last time I felt real and normal. I can remember multiple times in the last few years where I felt like I ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù suddenly and the world was real again. It would last between a few hours to a couple weeks. Colors looked brighter, I could think clearly, I could really feel my body. I thought those times were weird, and how I feel now is normal. But I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs the other way around? Now I feel painfully fake and disconnected from myself and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it. But it‚Äôs okay, cause I‚Äôll probably just forget about this soon."
Do you treat yourself harshly?,49,hu5scq,6,"I realized I'm completely stone-cold harsh on myself. Trying to always push myself even when it seems like torture. I have zero self-compassion, and zero care towards myself. I also notice myself ignoring the discomfort, along with probably all my emotional bad state, and try to be productive. Meaning I completely expect to be able to read books and be productive even when feeling depressed. I disregard how I feel automatically, or possibly habitually. I can tell I'm doing it somehow, but it's a very subtle background sense of knowing.

&#x200B;

Could this be causing dissociation?  My two biggest disconnect is that I have no emotional goggles, meaning I look at things way too objectively and efficiency centered. Second disconnect is in my thoughts. I can remember things when triggered by something else, or be able to produce witty responses if strong emotions trigger me, but it's like I can't make those memories or witty thoughts come to surface on it's own. There's a disconnect there, and my head feels empty since I can't reach to any knowledge on my own"
‚ÄúDissociation‚Äù becoming a trend?,48,dlsv44,30,"I‚Äôve had a dissociation disorder my whole life (child abuse but I obviously don‚Äôt remember any of it so it‚Äôs difficult to believe that it happened). Anyways, I‚Äôve noticed in the past couple years a lot of people. Like a fuck ton, have said they dissociate on a daily basis... I always thought dissociation is super rare.. I know in mental health there are periods of when a certain illness is .. not romanticized.. but.. idk maybe people have it more than they think they do.? When I find someone who says they dissociate a lot it‚Äôs a huge sigh of relief, because someone understands, but then I find out they mean dissociation as zoning out or just driving and not remembering.. but that‚Äôs normal. It makes me feel even more alone and crazy and I hate it."
Anyone else share the feeling like you only exist 50-60% instead of a full 100%?,48,csdpze,3,"Ever since I had DR it feels like my consciousness **literally** decreased by a good 40% minimum... I *actually* feel like 'I' exist *less.* Does anyone share that same feeling of having your consciousness dampened?

Not to mention the poor concentration and regularly losing my train of thought.... feels like I'm retarded."
Head in the clouds,51,cguz0z,1,
Does anyone dissociate over the tiniest things?,48,j75a1s,6,"A lot of the time stress and axiety triggers my dissociation. But also sometimes the tiniest bit of stress can make my brain jsut switch and it feels like I jsut entered a dizzy overwhelming dream so fast. For example something as little as seeing someone in public and the come say hi to me unexpectedly, it‚Äôs like when people catch me off guard or I‚Äôm not really expecting it, anyways that makes my brain switch so fast and dissociate really hard but jsut for a few minutes usually. Does anyone experience this ?"
Anyone have trouble reading?,45,egmwzk,14,"Dissociation caused by Anxiety and PTSD. 

(I'm not illiterate) 

I've always really struggled to read as it's an instant trigger for my Disassociation.  I recently bought a book that I really want to read, but it takes me an hour per page and I forget what Ive read anyway. 
It's super frustrating and I'd really like to know if anyone else experiences this, and knows a way to combat it and bring yourself back to reality?

Thanks I'm advance :)"
Addicted to escapism,48,m7x61w,10,"So, I'm addicted to the need too escape into a fictional world. Sometimes it's through movies and books but often times I don't even need that. I can just sit for hours and spend time in my own head. That's how I start my day, do during the day, in the evening and at night. 
People ask me, what I do in my free time and I say: ""nothing"" and literally mean it. I don't need to do anything else, then internally disepear in my own fantasy world.
If I don't do that, I become very irritated and stressed. It's my way to relief all the stress.

Lately I've been trying to break the habit. Because, as anyone can probably figure, if you only live your life throug fictional characters you don't have much of your own life. It's like and drug addiction. The highs are high.
I love and know the characters, their journey, their feelings. I feel every high they feel. If they win a war in the story, I feel like I've just won a war. If they lose someone dear to them, I feel like I lost someone dear to me. This escapism gave me some of the most heartwarming moments in my life. 
But the lows are low.
I can't focus in anything else, then my dream world. When I drive my car, am at work, during a conversation. I constantly zone into my fantasy world. I live my real world life, but I never feel, like I'm really there.

I know it's ruining my life, but it's so hard to let go. It's my safe space, that only I can control. But in reality I know, that I'm giving up my real life, for absolutely nothing.

Did anyone experience something similar? And does anyone have any advice, how to get free if this addiction?"
"A really helpful IMO article I found, entitled Dissociation: How People Cope with Trauma They Want to Forget https://brickelandassociates.com/dissociation-from-trauma/",46,kq2g46,2,
Can anyone relate? (Dissociation and talking),47,hqnc0o,12,"When I dissociate I hear my voice oddly, like it is behind some wall, like it is far away. Sometimes I've even felt like it was higher or lower than my normal voice (but it wasn't as common as first sensation). It annoys me, because I can't talk with someone without feeling this kind of echo... Is it a common feeling? Someone else feels like this?"
Exercise has made my dissociation so much worse.,45,fhzc42,43,"Lifting weights has send my soul and mind to another realm. I have never ever been this detached from my surroundings,myself and time. At the end of my workout I felt the insane dissociation creep up and I felt my mind even blanking out more. It has been over a week now and it has not gone back to baseline. I am thinking of suicide more. This was not a panic attack, I did not feel any anxiety or anything. This was a pure biological response from my body. I was training fasted for a few weeks on end. And just started the carnivore diet. But I have never ever responded like this to lifting weights. I don‚Äôt feel anything, everything happens in fragments, every second passes by and I forget the last second and so on. My vision changed even more, more 2d and no DEPTH object can be close of far away. Light sensitivity increaed even more, my cognition is shot, my ability to fantasize or imagine things are completely gone. I don‚Äôt feel anything outside the room I am in. My mind moves just an inch and not more. This happens out of my control. I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I have been dealing with dp/dr since I was 5 years old. So please don‚Äôt say it will go away because it does not. It has never been these bad in my entire life. Suicide is justified in my situation. I am in a vegative state."
Does anyone have moments where objects look very small and their distance is completely distorted?,44,m5z1ne,16,"It's happened to me a few times, mostly with houses. They end up shrinking and expanding in size both vertically and horizontally. And the distance between them and I seems to oscillate as well. Sometimes I almost feel like I could reach out and grab them as if they were miniatures.

Have any of you ever experienced this? Is this dissociation? Typically when I dissociate I have a more out-of-body kind of experience and I don't necessarily feel that way when this happens. Mostly nauseas if anything. I'm leaning more towards it being a hallucination."
"DAE feel like they can't form a single, coherent thought or meaning?",47,lriblz,3,"And thus can't heal or have any breakthroughs because their head is just a confused mush?   
I constantly loose my train of thought if I'm even able to come up with one in the first place.  
I know brain fog is a symtom of C-PTSD and I suspect that my inability to think clearly is caused by dissociation but unfortunately I can't seem to find any medical professional to give me a evaluation for it, at this point I'm just self-diagnosed with C-PTSD, DP/DR and general dissociation but it's just a wild guess. I don't know, sometimes I'm just scared that my brain is broken or that I have some serious disease going on. I remember a couple of years ago when I was still able to think clearly from time to time, it was amazing."
i feel like im high,44,l3oqop,7,"my disassociation gets so bad that i'll feel like i took some sort of drug, like when you smoke too much w\*eed but i'll be completely sober. i really dont know how to stop it, and it makes people accuse me of being high and it scary when they do. i dont know what to do. it seems to happen around 5pm, but yesterday it started happening at work too. 

it will feel like im kind of detached from myself, and i cant feel my body but i dont really ""float above"" it either, i have control over my actions for the most part but sometimes i dont if i get really upset. it seems liek the disassociation sometimes replaces anxiety attacks 

i wish people understood this for what it is instead of thinking its sjust spacing out"
what the fuck is wrong with me?,45,hw2xd7,3,sometimes i sit with people in some table and everyone is talking and i just zone out and feel like this exact scene has already happend before and nothing is real
I just want to see the world.,42,h8mx0c,3,"Nature, music, people, the sky, the mountains, life, is just so beautiful. Sometimes I just want to jump through this dissociation barrier I have and experience the world with full feeling. But I can‚Äôt. Here I am, outside, feeling like my whole mind is somewhere else. I just want to see this world."
Making memes after therapy helps,48,fh1a6j,2,
Do you ever get frustrated at not being able to feel empathy?,46,emd13r,3,"I like to think of myself as a caring person despite all my flaws but dissociation makes it such a Herculean challenge just to even put myself in a mental position to think of other people as genuine sentient actors with feelings, let alone to try and identify and help them. It hurts to see someone I love upset or crying and want to be able to comfort them but not know how."
does anyone else‚Äôs dissociation get in the way of everyday life? like even just talking to people you zone out and are a million miles away and have to forcefully bring yourself back to pay attention to anything that‚Äôs going on? it just feels like sometimes i miss a lot of things due to this,43,ddg322,3,"i can be doing the most basic of things and i zone out when anyone comes near me to ask about something else. or i can be doing something and just zone out completely at random it seems and totally forget what it is that i am doing. 

i also do tend to daydream a lot does anyone else do that or is it actually just dissociation?"
Does anyone feel like there‚Äôs no point doing anything?,42,lwvtty,3,"That title looks depressing, I don‚Äôt mean it in that way. What I mean is, that personally for me, my dissociation causes me to have very foggy memories, usually not knowing when something happened, if it‚Äôs a new event or old event, whether it actually happened at all, or just causes me straight up amnesia. What I‚Äôm saying is, I feel like there‚Äôs no point in going and doing memorable things, because I‚Äôm not going to remember them. I guess it reminds me to just ‚Äúlive in the moment‚Äù a little bit, but sometimes I would like to look back on my life‚Äôs accomplishments.
Thankfully, my way of coping with this is taking pictures of everything, I mean everything, so that even if I can‚Äôt fully remember what happened. I still have the footage with me, it helps a lot."
Sometimes I forget who and where I am,44,kxs3yh,15,"For example, I was watching TV with my dad. Out of nowhere I don't know who I am, where I am, how I got here (in the room), and who the other person is (dad). Nothing looks familiar and I don't know what I am. This lasts for about a minute, I don't panic or anything as I'm just trying to put things together in my head. 

Then it comes back all at once. 

Sometimes this happens when I look at myself in the mirror and I LITERALLY don't recognize who I'm looking at."
Why do people not ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù dissociation?,46,jid5ro,8,"Having a tough time wrapping my head around how it‚Äôs possible to define mental illness.

The mind can‚Äôt be measured, the DSM isn‚Äôt about neurological damage or physical pathology. 
If anxiety is real it‚Äôs an abstract sensation dependent on an individual‚Äôs interpretation of what COULD be something perceived totally differently in another‚Äôs mind.. how can one understand their own mind well enough to gauge what is occurring, whether bad or good? I  don‚Äôt understand what makes a feeling ‚Äúbad,‚Äù or why drugs treat what can‚Äôt be measured? 
I‚Äôm scared of the mental health field tbh 


Having a tough time. If dissociation isn‚Äôt real enough for people then what mental illness could possibly be? Sorry if this offends, I do not mean for that I just want meaningful discussion and to possibly be enlightened üí°"
emotional amnesia and dissociation,44,itxhki,15,"so i was doing some research recently and came across the term ""emotional amnesia"" which i found very interesting. basically, from what ive seen, it means you feel emotionally detached from your memories, like they aren't yours or youre watching someone else perform them. i came across the term in relation to switching with osdd and did, but i think i experience this all the time with all of my memories. i have trouble recalling memories if they arent prompted, they all feel really foggy and distorted, and i feel disconnected from them and like they arent really mine. 

could this be a symptom of some kind of dissociation? does anyone else experience this?"
Sometimes i forget what i look like,44,dq42u7,12,"Forgive me if this isnt a thing people who dissociate do, but i always forget what i look like, then hours later i will look in the mirror and think 'hmmmm that cant be me???'

Another think i do, that i dont know if is disassociation or not is, being on auto pilot then checking in and think 'im still alive?'


Does anyone else do this. Thanks for listening"
Forgetting how to interact,42,m1ndal,10,"Do you guys ever forget how to have a conversation or interact with people when you're going through dissociation? Whenever I go through this crap, I'm so damn awkward in conversations. My mind just goes blank and I have to try really hard to think of responses and I feel like everything I say sounds weird or doesn't make sense."
Don‚Äôt understand a thing,45,hlmcxo,8,"Does this happen to anyone? It‚Äôs like my brain doesn‚Äôt even work anymore, I can‚Äôt read my thoughts or emotions but somehow my body reacts to them without my knowledge. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a fog inside my brain between me and everything. I can‚Äôt concentrate enough to study, I am just so tired. I want to go back to my university, I can‚Äôt be around my family or this country because I get triggered by almost everything everyday and I am tired of being so triggered that my head hurts and feels like it‚Äôs gonna burst and I dissociate for months without realizing it most of the times and at the same time I don‚Äôt feel anything other than my horrible headache which have everyday.


I don‚Äôt remember my past or my present, it‚Äôs like I have amnesia and I wake up everyday with a very short summary of my life and I am just tired of living like this since years."
Anger,43,hgdyzy,10,"Does anyone else get quite angry at themselves and others because of dissociation.
I‚Äôve been pretty dissociated the whole of today and I just sat to watch a film with some of my family and it was just like every tiny thing they did agitated me so much, and I was fighting the urge to completely lash out. At the same time though I just wanted to cry? I don‚Äôt know"
Memories don't feel real,44,fl2rqz,5,"I don't have the best memory, usually my friends remember more about what i did a few years ago than me. But that ain't even the problem. The problem is i do remember most things, even though not detailed and very foggy but i don't feel like they happend to me. Also cant feel emotions related to the memory. This bothers me because for an example my therapist asks me about some memories where my brother is physically abusing me i cant remember shit (maybe 2 events in total) but i know it happend over a thousand times. Another confusing thing is that 2 weeks ago i was  suicidal and now i feel almost worryless and kinda joyful. What is wrong with me"
Has anyone been so numbed out from reality that they've questioned whether things are real?,43,d64obe,14,
DAE feel like their loved ones are strangers?,42,a6knhb,4,"Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm watching a movie of someone else‚Äôs life and I don‚Äôt know the characters. I know ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my best friend who I‚Äôve known since I was 11‚Äù yet I feel as if we‚Äôve never met. Or I look at my dog who I‚Äôve had since he was a puppy and it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know him at all. It‚Äôs a strange feeling, not sure I‚Äôm describing it properly. Everyone feels so foreign, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been bodysnatched and landed in someone else‚Äôs life. It‚Äôs very lonely and makes me feel so weird and insane. "

Just a ramble,42,jn9okv,9,
"I'm trapped in a loop of depression, anxiety and dissociation. What I thought would help me has left me feeling worse than ever.",46,jj6cg9,10,"My entire life I've felt dissociation/depersonalization and I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. When I was young I was extremely shy and anxious with no healthy way to cope. I feel dissociated all the time and that makes me even more depressed, being depressed all the time makes me constantly think about suicide, constantly thinking about suicide makes me anxious about what that entails and traps me even deeper in a disconnected state. The only person who has ever cared to take what I have to say seriously has told me I potentially use dissociation as a coping mechanism for moments of extreme anxiety.

I had hoped my whole life that if I got my act together and found someone to love that I would feel fulfilled enough to break the cycle, but now I can see that the cycle is independent of any outside force. No matter how perfect my life is on paper I have a unrelenting nagging in my head telling me I should just end my life. I think that if I could get a grip on reality my other problems would fall away. It's so hard to feel happy and satisfied when I know it's just a fleeting emotion I can't truly feel, everything just slips away and passes through my brain without ever feeling like its mine. 

I'm constantly reminded that only I can fix my own problems but I genuinely don't know if I can do it alone right now, I'm getting closer and closer and I feel like I'm going to have a breakdown or worse. I just need someone to rely on even for a moment but instead it just feels like no one is rooting for me, not even the people I would give anything to help."
i just spent an hour staring at a point on my wall unresponsively thinking about how my actions in this world will lead to the death of myself and perhaps others. apparently i was also listening to the spanish flea for 45 minutes. i didn‚Äôt hear it. was i dissociating?,42,jf0f9s,5,
Just realised not everyone dissociates,40,gzumsm,3,"Whenever I dissociate, people wave their hand in front of me to get my attention. I just realised that it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt have it and don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. That‚Äôs crazy I never realised that I just though everyone dissociates"
I dissociated during my sister's wedding.,41,fu9ovq,3,"I don't remember the ceremony itself. I remember blurs. It was a really hard time for me. My own life was falling apart and I felt like I couldn't tell anyone.

I just wanted the void to know.  I'm really sad I couldn't make it through the wedding.  It was so hard.

Thank you."
I did not know I was dissociating,46,dc0pih,6,"I am kind of mind blown to recognize it. I‚Äôve been doing it for decades. 

It looks like I switch to dissociation mode when presented with intense fear that I find hard to stay present with. It usually starts by me trying to distract myself by a video/movie or video game or a book. And then seemlessly I sink into this emtpy place where I feel nothing but a vague numbness, I don‚Äôt register my body and my thoughts barely register, it feels like there are multiple veils separating them from my focus, they are like pale shadows somewhere in the background. 
I thought it was a place of intense focus and ‚Äòcalm‚Äô. And it kind of is, I intensly focus on the chosen distraction to exclusion of everything. 
I am a year and a half in therapy now, I can‚Äôt believe I am just noticing and recognizing this now. 

I first noticed it in my therapist‚Äôs office when something unsafe would happen during body based therapy and I would notice my therapist‚Äôs words were coming to me with a delay, I could not focus on them. I could also not feel my self present in my body. I thought it was a bizarre and new thing.

Than during the last 5 days that I‚Äôve been sick in bed I noticed a pattern. At some point in the day I would get intensely afraid over something relatively minor (each day of something different - act of calling in sick, my boss‚Äôs reaction, what housemate thought about me, a mistake I made, something wrong I said...) and than for a while I would try to calm the fear / stay present with it using Pete Walker‚Äôs emotional flashback pdf. But the fear would keep returning and then I would start intensly craving a little bit of distraction from fear and would open youtube or a homescapes video game. Then time would start passsing very fast. 2-3 hours later I would notice that something was kinda off. I was not aware of my feelings and barely aware of my thoughts. 

It did not feel good. Just kinda numb. Blank.

That led me here. Mindfulness was mentioned. And than my mind thought of music. I turned on my music playlist and switched tracks until I got to one that I felt I could dance to (Rudimental: Not giving in). After the song finished I was back in my body and started sobbing. Numbness was blocking intense feeling of emotional pain.

I don‚Äôt know where this leads me but I feel being able to recognize it and know what it feels like is a first step."
another lil self portrait,39,kfz466,1,
Do you also have memory losses?,40,ic4yuy,14,"Hello everyone !
I just started to learn about dissociation and all, and realized that I was really affected by it. I'm still trying to understand my triggers and all, but there's one thing that I really noticed : I can't seem to think straight and remember things. I lose all my stuff because I forget where I put them, I forget the end of the stories I'm telling, I do multiple things at the same time because I feel like I can't totally focus on one thing. One of my friends told me it was probably linked with dissociation, but I wanted to know if other people felt like it? If you have that, did you find a way to cope and re-focus? 
Have a great day, take care!"
Can detachment from your memories be so big that you can't even think about your past?,41,i60jnw,6,
Do any of you feel your dissociation stems from an identity crisis?,39,enwp72,5,"I've always felt totally alienated from my family. I feel I have nothing in common with them and greatly resent my parents in a myriad of ways. Since I became a young adult, it's felt like I just exist in the world on my own, like some cosmic anomaly bouncing around. I've changed a lot in the past few years too, and that's really just intensified things, and makes me feel really alienated from friends. I'd explain it all to them if given the chance contextually, but how do you even explain this feeling? I just don't see myself as a person, or participant in the human experience."
Anyone else have trouble socializing?,43,cxv0rm,3,"Sometimes when I‚Äôm hanging out with friends I dissociate for no apparent reason. It feels like nothing around me is real, my vision gets staticky, and my mind gets foggy. I try so hard to continue engaging in conversation but it‚Äôs so hard when I feel like I‚Äôm not even there, and I think my friends notice it too and it makes me feel really bad about myself. Like why can‚Äôt I just interact like a normal person? It feels so lonely being in a room full of people and yet feeling so isolated and far away."
My Personal Library of Resources for Dissociation and Trauma.,43,cuy22x,4,"Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this subreddit was a thing? Since I do so love trauma  and dissociation education, I figured I‚Äôd share some of my resources with you fine people since I‚Äôm pleased as punch.

Does this also trigger your Dissociation?,42,asq7u3,8,Too much stimuli? It's been a while since I left my dorm and everything kind of overwhelmed my brain and I felt so spacey and out of it.
I feel like I'm constantly looking for dissociation symptoms vs actually having dissociation.,40,l5mu77,10,"If I don't think about dissociating then I'm good and it's like I never had it but if I have a random thought about dissociation then I start to actively look for symptoms of depersonalization/derealization. This then takes my focus off of what I'm doing and I start obsessing about it. My thoughts start getting scrambled(feel like I'm going crazy) but I can also think clearly if I wanted to. When I look in the mirror I don't feel a sense of detachment other than me obsessing over looking for the detachment feeling. When I look around everything looks real but I don't feel very present because of this obsession. I'm kind of a hypochondriac so whenever something happens I obsess about it until I find a solution, obviously with DPDR there is no ""solution"" per se so when it goes away I'm constantly thinking about it and don't really know if it comes back or if I'm just overthinking it. Does anyone else have this issue? Maybe this is OCD? I'm going to see a therapist because it's starting to get unbearable."
Is self harm linked with dissociation?,40,l38g36,16,My psychiatrist said that self harming is common among people that dissociate. How true do you think that is?
Derealization/depersonalization disorder is ruining my life,41,l0sjfg,16,"Hi. I would just like to vent or maybe seek some advice from people who are dealing with this because I'm going through a really rough patch in my mental health and I don't know if I can carry on like this.
I've been having pretty severe episodes of dpdr for the last 4-5 months following a really bad experience with cannabis edinles. It seems as from that time it just keeps getting worse and worse. I do get a few weeks where I barely have any symptoms to days where I cannot get out of bed.
I really want to talk about my symptoms, maybe someone can relate and reassure me because i feel so alone in this. These days I've been getting bouts of  extreme derealization and dissociation which leads me to have extreme panic attacks (I have a panic disorder). During them I completely lose my sense of self, can't even feel my body, everything and everyone feels flat and unreal. But the worst of it is always feeling like nothing really exists and never actually existed, including the world around me and myself. My memories feel fake, detached and I just keep having an intense fear that everything will just disappear or that I'm stuck feeling like this until the day I die. That's why I'm feeling so suicidal because the only escape from feeling like this is sleeping for hours on end during the day. I feel so alone in this. I don't know what to do, I am going to therapy, but everything feels so unreal that it becomes hard to tell that it's helping or not."
New Chat Room - The Crying Room,40,j69hws,33,"FYI. There is a new channel called ‚ÄúThe Crying Room‚Äù. This is for anyone to join and chat if you are actively dissociating or panicking and need some support or a sounding board from your peers. This is not a place to go if you are in crisis or feel suicidal. Go to the emergency room immediately if you feel such a way. 

I will try to be as active in the crying room as possible for anyone who needs support. I encourage everyone to add support though.  Please now reserve the general discussion room for well, general discussion only. Thanks!

THE LINK ISN'T WORKING RIGHT NOW SO JUST MESSAGE THE MODS AND I'LL ADD YOU!"
EMDR session,40,iy2lzz,12,"I started dissociating 24/7 nearly two years ago and started EMDR a couple weeks ago. 

Today, I felt like a little kid again and all the past emotions appeared. My therapist asked questions while I was in this state and it was so terrifying. It was taking me while to get back to the present and I was dreading the next few days because I knew it would mess me up but my therapist was able to bring me back by mentioning that I‚Äôll be getting my first paycheck soon. I instantly smiled at that and I feel so much better. I felt this childish joy that I hadn‚Äôt felt in years and it was amazing. My body still feels a bit shaky but it‚Äôs bearable. My first big accomplishment in therapy :)"
I disappear into TV shows,40,infyhv,9,I‚Äôm binge watching TV shows again. I feel like I disappear into them and lose myself.  I forget the world around me and then lose track of all time.
DAE Have Elaborate Arguments in Their Head,38,f5nczk,8,"I'm guessing this isn't just me, but I find that when I'm anxious about something and dissociating I'll go into these elaborate imagined arguments.  Like I'll just sit there and be zoned out and getting worked up over these arguments in my head.  Can anyone relate?"
Last month didn't even happen,41,e562v9,11,"Recently I've been so deep into dissociation (or depersonalization/derealization) that last month didn't even feel like it happened. It just feels like I watched a video of my month on a computer screen and only have small memories of what happened. I hate living like this, and am wondering if I'll be like this forever."
I live alternate lives rather than face my own,36,m6p2cv,5,"I‚Äôm a 24-year-old writer. I‚Äôm on disability due to my diagnoses, of which there are several. I have dissociative identity disorder, depersonalization and derealization disorder, all stemming from a combination of horrific bullying and my mother‚Äôs sudden death when I was 15, along with the subsequent abusive relationship that developed with my father because of her passing. 

What this means for my daily life is I am 100% dissociated from the moment I wake till I go to sleep. 

I do not work. I have in the past but find it impossible now. I don‚Äôt drive. 

To cope I have constructed fantasy simulations of my life in my mind. Lives where I‚Äôm a famous game developer, screenwriter, playwright, author, actor ‚Äî you name it. When I watch new films or tv shows, I immediately integrate them into a personal canon by pretending I‚Äôm the director/artist responsible for making it, and I‚Äôm showcasing my completed masterpiece to a group of adoring friends. When I read famous novels I pretend I‚Äôm the author. 

This alternate reality is the only space where I‚Äôm not panicked and frightened and depressed, because the reality is ‚Äî I‚Äôm not any of that. Not successful, not wealthy, deeply unhappy. From the viewpoint of wider society I‚Äôm probably just a welfare bum. Nobody notices me. My attempts to make a career, make friends, get into grad school ‚Äî all of those have failed. I‚Äôm invisible. So the fantasy world is the best place for me. 

Just wondering if anyone else does this. I‚Äôve done it since I was a child, and at times the fiction feels more real than reality."
Can't speak after dissociating,39,m0qmjy,10,"Had the worst bit of dissociation of my life where i couldnt recognize anything, couldn't think properly, couldn't move, couldn't talk, and didn't know if i was real. That all passed but i still cant speak, anybody have any idea why or any tips? Please help I'm scared"
What makes you feel more grounded/lessens the disscoiation,41,ldjk2r,18,For me it‚Äôs cooking idk why but I strongly suggest this. Anything simple even just baking cookies or making pasta idk it really helps me. :)) good luck on your journeys loves and let me know what helps you <33
Speaking on ‚Äúbehalf of‚Äù myself,37,khqvil,10,"Sometimes i‚Äôm in a situation where i have to give important information/answer questions with an important outcome and it feels like I‚Äôm detached from the information but i know i need to pass it along on behalf of myself. 

it happens sometimes in therapy when she asks me things about how i feel or what happened on such and such day that i was worried about and I feel like a middle man. 

I feel weird stopping and saying oh hey btw i‚Äôm dissociating right now and giving you the answers i think i would want to give?? 

y‚Äôall relate?"
Feels Like Brain Damage,38,jgcmov,6,"**the only reason I can articulate this paragraph is because I have ocd tendencies and can‚Äôt stop ruminating over my symptoms and researching them. I want to stop thinking about this but nothing successfully distracts me from it besides sleep. 

My brain is VOID of thoughts, ideas, words, consciousness. I literally CAN‚ÄôT THINK, process, reason, plan, create new ideas, think critically, have any sense of judgment or insight. Can‚Äôt wrap my brain around any complex thoughts anymore. Takes my brain so long to process reading books, watching TV, and listening to conversation. I forget things seconds after they occur, my memory is like a goldfish. I can barely maintain a conversation aside from responding with the most basic phrases because my verbal recall is terrible now.  I can‚Äôt write like I used to or make art. I feel like I lost my entire personality and sense of self. I‚Äôm emotionally numb. Light and sound sensitive. Music doesn‚Äôt make me feel alive anymore. I make stupid mistakes all the time. I‚Äôve been socially isolating because it takes so much energy to figure out how to respond to messages or conversations irl and I‚Äôm embarrassed because I probably sound stupid and boring. I‚Äôm training for a new job and barely can comprehend what‚Äôs going on- I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to keep this job. This condition has turned me into the opposite of who I used to be‚Äî intelligent, charismatic, highly creative, social, passionate, great critical thinking skills, unique, artistic. Now I‚Äôm diminished into a mindless robot who can barely take care of herself. Prior to all this I had finally found my calling and was just embarking on my passions and now those dreams have dissipated. I‚Äôm beyond depressed- this has taken everything from me that I‚Äôve ever cared about. My soul, mind, heart, and personality are gone. There‚Äôs a pressure in the front part of my skull that has been there for 4 months. No medical professional has alleviated these debilitating symptoms, which all started after quitting weed, experiencing extreme anxiety/panic, and going through a very stressful life event. I can‚Äôt stand this much longer, I‚Äôm stuck in purgatory like a sick joke. No one deserves this 

I might‚Äôve experienced a weed-induced psychosis this past year, and now I‚Äôm afraid that after quitting and going through severe stress I have all the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (cognitive decline, anhedonia/depression, and anxiety are key factors). Friends and family keep saying that I will recover, which I desperately want to believe, but if I do have the negative symptoms of schizo, it‚Äôs a degenerative disease and most psychiatrists don‚Äôt know how to treat negative symptoms. I just want to cry all the time and run away from this hell of an existence- I wish I could press a button on in my brain and turn ‚Äúme‚Äù on again. I‚Äôm scared, debilitated, and devastated, feel like I‚Äôm mentally disabled now, and don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do this. I was finally pursuing my dreams this year and then it all fell apart when I lost my brain capacity within weeks"
Vision issues caused from dissociation,39,j1mx18,16,"I have been dealing with dissociation for 2 months now, the only way I can describe my vision being off is it feels like I‚Äôm high 24/7, my ‚Äúdepth perception‚Äù is off and my vision is even a little blurry. How long is this going to last?! It‚Äôs driving me crazy. Can anyone tell me if my vision will start to go back to normal little by little or will I just wake up one day like nothing happened? I‚Äôve been experiencing this for what seems like such a long time, lately I‚Äôll go about my day not noticing it and then the next minute I realize ‚Äúsomething isn‚Äôt right‚Äù.."
"I started with this one, thanks for the support, means a lot.",39,i8xs6e,7,
Have y‚Äôall ever dissociated while driving?!,41,hvgadi,7,"I did for the first time yesterday. It was terrifying. I felt it starting and had a ‚ÄúAw damnit why‚Äù moment. It was like the mental part of me had moved to the back seat of my car and was watching the physical part of me driving. It almost felt like I had been drinking while I was driving. I felt like I had to split my brain in half and concentrate on the physical part of me while the mental part just watched me struggle

This shit is ridiculous."
Dissociating while happy,41,hpg13k,9,"I‚Äôve googled this and no answers and I see my therapist in like 2 weeks and I can‚Äôt wait for an answer to see her. I thought maybe you guys could help? I dissociate when I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm having a great time with people or just lying in bed with someone and it happens. I thought it was only supposed to happen when I was stressed, but I‚Äôm chill and it happens. Is it a bad thing? Is it that my brain is trying to protect me from feeling good bc I‚Äôm so used to bad shit happening so my mind is like ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got to protect her! Shit‚Äôs about to go down! Protect!‚Äù Idk. I‚Äôm just confused and worried. I was hoping you guys could help. Thanks so much."
Does anyone else dissociate when looking at old photos of themselves?,38,gmcxup,9,"Today is my birthday, and my family posted old photos of me on social media while celebrating. At first it was okay, I looked at them as most people do. Then I was thinking about what I felt at that time. The differences between now and then. It didnt feel real. I felt like the person I was looking at wasnt me. Like they could be existing at the same time as me right now, and I just know some information about them. I cant see a connection between then and now me. Sometimes it can be hard to look in the mirror because i dont feel like my body isnt me. I feel like me in old pictures isnt connected to either my mind or body. Im not sure. I just want to know if im alone in this."
functioning in public while disassociated is somewhat scary,38,gkngcg,9,since I disassociate and am derealized always I find that some times it‚Äôs harder to deal with.When I can already tell I‚Äôm feeling a bit more off usually at night for some reason it makes being in public or even car rides stressful I will feel like everything‚Äôs fake or that I‚Äôm losing my mind. weird things will happen sometimes or things will fall into place when I‚Äôm in these more intense depersonalized moments and my initial thought will be ‚Äúsee everything is fake‚Äù or ‚Äúsee you‚Äôre going fucking mad‚Äù. For example I‚Äôll think of a song earlier in the day then I‚Äôll be in a gas station and it will play or just little coincidences. My brain tells me that these are signs from the universe trying to tell me that nothing is real or those coincidences prove my brain is making up my life. does anyone else think crazy things like this
or is it just me???,42,ehntt3,4,
Who else kinda enjoys dissociating?,39,bgw6vy,15,"Like don't get me wrong there are times when it's really bad and it doesn't feel good at all, but sometimes it's kinda nice to just not feel like I exist, but I'm just observing my life happening. It's like a good TV show, I care about the main character but I'm not him. Maybe I just watch too much TV. My life is not a bad TV show, I'd like to keep watching it."
I fucked up. I was already gone before I realised it.,38,majfnx,19,"I just left everything. I took 4 outfits, way too many socks, a bunch of jumpers, 3 pairs of shoes, one can of deodorant, a book, my bible, my chargers, my phone, wallet and keys, my tablet, 2 pillows, a blanket, a pencil case with various stationary, a small notebook, my TTRPG Dice and Rolling Tray, whatever was in my car already, a laundry basket (holding all my clothes and stuff) and a leather satchel (holding everything else).

Why did I do that? I've left so many friends behind. My family were in a panic, I let them all down. There's still work to be done on my house. I left a bunch of stuff at my sisters place. I could barely talk to my mum on the phone Sunday morning. I've only told one friend I've even left. I was suppose to meet a bunch of my mates at the pub Saturday night. They were there for me. They were gonna have a open pit roast lunch next Saturday. How do I even tell them I'm gone.

I'm 500kms away. I only had a week until I left anyway. I'm lucky I already had a job lined up. I had 120 bucks, most of it got eaten on the drive down in fuel. An old bloke from church has put me up for a few days, and my mum is going to get me a hotel room for a little after that. I slept in my car the first night. 

I can't explain to them why I left. I don't even know how to face the ones I let down. I've never felt such shame before in my life. Even typing this feels surreal, like I'm just along for the ride. I'm switching between deep feelings of guilt and sorrow; and a detached view where my only thought is ""why does it matter, they only miss you now youre gone"".

My mum said I need to go to a hospital, but I don't know how a hospital is going to fix me, I'm not injured, I'm not even diagnosed. I can't afford food, let alone therapy. My rational brain says that thus we the right decision but made at the wrong time. My irrational brain has all the controls and I'm lucky I was able to get up for work this morning.

I'm sorry if this isn't the place, but I needed to put it somewhere to make it real and if anyone knows how I could confront the friends I left in the dark, that'd be a huge help."
"i had a ""dream"" that felt so real and now i feel like im dreaming and in the wrong reality",40,krzmou,15,"TLDR: as title states, i have had a dream that felt real, now i dont feel like this world is real. 

&#x200B;

ok hi im scared and feel weird. im sorry if this is jumbled or if it doesnt fit the sub. but i am suffering from bad derealization after this incident. also i apologize for how long it is, its about a dream so you know how that goes. 

&#x200B;

i had a dream today that felt like real life, sometimes i know im dreaming and i can wake myself up but this just felt like i was awake. my friends were there, until i walked out of the room and came back and they were gone. 2 people were there that i didnt know. i was like, ""oh i know what youre doing, youre going to kill me."" and the other guy said, ""oh youre so smart."" i felt dizzy and like a string or rope was being tied around my neck and i felt like i was dying. not in pain, but everything went black and i felt paralyzed (like in sleep paralysis where you feel heavy and want to move, but cant). and my only thought was, ""wow i am really dying this time, this is what death is. i wonder if there's an afterlife."" 

&#x200B;

then i ""woke up"" into another dream where i was sitting on my couch, and it turns out the ""dream"" i was having was just a video on my phone????? and i was like. weird i must have been really immersed and i got up to get dressed. but then i had the thought that it was a trick and the guy kept me alive instead and killed the other person there with us. so i knew i had to get addressed and leave. there were baby lizards on the floor (there were several baby lizards or geckos living in my house when i first moved in irl), that guided me a room in my house but no one was in there. i picked up a pair of pants that had a mouse in it and threw the mouse across the room because i got scared. then i just put the pants on as normal and went to open my door (mind you, this all felt completely real and like this was just my life). then i heard a voice say something along the lines of ""what are you doing?"" and it scared me so bad i woke up in real life this time and i swore i heard the voice irl. after that i cried and called my friend to ask her if i was in real life and she said yes, and laughed bc it happens to her (i knew she was the right one to call) and that made me feel better. 

&#x200B;

but after that i just felt weird and off all day and slept a lot (no more dreams like this). im up now and feel like there's always something behind me. i think the gist here is im mentally ill and im having really bad derealizastion in that im afraid im still in a fake reality and i feel detached. i there's also another whole problem that isnt directly related to this about my mom, but i wont talk about it here for length's sake. if you want to hear about it lmk. also if you finished this all, thank you so much i know how boring it can be to read people's dreams."
"it sucks when every day you consider if something is real or not , if it has consequences. sometimes i‚Äôll be driving and i think about what would happen if i crash, if it would even be real or even happen.",38,ixft2f,4,
Can dissociation be a coping mechanism for anxiety?,38,ia4uwh,13,"So I have a question: Can dissociation be a coping mechanism for anxiety? As well as could it be a coping mechanism for pain, specifically headaches or migraines that are the result of stress or anxiety? Or I am experiencing sings of brain fog?"
I'm dissociating 24/7 to the point I don't know if I'm dreaming or not,39,i3utln,11,"I have no idea how to ground myself, every time i try it doesnt work. I feel so disconnected from everything and everyone. Like everyone is on a different frequency or something. I feel so alone due to this."
I am disassociating further and further from the world,38,i1m4vy,1,"I look in the mirror and I don't understand what I see. Is that really me? 

I am passing through life. I don't feel anything. Everything goes through me. Numb numb numb 

Can't study, can't write

I did cry today which felt good but I need to do stuff

Tomorrow I will go to the library and try to do something with my life üíúplease let me go to the library."
I feel like a video game character,38,hj1kdm,4,"I'm dissociating worse right now than I have in a long time, I can't figure out why or what triggered it, but wow it's bad.

I can't stop feeling like I'm in a first person video game and my body is just a character I'm controlling. I don't even wanna look in a mirror cause I don't wanna see my face, I feel like it would be too shocking. My head is completely empty, I can't feel anything mentally or physically even. I'm just stuck in a video game that looks like my life and none of it is actually real. I hate this."
Have experienced severe dissociation since early childhood and have so many gaps in my memory.,41,hcldj9,3,"I feel like my memory is 80% gaps due to trauma and dissociation and only 20% of my life still exists like a fragile web that keeps it together. 

I worry about Alzheimer‚Äôs as I get older as even though I‚Äôm well on my way to ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù or living a mildly functional life my memory is still shocking and I can only remember three or four parts of a year and only with photo evidence or through a piece of art or writing I made.

It‚Äôs terrifying.

Does anyone else feel like this? If so how do you cope with it?"
Increased anxiety from the pandemic seems to be bringing me back to a dissociated state,39,g2ucvr,3,"Basically what the title says. A few years ago I was sort of struggling with being dissociated frequently but it seemed to resolve itself a bit over time (potentially thanks to starting therapy and taking anti anxiety medication). 

The pandemic has greatly increased my anxiety levels‚ÄîIve had some of the worst days of anxiety in my life in the past month or so. I also was noticing i was feeling a bit dissociated but I didnt really attribute it to my anxiety as i considered that ive never experienced a pandemic before (who has?) so it would make sense for things not to feel real.

The last three days things seem to have gotten a lot worse. One the first of the three days I started the day with an uncomfortable anxiety attack. I went for a walk to try and calm down (dont worry I kept 6 feet at all time) and while I was able to slow my heart rate, i noticed i was deeply dissociated. I got back into my house and it didnt feel like my house at all. I wouldnt even say it felt like walking into a strangers house bc i feel like when i enter someone else‚Äôs house i at least get the feeling of, ‚Äúokay this is a house‚Äù. It just felt like nothingness and foreign and like a dream. 

Bottom line is I am just scared and terrified I dont want to go back to this and i dont know how to cope without my friends."
"Just thought of this, how do I know I‚Äôm NOT dissociating",38,en62ma,20,"Like, what if I‚Äôm dissociating right now and I have no idea. Like what does NOT dissociating look....like? How do I know I‚Äôm in the now? Right now?"
I feel unreal or that people around me are unreal,36,dypgff,4,"I've had a feeling of dissociation from reality for a few years. It's hard for me to grasp the concept that people around me are real. I dont think the same as others, I'm not antisocial but when I speak about my random thought people often dont understand where the thought came from and I can't really describe it either. I cant imagine people around me having thoughts the way I do almost as if I'm in a tv show and I'm the main character and the people around me are just there to provide a situation for me to struggle in"
Did dissociation go away or did i get used to it?,38,kcujbt,18,"Well; it‚Äôs all in the title. A few weeks ago I has some really shitty intense symptoms of dissociation/depersonalization. Then at one point, I stopped fighting it, I just accepted it, and now it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much. I still don‚Äôt feel connected to reality or my body, nor do i feel fully present, but I‚Äôm wondering, has it gotten better or have i simply gotten used to it? I‚Äôm asking because im scared that if i keep ignoring it, it will just get worse. im in therapy and just started medication (20mg of celexa) but im still looking for some opinions."
Forgetting things?,35,jtr1b7,9,"Does anyone experience this, I feel as if at times I will forget what I used to like doing, For example someone might ask me my favourite movie, I could normally name 10 but at times I feel like I barley can name one. 

I feel as if at times, I truely forget myself?"
"Forgetting, then finally remembering again. My experience",37,jb8vd2,4,"So I didnt realise it fully at the time, but for the past year and a half I had essentially forgotten almost anything emotionally significant that had happened to me before that point.

 I was aware I had forgotten and it distressed me to a point because I felt separate from myself and didnt understand why I am like I am, it was confusing and distressing. Like I didnt know myself at all. But apparently I didnt put much effort at all into trying to remember which looking back is a bit odd sinse that was what was distressing me.

I could recall events mostly, like I knew certain things had happened. But it was like I was recalling a story someone else had told me. I had no emotional awareness of those events, things that hurt me deeply at the time, when recalling, didnt even slightly phase me. Again, bit weird when I think about it but at the time I legitimately didnt notice. 

I was struggling with how forgetting made me feel. I felt conflicted, I felt separate from myself, I felt angry at myself because I thought I had made up the fact I'd ever had problems. I wasnt sure if I ever had genuinely struggled, but it felt like I had. I felt like I was lying to myself and to others but I didnt know what I was supposedly lying about. But weirdly I never tried to remember, and if i did i was just completely unable to recall any of the emotions.

Then yesterday, after about a year  and a half of blissful ignorance, it was like someone opened the flood gates. All of it came back, I never had a specific significant trauma, just significant prolonged pain. I sat there in shock, both at how far I'd come in that time and at how id ever managed to forget the defining features of my life up until that point. I honestly was in shock, for about 4/5 hours after it all came back I just sat there and remembered, gobsmacked. It was jarring and overwhelming, my ears were ringing and I felt like I'd pass out. What I remembered wasnt objectively that bad , but to remember how I had felt for years, remembering the emotions and the pain, truely remembering... was surreal.

But i wasnt sad or upset. I was sad to remember my suffering, but me now wasnt sad. It was liberating, almost felt euphoric. Like it all made sense again, I knew who I was again. And for the first time in years, I dont hate who I discovered I was. I was proud of how far I'd come, proud of my progress, proud if my strength and resilience. I wasnt having an identity crisis anymore (like I'd been having sinse I apparently just fucking forget everything one day). I wasnt conflicted, I recognised myself again. I'm me again. And who I am does include the bad, but only as context, not as a constant. Both the pain I felt before forgetting, and the fear that forgetting brought me were each torture in their own right. But as I remembered, it felt like seeig it in hindsight. Like it was all in the past now. 

I was understandably confused as fuck and a bit concerned that before yesterday I had no real memory of almost anything past primary school. I looked it up and it seemed to fit the category of dissociation. But I'm not too familiar with the concept so I might be wrong, but it seems to be the best definition I can find right now. I think after a certain point It just got too much for me, I dont think anything triggered it really. Just a long time of a lot of things and it got too much. 

I'm kind of greatful though. It's like I emotionally checked out and went into autopilot for a while. But in that time I chnaged my life so much, chnaged it for the better. Things that held me back and overwhelmed me for years just one day I forgot about and took that clarity to sort my shit out. I've managed so much in that time that I'm so proud of myself for, in that time of having forgotten I truely turned my life around and had fun doing it. 

The only truely difficult thing I was able to acknowledge in that time was how lost I felt. Despite turning my life around and achieving a lot of amazing things, I knew something wasnt right. It felt like the person doing things and the person judging those things being done were separate somehow. The person I saw in the mirror I didnt recognise. Not metaphorically but literally. It was a scary feeling. I felt like a liar and an imposter, not knowing what the lie I was telling was, or what the truth I was hiding was either. I felt like I'd lost myself, but i didnt know what I'd lost. I didnt know who i was or why. But despite that, superficially i thrived. 

Looking at the big picture now I feel greatful and sad. Sad that the person that felt that pain was me, it's always been me. But im so greatful that one day I just unknowingly separated myself from that and bettered my life permanently and effectively. Both stages came with their challenges sure, but somehow I dragged myself out of my self dug grave. I feel at peace now, I can benefit from the changes I have made comfortably and I can know and love myself for the first time. I know myself again, and i love myself. I'm so proud of myself. Forgetting was fun but it was blissful ignorance. Now it's just blissful. Knowing myself again, feeling in control and whole.

 I didnt know this kind of thing existed, forgetting, let alone how someone could be so complacent and unaware of it. I knew I'd forgotten but that's about all I knew and I rarely addressed it. I think it makes sense though, like the brain I've hated myself for having... protected me. I couldnt have done it all knowingly, I was in too deep. So I just... forgot. And now that I'm at a place in life i never thought I could EVER get to, a place im beyond proud and a bit astounded to be, my brain let me remember. I'm at a place where the pain is long enough ago and different enough that it feels unfamiliar for the first time in my life. I can handle it now, I can cope on my own this time. I can remember and thrive, not just one or the other. 

That's my story. I'm sorry it was so long and I highly doubt anyone cares or is reading this far but i dont really care. This has been really therapeutic to get out and it feels like a conclusion. Like that chapters over now. I'm not sure if this is right for this sub, I'm not well versed in dissociation and what happened to me might not even be that, but it's the best fit I can find. I'd love to talk or chat with anyone who has experienced this phenomenon, or someone that might be knowledgeable on how and why this happens. It's new and confusing to me and It feels a bit surreal to know it all happened, it sounds mental because it is but i jsut never realised I guess. So yeah thanks for reading if you did. This has been my experience. My story and struggles are far from over, but I feel a peace and calm I've never felt before and for that I'll forever be greatful:)

20 Fast Interventions for Panic and Dissociation and Depersonalization,37,ihkivb,6,"Body

1. **Choose a particular group of muscles and try to maintain awareness of them despite the panic or dissociation. Tense them as tightly as you can and then force them to relax. Stay with the experience of the muscle group trying to relax.** 
2. **Choose a food with a strong flavor like mint, chocolate, cheese, or a pickle. Hold the food on your tongue and stay mindfully aware of the sensation of taste. Notice how different parts of your tongue taste different flavors.**
3. **Find something with a strong texture, like a soft blanket or a cool stone. Feel the item and be mindful of the experience. Try and pull yourself back into the world around you through the connection.** 
4. **Smell a strongly scented item, like peppermint oil or a scented candle. If possible choose a scent that reminds you of a pleasant place or memory. Try and reconnect with your senses and your environment by experiencing the strong smell. Notice what the smell makes you think about or feel in your body.**
5. **Laying under an ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù blanket or weighted blanket can be a stimulating somatic experience. If you don't have one, try lying under several heavy blankets to slow your heart rate and calm down.** 
6. **Rub a mentholated lotion around the neck and chest when you notice panic starting. There are many brands like Blue Stop ‚Ñ¢ that are marketed for arthritis and muscle pain. The cooling sensation can help you reconnect with your body and slow your heart rate.** 
7. **Wrap a frozen bag of peas in a towel and put it across your forehead and eyes. This will activate the body‚Äôs natural ‚Äúdive response‚Äù.  When the head becomes colder than the rest of the body, your body thinks it is diving into deep water and will slow your heart rate and relax muscles to save oxygen.**

# Mind

1. **Make a mantra about the fear, negative belief, or trigger for your panic or dissociation. This should be something that reminds you that you are ok and that the belief about the trauma is not true right now. Eg. ‚ÄúI am safe, I am free‚Äù or ‚Äúmy past is not my future‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am loving, I am loved‚Äù. Repeat the mantra to yourself when you notice the distressing belief taking hold.** 
2. **Break down what you are currently doing into a series of steps, and repeat back to yourself the steps of what you are doing in a deconstructed way. Remember that you are competent and that these are easy things to do. Eg. ‚ÄúI am turning on my blinker at the intersection‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am putting peanut butter on the bread‚Äù.**
3. **Go through your phone or a mental calendar of future events and realize that this moment is just one part of the rest of your life. Go through your schedule and realize that right now is just one minute of the next hour of the next day of the next week of the next year. Think about things that you are excited to do in the future. Think of ways you can prepare for them.** 
4. **Try and put your finger on the exact emotions that you are feeling. ‚ÄúOverwhelmed‚Äù or ‚Äúfreaked out‚Äù are not emotions. Try and specifically describe your experience. Ask yourself if your current reality necessitates this experience. Try and discover if you are feeling scared, vulnerable or angry in this moment. If so, try and figure out who or what you are directing these emotions toward.**  
5. **The ‚Äústuck memory‚Äù of the trauma remembers the muscle groups that were tightened during the trauma. It remembers the way that you wanted to move your body's posture to protect yourself. Most importantly it remembers the way that you felt about yourself during the trauma. you may have wanted to curl up into a ball or stand up and fight. You may have thought that you were dirty, weak, small, or foolish. remind yourself that the traumatic belief you had about yourself during the trauma is not true. Also, try and move your posture into the opposite position the trauma belief makes it want to move into. Relax all muscle groups that want to tighten.**

# Soul 

1. **Think of an object or a place that you find beautiful. Look up a picture on your phone if you have access to one. Think about what you find beautiful about this object or place. Notice all of the things that you appreciate about the beauty of this place or object. Eg. pictures of the beach or a famous painting or sculpture** 
2. **Think about someone you love and feel safe with.  Think about what it is that you love about them. Think about this person and try and cultivate compassion for them. Feel yourself move from isolation to connection, and fear to compassion. If a word or phrase jumps out at you that represents this relationship to you, then repeat it to yourself in your head. Eg. Trust, kindness, safety**
3. **Think of your whole life like a giant web. Imagine yourself at the center and the strands of the web as your connections to others. Think of all the people that you love. Imagine where they are right now and when you will see them again. Imagine that the strings of the web run out from you to where your loved ones are in the world..** 
4. **Creativity requires us to get outside our own immediate experiences and reconnect with our resilient self. Draw a picture with anything you have, pen and napkin or toe in the dirt. Think about how you want to feel and try and express that feeling however you can. Hum a tune or sing a song if that is more appealing to you. When you feel that you are out of the immediate experience of the panic or dissociation, do a more complex creative activity that you find healing. Bake a cake, paint pictures, write a short poem, or make yourself do a small home improvement project. Reconnecting with our creative image and spatial processing part of the brain allows us to draw new connections and create new learned experience that helps us process trauma.** 
5. **Go to a space that you find calming, spiritual, or that feeds you in a personal way. Walk in the woods, sit by a lake, bird watch, attend a religious service, watch a theater piece, or go for a scenic drive. Find a space where you feel like you are calm, safe, and can start to be yourself again.**  
6. **Try to find your center or mindful self during the experience of the panic or dissociation. Think about the essence, psyche, or soul of yourself as a person. Feel how this anxiety, panic and dissociative episode is holding you back from being present like you would like to be. Ask yourself, what in me do I need to leave behind so the rest of me can become what I want to be? Ask yourself, what enlarges what I am, and what restricts who I am? Visualize yourself taking off or moving away from the anxiety experience. Realize that it is hurting you and not helping you right now. Try and feel yourself leave some of it behind so your mindful self can become more present.**

Dissociating like crazy at the moment,37,hbj5je,10,"I can‚Äôt feel anything physically. I barely have any emotions except the odd explosive breakdown.

I was doing really well for the past year but I find being alone is a trigger for my dissociation and obviously being stuck in lockdown means I‚Äôm alone a lot. 

The thing that I hate the most is the movement of time. Sometimes I lose a few days and other times it feels like I‚Äôve been stuck in the same day for a week"
DAE have existential crises when thinking about the past and/or looking at old pictures?,39,fpw7vo,3,"It just reminds me so much that I actually exist, because I have a past, which really freaks me out. I see pics of things or read about things that I don't remember, and that especially freaks me out. Was this me? Was I like that? Am I like that now? And then I always get to the good ole question: who am I?"
Do you ever repress memories or forget huge lapses of your own life?,34,era09o,4,"I've recovered a bunch of memories the past year or so that I simply had forgotten for several years. Things I was direct actor in that I had simply lost. A lot of them are painful or traumatic but it seems they just all made a flash back after years of dormancy. I've always had a rough issue remembering basic things, even just about myself, as in things I said or believed or took part in years ago. I'm only 23 now, and have joked with friends before that I think I have Alzheimer's, but it's basically a way to laugh off a very scary form of DID.  It's frustrating because the inconsistency that roots out of things like this make me look like I'm lying or retroactively trying to change things with others who remember those things. I just have these gigantic lapses of blackness in my mental chronology. It's really scary. Is this normal with DID?"
no one knows about my trauma so they don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm valid for feeling this way,38,e4ohjp,8,
Paid Dissociation Research Opportunity (1 hour online survey!),35,kahzoo,19,"*Study is now closed*

Research opportunity about dissociation!

Hello, my name is Shae (they/them)! I am a graduate student studying clinical psychology at Towson University and I research trauma and dissociation. I am conducting an online study examining self-compassion, social support, and barriers to accessing mental health care among individuals with dissociative symptoms. Dissociative symptoms can include things like feeling detached from yourself or your surroundings, having flashbacks or intrusive memories about your trauma, or feeling like you act so differently at times, you feel as if you are different people. There is little research on dissociation, so I am hoping to highlight our experiences with dissociation through published research.

We will be compensating everyone who completes the online survey with a $15 (USD) Amazon gift card.

To participate, you must be 18 years of age or older, read English, and have dissociative symptoms. You will then take an online survey which will take approximately one hour to complete, at your own pace. After finishing the study, you will receive a $15 (USD) Amazon gift card. 

Please DM for a link to the study.

Feel free to pass along the study details to others you know with dissociative symptoms."
Never felt present in my body,38,k1f8qw,16,"I have suffered from dissociation ever since I was a child. I would be disconnected from myself, my body and reality on a daily basis and could never fully ‚Äùcome down‚Äù or snap out of that state. I‚Äôm still struggling.
I have never really felt like I‚Äôve been a 100% present in my body.
I was prescribed antidepressants and they helped a bit but I still didn‚Äôt feel fully present. 

Is it possible to dissociate 24/7 without occationally being able to fully come down from it. Does anyone else experience this? Like your not just triggered into dissoc. but your sort of perpetually stuck in that state?"
Lost sense of self?,36,jub987,5,"I don‚Äôt really know who I am at the moment. I have no ambitions, no dreams, and no motivation to do anything. My schoolwork is piling up which could be so easily avoidable if I just did it on the day it was handed out. When I think about myself I can‚Äôt define my character, everything is just a jumble in my mind. Why am I so lost?"
Is questioning your senses a part of disassociation i mean i questiion them all the time like ‚Äúwhat the fuck even is sight‚Äù,35,jgyyso,4,
I‚Äôm Only 16 And My Life Is Going To Shit,38,jgnt0x,21,"16 year old M here. I‚Äôve been in therapy about two and a half years now, and I‚Äôm just now starting to be told I‚Äôm dissociative. I don‚Äôt know if I really am though, because I don‚Äôt really have any ‚Äúalters‚Äù. For me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm in a constant haze and my conscious mind has little control over anything. I don‚Äôt think coherently, and I would say I have different personality states. It feels like I‚Äôm in a constant muddy fog, and every sort of emotion or thought my conscious mind has stays repressed. I also have constant intrusive thoughts and images of sexually violent things. They originally started about a month and a half ago, and it was really bad at the beginning, causing panic attacks where I would move and do things outside of my control. Now those don‚Äôt affect me, but I have these really weird other types of attacks that I don‚Äôt know how to explain. It‚Äôs like randomly, I‚Äôll stop dissociating, and I‚Äôll begin feeling a sudden rush of one emotion, but I‚Äôm still not able to control my body consciously. I‚Äôll get really angry, and start acting just like any other angry person would (nonviolent with excessive violent thoughts), or really sad, or paranoid, or anxious. And I‚Äôll switch between one emotional extreme to the other, with brief periods of dissociation, where it‚Äôs almost like a hypnotist snaps their fingers and I‚Äôm suddenly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, how I got where I am, why I‚Äôm crying etc. All I remember is the immediate moments right before. I‚Äôll also be ‚Äútransported‚Äù occasionally to different made up circumstances and be affected as such. For example, yesterday I was being operated on without anesthetics and I could feel everything inside of my body and I couldn‚Äôt start screaming. And this all usually happens back to back, like multiple episodes at a time, then it just stops and I can barely remember anything. Right now, ever since I‚Äôve been unable to think clearly at all (I could at least remember things like 2+2=4 beforehand), I can‚Äôt hardly remember anything, and I‚Äôve been really angry and snappy towards everyone. I never had any one sort of ‚Äútraumatic‚Äù experience as a child that I can think (I don‚Äôt remember being raped or any sort of other thing) but I was forced to take showers with my dad at a young age and it has been one source of trauma for me, as well as growing up in a religious extremist household with two very manipulative parents. But other than that I can‚Äôt think of anything that could have scarred me, even though my therapist wrote a letter to my doctor about me having PTSD. I‚Äôm also really paranoid. I‚Äôm scared half the time that my grandparents (who I live with) are going to kill me, even though bless their hearts they love me more than anyone else and have been here for me through everything, or I‚Äôm scared that the governments watching me and is going to take me away (for what I don‚Äôt know) but I recognize that it‚Äôs all crazy paranoia. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve always had mental health problems to some degree, but I was still an all A‚Äôs honors student. I‚Äôm not that anymore. I can‚Äôt even sit down to do schoolwork or I dissociate so far that I‚Äôll end up just sitting there, often staring at something and doing nothing else. Please tell me someone knows what‚Äôs going on. I can‚Äôt think of any other sort of community to reach out to."
Therapists are not helpful,35,jfrrf1,15,"Hello,

I am struggeling at the moment to find a therapist for trauma and dissociation. I have different forms of dissociation dp/dr being one of them and at the moment chronic. For me no matter how bad I feel or how dissociated I am its not very visible to anyone else...my problem is that therapists i go to dont see me. they cant see behind the appearances. I told one I was seeing about my chronic dissociation and she said ""you dont seem dissociated to me"". she i think meant it as a helpful statement but it was completely devastating. i mean why would you invalidate someone like that when they are trying to tell you how they are feeling? also is dissociation really something that is alway perceiveable to others?"
Feeling too much and too little at the same time.,34,hcbshy,4,"I get episodes of dissociation where i find myself becoming overwhelmingly anxious and scared bc I realize I'm dissociating severely, this panic and anxiety doesnt feel normal, but im aware that i am in a distressed state because i'm trying not to fall into a full blown dissociative episode so i start to internally panic-- but I feel extremely dissociated at the  same time. My hands are constantly twitching and jolting because I keep thinking theyre someone elses hands that arent supposed to be there, and im constantly touching my face because I keep thinking I'll disappear any moment. this goes on for a while and sometimes I'm able to ground myself, sometimes I'm not and I get amnesia. 

  
Tldr:  
I just hate the feeling of feeling dissociated, yet overwhelmed at the same time."
Forgetting to eat?,36,h8zldx,12,Any of you dissociate so much that you skip several meals
"Not sure if this is Dissociation, but terrified when I keep realising I‚Äôm made up of bones and flesh?",38,gb8t24,9,"Sounds weird I know, not sure how to explain it any more clearly. Just weird isn‚Äôt it, being trapped behind these eyes, all that I‚Äôve ever experienced or can remember is gristle and brain. Like, to see a skull, a brain, eyeballs or gore of any kind disgusts us, but at the same time we‚Äôre made of it. We‚Äôre inside it, our consciousness looks out from it. This freaks me out and there‚Äôs no escape or third person alternative. Constant existence. All we ever experience is looking out from within this prison. Is this a form of dissociation or the opposite?"
Is there a name for this?,36,fvs3oq,9,"Hi everyone, this has been happening to me for a while and I‚Äôm just curious if anyone has a name for this feeling. Every once in a while I feel like I‚Äôve just opened my eyes, like I‚Äôve just woken up even if I‚Äôve been up for hours. Sometimes it happens multiple times during the day. Basically it seems like I‚Äôll be going about my day, doing whatever I normally would and then suddenly out of nowhere I just realize where I am and who‚Äôs around me and everything for the first time. It‚Äôs almost like I completely lose my observing self/observing mind for a period of time and then I regain it all at once and become very suddenly aware of my surroundings and can‚Äôt remember the last few hours before it. I‚Äôve never experienced this happening in such a way that I ended up in a new place or wandered off or bought something without my own knowledge though. If anyone has any idea about this pls lmk :) thanks."
Dissociation and Social Media,36,fdm3bq,6,"Has anyone felt repelled by social media when their depersonalization/ dissociation is strong? 

I can‚Äôt seem to look on social media, I have a weird aversion to Facebook especially when I‚Äôm in the fog."
Anyone else who has two different personalities: the one who remembers the trauma and the other who thinks it was all a lie,36,ep2325,13,"Some days I remember being assaulted vividly but then a kind of second personality kicks in and tells me I made it all up only in order to get attention and that my abuser was a nice guy actually and that I was a bad person. I have completely different memories about the same events.
I went back to him again and again due to this.

Both personalities argue for hours in my head and it drives me crazy.

When the second personality takes completely over I honestly apologize everywhere for lying and being such a bad person and even if people show me the horrible threats he wrote me I still don't believe them.

I still know who I am, it's not like two completely different personalities with a different name, age or whatever 

Does anyone else experience this? What can I do?"
I am terrified of reality,35,eb58o4,5,"I'm currently going through EMDR therapy and we just discovered that I have dissociation. It made me reflect more on how these last two years where ive been doing more outgoing things than before I haven't been there and have been numb. The more we continue to fix the dissociation, the more scared I get. I'm scared to go back to depression and anxiety and thinking about reality and having emotions terrifies me. I don't know if anyone else feels like this, but it's a terrible feeling, and it's hard for me to accept it happening and to face my fears."
I don't feel alive and I don't want to be alive,34,df898n,8,"I don't feel alive, if I'm not occupying my mind and keeping myself busy I start to fall out of myself. My body feels alien and my head empty, my thoughts echo in my head and get louder with every time, looking in mirrors has become painful and confusing, any shift in movement or lighting or position and all of a sudden I'm staring at a new unfamiliar face, I know it's my own but it feels so foreign, I'm forgetting details about things that happened through my days because I don't feel like I'm experiencing them, I feel like an isolated observer, I keep wanting to end things but I honestly don't feel that I know that would do anything. If I don't feel alive who's to say I'm not already gone and this is just some hellish punishment for shortcomings in my life"
I write zines about dissociation and grounding üíó,36,dds1vq,8,
"there are days/chunks of time within days, that i feel completely beside and outside of myself. no motivation. no racing thoughts. no sense of purpose(?). it‚Äôs as if i‚Äôm simply existing. i‚Äôm not quite sure how to describe it.",36,chu8g9,2,"is what i‚Äôm experiencing dissociation? that‚Äôs the only word i‚Äôve ever been able to use that describes how i feel in those moment,  but i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôve been misidentifying this feeling."
Anyone else ever aware enough that you talk during dissociation?,35,meilck,15,I've been dealing with dissociation over the last several weeks as a response to being fired from my job. Has anyone else ever experienced having a conversation while you are dissociating? It's strange because I feel like I'm lucid but I also feel like I'm not. Sometimes I try to speak and no words come out but sometimes I talk but I feel like I'm literally in no control of what I'm saying because I have no control and feel like I'm just watching myself do all this.
I dissociated harder than I ever have before and it frightened me.,34,kqxepk,4,"I was upset yesterday about a fight with my boyfriend. It had to do with a topic that hits me at my very core and deeply upsets me. I was trying to fold clothes to calm myself down and in the middle of folding a towel I suddenly felt my brain get bigger than my skull, my vision tunneled, and I couldn't move or talk. The bed felt like it was moving and I was trying to ask my boyfriend if there was an Earthquake but I couldn't talk. It was like my thoughts slowed down to the point of incoherency. This lasted maybe 30 seconds of me staring into the distance and then I felt like my jaw was going to explode (always my precursor to a panic attack) and it surged a painful energy from my jaw down my spine. This snapped me out of it and I instantly knew I was going to have one. I collapsed and had the worst panic attack I've had in over ten years.

I guess....I just want to know if anyone else who dissociates has experienced it like this. I don't know anyone in my life who can relate to my dissociation."
i want to feel here. any advice?,33,k11gz6,10,"does anyone else feel like they‚Äôre just not present. i want to be present in the moment. i sit back and just watch everything happen in front of me, kind of like i‚Äôm watching behind a screen maybe. i know that i‚Äôm here and i feel happy and alright most of the time, but i just want to feel alive again. i feel like my brain has a part of it that‚Äôs blocked off maybe, my therapist says my brain takes me away because of past trauma and because i‚Äôm anxious for things to come. does anyone have any grounding advice?"
Question for people with bad memory loss going back to childhood,34,jwpg2f,16,"I have dissociative amnesia to where I can‚Äôt remember a lot of parts of my childhood and even pass that going into elementary, middle and high school. 

What I‚Äôve been questioning to myself now that I‚Äôm older is, 
Was I disassociating through all those younger years of my life? 
or
Have I only been disassociating after my high school years and that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt remember my past?

Does anyone with childhood memory loss have a guess to which one sounds more accurate?"
Anyone else not bothered by their dissociation?,32,j7gnqg,10,"Now this could just be because I don't experience it too often especially now compared to when I was a kid, but even then dissociation never really bothered me and was almost meditative in a way, like I've transcended the constraints of being a singular being and feel like I've become ""one with the force"" in a sense.

I hope I'm not causing any discomfort to those who are actually bothered by their dissociation by minimizing it in any way, but I was just curious if anyone else felt the same way."
What is and isn't dissociation?,35,iw2fam,9,"I want to know what I've been experiencing. Tests say I'm healthy. These are the things:

- little ""pings"" through my head that make me feel dizzy but I'm not Actually dizzy. Movement triggers them.

- feeling like the world around me is moving too fast and my brain is slowly trying to catch up with what's happening

- feeling like thoughts I have aren't mine/ don't come from me

- being unable to remember what I just discussed or what I just did

- feeling like I'm not the person who belongs in this body

- feeling like I'm just... not me? Like things that should represent me, don't."
I feel so...unknowing. Nothing feels genuine. The only time I realize I‚Äôm in the moment is a few moments later. Then I forget. Every time I feel I‚Äôm connecting it feels wrong and completely new because It‚Äôs been so long I‚Äôve forgotten what it feels like to be alive.,35,gk0kkw,4,
DAE: Feel Trapped In Their Own Body?,33,ft40nm,6,The title is pretty self explanatory lol. But I‚Äôve been experiencing really bad dpdr that makes me freak out about being in my own body/existence/etc. stupid shit that makes ZERO sense to panic over and I feel like I‚Äôll never regain a normal sense of self or perception. It‚Äôs really disheartening and the worst my anxiety/panic has ever been.
My name...isn't my name???,35,ff6sgc,11,"I didn't like feel like my name was my name for the longest time. I still respond to it, Its still in my papers. But whenever I write it down, see it or even think of it I just stray away from it as far as possible. Like I go idle and I just feel like my head is sinking somewhere not nice... I want to keep the name I was given to honor my dad (he named me).

I remember in the first grade other kids would make fun of my spelling because it didn't follow the ""rules"" of what the teacher said. Even the teacher got mad at me for acting out because of the students. But that didn't bug me as much as me feeling so detached from everything. Being bullied at school and at home didn't help at all. 

My relationships, my hobbies, my body, everything. I would go into detail of what my living situation was like and what current life is like, but I don't want to waste your time with a sad story. I just want help.

In high school, I started going by ""Toby"" and I felt like myself. I still have issues with depression and trauma and overall anxiety and low episodes but I can't even fathom my name being my birth name any more. Its like I was always ""Toby"". 

When I look at my birth name I can't help but feel idle and sad. Don't get me wrong, my birth name is really pretty, but it's....not me. It's hard for me to explain it to my partner. How can I live as ""Toby"" while my papers hold a name that I was given and that I associate with the life I had lived before.  

Am I just separating myself from my experiences? Am I just trying to run away from my problems giving myself a name I feel comfortable with? Is it a control thing??? 

This really only bothers me when I start thinking about it, but I find it important of why I feel this way about a form of letters that were just given to me? 

Does anybody else feel the same? Do you guys go by a different name from your own as a preferred name? I do go to therapy and I'm taking medication for my Depression."
"Yelling in my head, but body on autopilot",35,ew737u,2,"I had a job interview scheduled for this morning. But when I got up, the idea of the interview felt foreign. Like it wasn't my interview, but rather an interview someone arranged and told me I was going to. I started panicking internally, and giving myself instructions in my head. Telling myself the interview was important, telling myself I needed to get ready for the interview, etc. But I couldn't get my body to obey my instructions. It was like watching a POV video from inside my own head, and not having control of what's happening in the video.

I even pulled up the phone number for the business my interview was with, planning to call and reschedule. But I just stared at the number until I stopped hearing myself giving instructions in my head. And at that point, I started getting ready for work (scheduled for right after the interview) instead of the interview. By the time I remembered I was going to reschedule, my interview time had already come and gone.

Is that a normal part of dissociation? I recently started seeing a therapist, and am still in the early stages of figuring out exactly what's going on in my brain because of a childhood of abuse.

Edited to add: my heart rate was normal, my expressions in my mirror were normal, etc. But internally I was freaking out and talking in a panicked manner."
Clearly out of focus,33,duwg2b,4,"When I'm struggling to process visually, it feels like my eyes are out of focus even when I can read clearly. It's like there's a static-y haze between me and reality that I'm struggling to look through. I'm fighting it right now. Typing this is hard.
 
I want to note here that I had to take a 5 minute break after typing that before I could check for typos and continue.
 
It's strange because I could still play video games decently (not well though) when I'm like this, but I can't read a book and would struggle to process anything people say to me in a conversation. I literally bump into walls when I struggle with a dissociative episode like that.  
 
I want to note here that it's easier to think through it now than it was, so maybe I'm lucky and this was a short one. I'm struggling to make a coherent thought on this come through and feel like I'm rambling though. So I'll stop."
Comic about the questions that come with dissociation,37,9tqqzn,0,
I think I‚Äôve figured out the root of my dissociation,34,luz9q7,2,"I just made another post on it but I remember my sister telling me when I was 6 the first time (out of two times, my dad only had a slapping fit with me again when I was 15) he was physical with me, I wanted to play and he threw a medical textbook at me. like a heavy textbook. my childhood is blocked out until I turned 6ish. I have no recollection prior to that it‚Äôs all made up memories that end up being false. I also got bullied when I moved to America at age 6 for being brown. Nothings felt real ever to me and i dont know if I‚Äôm dissociating or going into psychosis"
Marijuana and dissociation,32,lgwk39,15,"Throughout my entire life I have struggled with various forms of anxiety. I used to have a panic disorder but now I mainly struggle with dissociation. I have gotten way too high in the past which triggered dissociative episodes but I have also had some really good high experiences where I felt euphoric, connected and focused. This range of experiences all happened before I got my medical marijuana card and I wasn't quite sure which strains I was getting I just knew some made me feel great and some made me dissociate (quantity of consumption didn't make much of a difference).

I have my medical marijuana card now and can experiment with strains but I have no clue what I'm looking for. People have recommended indicas but I have found myself to dissociate quickly when indicas make me zone out. With dissociation comes panic. 

High sativas keep me focused but sometimes cause panic from over thinking which then causes dissociation. Argh, can't seem to win here. 

I think I will be looking for a hybrid? I want a mild body high, feelings of euphoria WITHOUT tuning out to the world. I want to know what's going on but perceive what's going on in a very positive way if that makes sense. I want my life to feel better without being so uncomfortably aware that I'm tuned out and stoned.

Has anyone else gone through this? I am looking for strain recommendations preferably with low to medium THC levels and medium CBD levels."
How do I form a cohesive sense of self with a cohesive life timeline?,34,kzajaj,16,"This weekend I have written in my journal a summary of my life so far. I have just finished writing it and I'm crying and feel empty and hollow and I don't know why.

One thing I am finding upsetting is how disjointed my view of my life is. I feel like my life is in distinct chapters e.g. Primary School, Secondary School, University. As soon as I leave one chapter it's like I completely forget about it and I lose contact with everyone from that chapter. I feel so much grief and sadness at all the wonderful friends I just didn't stay in contact with. Right now I have no friends for the first time in my life as all my old friendships have faded away and I can't make new friends due to lockdown and working from home. Some of those friendships were intense ""best friends but more like sisters"" friendships, I don't understand how I can not have spoken to them again, I just let myself drift away from them.

My chapters are so inconsistent. I went from loud and sociable surrounded by loads of friends who didn't care about school work and would get bad grades to a science ""geek"", top of my university cohort with no friends in the space of a few years. 

My memory is so bad because of this issue where I just disregard the previous chapter. I struggled to remember the names of some of my friends at university even though I graduated just one year ago.

Does anyone have any advice?"
Spending all this time alone in lockdown is making me dissociate so much,32,kkk3d3,4,"My (22F) dissociation is sometimes triggered by emotions like anxiety and anger but it only lasts a short time when that happens. 

Being alone for prolonged periods of time can make me dissociate for weeks on end and I was doing really well with keeping it under control for a while but since lockdown started that has completely gone out of the window. I feel really strange all the time, I have no sense of time and I can barely feel anything either physically or emotionally. 

My office has reopened so I‚Äôm hoping that I will get to a better place soon"
I hate the reflections,35,kbckqb,5,"I don't see reflections as myself anymore. I haven't willingly looked at one in about 3 weeks. I don't want to remember what I look like as I've slowly forgotten the details overtime.

I hate any reminder of my normal self, any reminder that I'm just *me*. It is the most disappointing feeling to see that face staring back at me, even for a second. I completely avoid it, it never feels like me anymore. I just want that part of me gone entirely, I don't want to be myself. I don't want to be seen as myself, no one needs to know me."
I just realized something..,34,k5hwbw,10,"With how detached from ourselves right now, when we eventually figure out how to reattach everything will feel that much better, and we will actually have a deep appreciation for it. Maybe others are enjoying life more rn but we will have unlimited joy when we finally are healed, because of our vantage point from pain.

You only know how good you feel when you have been used to feeling bad."
Dissociating before a hookup?,34,j8cqz6,4,"I have anxiety when being intimate, not like I think something is going to go wrong, my brain is just like ‚Äòoh yes, let‚Äôs just make everything feel fake , that‚Äôll be such fun‚Äô.

I want to feel, absorb and taste everything without feeling like ‚Äòoh wow I can‚Äôt feel shit‚Äô. I can‚Äôt enjoy a hookup because I always end up dissociating. 

Does anyone have advice?"
Does/can anyone here dissociate on purpose?,32,hsudxo,8,"I‚Äôm trying to help my sister figure out what she has been doing as a coping mechanism most of her life.

She‚Äôs been doing this since she was a kid. Parents were arguing loudly right in front of her when she was just 6 years old, and she closed her eyes and repeatedly told herself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here.‚Äù All of a sudden, she was somewhere else. She said it was like she forgot she was even human. She eventually reminded herself who she was and came out of it. 

She has done it (always purposefully) many times over the years both to see if she can still do it and to avoid physical and emotional discomfort or pain. She has initiated it during tasks like doing the dishes, and she continues doing the task even while in her strange state. She always focuses and says a phrase about 12-15 times to make it happen.

She has never looked into it but she asked me to try to figure out what it is so she could understand it and put a name to it. My first thought was self-hypnosis, but some kind people at r/hypnosis also suggested it‚Äôs dissociation using an anchor (the phrase repetition). Can anyone here give me more input?"
Have you ever dissociated while driving?,36,hqw5rl,24,"I'm supposed to be getting my license somewhat soon, but I'm concerned about what will happen if dissociate while behind the wheel. 

Has this ever happened to anyone? Is it safe to drive?"
"Glad there‚Äôs a bit of a community, and that I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing dissociation.",34,eq6plv,2,"This has calmed me down a bit.

Remember, don‚Äôt be afraid to (like I was) sharing that something is off.

Your doctor should be there for you, but make sure that you do your best to describe what you think is happening.

It can be difficult to admit that something is wrong, because it makes it very real, and that can be part of what scares you off and even what triggers some of the dissociation.

Do your best to be honest about it!

At least share it with a professional, if you‚Äôre nervous about sharing with family/friends."
everything is an act.,34,d05swg,7,"it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm an alien inhabiting a body, desperately trying to blend in. everything i say i say because it‚Äôs what i think others want to hear. i can‚Äôt speak from my heart. i don‚Äôt even know if i have one. i always feel ‚Äúfloaty‚Äù, like i‚Äôm not really there. time passes by either painfully slow or strangely fast. 

is this what dissociation is? i‚Äôve been experiencing it for years."
having conversations without remembering anything,36,m7do8z,11,"Okay I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub because I‚Äôm not very educated on it and stopped going to psychiatrist because I don‚Äôt know if I need to so sorry if it isn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôve always had a bit of an issue with having conversations with people, but not realizing it and not knowing what i‚Äôm saying. Lately it has been almost every small conversation especially with my boyfriend. He‚Äôll make a comment about something I said, but I don‚Äôt even realize that I was talking to anyone and want really thinking of it. Sometimes when it‚Äôs worse I‚Äôll end up in different places without remembering moving. I‚Äôve like come back in?? to myself during the middle of a sentence and it felt like interrupting myself. 

Have been trying to get some information on this because I‚Äôm not sure it it‚Äôs normal or not, but can‚Äôt really find anything in the way to explain it. Does this happen to anyone ?"
When you are dissociating do you ever ‚Äúgo to sleep‚Äù,32,klk9kj,13,"I dont know how to describe it, sometimes i dissociate to a point where its almost like ive fallen asleep but my eyes are still open if that makes sense. Everything becomes void and there is just this enpty blackness until i fade back"
Anyone else 'feel' their dissociation in their head?,34,jzxy9a,25,"I have becoming more aware of my dissociation over the past year and realized I can actually kinda feel it in a specific location in my brain. Like a headache that doesn't hurt. Its hard to describe and weird to focus on 
 It makes me feel trapped in the dissociation and I don't like it to say the least lol

Edit: It makes me feel a lot better to know I'm not alone in this situation"
L-Theanine is helping my dissociation,31,iqrg4n,21,"So I want to start off by saying I experience very minor cases of dissociation, where I feel very distant like my brain is not connected to my body. Kinda like brain fog or when you wake up in the morning feeling groggy but it never actually goes away. It hard for me to think or feel. I know there are way more severe cases of dissociation so obviously this may not help everyone but I thought I would share anyway! 

I started taking L-theanine for social anxiety a couple months ago, it didn‚Äôt help for that but it did give me some energy boost. I kinda forgot about it for a while but I recently picked up at it again and it‚Äôs helping me feel more present. I take 2-3 tablets (400-600mg) in the morning with my coffee. I can tell it‚Äôs actually helping because normally when I‚Äôm driving to work in the morning I feel that dissociation and worry about how I‚Äôll be able to work thru the day, but when I follow this routine I feel present, excited, and happy. It‚Äôs kinda like a mood boost. 

If anyone else has tried this I‚Äôm curious if it has helped in the same way. It doesn‚Äôt cure dissociation forever but it is really helping me get my thoughts and energy/motivation back. I can do the things I like to do now without panicking. 

If you are unfamiliar with the supplement, here is some [info](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleep-newzzz/201708/what-you-need-know-about-l-theanine%3famp)"
Bad trip with weed and now I have severe anxiety and dissociation,31,ih32uc,48,"i‚Äôm just looking for some help and advice mostly because i have been dealing with this since may and i have gotten better but not where i want to be. i‚Äôm 15 and never been diagnosed with any mental issues, but anxiety and depression run in my family. and i‚Äôm positive i have anxiety disorder of some sort, i took a hit off a cart pen which contained THC in it, and i had a panic attack and when i passed out and woke up the next morning i was dissociating horrible of course at the time i had no clue what was happening to me because i‚Äôve never experienced anything like that or even severe anxiety before. a couple days later i felt as though i was going to end my life and i had no control over my mind because of the severe anxiety, so i told my mom to take me to the ER, they prescribed me hydroxyzine which is just a panic attack reliever not actual anxiety medication. recently i have been put on zoloft which seems to help my anxiety mostly and on top of that i‚Äôm starting to workout again to ease my dissociating and anxiety and it seems to be working but i‚Äôm nervous that it won‚Äôt fully work and i‚Äôm going to be stuck like this for a while, can someone please help me. i haven‚Äôt told my parents what caused this because in general i had a rough freshman year, but i just want to get better, i have improve tremendously just not fully back to normal."
touch starvation causes dissociation,33,hic7lb,12,"hi so i‚Äôve been dissociating at least once a day and it‚Äôs been extremely intense since the quarantine began. my memory is shit and i don‚Äôt recognize myself. i was thinking today about how i haven‚Äôt had human contact in a long time because i do be stayin safe and i think that could be a huge reason why i feel so disconnected from the world, others, myself. idk i‚Äôm just wondering if any of you guys also feel this way. it‚Äôs like one of the most stressful times in my life and i can‚Äôt get a fuckin hugüòî. i have realized tho that my pets ground me to an extent but i‚Äôm missing human connection."
Serious memory concerns,32,hdcsxw,13,"I woke up this morning feeling meh, but I cant remember the bulk of my life. I can list all the landmark moments, but could i tell you what occurred during them? No. 

I've had long standing memory issues but this now takes the cake. I looked at some old conversations I've had with a friends. I have zero recollection of those conversations. I was relaying detailed information that I don't remember. 

Now I'm looking through some manga, tv shows and movies I've watched and I can barely remember the contents. I can give a summary to some but others completely escape me. Usually I don't read/watch things twice because I remember at least the general plot lines.

What is with my memory today? Mind you, I have depression, panic disorder and MDD but this is the first time I'm concerned for my health. Is this due to my dissociation? Or something more serious?"
Types of dissociation - the one where you have no idea what happened,31,fmrv31,6,"
I read people's experiences of trauma, and people who remember very well of ""where"" their mind went. For example if they mentally started thinking of random checklists, or their math class (random stuff not associated with the occurring trauma). Also another example, when people float out of their bodies and are above and can see themselves (out of body experience).



But what about traumatic experiences where you don't remember anything. You don't think you floated out of your body, or at least you dont remember seeing yourself.  And you have no idea what or if you were thinking about during the trauma. You have no recollection of what happened in the moment around or to you, or what you were thinking about.



Hopefully this makes sense."
This could be Freedom,36,f8x6pp,7,"As of lately, it feels as if my dissociation is coming to an end! It's been a year since I had an episode of Derealization/Depersonalization followed by the Dissociation that I'm recovering from and I feel like the glass veil separating me from reality is cracking and shattering. This is a beautiful experience and I can't wait to get my mind completely back so I can get my emotions back and get on with life!"
This body isn't mine,32,ekv5cz,1,"I feel like in getting replaced, even do I know this is not my body, it doesn't feel like it.

All my life I felt like a ghost pulling strings from the shadows, but now I don't know who am I . This body reacts on it's own, and I hate it. Why can't I have a life?

Silver is the name I gave her, she responds out loud and I feel like she is replacing me, I don't know if she is even real. I hate it, I want my own life, my own body.

 It feels like sharing a body, but not knowing who is doing what. I don't talk anymore and find myself incapable of, writing is my only way of communicating. Is the only thing I know I'm doing myself. Still, I feel I'm making this crap, I have hopes of waking up some day in a real life. 

I just want to stop feeling like an observant."
Anybody else dissociate when you see someone you haven‚Äôt seen in a long time?,31,e2cozb,5,A good person or a bad person. Either way this happens to me.
I will look at a picture of myself from high school and literally say ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt even feel like me‚Äù,30,m9rsls,3,Does this sound like dissociation?
I want to disappear just for a little while,32,lzgu8x,9,"My body feels unfamiliar, my sense of self is foggy. I don‚Äôt like this, and I don‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm expected to act normal. I just want to knock out so I wake up and maybe feel a bit better.. I feel like this is another part of me that is in a trauma response. Part of me has thoughts of self harm but I‚Äôm mostly just uncomfortable. Most nights fucking suck. Trauma sucks."
I(19F) need help/advice about how to ground myself,32,jx7qes,10,"I never knew that what I was going through had a name. When I was younger I would go into movie theaters and watch movies/read books and be completely immersed in what was happening. By the time I had finished the book or the movie was over I‚Äôd feel very off and not like myself. It‚Äôs like I was in the world, I just thought I was connecting to whatever media I was interacting with. But lately it‚Äôs been caused by my dreams. I‚Äôd have such vivid dreams and I‚Äôd wake up feeling differently about other people and my own reality. I just can‚Äôt grasp what‚Äôs happened was fake and it‚Äôs like everything in my reality is now in another perspective. I zone out and it‚Äôs really hard for me to concentrate on whatever I‚Äôm doing or what reality I‚Äôm in. Honestly I could freak out but right now I‚Äôm kind of experiencing it. But I have work to do and I want it to stop. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to ground myself? I‚Äôm trying not to freak out but it feels so weird and I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs changing my perceptions of people and even myself and surroundings. Thank you so much"
I think I died last year and this is just me venting about it,34,jm5o1a,6,"Around this time last year i was not in a great place. I was incredibly reckless and I didn‚Äôt care what happened to me, and one night in particular at a college party i filled my system with as much cocaine, weed, and alcohol as i could get my hands on and then chased it all down with about 5 energy drinks, as one does. When i told this to a few of my friends months later, they all looked at me like i had 5 heads and told me i‚Äôm lucky i‚Äôm not dead. Ever since then, i feel like i‚Äôm in purgatory and the universe has been testing me to see if i should go to heaven or hell (the state of the world over the last few months and how i respond to them is my ‚Äútest‚Äù of morality). It kind of scares me because i think the US presidential election might be the final test of morality and i might not see my family anymore after this week. I try to avoid thinking about it too much because it immediately sends me in a state of full dissociation and it takes a bit for me to kinda come back but sometimes i‚Äôll see something that triggers thoughts of it (happened this morning). Sometimes I think i‚Äôm just being insane but i still use it as a way to justify my irresponsible behavior (‚Äúit‚Äôs completely fine that i just don‚Äôt submit any assignments for 4 days i‚Äôm dead anyway‚Äù). My therapist hasn‚Äôt really offered any
solution for this so i guess it‚Äôs just gonna be a part of me for now."
I'm exhausted from dissociating,29,j8tng5,4,"I'm sure I'm gonna sound confused as hell cause honestly I am. I'm so so exhausted. I have had symptoms of dissociation for years because of childhood trauma, and I kinda didn't know what it was for the longest time. I felt that once I knew what was wrong with me, it would magically get better. Spoiler alert, it didn't. So then I tried understanding it better, analysing myself and figured out the triggers, the cycles and all so that I could manage it not too poorly. I mean, I'm not asking for much, I just want to be a functional human being. It worked for a while, but now that anxiety is such a crushing big part of my day to day life, I don't know what to do. I'm just having anxiety peaks (they're not even attacks really) randomly throughout the day and I'll just snap and be sitting on the couch feeling like I'm dying and fighting inside my head to reconnect. The worst part is that from the outside I just look like an empty puppet, almost drooling. And when I finally resurface I'm just so tired I could sleep 10 hrs. I feel like it's 4.30 am all the time, and the more tired I am, the more anxiety I get. I don't f*ing know what to do, I can't find the courage or motivation or whatever to find a therapist that would work for me, it's like I don't have enough energy to shower most days, how tf am I supposed to pick up the phone and then take the subway, go there and sh*t. I can't even feel my f*ing face right now. And I can't even sleep cause as soon as I close my eyes, I get horrible flashes popping out of nowhere. This is so f*ed up"
Not now...,33,itdp7o,0,
Therapist triggered me by accident and now I feel like a scary monster.,32,igrihh,4,My therapist said he'd like to meet Fred( the voice in my head.) I think he thinks I might have some form of dissociation and he mentioned that it might be scary but I never associated the word scary with what was happening to me and now I feel like im a scary monster and I'm freaked out by myself. We have a session again in a few days and I've looked into dissociation more and I think he is correct i exhibit a lot of symptoms. But i always thought they were normal things. Now I'm kust scared of myself. :(
Just sharing idk,32,hjf6v7,5,"I was looking at myself in the mirror the other day - something I don't usually like doing because of my dissociative tendencies.
I haven't felt this in a while, I thought it had finally all come to a stop, but as I saw myself there, looking myself in the eyes, I got terrified. I could not understand who that person was, and why he blinked as I blinked, and why his chest moved in unison with mine.

I was hypnotised by this fear, this feeling of uncertainty. It just felt like I wasn't there, and that that person in my reflection was a different version of me.

This all sounds super cryptic and weird, I know, it's just the best way I've found of putting it into words.

Have any of you experienced this hypnotising feeling? I'm so disturbed by it, I hope you guys can relate."
Alice In Wonderland Syndrome. I feel like the feeling of this or symptoms feel similar sometimes. Or that they occur at the same time.,30,gkz0f2,8,
When do I dissociate?,32,ghvafv,6,"It feels like I dissociate all of the time. Like I never really feel my body. And my arms and legs almost feel unreal. It's like I'm constantly stressed and dissociating. I think when I'm with friends I recognize it and attempt to be more present. I'm alone now and I dont want to be present or feel anything so I look at my phone, and read or watch videos and become so immersed in whatever it is that I forget about my surroundings entirely or that there is a world moving around me. That I've got things that I'm responsible for but im letting them go because I just want to lay in my bed where its warm and comfortable. Listening to western movies in the background. It's a place where I cannot feel and I love it. I dont want anything else."
DAE experience extreme sleepiness/fatigue as a symptom of dissociation?,32,fot3sh,9,"I've been trying to work on my dissociation more lately because I realized just how much I do it... more than I thought. When I'm doing what I call light dissociation it's like someone else is driving and I can't manage to do something as simple as plan my day.  I have a history of chronic fatigue do to physical illnesses but I also have a history of surprise fatigue or sleepiness with no context/explanation/etc. and I don't think there's a physical explanation.  For example, it'll happen if I slept fine, eaten regularly/don't have low blood sugar.   


I'm beginning to wonder if the sleepiness is actually a symptom of dissociation because I'm all fuzzy and not here when it happens too and if I do something engaging - even writing this post - it'll go away some."

when i looked in the mirror it felt like i was looking through it at another person?,32,dy6a1c,4,"there are many times that i feel disconnected from my reflection, like i am still aware that it‚Äôs me but it just feels disjointed a bit. but recently something happened that took that way further. i was cleaning my mirror and when i was done i looked at my reflection and it legitimately felt like i was looking at another person, as if the barrier of the mirror doesn‚Äôt exist and i could reach through and touch them. i got into that same fuzzy headspace of not really thinking or hearing, disconnected from my body.  

something that i will put out there is my symptoms of dissociation are hard to pinpoint because i also have severe adhd, and also because my dissociation used to be much worse and i think i‚Äôve been much better with it in recent months. but i don‚Äôt know i‚Äôve never experienced this before and i‚Äôm not even sure if it‚Äôs a symptom of dissociation or if it‚Äôs something else?? has anyone else had this experience?"
How to connect,31,d603mw,3,How am I supposed to connect with people when I can‚Äôt even connect with myself. How am I supposed to relate to them when every experience that I‚Äôve ever had seems like a hazy feeling that I can‚Äôt relate to anymore. Am I just supposed to go through life trying to mimic other people‚Äôs emotions to try and feel what a normal person feels like? I can‚Äôt even talk to my parents anymore because it feels like I‚Äôm not the person that they raised and know. I‚Äôm 21 and still have so much longer to go.
feelings (or lack thereof),32,cotqqm,1,"just read a post on here where OP explained how they feel happy, sad, and angry but also don‚Äôt REALLY feel it. this has probably been one of the most destabilizing symptoms of my dissociation.

today i was with a few coworkers and we were all cracking up (i haven‚Äôt laughed this hard in months) and when the laughter died down i was like?? what just happened? did that just happen? wait, how did i make myself laugh? do i control that? where am i? who am i? oh shit am i acting weird?? just keep smiling. everything is fine no it‚Äôs not. did i really just laugh? why was i laughing so hard?? how long have i been dissociating for? was i dissociating before i started laughing? was that real JOY!?!
most of the time it just feels like i‚Äôm along for the ride in someone else‚Äôs body who‚Äôs speaking and reacting to other people."
"When you have an episode does it sometimes feel like you have (almost) no idea where you are and who you are, or even what you are?",34,cl971u,13,"I'm ok with this happening in my free time and I actually enjoy it lol but when at work is where it gets really annoying.

It'll feel like the picture (what I'm seeing) just distances itself from me and I can't really grasp what I'm looking at, like my mental functions cease to be coherent followed by me not knowing what is even happening. Nothing will make sense. Absolutely NOTHING. Not what I'm looking at nor who I am or even WHAT I am. Existence will seem like such a foreign absurd thing. I really have to THINK about doing my job so that it may go away or else I just can't do anything and be lost in this weird mental limbo trying to grasp what is happening and by what I mean this 'me' thing, this awareness being aware of itself somehow existing somewhere...

Can trauma come from within?,33,ki2fsb,6,"I have had bad mental health for as long as I can remember.

Is it possible the presence of bad mental health could have traumatised me? 

Now, as an adult, I have all the symptoms of trauma but I feel like I‚Äôve been this way for a long time. A lot of my mental health is centred around traumatising myself (or so it feels) with involuntary thoughts and images.

What does normal feel like? Signs you're NOT dissociated?,32,ej7ref,4,"I had traumatic memories starting as early as 1-3 yo, went fully emotionally dead in elementary school and I don't know what's normal anymore. 

When I think of something, I have no idea I'm thinking it, but I will still be affected by those thoughts. My awareness is zero, unless I consciously think of it. I also never get random or stray thoughts, my mind is empty 24/7. I only get things in my head if it's a knowledge or fact I already know and is related. I absolutely can't focus on lectures, the talk just goes by me, without me getting much of a meaning out of words. I don't actually know what people mean by having a sense of self. I can act and be ANY way I like and I completely change depending on people to fit in. Been described as empty behind my eyes, having no expressions at all and I definitely don't have emotional goggles to see life and I can severely over-think without even realizing what I'm doing or how I am doing. Except I'm aware of no activity or thoughts, and I simply keep living without noticing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I always described myself as absent-minded, I'll do dumb things because my mind isn't here. Now I think maybe all of that wasn't a personality quirk, that it was dissociation all along.

 

I might've had this condition for the majority of my life. Is it impossible to reach normal at this point? I always revert back to freeze or depression for no reason, I know it might be near impossible to fix. I'll read on books, shock myself with cold water and exercise, maybe I'll eventually wake up lol. Except there's dp/dr, what to do for what? What's normal?  Do you have random thoughts, ideas and awareness of them? Those are extremely rare for me."
How do you experience dissociation?,33,ecef6y,14,"For me, Its like I cant think or focus and my head is filled with cotton balls. I'll start spacing out and forgetting what Im doing or what I was about to do. It really bothers me in school and in social situations. I find it hard to focus or do my work during dissociation, or even speak. Its like my brain has become mush. So my question is, what is dissociation like for you? How do you prevent it in social situations?"
I really don't think anyone gets it.,32,dwj7sz,3,"When I say that, I mean mental health professionals. I will sound horrible saying this but 99% of the ones I have been to simply fell into their career with no idea as to what dissociation is and are only there to accept your check and say ""And how does that make you feel"".  


I won't use my struggle as a crutch, that only adds to the downward spiral but I do think back and reminisce a lot. 

In the past 3 years I lost my childhood home, my father from cancer, and his house that I stayed at constantly.  


I go to google street view and just stare at my houses while thinking ""Nah, this is bullshit. There's no way you could've actually lived in that home"". It's NOTHING to do with the material component - I am not being an ingrate. It's the fact that so much has changed. Lost my child hood home (Parents were divorced hence 2 houses) in a foreclosure? Fine, I can handle that. Lose my Dads house? Okay EXTREMELY difficult but I will live... but losing my dad too?  


I have these vibrant memories of Christmas time and holidays and I ask myself ""You've never experienced anything like that, right? How could you tap into these joyful visions of what Christmas, Thanksgiving, ect should be like?"".  


I did have them. When I was a child, before the divorce, before the death, before the loss....  


Moving on is something I am trying to do, I actually do it quite well! It's when it hits you all at once. My friends even told me ""Ever since your dad died - I see you do the 1,000 yard stare a lot"". There's just too much damage (at this point at least) than I know what to do with... My life has changed SO MUCH that I can't fucking recalibrate!  


I'm working a job, I have hobbies - but it's akin to a nice boating floating down a stream only to find the polluted and toxic water underneath. It's just not what it seems."
Missing hours,32,dqtdxp,3,"One of the most off-putting things I experience due to dissociation is missing time. I'll look at the clock, it's 1:23. I look at the clock a few minutes later, it's 2:56. I don't remember the last hour and a half, though I'm certain I didn't do much during that time because things like going outside would leave a vague memory at least. All evidence suggests I sat in my chair without moving the whole time. I must have been lost in thought, but I can't even remember what I was thinking about."

"Wife having weird feelings that she couldn't describe to me, then she googled them",31,ku625m,8,"This is a really long story that I'm going to try to make brief:

My wife(37) has a brain tumor in her cerebellum, and has been fighting with it for 3 years. It started out as a low-grade benign (Grade 1), that was resected, but then it came back much more aggressively.

She had a second surgery that removed a large amount of her right cerebellum, 3 weeks of radiation. Suffered from hydrocephalus that led to a 3rd surgery to install a VP shunt. Been loaded with dexamethasone for the better part of 6 months. We then started a promising new drug that she's been taking for a month. She was basically told that if the drug works, great, but if it doesn't work the tumor would likely return in 4 - 5 months.

Well good news! Her last scan showed that the drug was working with flying colors, and is stopping the tumor in it's tracks. If it work, she can technically take the drug for the rest of her life, there is no toxicity like you'd see with other cytotoxic chemos.

For several weeks she's been complaining more about her mental symptoms then her physical symptoms. She's been through a lot, but she's never shown externally to be in any kind of emotional distress. I downplayed it for a while, telling her ""You're doing great, your symptoms are subsidding, your balance is back, you aren't so dizzy anymore.""

They have a counselor associated with the cancer practice, but she didn't really get along with her.

But even after the good scan, she mentioned that it seemed like there were 2 different universes. The one she is in, and the one that our daughter and I live in. She says that she is aware of what is going on, but doesn't feel like she's part of it. Physically, she is improving. But she is getting increasingly frustrated. She says she feels like her body and mind aren't connected. Like she's controlling a robot.

Her oncologist put her on zoloft. After taking the zoloft she had severe panic and anxiety attacks, uncharacteristic of her. They discontinued the Zoloft promptly and put her on  clonazepam. It helps with the anxiety, but her feelings of detachment are still there.

Today she was googling, and sent me a link to ""derealization"", and said ""That's it! That's me there""

This seemed like the place to ask for some advice.

This post really simplifies things, but it's hard to tell everything without writing a book on here."
I have dissociated for an entire year,29,km6yxc,14,I have all but forgotten what it feels like to be alive. I don‚Äôt know what to do. This is all I am capable of typing.
I just woke up from a dissociative episode and have been running multiple Reddit accounts with all different variations of my life and now I don‚Äôt remember which one is real??,28,jq7tq9,10,"
I‚Äôve deleted the accounts I‚Äôve finished reading and like holy fuck some of them are 100+ days old. For the record I have been diagnosed with DID, CPTSD, Borderline with Narcissistic tendencies, ASPD, mild agoraphobia and Generalized Anxiety. I‚Äôve been fucked up and ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù since I was little. But I‚Äôve also been a genius when it came to humanity for equally as long. I understand the brain in such a complex but it is a double edged because I cannot live with humanity and so I‚Äôm always inside my own head or trying to dig my way into others. I came from monsters and I learned to weaponize it. 

My specialist disappeared when COVID first happened and she was the only one who knew ‚Äúus‚Äù. She‚Äôs said there‚Äôs four. I know of their basics but I never know when they are around. Weird. Like a car I have no control of. I can feel my cracks and I know what I have to do. 

My ears are ringing I can‚Äôt see or feel anything. All I know is that I‚Äôm pregnant. That is confirmed via messages with my worker who is real. 

My head is spinning and my mind is a mess 

I can‚Äôt believe this but bless Reddit for allowing the alters to have their own pages to express. We used to keep journals when we were still seeing the specialist. 

Have you ever felt your brain working? It‚Äôs like I can feel every bit of it. 

Maybe it‚Äôs the 50% more blood pumping through my body because of the baby. 

Will I keep it? 
That seems up in the air with the others. 

Gem insists on talking to our aunt first. I know she wants to keep it but... eh. 

Others seem set on aborting.

My brain hurts anyway. Yeah. I wonder how long I‚Äôll be conscious. Ask away.. maybe I‚Äôm already dead and I‚Äôm a ghost looking on?? 

Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm a schizo too. Never been confirmed. Too... self aware perhaps? Hmm maybe. Who knows"

DAE feel dissociative w/o their glasses?,29,iajrhy,9,"Howdy! This is a question for my glasses wearing people in this sub.
So i suffer with dissociation as a result of adolescent cptsd, and recently i was prescribed glasses after noticing my vision was foggy.

DAE Get Complimented on Being Calm Under Pressure as a Kid?,31,f6nqdg,3,"There's really two memories that come to mind here.  The first was when I was in the third grade (TBH, I don't really remember it, but I've been told the story enough that I know it) I brought in one of my toys for a show and tell day.  Apparently the teacher was walking around and accidentally stepped on it and crushed it to pieces.  The teacher's aide saw this happen and I apparently just sat there frozen as it happened and didn't do anything.  The weird part is that she told my parents the story like it was some kind of good thing.  Like, no shit I didn't do anything, I was probably frozen in place and dissociating the fuck out of there.

The other one was when I got lost in the wood on a family camping trip.  My brother and I got separated from our parents and I basically dissociated and went into like ""robot mode"" which is what I do under pressure.  Eventually we reconnected and the takeaway was how calm I was since my brother was kind of freaking out by the end of it.

Has anyone else received this type of ""compliement""?  I've always felt guilty being called smooth under pressure because that's not really what's going on."

Does anyone dissociate while doing routine activities?,30,koy8d5,2,I often find myself dissociating when brushing my teeth or washing my hands and end up doing it for 10+ minutes. My therapist is trying to help me with this. Does this happen to anyone else?
Screens and dissociation,30,iojh6s,4,Does anyone know if there‚Äôs a link between the two? I feel like looking at screens all the time passively (as you do as you‚Äôre scrolling) makes me experience reality in the same passive way. Has anyone gone on a screen cleanse and seen any results?
Does suppressing your own motivations and drives cause dissociation?,30,hxrncw,11,"I've noticed that sometimes the world around me seems a lot more vivid and pleasant in terms of feelings associated with perception. I also sometimes feel a lot more like a human body than just particular parts of particular senses I'm focusing on.

When I don't feel like that it doesn't feel obviously wrong because it seems normal and I can even forget the better state. But when I feel like that it feels way more right. 

I can to some extent produce the better state on demand simply by relaxing and focusing on sensory input while giving less attention on thoughts and even suppressing them a bit. Though it's better when it arises spontaneously.

Recent experiences make me think the main factor might be expressing more of my own motivations and drives into action. If I'm really doing what I want to be doing, my overall life experience becomes better like that. If I'm doing something that only a small part of me cares about, my overall life experience is only a small fraction of what it can be."
I can‚Äôt recognize people.,28,hfoupc,11,"I don‚Äôt know if this even belongs on this sub but I‚Äôve experienced dissociation in the past due to severe panic and anxiety so I‚Äôm assuming it must be some form of dissociation. 
 
So here‚Äôs what happens, whenever I‚Äôm with familiar people I get this feeling of not recognizing them. To the point where they look different. They don‚Äôt look like anyone I know. I feel so confused when this happens because it makes me distance myself from people when it happens.

It just stopped all of a sudden...,30,elkjhz,2,"There's a good chance that this is just temporary but since Monday I've felt 100% aware of my surroundings.

I've always felt like this since I was born. I was diagnosed with ADD and Autism when I was 4 and was given social therapy until 9th grade at which progress slowed down until after graduation where I disconnected from everyone but to be fair I was always the one calling them and them not calling me at all.

5 years later I've my social skills have improved but has yet to make many solid relationships but then again that's a little hard when you have family that still relies on you and when you and your friends are constantly working.

I tend to stop dissociatiating when my social life improves but this time I think the exact opposite happened. I worked like crazy to visit friends that I only get to see once a year and I felt robotic. It was by no means their fault but I felt like I robot, I didn't know how to act.

On the drive back I didn't know how to feel. I talk to them but that's it. I get a few jokes in but I know how bad they can get and honestly I just feel stupid afterwards.

Call it whatever you want, I just want a life where daydreaming doesn't mean that I miss out on life.

I remembered getting frustrated on this FPS, people were talking in chat. I got angry and asked how they were so good.

They responded with ""I don't hesitate"". It's a simple thing to do but I always forget because I'm too busy overthinking and zoning out.

Fortune cookie advise snapped me out of it, it's been 2 days since it stopped and life is already improving. I've got projects lined up, a list of psychiatrists to try to prevent a relapse, and I've forgotten how good it feels to experience a day minute by minute.

But I'm not going anywhere. I don't know what will happen but I'll do what I can to continue to live my life so as long as I'm willing to change things for the better.

Good luck to all of you"
There has to be some way to snap out of it. I don't want to deal with it anymore.,29,cyx465,14,"I've struggled with bad anxiety including a lot of dissociation for nearly 7 weeks now. On Saturday after having awful anxiety throughout the weekend and struggling to stop it for several hours I had my third and by far worst panic attack. It was so bad that I passed out and had a seizure from the hyperventilating, and ended up in the hospital. I left yesterday and since then my dissociation has been extremely bad. I feel like I'm high on weed but I'm not. I keep getting blurred spots in my vision and everything around me looks and feels fake. Every time I get bad dissociation I'm also afraid that I could die or pass out again. Every time I blink or close my eyes it feels scary and weird, I don't know how to describe it.

I've been on a prozac for a little over a week and the doctor had me stop taking it. I should have never taken it to begin with. They gave me buspirone but I need to talk to my doctor about it first. I'm also going to try and find a therapist who can help me. I don't know I just can't comprehend the fact that I passed out and had a seizure (no history of either) and ended up in the hospital.

almost no memories of childhood,29,cu9fhl,8,"the only ones i can ""remember"" are really specific and strange and im also not really sure if they happened because they seem so foggy and far away, almost like its someone else's life i watched in a movie

edit: a word

edit edit: i forgot to mention that the non ""happy"" memories i do have and extremely negative and my whole family denies they ever happened.

I‚Äôve been working from home since the quarantine back in March and I guess being alone this long and not seeing people everyday for work has put me in my head a lot more and has been giving me way too much time to think about how much I zone out and barely remember things and can‚Äôt stay grounded (I‚Äôve been going more crazy knowing that I disassociate than before I knew)

My post for today is about it‚Äôs gotten worse to the point where I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs derealization or depersonalization.

It feels kind of similar to when I get little sleep but I've gotten enough sleep today and I'm not tired, though if I closed my eyes I'd probably fall asleep. 

Pain feels dulled. Emotions feel dulled. I can experience them but I can't express them without added effort. 

I'm aware of my surroundings but I don't respond unless I have to. 

I flicker between a distressed ""oh god what's happening,"" and meaningless, fleeting thoughts. 

My body goes numb the moment I don't have anything else to do. 

When I become more aware everything that's happened before that moment feels like a dream.

It's been on and off like this for the past 16 hours, minus sleep.

Yesterday I also zoned out for half an hour, stared off into space until everything started morphing and changing colours.

Advice for how to pull myself out of an episode,28,f166kk,6,"I‚Äôve been depersonalizing/dissociating for a very long time, childhood emotional neglect/abuse and all that fun; this used to be a very common and frequent thing where it was a jumble of things that I thought were all separate.  I‚Äôve been doing good the past few years and was exposed to something that was a common occurrence in my childhood that caused an episode to happen, this gave me a really good chance to see how everything is tied together and what all I experience in an episode.  All that aside I need some advice to pull myself out of one, most of what I‚Äôve read is things like:
- read a book you like
- listen to your favorite music
- watch your favorite movie/show/video
- work on a hobby
- etc.

My problem is when I have an episode I can‚Äôt focus to do any of those, in seconds I zone out of music, movies, shows, and videos to the point the auido isn‚Äôt even droning in the background its gone and the visuals are completely ignored for getting lost in my head; reading is impossible because I will reread a paragraph over and over until I give up trying; I can‚Äôt do a hobby because I can‚Äôt find the urge to care enough to try.

Long-term dissociation and Getting worse (years),28,mewk9l,6,I feel like I'm.. Degrading fast and hard. Its been bad for years but the stress and anxiety and the covid-ity of the world and my personal life makes it so much worse. I want to be a person again and remember things and stop being...  gone for long stints of time. I miss experiencing life and remembering it and being there for all those moments
"I'm slipping away, very slowly.",27,l6ksuu,13,"I think I'm just slowly losing my grip on reality and my consciousness. It's happening slowly, but it's there.

I don't know what to do about this though. It's like I'm fighting an infection I don't know how to treat. My whole sense of self is being questioned, and often I don't know what I'm doing or how my body is able to do the things it does when I'm not really focused.

I'm really scared. The fact that I have not-alters (voices that until I get a diagnosis or a doctor saying they are actually alters I will not acknowledge as people) going on in here saying a bunch of stuff and just switching between themselves in the co-pilot seat and putting thoughts in the stream of thoughts doesn't help. I don't know what they are. I don't know what's going on with me. I don't know why I'm finding them at this time of my life. I don't know if they're real or just my imagination. I don't know what's going on. I wish someone just had the answer.

My only lead is that it's dissociation, but it's not tied to a disorder yet. But I'm just scared that one day I'm going to lose complete control of myself and just be lost, watching my life go by as someone in the co-pilot seat instead of someone who should be in the pilot's seat. Or worse, I could be put in coach and not be able to see myself doing things and just black out. Completely disconnect from reality.

I don't want that to happen though, but I'm so scared. I can't really do anything concrete with my therapist until we get a diagnosis from the psychiatrist, but I don't know when that's going to happen, if it'll happen at all.

I could use some help right now. I don't think I have anyone else to turn to. I don't know if I'm dissociating or not. I probably am."
has anyone else created a traumatic alternative/imaginary life since childhood?,27,kp5l9m,9,"I'm not sure where the right place to post this is but it's the community I've found that is that can be the closest described to what I've experienced.  I have started to feel uncomfortable by the fact that I still am expanding and building on this same alternative life in my head since childhood and was wondering if anyone else has done this? I think for me what is a bit, not shameful, but unsettling is that I have had a happy childhood and adulthood but this alternate life is quite tragic. 

Ever since I was a kid, I developed an alternative life, in which I am the central character. This life is a product of several interests of mine from royalty to travel to whatever. But as the protagonist I go through or bare witness to several traumatic experiences and I often find that I have long conversations with imaginary or often real life people (that I have never met, but have added to my imaginary world) about these events, where I reason out my feelings and thoughts on them. In this life I have a different name, position/status, that don't really bare resemblance to me in reality. 

Also this isn't a fantasy world like Narnia, but rather very much the real world - but I am a made up character in it. It has no effect on my normal life and I find it easy to switch back and forth between my reality and this made up one in my head. I have played at this character since I was probably 10 or so and am now in my mid 20s. I have no other imaginary worlds or anything like that - but this one alternate life has been the one consistent imaginary reality of mine for so long. It's mostly for entertainment but since this alternative life is way more challenging and traumatic than my own I find it unsettling that i do it. I certainly never want to experience the trauma I've created in this alternative life in my own real life, so I can't understand for the life of me if this is okay?"

How to date with dissociation?,27,jq2frd,14," How do I stay present and relaxed while talking and being on dates and everything.

It gets better,25,j5u5la,10,"My dissociation started september 2019 and I would like to spread hope and positivity by sharing my story. 

 I had a bad reaction to something in september of last year that triggered this horrible feeling that never seemed to fade after that night. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt there in my body for a couple months. This happened all the time, during practice, hanging out with friends and the worst of all times at my town haunted house. I had this horrible feeling in me and at this time I didnt know what it was. I started crying and had to go home. My mom picked me up and took me to the hospital because she thought I was having a seizure. Then, I went to therapy every two weeks for a couple months. I started to get better, but still had trouble getting back to reality at times. However, through AVOIDING FOCUSING ON IT and ACCEPTING THE UNCOMFORTBLENESS I healed and am barely affected by it now. This was hard for me because when I first knew that dissociation was what I was going through I immediately poured over reddit, quora and any article I could find about this subject. Every single thing I read told me it wouldnt get better, I would always be like this, and to learn to deal with it. This destroyed me. I was devastated and thought I had ruined my life at such a young age. For anyone whos read this same thing YOU WILL BE OKAY. Please overcome this for your family, friends and all the people that love you. I care about every single one of you and am so sorry if you are reading this right now, but remember that it gets better. 

Avoid focusing on it. 
Be comfortable being uncomfortable. 
Distract yourself. 
Take breaks if you need them. 
Make yourself a playlist
Use ice or exercise to make yourself feel something, these are grounding techniques. 

I love you."

Shutting myself off to the point of insanity,27,ilyv4y,12,"Long story short, I graduated from college and went to live back home after my lease ended. I work from home. I live with a manipulative, narcissistic mom and am surrounded by enabling family members.

More info:

I feel alone and am always on edge. The past few days have been rough. Been dissociating more than normal. 

To stay sane around a parent that keeps picking fights, projecting, criticizing, manipulating, etc. I shut down. 

But then you get hyper vigilant because you‚Äôre stressed all the time and it feels like you‚Äôre imprisoned in your own body. 

No one in my family has my back and I feel alone. It‚Äôs unreal. I don‚Äôt really have much privacy in this house, either. 

And I‚Äôm at the mercy of my narcissistic mom‚Äôs volatile, manipulative personality.

The other night, I realized that my memories from the past are real, because of a jacket I purchased then. That proved to me, what was real. Everyone has 'those days' and I really know that, you just have to fight through it. Hold on to something until you can stand on your feet again. I have too many good things in my life. I don't think that I will end that for myself. Sometimes I'm even happy, so so happy. I still have things that I want to do, I dream a lot, I make plans. But I don't push myself to do them.

Dissociating when i express myself,27,gmvsle,8,"Hi guys! I hope you're doing well and staying safe 
I noticed something today whenever i try to express myself i dissociate like i say the words but im not aware of them . Does this happen to you guys ? And Does it happen because when i was a child my teachers would punish me or humiliate me  whenever i gave the wrong answer  so maybe my brain associated expressing myself to being punished so in a way dissociation is there to save me from punishment.

I‚Äôve had voices before, very loud, obnoxious and anxiety driven voices that were there specifically there to stress me out- but this voice is a singular male voice.

Have you ever played Sims?,27,dxpfom,2,"I always feel like I‚Äôm a sim inside a computer screen, or a person on their own version of the Truman show.

I‚Äôve been on antidepressants for depression and mood stabilisers for bipolar disorder. I thought that my disassociations were being pedalled by these illnesses but despite feeling stronger mentally, I still just feel like I‚Äôm floating through space watching my life go by and watching my words come out of someone else‚Äôs mouth. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore because I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs real and what I‚Äôm just watching on the tv screen inside my head.

How would you describe disassociation?,26,dp7qwd,13,"Finding it very difficult to explain to others what happens when I disassociate.

They think it‚Äôs made up or that I‚Äôm just being silly. They don‚Äôt understand that I can‚Äôt control it and I‚Äôm not just ‚Äúzoning out‚Äù it‚Äôs so much more than that.

I find I forget everything and everything looses significance. I can‚Äôt think. I basically forget who I am and everything to do with me, without really forgetting. Like I have just possessed an avatar. I haven‚Äôt actually experienced anything from that avatar so nothing to do with it has significance but I‚Äôm expected to live for it despite not relating to it.

It‚Äôs like my emotions stop regulating. Everything is just like a big foggy dream without any details. Slightly terrifying but numbing at the same time but also you just don‚Äôt even feel anything. It‚Äôs like your dead but you‚Äôre not even you so it doesn‚Äôt matter. 
You seperate from yourself but yourself is just some meaningless object and everything is nothing.

Sometimes I don‚Äôt even recognise my sister as anyone. I don‚Äôt even recognise myself. It‚Äôs like im just watching a dead persons memories, that I don‚Äôt even know, without any context and then forgetting it all as I‚Äôm watching it.
You never know when it‚Äôll happen or how to control or when it‚Äôll end.

Has anyone else felt this before.,26,mgu9ir,11,"Do you ever feel so impossibly empty, that you aren't sure where anything starts or where it ends? Like you're floating at the bottom of the sea, or walking through pitch-black darkness? The thoughts in my head, are they mine? The things I say, do really I mean them, or am I saying things out of social expectation?

I had a psychotic break four years ago after a traumatic event. Lost a substantial amount of memories, probably won't ever get most of them back. The memories I do remember, they feel... reconstructed. As though they were something that happened to someone else.

I don't recognize myself, because all I see in the mirror is a face and a body that has never really felt like mine.

I thought I'd adjusted as well as I could. Some days harder than others, and all that. I though I was moving on and making my peace with all of it. Engaging in all the right things like work, hobbies, and so on. Even through 2020, I managed quite well.

Until I couldn't do it anymore. Something I only ever seem to realise in retrospect.

Lately I feel like an impostor stuck inside a stranger's skin again. It feels like some VR game gone horribly wrong. I don't know why that feeling came back. I haven't felt it in a long time.

Everything has spread out too far and nothing feels real. My emotions aren't mine. I just...watch this body feel them, in some strangely removed sense. I cannot focus on anything. I have to work so much harder at being ""present"" when I'm really somehow a million miles away.

That's the thing about the emptiness, isn't it. The distance from everything is welcome, until the distance *is* everything, and whatever existed before feels like it's gone.

Not really sure what the point of writing this is. Wondering if anyone can relate maybe."

I often drift into a whole another world, in another reality. i can be there for hours without realising the time and during that time i just lay on my bed feeling absolutely nothing.

it randomly starts with me not being able to speak, then not feeling anything. then i just disappear from this world. sometimes i end up there on my own will and sometimes it just happens. once during a class i suddenly felt like i was flying above the classroom and just couldn't really do anything.

i have forgotten years of my life. i don't remember anything from my age years of 9-13. sometimes i get flashbacks from somewhere in my life that are triggered by smells, places that i don't really remember visiting before that etc. and the problem is that i can't even tell if the memories are real.

Self preservation??,26,h9h7wb,2,"I have noticed that I often dissociate in social situations where someone could pose a potential threat to my feelings.

It takes a while for me to recollect these events... often when I am home by myself, where I feel the most safe.

I want to know how to prevent myself from protecting myself in this way. I want to respond in ways that are true to what I would really want to say. I want to protect myself in an intentional way, by standing up for myself and telling an M Effer to eff the eff off, respectfully.. or not.

so when my teacher was talking about dissociation i was listening and kinda drawing on my noteboook and i realized i was sorta dissociating but when i looked up everything was moving super slow like slow motion and a prickling sensation starting at the top of my head to my legs. and idk why it triggered me, but he was explaining it exactly how it feels but i just got stuck. it was like being ripped out of my body and completely dissociating. the best i can relate it to is when you get high and everything feels far away and really slow like a lagging computer game. except it comes with a lot of panic and paranoia. when i was leaving the classroom it felt like i was watching a tv show and everyone was staring at me. it was so scary cuz idk why it was happening i just had to get out of there. when i got to the bathroom i looked in the mirror and everything looked really disoriented and distorted. my face didn‚Äôt look like mine and any face i looked at freaked me out. and so i went into a stall and started having a panic attack and when i chilled out i went down to the guidance office cuz i was scared of going back to his room. so i just cried in the office.

I woke up one day feeling really strange in my body and feeling like everything I was doing I was doing for the first time, feeling panicked, helpless, not knowing how to wash my hair, feeling like a robot and speech being mechanical. I feel like who I was before this shift hid away or was suppressed. The initial dissociation was kind of a drug/escape I guess? I got a high off of it and it was nice to not think so much but being there...being so far away from my thoughts, from reality had a major toll and when I switched or shifted or whatever, it was terrifying....my mind went black, etc. My hair color also changed, everywhere, from a natural brown with red highlights in the sun to a blondish red color. The shape of my nose slightly changed. It‚Äôs like this baby or infant or child self kind of came out...sometimes I‚Äôll feel soothed when a woman with a gentle high pitched voice talks to me, it‚Äôs so strange, and I get this weird taste in my mouth and smell that my brain always associates with being younger...I also have had ongoing depression and had strange intrusive thoughts since the dissociation happened, which was 11 years ago, causing me to feel like I‚Äôm insane, isolating myself. Thoughts came that told me I was just copying others, that I was a plagiarist, that I should just stop being me I guess, being human...I even reached a suicidal depression last year and was hospitalized three times in 4 months. Doing better but my hair is in really bad health...forgot how to wash it during the episode and since, not much shampoo or conditioner will come out of my hair, even after 2 rinses. I cut it shorter but it hasn‚Äôt helped. I‚Äôve lost a lot of my curls and became in the habit of not pulling but coaxing split ends and I have bald spots üò≠. I just want to have healthy, pretty hair again. I was 16 when this all happened. I was working at my first job as a hostess at a nice italian restaurant with major social anxiety, I was on a psychiatric med that I had a bad reaction to as well and went off of it cold turkey a month before ‚Äúthis‚Äù happened. Also lost a friend who broke up the friendship because I was acting selfish and she was tired of me just venting to her about everything and not paying attention to anything else..had friend issues in the past too. And another friend of mine was changing...became into weed which I was against and was hanging out with new people. She even smoked a blunt with me there one time during that summer and I felt so uncomfortable and scared. I‚Äôve always been imaginative, oversensitive and I used to have an avoidant personality but not anymore...it seems like high sensitivity and imagination is a commonality with people who suffer from dissociation/depersonalization which I find really interesting. Anyway, what bothers me the most is my hair...not sure what to do to reintegrate it, make it cooperate? lol. I know what happened to it is definitely psychological-based and possibly hormonal as well. I also had blonde highlights in my hair at the time of my dissociative episode. Thanks. Sorry this was super long but hopefully it was interesting and maybe some people can relate?"
Feeling I‚Äôm faking it.,27,dfilby,17,I‚Äôve only just been told diagnosis that I have this but I keep having a feeling I‚Äôm making it up or it‚Äôs not real even though I‚Äôm gojng through this. Is this a normal feeling or reaction?
Anyone remember having DPDR as a child but not knowing what it was?,25,czds8j,6,"My parents used to yell a fuck ton when I was a kid, to the point where I was used to laying in my bed hearing  my parents screaming at each other. It was constant, day after day, maybe we went one or two days without a yelling match, but it always happened. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is wear my DPDR started, as I started not to care because (I think) I would start to dissociate. I‚Äôm not fully sure, but I‚Äôm guessing my dissociation started here. Also, I remember at one point I just decided to not talk back to my parents at all if they yelled at me or told me to do some stupid shit. I would be completely honest if they (mostly my dad) asked me something I knew I would get yelled at for. It was to the point where my parents never got mad at me for anything because there was nothing to get mad at, because I literally did not resist at all. I was definitely dissociating at this time, I may not have been but I‚Äôm pretty sure I was. 

Even my family started to notice, because there was a point in time where I hadn‚Äôt cried for half a year to a year, and when I did finally cry (because I thought my cat died), my sister and mom were kind of surprised, and even told me that they haven‚Äôt seen me cry in a long time.

My parents will never know this, because they will never understand DPDR, but because of all their screaming matches and arguments they‚Äôve given me a curse I will never be able to let go of. I‚Äôm not mad though, I don‚Äôt really get mad or hold grudges anymore. 

Just wanted to know, has anyone had a similar experience to mine? If so, what was it?

it wasn‚Äôt fully my parents fault, I admit smoking weed made my DPDR a lot more apparent. But still, I would‚Äôve never gotten DPDR from weed if that never happened I‚Äôm guessing.

My brother processed it a different way, and he‚Äôs a lot more emotional than me. I envy him, because even though he has a lot more mental problems than me he still kept his original personality, and he smokes weed almost every day and has no issues with DPDR. He has real, trustworthy friends that he can probably call family. I don‚Äôt think I do, or could ever."
Short comic about how dissociation can feel like for me [OC],26,c83qre,3,
Realizing in your 20s that something has been wrong,26,c3olwb,2,"So I recently told my girlfriend about this strange feeling I get pretty frequently. I told her about how I feel like I‚Äôm watching my self in a 3rd person perspective, and almost lightheaded but not how I usually feel when I become lightheaded or that I feel indifferent about everything around me and almost lost. She told that it sounds like I‚Äôm dissociating. It happened most of life as far as I can remember. I‚Äôm not sure if I should be worried because it always came in handy during times of stress like when I was in car accidents, traumatic experiences, or my job becoming hectic but I‚Äôm realizing that it also has prevented me from having genuine connections or losing friends because I lost interest in the world around me just because of how unreal everything feels. 

I just wanted to know has anyone ever realized how something you normalized your entire life could actually be categorized as a mental illness? 

And did you bother taking steps to become better? Or did you just brush it off?"
I wish this sub was more active,27,6xuvju,4,I guess it makes sense as to why it's not but I wish it was. I just came to a realization that I have a dissociative disorder with the help of my psychotherapist after only a few sessions. It feels so lonely and I don't feel like I can tell anyone. How do you tell someone you've known for so long that you a lot of times aren't there..

How much is too much?,26,jr7699,3,"I am finding myself very frequently dissociating (daydreaming, derealization, zoning out, going onto auto pilot ect.) and I was wondering how much is too much? Like, where is the line drawn between healthy dissociating and a dissociative disorder?"
Need help understanding my own experience,25,jaedix,11,"I had a really weird session with my therapist today. The time felt very distorted and on several occasions, I was heavily dissociated. I'm not very familiar with dissociation, but it seems to happen frequently. I feel like I'm not really there or like I'm watching myself or like time is paused (I guess would be my best way of describing some of what it feels like)

I also felt a weird experience. It's hard to explain, but I have a set of many (I think around 8-9) inner voices. One of the inner voices is incredibly sweet and acts like a caretaker to me in moments of stress or challenges. Well today during the session, after a period of dissociation, it was as if she took over and started doing the talking instead.

I feel like that doesn't make much sense - but yeah it was very strange. My memory of the session is patchy and I was having a lot of difficulty remembering things during the session. But my overall impression leaving was good. I'm just confused about what happened. 

Wondering if anyone can help explain my experience at all. Thank you if you can - sorry if this is the wrong place for this"
"""I don't know how to help you"" - My Therapist",26,j0ocgm,37,"Therapy for me is literally the final resort in the sense that there's nothing else left I can do for myself or any other treatment or test. We have no access to FMRI in NZ though, so that aside.

I don't want this to be a wall of text and I have enough info for a thousand walls so going to heavily summarize everything.

Had to fight to get government to admit fault for CPTSD events and then years to get them to provide therapy. I've fully committed myself and complied willfully because I truly want to get better - I also don't see how it could ever help.

And I guess, neither does she. We're 7 appointments in and that's what she said last time. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with derealization induced by extreme prolonged anxiety and CPTSD.

I said when I was 24 I started having brief moments of disassociation which got longer, then lasted for hours each day, then they became the majority of the day, then it was rare to come out, then I stopped coming out. I'm 33 now.

It has been about 4 years since I came out of disassociation.

She asked me to keep a diary gauging the level of disassociation and I described in detail why that isn't possible - basically I can't evaluate until it's well in the past.

She said it appears to her I can connect with nature, animals, and people though I'm not sure if she understands it's only in the moment and doesn't last. She says it seems I'm purely disconnected from myself.

Also when I became fully disassociated I didn't stop getting worse. You aren't either in or not in an episode. It keeps degrading.

Basically the issue for her is that there is no longer any way to identify triggers and all of her techniques require it to be episodic.

I spent all the time I needed to be in therapy fighting just to receive therapy and for doctors to take me seriously while my brain was shutting down.

I don't believe I have a future. I committed suicide early July and came so close, but now I'm more trapped than ever because of what it did to my family. I can't even tell them they're strangers and I can't know them in this state.

I can't live the rest of my life in this perpetual torture that no one else can see or comprehend on any level and I can't kill myself and it seems no one can help."
Physical sensations feel really ‚Äúthird person‚Äù?,24,izii3k,5,"I‚Äôm sorry to ask this here but Google isn‚Äôt being very helpful for me. I was wondering if anyone else has felt really dissociated, like, physically. Like when I scratch my arm or something, it takes a minute to realize *I‚Äôm* the one doing it and to actually find the spot I‚Äôm going for.

I‚Äôve felt this once before but it was after I got really high and stayed that way for a few days but I haven‚Äôt gotten that high sense and this time the feeling came out of no where. I feel like it could have to do with my ADHD (which has been getting slightly worse over the past few months) but I‚Äôm still not sure *why*.

I also feel kind of spaced out and a little mentally dizzy. I‚Äôve dissociated a lot but it‚Äôs not usually this physical. Usually my sensation perception is pretty much the same, or at least not *this* fucked up and uncoordinated. Any possible causes or advice for this??"

Dissociation as a child-Trying to find similar experiences,27,gwbmcz,13,"Okay so just found this subreddit and I'm really intrigued to know if anyone has had a similar experience in childhood. 

(I am not diagnosed, to preface, but I know I've experienced some form of dissociation my entire life)

My earliest memory of feeling like this was probably 5-6. I would lay in bed and often couldn't sleep, so my brain would go off on weird ideas. I constantly had this feeling of not being real, I can't explain it, but when that thought hit me I'd feel almost entranced and out of body. 

If anyone had similar experiences I'd love to hear them and compare"
It's really hard to tell if I've been dissociating or not.,25,gr2vbt,2,"Sometimes when my anxiety kicks up I'll suddenly have tunnel vision, then it gets kinda blurry, and its like im so hyperaware of my thoughts and my heartrate that i then forget the rest of my body exists and have a reduced awareness of my surroundings. Kinda  like the walls are closing in but the walls are my surroundings and theyre kinda hazy. And when im in this state its like everything is too bright, and when typing on my phone i seem to not fully think as i type stuff. My therapist said this isnt dissociation, as she works with patients with Borderline. She says when her patients dissociate they completely lose chunks of time and cant remember anything."
Dissociation from a non-traumatic event?,25,fuk6ai,4,"I've never experienced trauma, I've never had any mental health issues, and I've never abused drugs but just recently this started. My parents recently got a trampoline, it was really fun. In 2 days I was probably on it for 10 hours. Great exercise too, I felt like a little kid again. My goal was to do a front flip because I never did it when I was a kid.

Towards the end of the 2nd day of my attempts to do a front front flip and what I believe to be depersonalization started. It started pretty fast, I was already jumping for probably 4 hours by this point, with breaks of course and I already figured out how to flip. Everything was normal. I was getting pretty good at flipping and I wondered what it would be like to flip with my eyes closed. I did it once, it felt kinda cool, I did it again and it felt odd, I jumped again this time with my eyes opened and it started.

 I thought it was an interesting feeling and I kept jumping, I actually thought it was really cool. I felt like I was dreaming, things around me felt bigger and my sense of touch was either not there at all or delayed. I couldn't feel pain, I noticed this because every time I hit the ground before the depersonalization began, my legs would collide with my body and create a small jolt of pain. With depersonalization I did not feel this.

After a while I realized this alien feeling was probably not healthy and I started to become a tiny bit paranoid. I got off of the trampoline and I was surprised that it did not stop. While I was on the trampoline I was under the assumption that it was just caused by my repeated flips and would end when I touched even ground. 

While on the way to the door of my parent's house I looked at my hands. I realized that I have experienced this exact feeling as a child around the ages of 8-10. I remember throwing a football with my brother at my grandmothers house and feeling like I was in a video game. My hands looked different, like they were detached from me. Almost as though I am not in control. I also realized that everything in the immediate past felt hazy. You know when you wake up from a dream, and everything is scrambled and the memories of the dream fade quickly?

I went inside and talked to my mom about it, she told me to drink some water and sit down. But when I spoke to her I didn't feel like I was talking. It was kind of like when you can't remember whether you said something or not, so you just choose to not say anything. I hope this makes sense. The feelings continued for about an hour or two after that and I was scared it was going to stay that way forever.

I wouldn't be posting this if it was just a one time thing, every time I do a flip on that trampoline the same feeling starts again. It is a shame because that trampoline was really fun for a while. The obvious solution is to just stop going on the trampoline. It's not about the trampoline though. I'm scared that maybe the depersonalization will spread to other activities. I read that it could happen. It is also strange to me because everything that I saw online says that it is caused by drugs, mental health, or trauma, and everything else is just a rare thing that some people experience once or twice. But this is calculated, I know a way of experiencing it every single time without fail, could this be a physical issue like maybe the flipping is causing it? Or is it purely psychological? Any information would help.

I don't even know what to title this post, thanks if you read the whole thing."
Does this originate from childhood?,26,fm6pj4,11,"I read somewhere that said people who dissociate from trauma usually had some traumatic event in their childhood, which is when dissociation began.


Is this true? I can't remember any traumatic childhood event, but I dont remember so much of my childhood in the first place."
Was this dissociation? Running back and forth as a child,24,eo1cu1,5,"One of my favorite things to do as a child (if not favorite) was to pretend. I could create movies in my head with a flip of a switch. From my perspective, my eyes became tv screens showing various angles of some action / fantasy story. The real world would become non-existent, replaced almost completely by the stories in my head. As long as I was moving, I could be anyone doing anything.

From the outsiders (my parents) perspective, this was odd. What they would see is just me running back and forth between two couches making noises with my mouth.

I did this until I was 13 and only stopped because the weirdness of the whole thing became too much at that age.

The question I have no is was this a symptom of dissociation or something else?"
Do I have some kind of disorder? Is this dissociation?,26,emmscq,4,"So this morning I found out that dissociation is a psychological disorder that is recognized by psychologists and everything. I read about it and it exactly describes how I feel on a daily basis. I zone out intensely multiple times a day, to the point where I will be completely lost in my head. My eyes even go blurry when I zone out, almost like the muscles in my eyes are relaxing and unfocusing, and I have to flex them to see clearly again. Sometimes I feel like I barely process what‚Äôs going on around me, and it can be horrifying when I start to think about how fast my week is going by, how little I notice the passage of time. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm not fully living my life, and just drifting through it. Since I‚Äôm in highschool, it can actually be a pretty useful way to get through the day, like a coping mechanism. I can go numb and ignore all the stress and stuff around me. Parts of it are nice, but parts of it are horrifying. Sometimes I will be walking and just start thinking about how I‚Äôm a person and it can be panic inducing. I start to think about how long I‚Äôve been alive, but how little of it I can remember. I feel like my brain is broken and I‚Äôm retarded. So many things go by me that my brain doesn‚Äôt even process. I‚Äôve always been kinda spacey, but it has gotten so much worse since about a year and a half ago, when my mom killed herself. It‚Äôs like I developed it as a coping mechanism, but now it won‚Äôt go away."
always felt like i was in a game + there must be a main menu somewhere where i can exit,24,em8mc2,3,"ive been experiencing this since i was about 7, and i suddenly got hit with this feeling of being in a game with no keyboard, no controls to bring me to the main menu so i could exit or save. a vr game. it never caused me severe discomfort but it was always mildly unsettling. was this an early sign of my did developing? because it sure feels like it.."
My recovery journey,25,ed38ez,4,"I am writing this as a means of giving back to this small community which has helped me immensely in understanding what was happening to me for the past few months. Thank you all, I hope you all start to get better soon, which I am most certain you will.

I will be brief as I know all the talk of the why and the what may be reassuring you're not crazy but it also might reassure your symptoms which is not something I want to happen. Why? Because, yeah, you've probably heard it a couple of times by now - dissociation does not exist, per se. It is only a story your mind is telling you which you've become too accustomed to, to forget about.

So to recover, you need to let go of that story and focus on something else. What do I mean by that? Letting go does not mean:  
\- being distracted for several hours only to start staring at your symptoms immediately after  
\- doing something to distract yourself while constantly checking in your mind if you're better  
\- 'walking away' from it while still having your mental view on it

Letting go means absolutely not giving a F about dissociation and using your time and energy for doing something productive with yourself. Because you will be shocked when you look back and realize how much mental resource you have been giving to that stupid repetitive story. Try to realize this at this very moment, if you can. You really have to channel all your existing motivation, strength and desires into building whatever you want to be. DON'T focus on the results, focus on the effort you're putting in whatever you're doing. Try to be in the ""doing"" at the moment as much as you can. Create yourself, starting as soon as possible. Don't question it, just start doing IT. ""It"" being anything that makes you not think as much and asserts your personality.

Dissociation is a thought process so overthinking just aggravates it. This is why you have to start thinking less and start focusing on doing stuff, whatever it might be. Learning how to not get stuck on thoughts is vital. Try not to do any kind of drugs, including cigarettes or alcohol until you are in a prolonged good mental state. Once you start focusing on other stuff, a miracle happens - your thoughts stop being so stuck on that repetitive story and new, more productive ones appear. The story takes some time to fade away into the background and there will be times when it will revisit you, but remain calm and carry on. Letting go of dissociation is a process and it will take a while. It might be only a few days even if you've been dissociating for months. Do not keep track of it. Dissociation is like a scab which does not heal because you keep picking on it. Just do stuff that gets your mind off of it that is based in willful action and not in autopilot. Trust yourself unconditionally.

Trust in your power and your capabilities. Do by your virtues. Going through this is a wonderful opportunity to come out as your best self on the other side. You will go through this and feel whole, I promise you. The power is in you, you just have to believe it and stick by that truth.

Not sure how brief that was but I will finish with a quote which has really stuck with me:  
""Dissociation is a break from reality, to overcome it you must willfully assert yourself into reality."""
Today I finally accepted to myself that I was sexually abused. Except I immediately started dissociating and I was driving. All my surroundings felt fake and all the headlights made my head spin.,25,e6r2df,4,"I have been teetering back and forth on whether I experienced CSA for the last couple weeks. Today I finally said ""yep, it happened because of XYZ reasons"" and I immediately started to dissociate for some reason. More so than normal. 

I was driving at night, and all the buildings around me felt fake, almost like doll houses? The headlights from everyone else made me feel overstimulated. I almost felt like I was high on weed but I wasn't. 

I also kept thinking I was in a different location than I was. When I finally got home I had to lie down because I felt way too off to do anything else. 

I haven't dissociated this hard in awhile."
dissociation and memory loss?,26,dsttu4,7,"recently i went through a period of depersonalisation n general dissociation-ness (for about 2 months on and off, it got really intense sometimes and escalated into a panic attack one night in september and ended up w me shaving a portion of my eyebrow). i‚Äôve noticed my concept of time is disintegrating. one moment it‚Äôs 11 am, the other it‚Äôs 3 pm and it‚Äôs so strange to me? i can barely get my thoughts together- when i‚Äôm not thinking about . the absurdity of thoughts and questioning if they‚Äôre real, or if anything or anyone is. i can cram in info for a test the day before (it takes a lot of strength) but my memory in general . has turned shitty- my brain is stuck in this permanent fog, it feels like murky stagnant water. how do you guys deal with stuff like this?"
Dissociation isn‚Äôt all bad,26,doj5j2,2,"Sure, it‚Äôs definitely a problem. And it affects things. I really wish I didn‚Äôt dissociate so much and I‚Äôm working on that, I think I‚Äôm getting better. But it‚Äôs also a coping mechanism.

How safe is it to drive while dissociating?,26,ce36dr,8,"I can never tell if it's actually dangerous or if my anxiety is just overreacting. Sometimes when I'm dissociating I don't worry about it, like when it feels more like I'm playing a video game. Sometimes, though, it's like there's so much around me that I can't keep up with or actually focus on what I see. Like I'm far away from everything and it's so overwhelming that I'm not even in my body anymore. 

I worry that it means my reaction time is slowed and I might not notice a pedestrian or car and hit them. Does anyone know if feeling slow means I actually am? How do you handle driving?"

First day not dissociated in months,24,k5u3rc,6,"Hi guys
I guess I'm just looking to see if someone can relate?

So yesterday I had my first day in months where I was not dissociated at ALL for most of the day. And it made me realise some things about dissociation...

1. Dissociation is the main reason I do (or don't do) all the things i hate about myself. When not dissociated i get dressed properly, brush my teeth, feel full after eating, stay hydrated, don't binge eat all day, and keep the flat clean. 
2. I'm a better boyfriend when not dissociated. 
3. Dissociation DOES severely impact my quality of work and ability to stay focused at work. 

But the strangest thing for me is that there is definitely a ""negative"" to not being dissociated. I'm trans, and found that when not dissociated my dysphoria is a lot worse  and really bothers me (usually its just background noise). I also found my anxiety to be slightly higher. 

I've realised now that my dissociation IS an issue - previously just got so used to it that I accepted it as normal. Is there hope for treatment to have more days like yesterday?"
I had my first significant dissociative episode today. Trigger Warning: Detailed Description,24,jt9kaw,10,"Today, I was triggered by something. I do not know what it was, but suddenly it felt like my mind was lagging behind, I could not think inside my head, my vision was tunneling, things looked 'off', I was going through everything like a dream, my eyes were wide open, I was hardly blinking, I was unable to introspect or contemplate, I was blanking on the events between getting from point A to B, my movements seemed jerky, I felt disconnected from my body, etc. It was weird, and lasted two hours at least.

I have had something similar before, but never so prolonged, and usually accompanied by vertigo and tremors.

I just thought to put this out there. I am sure someone else can relate."

Advice on how to deal with dissociation and marijuana.,24,jmhovh,14,"Hello, I‚Äôm 18 years old and am struggling with Dissociation Disorder. I am diagnosed with anxiety and have dealt with it my entire life. I do not currently take medication but have in the past. When I was 15, I tried smoking weed for the first time. I didn‚Äôt like it very much and was pretty nervous the entire time. The day after I smoked, in school, I had experienced what I would consider to be a panic attack. My anxiety shot through the roof, my body felt warm, and I felt what I now know as dissociated. Finding myself in social situations where I smoked a few more times, I realized I had dug myself into a hole to which I have yet to climb out of. I stopped smoking for 8 months and didn‚Äôt notice any change in my thoughts and perceptions of the world around me. I still felt dissociated and disconnected from reality. I took on smoking again as I thought, at the time, I was the only person who felt this way and things were not going to get any better. I now enjoy smoking weed as I have learned to seek its benefits. However, my dissociation has remained the same as when I first started experiencing it. I am conflicted as what to do as I enjoy weed and don‚Äôt seem to get better when off it. Thanks for spending the time to read this and if anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate the thoughts."
if this is a coping mechanism.. can I get a new one?,24,jjrwdd,11,"I know thats a goofy question. 

I told my therapist about my dissociation and traumas, we traced it back to where we are  pretty sure i've dissociated since childhood and that its just gotten worse since other traumas have entered my life. 

she described it as a coping mechanism, which until now I thought coping mechanisms had to be something you do on purpose to some extent. where I feel like I don't dissociate ""on purpose""

so okay, my brain is doing it. but like I forget stuff all the time, I lose interest in everything I care about, I feel like I have to pretend to be me? 

it affects my job, my relationship, my safety??? 

how does this help? 

I always thought I was open, I always thought that i was the type to deal with things emotionally early on so it wouldn't prolong but my brain is like lol no. 

what gives?"

Alien hand syndrome and deja vu?!,24,irxxd3,28,"So i've had 3 specific symptoms of my DP/DR diagnosis for about 2.5 years now that I havent heard of anyone else experiencing, so thought i'd ask on here to see if anyone has had a similar experience!!

The first is a kind of ""alien hand syndrome"" in which i will suddenly feel like my hand is cut off halfway down my forearm, and I can still move and control my hand but it feels like it literally belongs to someone else. When i look at and become aware of my hand, i ""know"" that its not mine.

The second is extremely reoccuring deja vu. Some days when i'm teetering on the edge, i'll have deja vu upwards of 10 times a day. Its pretty weird

And the third is not recognising faces. My best friends face, my moms face, my partners faces. I just would not recognise their face or know who they were. It started out only when I was looking at pictures of friends, then became also for faces in real life.

Anyone else?


Edit: this post seems to be validating me and quite a few others, so thought i'd mention some more of my less-discussed symptoms:

I get EXTREMELY irritable and moody right before I begin an episode. Any and every little thing will piss me off and i lash out and i cant control it. Its almost like dissociative anger before dissociative numbing??

Also, I have very intrustive thoughts. Not only ones related to the possibility of existence, but just generally I will get super horrible thoughts that occur more often than they would for a normal person. Sometimes they arent horrible things, but rather just ""fixations""? Like when i'm supposed to be focusing on something or even relaxing I will compulsively play one word over and over in my head or start having uncontrollable half-dreams or very strange thoughts. I know this is very common with OCD diagnosis (I dont have OCD) but it happens most commonly when i'm teetering on the edge. 


Anyone else for either?"

Anyone else get weak and chills before dissociating?,24,g1e748,5,I have been dealing with dissociation for years but this only started  a couple years ago. Minutes before I dissociate I began to feel irritable and weak and I'll get chills up my spine. I'll zone out a couple times before the real dissociation begins.

dear dissociation,23,fle9vz,3,"i hate you. i really hate you. that's all, i just really needed to get that out lol"
Constant dissociation,24,fg5ep8,6,"This is my first post to reddit like ever lol. But I‚Äôve been experiencing dissociation for years now and I just want it to stop. I‚Äôll start at the beginning I suppose, I didn‚Äôt have the easiest childhood & a lot of traumatic stuff happened to me, however I believe my dissociation stems from one particular thing, when I was 11 my brother was arrested (I‚Äôm 20 now) and it really sent my whole family through one of our worst possible times, I had a lot happen before but this was the worst. I‚Äôm not going to go into details about his case but I was very close to him and it was very hard for me to cope with what was happening, I don‚Äôt have the best family unit and nobody explained any process of what was happening, I was simply told what he was charged with and that was it, my mum started to go out more and my step dad left our family due to it. I was basically left to get through it on my own, I don‚Äôt remember much from that time but I do remember I self harmed and I would write creepy poems everyday about how much I wanted to die, I truly believed it was my fault when it was not, I had to move house to an area where I knew nobody and I had to move school where I also knew nobody, it was the one time in life that I truly felt so alone, this impacted on me throughout my entire teen years. The first time I really remember dissociating was when I was around 13/14 I just remember thinking how NOTHING around me was real and if I looked too long everything would simply crumble around me because it was not real, I looked it up online and I knew it was some sort of dissociative disorder, I didn‚Äôt tell anybody about my feelings and my family‚Äôs not the sort you could tell about having a disorder where nothing seemed real, they‚Äôre response would be that it didn‚Äôt make sense. I just sort of ignored it for years, I guess it helped me to cope being disconnected from reality, sometimes I don‚Äôt notice it but most of the time it‚Äôs in my head, I can‚Äôt drink alcohol because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm going insane due to this, the last time I got drunk I thought I was loosing my mind, I thought if I hurt myself it doesn‚Äôt matter because I‚Äôm not gonna me the next day I‚Äôll be someone else because my life isn‚Äôt real. I go thru life acting how I‚Äôm supposed to act and doing what is expected but I constantly do not feel like I‚Äôm here, I have felt like this for so many years and I don‚Äôt want too anymore, I want to feel normal and to feel real. I know I am here I‚Äôm not crazy and I know that I am physically here but it‚Äôs like my mind doesn‚Äôt make that connection and when I think to myself ‚ÄòI‚Äôm actually here this is actually real‚Äô I start to panic and get scared because I know this isn‚Äôt normal. I don‚Äôt know what I hope to achieve by writing this but please any advice would help. I just want to feel real and I want to feel like I‚Äôm actually alive."
Does your dissociation mess with your perspective?,25,ezdo0z,17,I had two pretty bad dissociative ‚Äútrips‚Äù today (i guess i would call them trips?) and my perspective was so fucked up my boyfriends head started to look smaller and so unproportional to the rest of his body and he looked far but close at the same time and i couldnt really process exactly what was happening does that ever happen to anyone? It feels like a really bad weed trip
I've been disassociating for years,24,eth47h,9,"I was sexual abused by someone in my family as aa child. It's my earliest memory and it stopped when I was 11 (after that person made me pee in a cup).

I'm 30 and started going to a therapist. They are the first person who I ever told. He told me, after a few months, he told me that I probably and experiencing disassociation. I thought I just daydreamed a lot, but it's always flashbacks of the abuse...like I am watching it happen to someone else. 

I'm feeling defeated because when I told my therapist about the abuse, the disassociation got worse. It's happening a lot and I can't control it. Even during therapy. It makes me want to die, I just can't handle it  anymore.

Does it get better? Help."
I‚Äôm v tall this Christmas,24,efibpq,0,"Disassociated Christmas. Came to my parents house, I‚Äôm so tall right now I‚Äôm having trouble sitting, washing hands, dish‚Äôs, I already fell over like full splay. At least they just think I‚Äôm clumsy. It‚Äôs p funny I must say"
Stuck in time for the past month,22,eerq3s,3,"Maybe it's been longer, but for a long time now I've been feeling like I'm stuck frozen in time, even though time keeps moving forward. I genuinely don't know what to do. Everything is so slow yet fast at the same time and I don't know how much more of this I can take before I have a breakdown. This is the worst dissociation I've felt in a while and I can't break out of it."
Dissacosating so hard I can‚Äôt see?,24,dzrja0,8,"I‚Äôm currently dissociating so apologies if this doesn‚Äôt make any sense. 
Today in therapy, I began dissociating. I dissociate a lot but it was while my therapist was speaking to me that I really noticed how severe it really was. I could only focus on her eyes and everything else was ‚Äògone,‚Äô so to speak. It was like everything was ‚Äòsmeared‚Äô and I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. Nothing she said made any sense. I don‚Äôt remember leaving. Everything feels weird. I don‚Äôt know who I am or who the person in the bathroom mirror is- I don‚Äôt recognize myself. Even as I type this I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm saying. I can‚Äôt focus on the words or what‚Äôs happening around me. 
Can anyone relate to this?"
Forgetting names?,23,dvlpqe,2,"I'm not sure if this is actually dissociation, but I have been noticeably dissociative these last few days regardless and I'm wondering if that influenced this....

Anyways today something sort of concerning happened - I forgot 2 people's names today.

Wouldn't be a big deal except I've had a relationship with both of them for over a year and very clearly know their names because I've greeted them by name countless times.

I just?? Could not for the life of me remember what their names were and it freaked me out a little.

Anyone else have sudden lapses in memory like that? Cuz it wasn't a comfy feeling."
What helped your dissociation and helped you stay in the present moment?,26,ds74wf,13,"I have been dealing with dissociation for some time. All of this year to be exact. Early this year I had a very bad panic attack at work that made me dissociate and feel very detached for about a week and then it went away. I have always struggled with anxiety. The dissociation went away for some time. And then it crept back. I was having very severe anxiety and panic attacks every single day. They got so bad to the point I thought I was having a heart attack or dying. I'm currently on medicine to help the panic attacks and they have subsided. (I still get panicky but it's a lot better)  Well..the anxiety and dissociation has not. I dissociate every day and its super scary. I feel detached from my body. I can't enjoy fun events or travelling because it feels so foreign and I feel like I'm not in my own reality and not grounded or present. It's like I'm seeing through my eyes and not with my eyes. Like a haze or dream like state. Although I truly know everything and everyone is real, it feels like it's not. Lately I have been getting dizzy. I have to focus when driving because I feel so out of it. Lighting is weird to me now, sometimes I feel like it's too dark or too bright when before I remember never questioning the light. I'm going to see a phycololgist but wondered what has helped with your dissociation/derealization? I want out of this so bad."
DAE feel like early Alzheimer's/dementia?,24,deqmum,8,"I feel so disjointed, for a couple weeks now.  Like things in life are happening, but not really that I can do anything about anything.  I can barely string two logical sentences together and writing is nearly impossible; editing my stuff (which i'm normally good at) doesn't even make sense anymore, I just wind up with fragments on fragments.   I am not angry, or disturbed or upset, or overtired.  I've interacted with early Alzheimer's patients, and I feel like I've seen them, just totally fine and happy, because 1) they don't, or only occasionally realize that they have lost something or are out of place and 2)they were pretty nice anyway.  My grandmom had dementia and that was something else, but I can't remember.  I'm hoping I'm only in a temporary spot - was pretty shaken by some things repeated 2 weeks ago and still trying to come out of that emotionally, even trying to unfreeze enough to deal with it in bits instead of just pretending like it wasn't a big deal, but it just seems like since then life and reality has been really weird.  Maybe I'm on the wrong sub, I just still feel like everything is passing by in a river and I can't even reach it; I think I'm standing in one place, but maybe I'm, I don't know, something else.  It's such a weird place.  Tried talking to my therapist about it today, but I'm not sure I explained it well, it's really hard to describe, and I seem to be getting worse at putting words on it, even though it still feels strong.  We were focused on some other big stuff and the only thing that made sense was the word disjointed.  Nothing connects, nothing sticks.  It bothers me, doesn't bother me.  Nothing I can seem to do about it, I do grounding but it doesn't change anything.  Meditation doesn't do anything to put off the feeling of being lost and that life is chaotic and that I can't do anything effective about it.  I know I'm living, but I'm not making any waves.  All I really know is that this state of mind is really quite odd, and that it doesn't make sense (no, not drinking or taking any drugs, other than 1 rx that hasn't changed in 6 months).  I've been making myself stay up, not hiding in bed like I'd like to be to just escape, but this is weird.  

Sorry, for the read,  I know it is rambling and unedited, and normally I wouldn't write anything like this, but I'm trying to write it out, just trying to force something to make sense of all this, hoping someone maybe can relate, I don't even know anybody in real life that might understand.  If this doesn't make sense or if it doesn't fit the sub, please feel free to delete, or tell me and I can do it."

I‚Äôve talked to medical professionals and they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs only dissociation but how do i live with it without panicking myself every other hour? for instance i‚Äôll be sitting and i just think hmmm having a body is weird, my voice sounds weird, or the worst what if life isn‚Äôt real. It‚Äôs hard to get these thoughts to go away and they‚Äôre very unsettling. In other word how do i stop questioning everything, how do i stop believing i my dissociation (ie. life is a simulation, not being real) Help would be greatly appreciated"

Found a way to keep things normal,24,lfrlqr,4,"I‚Äôm sure someone‚Äôs had this idea before, sorry if it‚Äôs a repost. 

I‚Äôve written down instructions for when I dissociate. Through therapy I‚Äôve begun to understand what each dissociative state is supposed to function as

So I‚Äôve written down rules and procedures to make dissociation less disruptive 

Me, being the main ‚Äúperson‚Äù, I‚Äôve worked with my therapist to identify the dangers, or the ways my dissociative states function. 

Writing down a guide book really helps, especially when you come back. You can check if the dissociative state followed the rules or if something else happened

So far I‚Äôve been able to go to school, get my work done, and understand what happens when I‚Äôm not present 

I highly recommend writing a set of rules, or having one notebook to write down the events that happen when you‚Äôre you, and when you‚Äôre not you"
"I feel stuck , long term dissociating",23,kjofpw,28,"Ever since my trauma , at 7, i been stuck in what i a few years ago realized was dissociating. I think possibly before then as well, but im not sure, i don't remember much of my childhood. As a child it was severe, as a teen it wasn't as severe, but as i aged it got worse again, i dropped out of school, and isolated myself completely. For years i been stuck in this dissociation. I feel depressed as well. I dont know what to do. Is there any way to escape this? I cant comuicate with people or focus on anything, i cant remember most things and im not even sure im alive anymore. I dont ever feel alive. For some reason talking online is a bit easier than irl.

Has anyone's sense of smell and consequently taste notably deteriorated?,23,k803os,9,"I feel much less for years, people keep saying how something stinks and I don't feel anything. Food has lost most of its appeal so I have to furiously season and flavour everything. Doctors are useless where I live and now they don't want to deal with you with these symptoms because covid... No matter I say it's been going on for years.

As a hypochondriac, I am afraid it might be some tumour... I will try harder to get some proper screening but in the meantime, I wondered if that's normal with dissociated people. Also, a curious thing is that LSD sometimes helps me to smell and taste like I used to, so the brain centre can't be totally broken, probably just disconnected, or that's how I imagine it at least."

Paralysis?,22,h99224,5,"Sometimes when I am dissociating , I find that I can't move. This usually starts in my legs, then sometimes spreads to the rest of my body. My body feels heavy, sometimes my limbs feel glued together or to whatever surface. This doesn't necessarily just happen if I am sitting or lying down: I've had it happen while I'm walking or moving about or standing. I can get stuck in this loop of trying to move, but somehow being unable to get the impulse to any part of me, but I can generally move if I am distracted from thinking about it...sometimes it's just hard to feel distracted rather than paralyzed and internally terrified, with my heart racing. I typically have this when I am triggered on the subject of one trauma in particular. Does anyone else experience this?

Overstimulation at the Grocery Store,22,gocc2e,3,"I hate the grocery store. If I have to go to the grocery store I will dwell on it for days beforehand. I'm always in a mildly dissociated state since my  out-of-nowhere status epilepticus eight months ago (turns out almost dying can cause stress), but once or twice since then I've had this 4 out of 10 dissociation that has occasionally ramped up to 11. I try to be scientific about things to help me cope, but unsurprisingly knowing what's going on doesn't make the experience better.

Something commonly associated with dissociation in general is visual issues like overstimulation. Part of what causes us to feel detached from reality is that our perception is literally not what it is supposed to be due to real physical symptoms. Our eyes are dilated, so we are taking in a lot of light. Our brains are moving a little too quick, so images are being processed faster than our consciousness can keep up. Because of adrenaline we're expecting our minds to be able to keep up with all the extra input when it just isn't possible - visual snow, depth perception issues, visual trailing, photophobia, the ""snow globe"" effect as I've heard it called - these are all things that are caused by actual physical processes. Wild to think about.

The grocery store is a horrible place for this. They're are lots of shiny reflective packages, laboratory-white lights, general commotion, all things that exacerbate the symptoms. When I think dissociation, I think grocery store. And I worry that my controllable 4/10 dissociation will turn into a 11/10 panic episode. Almost every time it's turned into a panic attack or came very close has been in a grocery store.

At a certain point, the biggest fear associated with dissociation has become dissociation itself. But a dude gotta eat.

There's no moral to this story, but I need to go to the store tomorrow so I need to hype myself up.

Fun fact: I'm also getting evaluated for epilepsy (obviously), chronic daily migraine, and even CSF leak, because all of these things can lead to almost exactly the same symptoms of anxiety-induced dissociation. They can even cause they anxiety itself. But no matter what the diagnosis ends up being, even if it is ""just"" a dissociative disorder, the dissociation will have been the worst part."
Can dissociation cause visual hallucinations?,22,fqya6g,28,I have been seeing things recently and hearing people say things that they say they haven‚Äôt
Am I crazy?,22,f3kalb,15,"I'm sorry if someone has already talked about this but I'm not sure if it's disassociation or something else. It started in middle school, I grew up with my dad who was/is very emotionally abusive so I'm not sure if I started doing this to cope or because I was so lonely. I've always had a very active imagination and in 6th grade I started pretending I was part of the story line in shows I liked. I feel embarrassed saying this but when I would listen to music I would pretend to be an important part of the storyline of whatever book or show I was into at the time. Like not talking to myself but having conversations with characters in my head or listening to music and creating funny scenarios/playing out an epic battle. I used to stay up almost all night playing out scenarios and catching myself making facial expressions to match. It used to consume my life but now I'm 22 and it doesn't happen as often. I feel really pathetic about it, especially if I catch myself doing it now. I'm not sure if I started doing this because of my childhood or if there's something wrong. Thank you for your time while I get that off my chest!"
Weird dissociative coping mechanisms?,23,exluok,4,"So I‚Äôve had depression/anxiety/dissociative issues for about seven years now. Several years ago it was terrible. I just lived in a fog, had no short term memory, stayed feeling outside of my body, everything would feel unfamiliar. Lately the physical feeling has been better and I don‚Äôt really get the dissociative symptoms unless I‚Äôm having a panic attack. 

But when I get depressed I develop strange obsessions and develop worlds inside my head. I get obsessed with strange things like a certain place I have no connection to and start daydreaming constantly about my life there. I used to get obsessed with a certain band for a while and learn everything about them, buy merch, drive hours to their shows and then go to the next one. I would also get obsessed with learning languages, learning about cultures. I just get obsessed on one thing for a while. 

I also have this obsessive tendency to daydream about a fake life. Like I‚Äôll start imagining my life in a relationship this fake person and develop their whole persona and identity in my head. That‚Äôs actually what I‚Äôm stuck on now. I got broken up with a few months ago and then started forming this fake relationship in my head and I have this fake apartment imagined and our fake lives and it gets even as obsessive as researching fake places to visualize/looking in google maps at a city I‚Äôve never been in that we live in in the daydreams. Then I‚Äôll cycle through scenarios/stories daydreaming about this fake life to the point it interferes with my real life. It‚Äôs really strange. Guessing some kind of coping mechanism sort of related to dissociation?"

Does anyone else ever feel almost like things are moving around too fluidly?,25,dhhfyk,6,It's hard to describe. I'm just getting this feeling the past half hour or so but I have had it before. I dissociate all the time but I sometimes get this feeling where movement looks and feels weird almost like it's moving too fluidly. It's always so scary and I can never easily snap out of it and end up thinking I'm going to drop dead. I've been trying to do better but I don't know if this will ever fully stop. Ugh I hate it so much. üò´
Autopilot typing,22,d2cq9h,3,"Sometimes I am writing and out of nowhere I will write a sentence unrelated to anything going on in the current moment. For instance, I was texting a friend and my fingers randomly typed.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all going to Hell.‚Äù I had not been thinking of this at all. It was hair automatic. 

Other times, I will type in a name of a fictional character that I loved as a child or the name of my cats.

I‚Äôll even find myself typing about eating cats. Not that I‚Äôd ever eat a cat. It‚Äôs just a random, yet consistent phrase that I have been typing at random for years. It‚Äôs always when I least expect it. 

Is this phenomenon linked to dissociation?

I am diagnosed with DID and have been for about thirteen years. I just am unsure if this is a common thing that could be linked to alters or if it is something that people without DID do as well?"
I‚Äôm dissociating and having trouble thinking. I‚Äôm not sure if having trouble thinking is because of it or a separate thing. Is anyone else experiencing this? It takes me more time and more mental effort to do things I used to be able to do easily. I feel like I‚Äôve gotten stupid or something.,24,cyhifq,6,
"Facial fragmentation, only seeing parts of someones faces",23,ctk406,12,"Anybody else feel like the longer you look at people (or just immediately) that their faces fragment? Like whenever I sit down with someone to talk I feel like I can only see parts of their face  instead of the face as a whole. Seems to be happening less so with photos. I'm trying to figure out if I've acquired face blindness or if anyone gets this from dissociation. Like everything else gets blurry.

Thanks in advance!"
How are you?,21,cjkxn4,7," 
Am I the only one who hates that question? Most of the time, my honest answer is ""I don't know."" The usual response to that is, ""How could you not know?"" Like... I literally don't know what I'm doing *while I'm doing it* sometimes, and you want me to waste energy figuring out how I feel?! Why?!"
Does anyone get different ways of experiencing the world around them and themselves instead of clear emotions?,23,c9w5la,2,"I've noticed that the same physical environment can seem very different in a different mental state because of changes in various feelings associated with perception. Everything stays objectively the same but feels very different because the feelings in my mind associated with perceptions change. These are countless nameless feelings, which feel like essences of whatever I'm perceiving. In general in a better state I feel a greater variety and complexity of these feelings, making reality seem more vivid. These feelings form the basis of enjoyment of simple mundane everyday things, and also a deeper and more profound enjoyment of especially enjoyable things.

The way I perceive my body changes as well. It never feels like not-me, but in a better state there's a lot more of a feeling like it is me. I feel a sort of ""me energy"" looking at my body and a sense of connection with myself looking at my face in the mirror. There is also a similar change in how I perceive other people.

I've known about this phenomenon for a long time, and saw getting into a state where I experienced myself and the world in the better way as a good achievement. I'm pretty sure I can say that I'm less dissociated when I'm in that good state.

However, there seems to be a further level one can get to, which I've only tasted a little bit. Many people talk about experiencing various emotions in life, and what I talked about above doesn't clearly link to emotions. Maybe I'm seeing the mental state changes which are the basis of emotions without allowing those things to fully develop into emotions."

Dealing with my dissociation with skincare!,23,add6ys,2,"I have a huge problem with my dissociation making my face look unfamiliar to me. It makes me not recognize my face as my own. So, to fight that, I've been going HARD on skincare. I have the entire area around my sink absolutely loaded with all kinds of masks, hydrating lotions, face washes, oils, toners, the whole nine yards. It's really helped me to see my face change as a direct result to the actions I take on it. My skin has cleared up, the redness is going away, and it's all because I am affecting it. Obviously it can't be someone else's face, because look, I see how I changed it! It's obviously mine! It helps me a lot to watch my progress. Not sure if that's any help to anyone else, but I'm just proud of myself! "
Dissociating every day.,23,a11jjj,2,"I tend to dissociate when I change scenery. I have a distinct feeling of being ‚Äúunreal‚Äù when I switch from one environment to another, and sometimes it carries on after I‚Äôve been in that environment for quite some time. 

Dissociating for me is easy to recognize because my mind goes blank except for thoughts like ‚ÄúWhy am I here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat am I doing?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this real?‚Äù Etc. My vision gets somewhat blurry and light and noises become a lot more intense. Usually, especially if I‚Äôm walking, I can‚Äôt feel my body. 

I‚Äôve learned to ignore this feeling for the most part, but it happens every day and it‚Äôs concerning. Sometimes it lasts a minute to five minutes and sometimes it can last an entire day. Sometimes I wake up dissociated like I‚Äôm still asleep, in a dream, somehow. 

Anyone else feel this sort of dissociation? 
Not sure if this is the right sub or not but I figured I‚Äôd give it a go. "
Anyone have horrifying dissociation but lately it‚Äôs good?,22,m54vhu,3,"Ok, I was diagnosed with depersonalization. And all day since I woke up I am really amazed. My beverages are already where I want them. I‚Äôm constantly delighted and feeling on top of things. It‚Äôs a relief because I think ok I gotta bring this cup here or put this away. 

And I walk over and the cups already there on the coffee table as I wanted to place it. Idk if it‚Äôs a side effect of this new antipsychotic. I always panicked when I‚Äôd dissociate full blown horror and anxiety sometimes for hours on end or 30 mins. But I space out so deep and so far.. ha .. key words. I‚Äôm overjoyed by these small surprises. I just now see why people use drugs to feel this. 

My brain just does it. Ole trauma from childhood and up. It‚Äôs a new skill I‚Äôve acquired I‚Äôm giggling. Anyone else experience? Or what other types.. idk
if starting this new antipsychotic and having hyperthyroid recently . Is allowing me to not suffer when I dissociate. Curious what you all think, and your experiences."

How can I help my girlfriend who is currently dissociative,22,luktzo,13,"
Due to a horribly abusive relationship that she got out of less than a year ago she‚Äôs developed ptsd, and is now dissociating for the first time because of some flashbacks that happened yesterday.

It started yesterday and has been ongoing today

I‚Äôm scared and I don‚Äôt know how to help

I‚Äôm looking up things to do but am a little overwhelmed and currently can only text her, though hopefully I can take her somewhere in a few hours.

She can still talk and remember basic things, but I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to get worse and I‚Äôm not going to be able to help when it gets that bad.

Is there anything I can do right now? Or any other resources I can look at that I haven‚Äôt seen?

I‚Äôm sorry for not reading all of the subreddit info I‚Äôm just kind of mildly panicking"
I feel like there's parts closed off or missing in me and it's scary as hell. Can anyone relate?,21,ltnf1n,9,
Is this dissociation?,22,lgenhn,8,"This is a list of things where I am not sure what they are,,


‚Ä¢Daydreaming

‚Ä¢brain fog"
"If you feel down listen to this üñ§ ‚Äò‚ÄôLost‚Äô‚Äô is a sad melancholic ballad I wrote whilst finding myself in the depths of depression and the state of dissociation. My song ""Lost"" made me feel soothed because I felt understood. I sincerely hope it can do the same for you üñ§",22,l9c8on,2,
How do I know if I‚Äôve processed an emotionally stressful event or I‚Äôm just dissociated from it?,22,kzx5xi,10,"I‚Äôve had dissociation for years, made worse my a medication I take. I feel more dissociated this year than I did this time last year. Something quite distressing happened last year in July, it induced a lot of feelings of shame and rejection, (and the incident layered on previous flashbacks). I felt myself dissociating while all those horrible emotions were coming up. I feel less able to cry now, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because this incident increased my dissociation or I‚Äôm less able to cry because I‚Äôve processed more emotions."
Remembering your life or trouble creating memories.,21,kw7v67,4,"Hi, I don‚Äôt really dissociate much anymore since stopping my meds. I was wondering if you have tips for remembering your life more. I had a near 2 years period that I don‚Äôt really remember at all (memories are slowly coming back). I think it might be cause I don‚Äôt 100% feel present in my life. I hate it, it‚Äôs terrifying. I remember moments more now but don‚Äôt have much sense of time and where things happen in a time frame. Anyone got tips to fix it? I do feel way more present now in my life but not remembering much makes me feel terrible."
Is it possible to experience dissociation/depersonalization/derealization without amnesia?,21,kspz45,4,"Sometimes I remember doing things and I know at this time it felt absolutely like something I would do. 
But later when I remember I can't recognize myself doing this. I Know it happened (even if it doesn't feel real) I know it was ""me"" who did it. But it doesnt feel like me or my actions at all.
It's like watching a movie."
i'm wondering if this is dissociation?,21,kefacv,5,"sometimes i kind of space out and become unaware of my surroundings, i get really confused and sometimes when i move it feels like im moving automatically, like a robot. i am aware of it but sometimes i dont try to get out of it,, as messed up as it sounds sometimes its nice to just be away from everything especially when im in situations that make me anxious. these usually last minutes to hours. is this just normal zoning out or could it be something more severe? 

ive been through quite a few traumatic experiences when i was a kid but as far as i know i have no symptoms of ptsd or anything as a result of it. if other mental illnesses could have anything to do with it, i do have anxiety and depression, but i have been suspecting recently i have been underdiagnosed. i have close family history of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."
Is it dissociation?,21,k3y1o8,2,"I was pretty certain that I experience dissociation, but a conversation with a mental health nurse today has made me very confused and unsure.

I experience periods where I scroll mindlessly on my phone, not registering what I'm looking at or what is around me, just scrolling and thinking, but not knowing what I'm even thinking, time is just passing - the nurse says that this sounds more like ""avoidance"" than dissociation, which has thrown me, because I found that grounding techniques such as rolling ice cubes on my head, having a hot bath and using hot smells could 'snap' me out of it, so I'm now paranoid that I've been making the whole thing up - I know that probably makes no sense.

I also get into a 'self hatred spiral', where I am attacked by derogatory thoughts and am unable to focus on anything around me, all I can do is curl up with these thoughts and it's so difficult to get out of; I also believed this might be a form of dissociation, but now I'm not so sure.

To your knowledge, does this sound like dissociation or just avoidance?"
Little gem from Tumblr,23,jk5c09,2,
Will this dissociation episode last forever.,21,itpgcv,30,Please someone help me. I'm terrified. I have such an amazing boyfriend who I want to spend my life with consciously and not in this fog. If this is how life will be forever then what's the point? Has anyone ever heard of a dissociation episode lasting forever. I've been in this episode now for 4 days and have an anxiety disorder but am not taking any meds.
Bodies make me nauseous,22,ireiih,6,"I've been trying to avoid people recently but that's hardly possible of course so that's how I'm feeling now again. It's like being trapped in a chicken factory together with these live bodies, and even their subtle smell repulses me and how  different each is from the other and there is no order at all. Looking at people just makes me want to cry, doesn't matter if man, woman, or child, I just get freaked out by their strange looks and this makes me want to drink myself into oblivion so I can just forget about everything. I just hate being a body with arms and legs and all that shit. I feel trapped

Edit: I can't cry btw because it makes me feel human and then I REALLY got a reason to cry for"
Tips for dissociative seizures,22,iju8ut,4,"School starts again for me soon, and during the summer holidays I started experiencing dissociative seizures. Mine look a lot like epileptic seizures, just not as stiff, and I get them whenever I get triggered, which happens a lot in school.

Does anyone have tips on how to deal with those seizures in school and on the way to school? (I take the bus and train).

I already got a medical alert bracelet where it says ""dissociative seizures, don't call an ambulance"" on it. And my friend is sewing a small bag for me that I can clip onto my backpack that says ""open in case of emergency"" where I will put my emergency meds, instructions and my mum's contact information inside.

Does anyone have any ideas on what else to do? I really don't want someone to call an ambulance because I have a seizure. That would just make things way more stressful.

Thanks already for your help!"
Am I crazy?,21,ib82pq,13,"Sometimes I honestly feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I‚Äôm a 24 year old healthy fairly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù educated female. I am wondering if I have some type of disorder such as a dissociation disorder or if this normal but no one talks about it or what.

Sometimes I just wake up out of what feels like a trance and I realize I‚Äôm a real live human and I live with other real life humans who also have their own lives. Sometimes I realize this once I come home to my boyfriend and I haven‚Äôt seen him in a few days and he just looks different almost but still the same and I feel disconnected from him like he‚Äôs a faint memory or stranger. Other times it‚Äôs when I look in the mirror but I look too deep and began closely examining my face realizing this is what I actually look like and this is how other people view me. Every thing feels very dream like but I know that I‚Äôm doing it/it‚Äôs happening to me, I‚Äôm extremely hyper aware of it. Ironically, I work in a mental hospital and treatment center for the mentally ill and dangerous, so I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about this. I know this isn‚Äôt normal and it comes in phases, it will happen for a couple of days and then I will become accustomed to my new reality and get used to it/it wares off, but then it repeats the cycle again.

Part of me makes excuses for myself, is it because I‚Äôve worked 50 hours in 4? I‚Äôm probably just exhausted and haven‚Äôt seen my boyfriend or looked at myself hard in the mirror in awhile. Or is it because I myself do smoke marijuana and it‚Äôs causing me to dissociate? Am I even dissociating? If I‚Äôm hyper aware I‚Äôm doing it, does that even make sense? Ahhh, help"
Hearing a voice,21,i6ez21,7,"This does not happen a lot maybe 3 times a year. But I hear a voice talking to me and making comments, it sounds like my own voice. It makes comments on everything I do. It's not really scary but still so damn strange because it has been happening from the age of 6. It does not really effect my life so I might just leave it alone"
Me: doesn‚Äôt remember anything from my past with extreme long term and short term memory loss... that borders early onset dementia...,24,i3x1ap,3,"Also me: can sing every song off an album I haven‚Äôt listened to since I was 16

How do you tell the difference between chunks of time missing due to disassociation or disassociative amnesia bad memory,22,gsl0ee,6,"Edit: i noticed a typo in the title. I meant to say how do you tell the difference between chunks of time missing due to disassociation or dissociative amnesia and bad memory 

Im trying to distinguish the difference because I feel like i have chunks of my life missing or im not able to recall even general information about certain times. Im not sure if this has to do with disassociation because mine was triggered more recently and i don‚Äôt remember disassociating much before then. I just wanna know if i have memory issues or not and if theyre linked to disassociation"
is this something to actually worry about,22,frpdc1,5,"this might be a mess of a post (im so sorry in advance im kind of a mess rn and my english is pretty bad) and i apologize if this was the wrong thread?

so ah first things first i guess? im 17 and i have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. im too scared to talk about anything else ( i was forced to talk last time resulting in my dx). the only thing i havent talked about but highly suspect is me having an ed but i hate self dx, it feels like im taking away from others who are actually suffering but please keep this in mind bc i think it affects how i see myself. i dont want to cause trouble so until im 18 i dont want to talk to any adults who know me. only a few more months. i am safe tho im quarantined w my mom and shes alright

i don't know if what i feel is like *actually* dissociation yknow? everything just feels like im faking. nothing in my life seems concrete, i dont know anything i dont remember anything. i dont know if im actually being truthful or if im somehow being a hypochondriac and just somehow subconsciously faking it. i just dont know. i keep a log of things that happen to me. more for therapy purposes so i remember. ill look back and realize how much ive forgotten

a lot of the times when i look in a mirror i cant ever connect? like the thing in the mirror and the thing that is typing to you right now are two different entities. other times i just dont feel like a person, not quite human. i just cant seem to connect myself to my body. its either i hate this body or this just isnt mine so i have to treat it nicely

i dont know if what i went through was bad enough to be considered trauma? i just feel so bad if im just hypersensitive and im making a big deal out of absolutely nothing bc i dont want to take away from others. some part of me thinks im just fine im okay nothing is wrong but another part is just this isnt normal. i wont talk about details unless asked in case the details are too intense but im like really sure my father is manipulative? every time i say i am uncomfortable with him hugging me he says ""oh then you dont actually love me"" but this usually only happens when hes drunk. there are other things but this is one that happens more often. afterward, i feel so bad like im treating *him* badly because I do not want to be touched. its usually only him tho and mostly men. i get so uncomfortable around men even if they are my friends. it takes a lot for me to get use to my male friends.

<quick p\*do mention but no details>

every time i remember something kind of off about my childhood i think i end up dissociating? i dont remember the things most of the time but i kind of freak out and disconnect like that didnt happen to me yknow? one time a p\*do sent me like REAL c/p and i freaked out. i cant remember anything from that week, i usually have really bad memory but i usually remember something but this time. nothing. but i must have been lucid?? i did okay in school which means i was there in some way. i cant remember. that was a pretty big one when i began to suspect that maybe something isnt right. usually its just days tho like some days are off. affectionately ive started calling this side when i cant remember stuff the guardian angel bc im like alive so i must be taking care of myself even if it is not me per se. and angel seem to fit so well since i have super big issues w purity and feeling clean :( i cant go to bed without showering at least once since i have to be clean. other times people cannot touch my things or i have to clean them w rubbing alcohol cos some dumb brain part of me says they contaminated it so i have to clean it

i remember i once had a whole breakdown complete with me crying very hard (i dont really cry ?) because im a dumb kid and i posted a picture of myself online and it was being interacted with by nsfw people and it felt like ,,, just so bad yknow? im still a child. 

im just so tired all the time. im tired of not knowing but im also so scared of knowing. it just feels like im not real anymore not a proper person

if u have any questions feel free to comment or dm me or something. im not the most coherent person ever so id be happy to clarify bits if need be. any advice or anything is lovely ! thank you for reading this if you got this far."
Video games are a great distraction when you live with uninterested parents.,21,fgpx8z,0,
trapped,20,fcytgf,2,"excuse the rant but here i go: this sh\*t is horrible. i thought i was a perfectly fine person just the other day. but now i look at people, even people my own age and it feels like we are universes apart. genuine connections are few, far between and fleeting. i am grateful to have online communities but i  need more real connections too. i also deleted all my social media apps off my phone today. hopefully filling my brain with less noise will allow me to create more. but everyone around me is in their own bubble of noise too. if you want to talk to the person next to you you often have to drag their face out of the abyss of a screen sometimes, and even then the gravity well of devices isn't so easily escaped from. hell, i'm even on a screen right now. the world right now often feels like it's own sort of dystopia. how do i get away from it all?"
Writing I did to describe my dissociation,22,f365iv,2,"For context, I'm writing a paper in college, and part of it is about my dissociation caused by my DPDR and my anxiety. I wanted to share it and see if anyone else could relate to it. The narrator and the guy are the same

&#x200B;

He sat across a portrait painted from glass. He had spent the day debating whether he could justify a trip to the museum just down the street. Before he ever felt a decision was made, he found himself in this small, derelict room. The motions are always a blur. Steps on concrete, a cold press of hand to metal, an exchange of cash. Perhaps a school was visiting that day. Maybe tourists were visiting, he supposed. He couldn‚Äôt really remember, and found it hard to justify his current position. The truth is, he never actually wanted to go to the museum that day. But sometimes the walls of your house become too much to handle. Sometimes the couch just swallows you a bit too deeply, and the walls just seem to cover up some impossible truth. So you have to take the initiative to leave and find *something* to occupy your melting thoughts. Even if leaving is unbearable, the sun bites a bit too harshly or the light offends your eyes, anything‚Äôs better than letting the doghouse tangle you in.

Those were the sort of thoughts he used to explain this sluggish vacation. The museum‚Äôs interesting, he thought. It has all sorts of varying and interesting things to consider, he thought. What he doesn‚Äôt know, or maybe what he doesn‚Äôt want to recognize, is that art doesn‚Äôt mean anything if you don‚Äôt let it in. After about an hour of staring at nothing, thinking nothing, he found himself sitting across a portrait painted from glass. It was in a small side room, in a hallway separated from all the main exhibits. The portrait was of a man he didn‚Äôt know, but he briefly considered what that man must be feeling. Would he hate me? Would he like me? What would I say to him if I saw him in public? The portrait‚Äôs glassy eyes stared back, they stared straight into him as if to say,

‚Äúyou already know the answer.‚Äù

He suddenly felt uncomfortable, and decided to leave. He decided that that was enough time spent at the museum, he should go home. No, I can‚Äôt go back home, he said aloud, I shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll go somewhere else. I‚Äôll walk into town. And do what? Spend money you don‚Äôt have? Sit around for an hour? It‚Äôs always nice just walking, don‚Äôt you think? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.

So that‚Äôs what he decided to do. The only problem being, since he pretty much drifted around with his mind drowning in a fugue state for a few hours, he had no idea where he was, and had no idea how to get out of the museum. Everything looked unfamiliar and foreign. Streets with no names and buildings that stared back in words he didn‚Äôt understand like postmodernism, impressionism and expressionism. Sure, when someone says it you pretend to know what they mean, but you never actually cared enough to look into it. Paintings tend to know when you‚Äôre lying.

Finally. The exit. He heard the entire room whispering to each other about him, and he wondered what he did to deserve the ridicule. His mind went blank, and the walls closed in again.

Did he go on that walk into town? Who knows, certainly not him. He just found himself at his desk, thinking about how tired he was getting. Did he receive a message from one of his friends? Did he eat? Did he do anything? Does he do anything?"
"When I look in the mirror, I actually like what I see",22,f2geeo,6,"I've been having periods of dissociation like symptoms where I feel like I'm no longer in my own body like my mind is floating and disconnected. Sometimes when I look in the mirror, my reflection doesn't seem like me, like I know I'm seeing myself but I don't recognize her.  

I have always dealt with self-esteem issues. I could be staring at a full-body mirror and completely tear myself apart. But for the times where I don't recognize myself, I don't hate it? Like I objectively find myself attractive?  

I'm not sure if this makes sense but does anyone else have a similar experience?"
There are more like me,23,ey95dy,0,"I have had dissociation for like 7 years now, when I was 12 I started hearing everything like a background noise, it had happened 2 or 3 times before but that time it stayed there forever.

I discovered randomly that it had a name, and it explained why I act so differently to other people sometimes. I nowadays have no direct big problems because of it, but sometimes its frustrating to not be able to care for other people or to feel my own feelings.

Seeing that there are more like me, you guys, makes me feel a bit less crazy. So thank you.


Btw if someone feels really bad about all this, I am ready to hear. Mine is not really hard, but I've read that some of you feel that don't even exist (I actually understand how that could feel because of how this feels), or shit like that. So if you are struggling to much, I am ready to hear."
Does anybody here dissociate periodically?,23,el42c8,4,"For example, every 5 seconds. I think that I have dissociative amnesia every 5 seconds a lot of the time."
Today I woke up..,21,eds9ms,2,"I‚Äôm not sure how to put all this into words but bare with me.

So I‚Äôve been dealing with this feeling for almost 9 months now. I‚Äôve been dealing with just anxiety most of my life. The past year has been pretty bad though. I moved to a new area for the first time, 4+ family members died, started 2 new jobs, my therapist went on a family leave. I had a panic attack for the first time 9 months ago. I was okay at first, but a few days later I slipped into a dissociation feeling, and now I just can‚Äôt shake it off.. the more I realize it, the worse it is. I get up, get dressed, pack my lunch & drive to work. I don‚Äôt even know how I got there half the time."
Anyone else just want to explore?,23,e1oyvz,7,(I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed by a doctor but I‚Äôve been experiencing most if not all of the main symptoms of DR/DP) Does anyone else just get into moods where you just basically want to explore? Like I‚Äôll just want to look at everything and touch everything and I‚Äôve noticed that I smell things a lot more now. I went to the store with my mom today and I just wanted to smell all the soaps and touch all the blankets and I just wanted to stand and watch people for no reason other than it‚Äôs just what my brain wants to do
"Dissociation, in my experience, is like television",22,dp6o2m,10,"Countless hours I have spent in my 22 years of life sitting in front of a t.v.. ask me what my favorite movie or tv show is and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell you my answer. If I give you an answer, I would be questioning myself.

It‚Äôs not because there‚Äôs so many to choose from; it‚Äôs because I can‚Äôt remember most of what I‚Äôve watched; I can‚Äôt even remember scenes I have watched on repeat and I have repeated a lot of scenes because it‚Äôs hard for me to grasp what I just saw/heard.

Dissociation is like watching television because a lot of the times I feel like my actions, choices, thoughts, interactions, anything that comes out of me or is a part of me doesn‚Äôt feel like it belongs to me.. everything is secondhand, unoriginal, something that is expected  to be done. I live in fear of disappointing others.

Except when I‚Äôm watching tv, I‚Äôm not liking what I see, I am very bored and uninterested and too lazy to learn anything new. Like there is a disconnect between me and the couch I‚Äôm sitting on. I can‚Äôt even enjoy the comfort from the soft blanket and fluffy pillow. I know these things are comfortable yet I feel so far away that I can‚Äôt sink in. I‚Äôm constantly floating.

What bothers me is that none of this makes sense to me. This doesn‚Äôt even feel like it‚Äôs my post or something that I‚Äôm typing up this very instant as I‚Äôm writing in the train.

I‚Äôm a teacher‚Äôs assistant at a daycare center. How am I supposed to help my students understand their senses when I can‚Äôt even feel my own. I‚Äôm living through another person‚Äôs point of view. I have no respect for myself. I‚Äôm not living the life I want to live but please, for the love of God or anything you believe in, I‚Äôm trying so fucking hard to be happy. I‚Äôm trying to make the right decisions. I‚Äôm waking up at 5 am to work out. I am sleeping the right amount of hours. I am saving my money. I am trying to learn something new everyday. I am reading again. I am spending more time with family. I am eating healthier (I really am even though I‚Äôm craving hot Cheetos) for the love of everyone you love I am fucking trying please believe me"
Does anyone else feel like their decisions are affected by dissociation?,20,dnu36f,11,"As the title suggests, does anyone else feel like their decision-making abilities are affected by dissociation?

It feels like when I‚Äôm having an episode I cannot relate to my surroundings and that my perception of reality is somehow distorted which makes me more indecisive than usual."
Anyone else get extremely heavy after dissociating?,22,bjnzdq,4,"For me it rolls in like waves and I immediately stop speaking. I go completely mute and it feels like I want to express some sort of emotion, but I am physically unable to. I lose hours to this."
"How do I bring myself back from dissociation, esp when I'm spending time with my boyfriend?",24,b9xu67,7,"i live most of my days detached from reality. usually not completely, i feel like im in a bubble or a glass box experiencing my life and i can feel and touch and hear things but not to their full capacity.   


when i'm with my boyfriend i get really sad because i feel like i'm not experiencing our time together fully. i'm physically there, even mentally there, but its like hazy and foggy. i can feel him kissing me but its not until i really focus and bring my attention to the kiss, or to the activity, or to the present, that i REALLY feel anything. And doing that takes a lot of energy so i can only do it for like 1 min.  


i don't know if that makes sense.   


I just don't want to feel so floaty anymore. Especially when im with him, i feel like i see, hear, feel, things happening, but am not absorbing any of it. "
I didn't quite forget. I didn't quite remember. Anybody else?,23,8umf1s,4,"Does anybody else have an experience where they completely remember traumatic events, but they attach no significance to it? I've even talked about the event nonchalantly and been kind of just emotionally detached.. or even joking about it. Then years later attaching significance? It's not suddenly remembering. The memory was always there. It's just a sudden onslaught of emotions and sequencing events. I've felt like it's the end of the sixth sense almost. Like I've replayed the 2 years following that trauma with new context and it made a lot of things make a shitton of sense. I'm just wondering if anybody has a similar experience of not quite forgetting but not really understanding. Thanks"
Remembering my life,22,mbj509,1,"Tw for a lot of things. 
There are a lot of things I feel I can't tell people because they'll think I'm lying. What has caused me to dissociate my whole life is having to suck it up and hide who I am. It's not like I don't want to tell everybody my trauma I just feel like I was never allowed to. I'm not allowed to feel anything ever. I feel like I've never been allowed to to the point it doesn't feel like it even really happened. Society does not allow an open conversation about trauma and assumes you don't want to talk about it. Maybe I do.
I was so sick as a child I almost died, I had an autoimmune issue and it caused inflammation that probably damaged my brain. 
My mom had dangerous men (johns) at my house often. 
My mom was in a coma from a car accident when I was 6. 
My mom did hard drugs. 
My father rejected me due to me being born with too brown skin, although a paternity test proved he was the father.
I was abused by my grandparents physically and mentally. 
I was abused by a friend sexually, and felt guilty my entire life for asking for it to happen again for 3 years. 
I was severely bullied in school. 
I chose to be in an abusive relationship because it was comfortable. 
I'm choosing now to address these. I don't have to ""get over myself"" I'm allowed to be sad, upset, and angry that these things happened. I'm allowed to feel every emotion at once about my childhood. This was years upon years of daily trauma. I refuse to wear something pretty and smile just because that is how someone is supposed to act. I'm allowed to be me. If you want to tell something you are frustrated you had to hide you don't have to worry, you don't have to. You're allowed to be upset."
just want to know that people understand,22,lu1m5z,11,"I don't know anyone else who dissociates all of the time and I wish I did, I just feel so lonely inside my own head but I don't know how to talk about it to people outside of my therapist because it feels like turning my soul inside out and showing everyone my deepest hurt and I couldn't bear to be so visible and open but still so unseen and misunderstood

sometimes I think that all the anxiety and panic I felt before it evolved into dissociation was just me begging to be comforted and my body fucking crying out for what it needed and I never got it so I just tapped out, like the fucking chemicals in my brain got weary and took the hint and gave up. It was better to just believe none of it was even real. 

and I just I don't know I'm 19 I feel too young to be this hurt in this way, I had to grow up too fast and sort out my shit all by myself and I pretend I'm fine but I'm not I'm so untethered I just want someone to say yeah me too"
inability to feel affection/bond properly because of dissociation?,20,l7brh6,2,"I've had this weird problem that I'm pretty sure is a kind of dissociation, maybe dissociative amnesia. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem.

It happens with most relationships in my life, but it's particularly bad with my s/o. A lot of the time, I feel strangely detached from him in a lot of ways. I don't feel emotion from anything he says or does. He'll be hugging/kissing me or whatever, but I feel like I'm hugging a lump of nothing, like he's not a person. Sometimes he'll be with me and I feel like he's imaginary, like he's not there at all. Most of the time when he says affectionate things like ""I love you"" they just fly over my head...they have no meaning. Often, I'll also feel like I've forgotten who he is...I don't *actually* forget, but memories feel hazy. I look at him, but I don't see anything familiar. Since I don't feel any affection or familiarity from him, I start to forget the things I like about him and why I'm with him. I also don't feel my own affection for him as strongly because he feels so unreal.

As you might imagine, this makes being in a relationship really difficult. I feel like I can't be a proper loving girlfriend this way if I can't feel affection for or from him half the time. It's like I'm a robot who can't feel affection. This is also hard in friendships and with family members, albeit to a lesser degree.

I've had this issue since I started having ptsd so it's probably from that. It's gotten worse recently, though. Anyway, I'm really curious if anyone else goes through a similar thing or has any insight into this."
Feeling odd physical sensations when dissociating intensely,21,kty3ph,3,"Today I woke up very late, which is something that makes my dissociation a lot worse. I couldn't feel myself physically being, and my vision felt foggy and objects around me felt unreal. But the weirdest bit was that there was tingling on the bridge of my nose, as if my glasses were there, but they weren't. I sometimes get the same feeling on the side of my head, like the glasses are compressing on my face, but they arent there. I've only started getting this feeling since I starting wearing glasses to help with blue light headaches. (And it becomes less noticeable/goes away when I put the glasses on.) Is this normal with dissociation, or should I be concerned?"
Does dissociation prevent you from forming & maintaining relationships ?,20,krmo5s,10,"^ Not even referring to romantic in nature but even just potential friendships - any possible bond in whatever form of relationship that may be. 

Sometimes when in the moment of socializing/‚Äòbonding‚Äô with someone it‚Äôs nice and all..

But afterwards you get the feeling of .. 
‚Äú that was me who was talking to them ? ‚Äú
And a slight guilt and/or wonder of,  
well, if we never talk again ... would I feel any type of way at all ? Not even hurt because I don‚Äôt even feel like i interacted with said person ..I mean, I last talked to them a week ago... to me that‚Äôs what I already consider a lifetime ago / a past life / therefore irrelevant possibly never even existed in the first place ...

Umm.. wth is wrong with my brain ?"
Am I dissociating?,21,kl4e3d,8,"Hi, I'm new to this subreddit.

I (21F) notice that a lot of the times throughout the day I'm simply not present. I get this daydreamy feeling, almost like I'm floating, and it feels like I go to some other reality (the one in my head). This happens especially during difficult conversations with my bf. Is this just form of escapisms, or can it be that I am dissociating?"
Help,21,kj5x17,6,I haven't really been able to come out of this state of what I can assume is dissociation. I can't seem to ever come out of it. What's wrong with me?

If you are in a right mind space to be reading this, welcome to a part of the internet I'm glad I found.",21,k48r87,0,"Firstly I just have to add a big trigger warning, even to me someone who is hardly hardly triggered this triggered me immensely so just note that readers discretion is advised, same for viewers discretion for the videos I will be linking below.

Thirdly, I have posted this to multiple subreddits because I'd generally love to see different people's opinions on this, show this incredible piece of art to more people, spread awareness about dementia, derealization, dissociation and depersonalization and generally share my point of view to start a discussion of this incredibly interesting yet morbid topic, and also share my experience with how I felt and a direct description of my derealization and dissociation episode that I got during around minute 18 in this video: [https://youtu.be/l\_x08kbj-Fk](https://youtu.be/l_x08kbj-Fk) ,which is a detailed description of the 6 hour album. Further in my post I will mostly be referencing this video as well the album itself, but here are some other links to videos that I also find interesting about this topic that were also talked about in video linked and talked above in the video ill mostly be referencing, as well as some others I've found interesting while in this rabbit hole, to which again I say trigger warning:

**Now to talk about the album and the subject matter itself**. To note: I'm not in any way shape or form trying to belittle dementia by comparing it to derealazing, but it's the only thing I have actually experienced under the umbrella of losing one's self and that is why I'm hugely referencing it. The music itself, even if I didn't get to the end of the 6 hour masterpiece is an incredibly beautiful piece of artwork really. It felt like it hit so close to home even if what they were portraying was a long life struggle the 20 minute format the video was in was the best representation in words I've ever seen describing someone lose themselves. Maybe because it was so short it hit so close since my episodes usually never last more then a few hours, even if its supposed to portray a disease that eats slowly at someone on the matter of years. Even if dementia is memory related, and I might have dug to deep here, I feel like the loss of that ones memories is directly correlated to the loss of ones self, what makes them them, the them loses itself and I believe that's why it felt to me at least like a walk I've done 100 times but this time the road was twisted to a destination that I couldn't remember, but of which I knew.

I am sorry for not being able to add more to the subject, but I greatly feel that saying more about the piece would mean much much less the intended. Even if I would want to talk more about hoe i see losing ones self in art, the piece should be let speak for itself. That is why I really recommend the video to be watched and maybe even the album been listened to in it entirety, because its worth it, it leaves you speechless the good kind of speechless and its an experience that's worth living.

&#x200B;

**My own experience with listening to the 20 minute video about the album:**

I usually listen to documentaries in the shower, the burning water hitting my skin caresses with soft spoken voices of things that otherworldly, world or so much resembling one that it switches to the other. Never had I felt the need to stop a video unless I didn't understand a sentence, but this time I needed to stop it because it felt like life flashing in front of my eyes while I was seeing dark, when all it was were my hands flickering into a void cause they felt the need to be held, while I was carelessly watching not nurturing like id usually do. The moment I stopped the video that moment my tears from the words heard before had stopped. That moment the panic settled in. That moment my hands went sporadically to scratch myself, as the me that's me when I'm not here was trying to itch the outside layer of myself off from my inner self to protect it, like a dog at an owners gravestone after the panic of loss had settled, they feeling of a knife at their neck while sobbing numbly. While the harsh finger nails were digging deep into my back and although what I was actually watching with my very eyes was a blurry representation of what was in front of me, I felt as if I was in my head or as if my brain was making me choose to also me in the back of my head. Watch myself from a 3rd person perspective in my head on a chair in a large room as large as many men greater then me had been driven mad at the thought of its size before. I was watching a horrid yet unusually calm video being played on a wall with a projector. The mini film playing was of me in the position my body had been seemingly stuck in for the time being as a young woman on a wooden stool, that made the decision to turn herself into stone, at the end resembling a Greek statue, in fear that the rodents at her feet would eat her up. The shots of the movie playing go as follows, the woman on the stool, the rodents come to her feet, she makes no change in expression. Following shots are zoomed in on each part of her body from the feet to the head. You can feel her fear as soon as you'd think the human eating mice would touch her flesh, then her feet turn into stone, what follows is a chase, a chase inside her mind, a chase of her being turned into stone while the rodents go up her petrified self, she makes no change in facial expression, but i feel her experiencing a courageous breakthrough as before her right hand is turned into sculpted marble she waves it in the air, leading to her final stone shape as an angel reaching for heaven. The movie playing then goes back to a full shot of the woman. The rodents that were on her frail body before disappear as fast as they came. They didn't puff in thin air, they didn't care what happened next their goal was defeated. With a glitch of the movie tape being played the switch from one frame to the other leads to their disappearance. The movie felt like was in slow motion, but my mind was making me watch myself watch it in a speed up manner so much that it seemed so distorted.

I am rarely able to state what happens in a derealization/disassociation mind set but this time it cut off right before amnesia kicked in. It cut off in a way making me feel complete, like if one second less or more had happened it would have all been shattered. It left me feeling complete, as if I had finally understood that I am what reality makes of myself, that is if reality even is, which I have not making that feeling even more strange yet familiar at the same time.

This YouTube rabbit hole has to have been the best one I've ever fallen in. I am deeply sorry for my lack of better words in which I didn't add much to the original, other then my experience and that is simply because during my listening of it I felt as it spoke for me.

Thank you for listening to my rant about this topic, its highly appreciated if you did get to the end, but now i have to ask you, how did it make you feel?

Have a cookie and have a great day. üç™‚ú®"
help,20,jiv1s9,2,"i really am at a lost right now, i have been experiencing dissociation for quite a while now, like while covid had just begun as it happened after i took edibles while i was in a state of stress. it really affects the way i think and feel. some days i just feel completely out of it like i‚Äôm not in touch with my emotions and surroundings and it causes constant stress and anxiety. i‚Äôm constantly tired and just feel numb. i went for my road test today and failed it because i just couldn‚Äôt think properly and it affects how i think all the time now. i really am just at a loss and don‚Äôt know what to do."
i dont know what‚Äôs happening to me,22,ja4vb7,16,"for the past few weeks ive been stuck in a dissociation episode, a few weeks ago i started therapy for my trauma but haven‚Äôt made any major breakthroughs, havent relived THAT much? i feel like im constantly high but not in a good way. the kind of high that makes you feel like you‚Äôre doomed or you‚Äôre out of it. the days feel so slow and so long at the same time? my dreams and reality feel mixed up and i dont know whats wrong with me. im scared im dying or maybe im going insane. nothing feels real but at the same time it feels so heavy. earlier i tried grounding myself and it worked for a second before falling back into dissociation. how do i get out of this? im so scared. absolutely nothing feels real. the days are starting to blend together. i think abt last week and i dont remember what i did or how i felt or if that was a dream. is that normal?"
Is dissociation always associated with anxiety?,22,ihvppe,11,"I dont have DID, but I do have depersonalization/derealization issues, and frequently ""zone out"" while being incapable of grounding myself. 
Im frustrated. I dont think this is being caused by anxiety, because im not generally anxious when I dissociate. 
I cant seem to ground myself, and since I dont know whats causing it I dont really know what to do. Any advice?"
idk who he is,21,iccn61,2,"he is someone else than he was yesterday

nothing really changed...but then again everything did

idk how to put the pieces back together

idek when they fell apart

idek at what point they fell apart

it all just blew up and then it was gone 

hmm

it must have been right after i woke up

it all just blew up and then it was all gone 

the world is strange and very sterile

i want out but there doesnt seem much better

an infinite loop and nobody is to be envied i find them to be just as miserable and more if they are already miserable without *this*. 

all concepts and meanings are lost, it is all pictures and weird angles of lightning 

and i forgot about him while writing all this, who is he again? idk. maybe he will forget me to, which is for the better because he shouldnt remember someone that has forgotten him

can i tell him i love him even if it's shallow and a statement blank as paper?

perhabs i could but i doubt he would feel anything....projection yes

i dont really understand it either."
I think I've been dealing with dissociation for a long time,21,i6yqa5,12,"I've been dealing with this for a long time but I've never really looked into it. I can look at things but none of it feels grounded, I can stare at anything even myself in a mirror and I feel no emotion and no connection to what I should be feeling, seeing, hearing. It goes in and out and I don't know what it is. Some perspective needed, thank you"
Reoccurring months of horrible mental health issues then literally overnight as if nothing is wrong at all - disassociation? Anyone relate???,22,hyk7xp,13,"Anyone relate? Horrible mental health episodes (disassociation, depression, anxiety, etc.) for months then overnight it shifts as if NOTHING is wrong at all (physically, emotionally, mentally) and I can smile. This has now happened twice in the past 5 months. I was having a horrible time trying to deal with past trauma with my therapist and it was like my mind was blocking our EMDR sessions because nothing would come up except to cry. Then overnight it was like nothing was wrong. I wondered why I even went to therapy. That lasted for a few weeks then all the negative emotions were brought back up to the surface organically over time and I had a very hard time functioning, this lasted a couple months and now in the past day, it's again, as if nothing is wrong. I am about to go inpatient for an eating disorder/mental health because my life was being literally taken over and consumed and now that I feel nothing is wrong, I question if I should even go.  BUT is all of this because my mind couldn't handle to process more so it shifted to protect itself from the pain or is there some weird thing that I really am ""ok"" or just for ""today"" but all the other stuff is still brewing under the surface. I have dealt with derealization and depersonalization as well as experienced mild alters. So anyone have any idea???  Thanks in advance!!"
Feeling Uneasy,21,h8ax0w,14,This is basically just a ranting post and also to see if anybody can relate. I feel so paranoid and scared all the time. I have reoccurring thoughts that I'm the only person in the world and that I must have imagined everything that exists around me. I avoid the show The Simpson's because of how many times it's predicted things that have happened irl. I'm scared because it makes me feel like maybe everybody knows what's gonna happen in the world and maybe everybody is against me. I also have really bad intrusive thoughts and I'm scared of possibly acting on them even though I do NOT want to hurt anybody. I keep thinking about all of the thoughts I've had in my life and all of the times I've changed my mind about things and it scares me for no good reason. I know not all of these things have to do with dissociation - I was just typing the things that were on my mind and things unrelated came up.
Can't move Bodyparts when dissociating?,22,grp0uf,6,"Just a few moments ago I was in a full blown dissociation and couldn't move my right hand...
Did this happen to anybody else?
Could't find something on the web and now I am seriously scared there might be something wrong with not only my mind..."
Sound Processing,21,gffx79,10,"Anyone else ever take a few seconds to process a sound, or even a minute? For example, if someone asks me what a noise was, I may have to go back and think if I heard something or not. Or I will hear someone speak, and not fully realize what they are saying but then suddenly what they said will be replaying in my head and I have to catch up. Anyone experience this or similar?"
Has anyone felt like their mind left them after something traumatic?,21,e6ltxb,2,"About one and a half years ago I injured myself. Doing something really stupid...but it basically caused me to completely dissociate from reality.  I  also have many physical symptoms due to what I did. I never got proper help or went to a doctor because at the time I thought I deserved It...obviously I didn't but that's what I thought at the time. It's been recently that i finally feel like I'm coming back to reality. Almost 2 years now. 

Anyone else ever feel this? Does it mean that maybe the dissociation is starting to get better? I hope so"
I'm afraid to meet someone who thinks like me,21,dzzwoi,3,"I have a perverse way of viewing alot of situations I am able to remove almost all emotion from all of my actions 
For example my girlfriend cheated and broke up with me and when she said that she want to break up I responded with ""I understand""
Or when I have depressive episodes (sometimes spanning months) and have suicidal thoughts and urges I'm still able to logically look at the situation and realize it's not what I want
However it's not that I fear death I would consider death somewhat of a win I wouldn't have to finish my degree and all of the stress and anguish that comes along with it. By this I mean, you work your whole life and then you die like you physically and mentally torture yourself and then you die and that's something I've always kinda had an issue with. I've never really expressed these beliefs to anyone and I'd be terrified of someone said it back to me because I know what I feel isnt ""normal"""
I feel so wrong all the time. I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore,21,dk0x6i,4,"I've been dissociating for so long i genuinely dont feel human anymore. I don't dissociate like once a day I dissociate all the time there is not a single second of my life that I haven't spent asking myself if this is all real. I'm scsred that it might not be psychological and I actually have some kind of brain damage but I don't want to sound paranoid or annoy any doctors I JUST FEEL REALLY BAD ALL THE TIME
My therapist say's itll go away in recovery but I really dont think so everything feels so SURREAL AND FAKE AND WRONG all the time i feel like i'm going insane"

I have a hard time believing my past life existed.,21,d5r8m1,4,"I don't mean for this to sound existential, but that's the way it comes off. I've been through a ton - TON of trauma the past few years of my life. I lost one house in a foreclosure, that was my childhood home. I moved into an apartment and eventually moved out a year later to live with my father who had cancer. I'd been back and forth to his house (He only lived 10 mins from me my entire life / parents were divorced) and then he passed away. Both homes were with me my entire life. All 25+ years. After my dad died the move out date was.... fathers day. The first fathers day I had to leave. I had no luck finding apartments despite frantically calling. From that point on - I went from a house that I'd lived in with my father for 16+ years to a hotel room. All in the course of one day.

At times I drive by them and just stare. It's in a neighborhood and I just roll past so the new residents don't notice me.

Everything in my life changed the past 3 years. I went from having my father and 2 familiar houses to losing both gorgeous homes and then being homeless for upwards of 2 months before finding another apartment. I lived in a hotel.

&#x200B;

What scares me is that I'll look at these houses and think of my dad and say ""No, this cannot be. How did I used to live this life? There is simply NO WAY that my life once existed inside of those walls. There is no possibly way that I once drove home to that house, walked in the door and sat down to watch TV with my father"".

I try to explain this to my friends and they don't get it. How could they? Seriously - even when I was going through it I didn't get it! It's now that the dust has settled that I don't even give a shit about who I am anymore or what life is about. I am just so, so broken.

&#x200B;

TL;dr - Lost everything in a 3 year timespan. Life is entirely different. I cannot believe my past life really happened because it is too radically different from my life now."
How I described dissociation to my friend,21,d0z25c,1,"For me, it feels like driving a car. I am in control of the car. Everyrhing the car is doing, is something that I made it do. But, I am not the car. When I drive, I feel separate from the car.

I feel like I'm living through a trauma I never experienced,21,a1wh3m,9,"As well as suffering from anxiety, depression and gender dysphoria, I've noticed that I've consistently showed some symptoms of trauma despite not experiencing anything particularly traumatic. I have an irrational and constant aversion to sexual activities, I often find myself getting irritable for no reason, I have trouble letting go of things from the past, I've recently started having nightmares related to these memories and my gender dysphoria and of course, there's the dissociation that has been around ever since my gender dysphoria has (it's fluctuated from major to barely noticeable over the past couple of years).

I know this is an awful thing to say, but sometimes I wish that something traumatic had happened to me just so I could point at something as a reason for my brain being utterly fucked down a well. But I can't because awkward relationships and not being socially adroit isn't traumatic it's adolescence.

My mental health has just tanked recently and I'm new to this sub...I guess I just want to know how to deal with dissociative episodes and how to work out if there is something from my past that contributed to it. I can't even tell if these feelings are legitimate problems or if I'm just reacting badly to a show I watched recently about coping with a traumatic past. That would be really fucking stupid.

Sorry. I'm a mess. Just needed to talk I guess."
Is this dissociation?,18,mi4pvp,3,"When you live your life on autopilot and with depression (for me also pure-O OCD), then after a few years something suddenly ‚Äúwakes you up‚Äù to what your life has come to.

How it isn‚Äôt what you wanted at all, you didn‚Äôt take the time to focus on what your heart truly desires, you settled for less, you hung out with completely wrong people, you made many wrong decisions, and you didn‚Äôt care enough to go on the right path, and now it‚Äôs too late.

It‚Äôs like you see ruins after a war, but now you can‚Äôt do anything about it. All because you weren‚Äôt ever completely present in the moment to notice the unfullfillment inside you, and you didn‚Äôt take care of yourself.

And because everything suddenly feels so strange, you feel disconnected with reality, and prefer to escape it as much as possible, with excessive daydreaming and internet use over many hours of the day.

I mean, I was always kind of a loner, but I always kinda routinely ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù myself with watching old videos from Youtubers every few months, and I kinda got some insight on what has happened since the time i last watched them, and that was how I got ‚Äúguidance‚Äù on my life (and what I should do next) from my ‚Äúpast‚Äù self..? Then once i didn‚Äôt do that, i would just feel weirdly lost, idk"
Imagine crossing two young girls while overhearing one say to the other: 'What kind of human is that?',20,m8gljx,7,"I'm used to alienation for some years and I thought it would get better for a while but this is scary. Children really have a sense to spot abnormal humans at a glimpse. There's no purer truth than the words of a naive and unbiased child spoken due to honest curiosity. Yeah, what kind of a human am I? Why can't I fit in? Why can't I relate to people around me? I don't know, but people notice. I like to believe they don't but these words from that girl broke this delusion. I'm isolated too much and don't have a job. This place never felt right."
Nothing..,20,m3mrcp,5,"I have no desire to do anything anymore, my sex drive is non-existent and my boyfriend is probably getting frustrated by now. I've been dissociating for a year and a half/2 years, I don't know the time just meshes together. I know I have to stop, I've got the banks looking for me, my phone's been shut off, car's about to be repossessed.. Nothing seems real anymore, when I do feel anything it's waves of panic that are quickly swallowed away as I slip back into the safety of nothingness. I don't know what I'm doing and I need help.."
I think I dissociated last night and I found something that wasn‚Äôt in my notes before,20,lc8mza,4,"Hi I‚Äôm using a throw away account, for reasons I cannot say.

i um don‚Äôt know what the heck this means, formatting is shit but I don‚Äôt care. 

I don‚Äôt remember what triggered this or even if this is disorientation or just ptsd? why I did I this or how this happened I have no fucking clue, because I absolutely do not remember writing this or something like this happening before.

Anyways this is what I found in my notes, 
(I edited out my name for privacy reasons of corse.)


You aren‚Äôt looking hard enough, you guys aren‚Äôt looking hard enough! It‚Äôs super easy to find my name but not your question! You aren‚Äôt looking hard to your question!

It's (insert my name here) That's In Front Of You, You Weren't Looking Hard, Of Corse You Weren't Looking Hard To You All You Guys Aren't Looking Hard To All You All."
Gratitude to my body and mind,21,kgid7g,2,"I have been really down on myself recently for struggling so much with depression and dissociative symptoms. Earlier today, I explored what it was like to feel grateful that my body and mind protected me for so long to get to where I am today, to have job stability, a very kind therapist, and genuine love in my life (with a select few). I just had a moment of thanking my body and mind for doing it‚Äôs best to protect me from long forgotten trauma and it brought me to tears. 

I just don‚Äôt want to punish myself any longer for doing what I had to do (even subconsciously) to survive. 

Feeling hope can be so difficult and frightening, but I feel hopeful today."
Struggling to Let Go,22,jwgqlb,10,"Does anyone feel like they have trouble letting their body take over itself when trying to ground for an extended period of time? Every time I try, I keep stopping. I notice the changes in my body and I begin to get uncomfortable. I know I‚Äôm heading towards a good place(home) and the changes are positive but what‚Äôs next once I get there? How will I feel? Will I feel depressed, excited or just plain normal? Will I return to the awful realization that brought me to where I am now? How do I live my life in a place I‚Äôve been gone from for so long? I don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs very frightening for me. Does anybody else feel this and if you do how‚Äôd you break out of it once you did?"
Is this a symptom of dissociation?,20,jsq2iq,3,"I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm experiencing is a symptom of dissociation or a slow on-set of what could one day become dissociation, or something totally different - let me know any thoughts.

Fairly often (maybe once a week or so) I get this sudden and random feeling that I refer to as the ‚Äúdaycare feeling.‚Äù The best way I can describe it is it feels like when your parent dropped you off at daycare as a young child and everything felt foreign and a little uncomfortable and you wanted to go home (mind you, this feeling has come over me before while I‚Äôm at my parents house with them there too). Basically it‚Äôs like everything around me and where I am at the moment doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúright.‚Äù
It‚Äôs happened at home, at school, at work, at the mall, you name it - it doesn‚Äôt discriminate. The feeling always comes randomly and goes away as quickly as it came...typically within a few minutes. I‚Äôve never thought too much about it, just assumed it was generalized-anxiety based (which I take medication for) - but recently learned about dissociation and wondering now if I‚Äôm experiencing a slight variation of that.

Thanks for any input."
Could dissociation be mistaken for autism?,20,jm0y0y,9,"I've learned that I dissociate a lot, space out, feel numb, have almost no memories from my life, and so on. Could those symptoms be mistaken for autism by someone who knows very little about dissociation (and is, perhaps, biased towards an autism diagnosis)? Especially when the patient is a child/teenager?"
Do you sometimes feel better than people?,20,jfjly2,7,"Moment of honesty here, i'm not sure if its because I dissociate or if I have another problem I need to figure out but. I feel because I can dissociate and that's why things really don't bother me at all (because I forget the drama anyways) and people think i'm calm/collected but really I just cant connect to me my emotions enough to react like a normal person.  

Does anyone have this sense of 'nothing can bother you' attitude sometimes and it makes you feel better than people because they get worked up about such trivial things?

(I know this sounds a-hole-ish, but I really am a nice person, but I know that I have this above side to me also and im trying to pinpoint if my dissociation has created some A-hole ego or something)"
Does anyone else dissociate like this?,20,ifpv71,13,"I tend to experience derealization more frequently, but sometimes when I experience dissociation from myself rather than my environment, I feel the need to willingly unfocus my eyes a lot. I also tend to have very vivid daydreams and I feel very detached from myself and what I feel (a hallmark symptom of dissociation). I mean, it‚Äôs like I know what I like, who I am as a person, and how I usually feel from day to day, usually anxious or nervous in some way, but I can‚Äôt touch it. I know it‚Äôs there but I can‚Äôt get there. My head is just.. somewhere else. I also tend to look at objects and think they have a certain ‚Äúvibe‚Äù or ‚Äúfeel‚Äù to them. Usually it‚Äôs neither positive nor negative. Just a strange feeling to be able to enter a whole other universe by just looking at a random object. It is a hard feeling to describe, that takes over when I dissociate, if it is a feeling at all."
Freaking the fuck out,20,hy3rzt,10,I feel like I‚Äôm insane and I feel like nothing around me is real or if I‚Äôm even real. Hell I couldn‚Äôt even be typing this probably because maybe this reality is all just in my head and you‚Äôre all just reflections of myself that I‚Äôve projected.
Is this dissociation?,20,h7m812,12,"Hello all. 

Sometimes I don't recognize my girlfriend, it's like her face is new to me. When this happens, I usually backtrack to when we first met. 

I also have this with my family as well. They look almost weird. I have to repeat to myself that it is my family. 

Sometimes this happens when I'm exiting a videogame or movie but sometimes there's no reason at all. (Now that I type it out, I notice a pattern it's usually in the morning.) 

Thank you very much for any replies, I'm out of my depth here. I live in America so no insurance or doctor."
I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle.,19,gm7j4b,10,"I can‚Äôt recognize my own hands. I can‚Äôt feel anything anymore. Nothing feels real. I‚Äôm addicted to video games and the internet. The only time I feel like a living human being is when I‚Äôm not in the real world. I haven‚Äôt done anything but play video games, watch television, or watch twitch streams for a month. I have a homework load which has built up to an unconquerable mountain. I haven‚Äôt done homework in a month. For about three weeks everyday I would get up in the morning try and do homework and then I would have a panic attack. I would end up driving like 150 down the highway convinced that driving into a tree would be the best thing to me. 

Ive now completely quit trying. I think if I ram my head into that brick wall anymore I will end up dead. I told my parents that I couldn‚Äôt do it. They have no idea about my dissociation which has been going on for a year. They think I just have anxiety but it‚Äôs much more than that. They tell me everything is going to be okay and that it‚Äôs okay if homework is late. They tell me to do stuff slowly. I‚Äôve done really well in school for my entire life and I was probably going to go to a really good college (I‚Äôm a junior) but this shit has completely fucked over my life plans. My parents expect a lot from me and desperately want me to succeed. They still think that I‚Äôm going somewhere in life but this has fucked everything up. On top of this I have so much more important things to worry about. I don‚Äôt feel like anything is real and it is the most lonely sensation you can imagine. I haven‚Äôt told a soul and it‚Äôs killing me. I can‚Äôt fucking do it anymore if I try to succeed I‚Äôm going to kill myself. I don‚Äôt know what to do."
Dissociation or just me zoning out and being paranoid?,20,ghjzcg,9,"Hey, so, I'm new here, haven't been diagnosed or anything, but I recently noticed I've been having a form of zoning out where everything gets fuzzy and blurry for random amounts of time. It usually comes on when I've been misgendered or deadnamed (I'm trans, ftm), but sometimes just at random as well. Occasionally I'll just go into the bathroom and stare into my eyes for minutes on end and it feels very strange. I can move around while in the very foggy state, but my body protests it. When it happens I kind of go limp, my mouth will hang open sometimes, everything will go from being blurry to barely in focus, and thinking about anything becomes a chore. I've never had any traumatic experiences from my knowledge, but I don't remember the large majority of my childhood. I use forgetting things as a sort of coping mechanism, so my memory is always foggy and it usually takes a while for things to register, whether it's people talking to me or emotional pain. When at school sometimes I won't remember entire classes. Right now it doesn't really feel like it's my hands typing out these words.

Anyways, sorry for the word dump. I think I'm just paranoid, but I just want others' input since I've already thought about this so much."
Thought I was someone else for 12 years,18,g3rn0s,3,"I went through a harrowing, unexplainable episode of depersonalization and then complete personality/identity annihilation when I was 16, with a huge memory gap beforehand, after playing this creepy video game with an eye that matched mine, hypnosis, etc, as well as dealing with lingering depression, anxiety, anticipation of my next shift at my first job as a hostess when I was already dealing with a lot of social anxiety already...also having gone off of an antidepressant cold turkey and everything built up and I dissociated. I experienced this eerie trance where I was walking around and talking about everything around me as if I was seeing it all for the first time...also some childlike regression and it felt like something came with me that wasn‚Äôt there originally that talked to me (almost like this creature that gave me intrusive thoughts and scared me). I experienced identity alteration, loss, mechanical-ness, fight or flight and that voice that told me I was a baby and if I was a baby then ‚Äú....‚Äù, trying to dismantle and isolate me from friends, from reality, as much as it could. Eventually I came out of the dissociation after quitting the job but that voice/presence was still there when I did, scratching me and giving this image of a baby when I woke up one day, thinking when I came back to my body. I never returned to who I was before because it made me believe that I wasn‚Äôt the same, that my nose was different, etc, that if I was a baby I wouldn‚Äôt be able to wash my hair, etc etc etc, terrifying things. 
I never saw myself differently because I never snapped out of the dp and dp mentality. I kept fighting to keep my voice but more and more, I lost it. It‚Äôs like I couldn‚Äôt remember anything that happened before I started dissociating, or it was distant. I‚Äôm not sure. I finally broke out of the delusion at 28, after seeing that my nose was indeed the same and going back through the memories. The tragedy of it as well is that at that point I didn‚Äôt even consider the possibility that I was one consciousness. I thought that I was an alter and that that was the dp, the creation of a new alter, when I never experienced DID in past years. I was so disconnected from my past that I never even realized this. I‚Äôve been experiencing PTSD for four months reliving what happened. I keep doing reality checks about everything nowadays to try and keep myself sane and prevent me from going back into the delusion. It‚Äôs just so heartbreaking that I‚Äôve been dissociating to keep myself together...though I think what I really need to do is relax and accept it all. Accept that it was out of my control. Unsurprisingly I‚Äôm having a huge identity crisis and trying to figure out who I am. I‚Äôve experienced seborrheic dermatitis and all kinds of physical stress for years and I never even understood why until now, and it kills me. It really kills me. Physiologically I became used to the stress, became used to my hair being unclean, became used to being a robot. And that thing that was talking to me and was attached? They‚Äôre called elementals that are like these organisms that build from certain scary thoughts, producing more of those thoughts in its host (me) to continue its existence. (I know how insane this all sounds). Luckily I got it removed back in December and haven‚Äôt had any of the random disturbing thoughts that I had before. The addition of Corona makes my epiphany and everything else even more difficult though.
Has anyone else had an experience like this or just thoughts period? I‚Äôm reeling."
Anyone?,21,fw5mdr,11,"Corona virus (not scared of getting it because isolating) making anyone else dissociate slightly? The whole scale of this pandemic and the rarity of it is taking me to a very low and strange place, anyone else feeling anything similar? Would be good to reach out. 

Thanks"
Time Dissacociation?,20,fj58bz,7,"Last night I struggled to sleep until almost 2am because I simply felt awake. I felt as though it wasnt night time, like it was noon, and I wanted to do something but had no clue what to do with myself. In my brain, I felt disconnected from time, like I was existing out of place in time. I wanted to just do stuff and be me but it was late and the house was asleep. I ended up staring out into the darkness of my room for a long time. I wasnt frustrated just confused because I knew what time it was, but time didnt feel real, I couldnt connect the two as a reality. After this leading to anxiety for no real reason I took some deep breaths and then I felt okay like something finally clicked in my head. And I felt exhausted, like completely drained and I quickly fell asleep. Im wondering if anyone else has ever experienced something similar to this? Could it be called time dissacociation? How did you cope and reconnect with reality? Im interested to read some thoughts."
My dissociated part keeps making a mess,20,fc35p4,0,"I think this happens at night like I've had a dream I've lost something and I guess I'm searching for it.  


I've lost many things in the last few years, my house and my friends and everything and I have no home now due to domestic violence. Sometimes when I wake up the house has been turned upside down, boxes have been emptied and rifled through and things are in disorganized piles everywhere.   


No one else lives here and no one else has a key.   


I have ban chronic pain and can't keep up with the mess. I'm exhausted (wonder why).  It makes no sense but i think I'm looking for my partner from when he was kind... in boxes? i have to remind myself this is not about logic. It's creeping me out."
I'm starting to think I've had multiple dissociative episodes and dissociation might be my issue,20,fb7mcw,6,"I'm not entirely sure. But for me, days literally go by and I wonder where all of the time went. Days and weeks mosh together and my sense of time just gets off. 

The past couple days I've felt checked out. I'm here. I'm moving and talking or walking to class. Someone will say something and I'll sort of be like, ""huh? what did u say?"" And zone back in to respond to them. I dont have any words to say. I'm either lost in thoughts or it gets to much and my brain legit feels like TV static. Like fogged glass and my thoughts, feelings, everything else is on one side and I'm staring at it blankly. 

My bestfriend says that when I get depressed I tend to just shut down. 

Another weird thing that happens to me to which no one really seems to understand is I will watch a movie or something and once I'm done I feel a loss of myself. Like I forget who I am because I got so caught up in the movie and the character. It's really weird and used to terrify me in the past.

Maybe its just being overwhelmed. Depression. Not enough sleep. I dont get confused as much it's more just zoning out for long periods of time. Not really being present at all. Like if someone was super tired and just sleeping with their eyes open. 

Idrk what I'm looking to say. I'm not looking for a diagnosis... more of just some insight. I'm late and I'm tired. Really needed to vent."
Disassociating in arguments?,19,f3xhii,6,"I have been seeing a counselor for about 6 months maybe 7 months. During this time, We have talked about some trauma from my past which has given me PTSD and I also learned/realized how my parents treated me as a child wasn't typical and toxic and not very nurturing. I haven't seen her since mid December because of the holidays and then just ""life"".

Over the past couple of months my SO (of 7 Years) and I have been having really bad issues. We have actually broken up, We are still living together since our lease doesn't end until April. I have a tendency when ever my trauma is brought to light to start unintentionally pushing people away, making irresponsible and reckless decisions...basically just spiraling through my existence and not knowing what to do or how to cope. I leave a path of destruction behind me.

 My SO other told me that I said some very vile, hurtful and viscous things to him that haunt him and he will remember them for the rest of his life. There have been 2 incidents like this recently but I have no recollection of saying any of the things he said. I KIND of remember us starting to argue. I think we were getting ready to go to bed and we started to argue and I remember i guess starting to mentally/verbally shut down and not respond to him and then the next thing I remember is Waking up the next morning. He brought up that he couldn't believe I said those things. I was confused and also defensive but I did not tell him I didn't remember any of that because I was embarrassed and I felt like I  was mentally crazy. I felt/feel remorse for saying those things and hurting him even though I don't remember it and I also feel sooo guilty for not being able to remembering. 

After we talked about what happened, He did tell me that my eyes were so cold and dark. It was like another person. That really scares me.

So my question is, Has anyone else had something like that happen during an argument or stressful  situation? Specifically having like anger and saying hurtful things? Is anger disassociation a thing??
I hoping I am not alone (All though, I don't wish this on anyone.) and going out of my mind."
Words seem unfathomable,20,ex1qny,8,I don‚Äôt know how to describe what I‚Äôm feeling. I disassociate. I feel empty. I feel like less than half a person. I feel disconnected. I don‚Äôt care. This is my reality. I want to cry. I want to fall apart. I want to just be. I‚Äôm numb.
Is dissociation feeling like ur in ur own world?,21,eqodlo,24,"So basically I‚Äôm at work, well in the bathroom lol. But well I just feel like I‚Äôm in my own world lol. Like I don‚Äôt even listen when people are talking, I just stare.....and it‚Äôs funny cuz I can like imagine/see myself staring. Even rn if I think bout it too much I‚Äôll stop dissociating. But it‚Äôs scary so I don‚Äôt."
Disassociation makes you feel as if you have brain damage or something is majorly wrong?,20,em2cjh,7,when I disassociate (which is 24/7) I get these moments I call going in and out and it‚Äôs basically like I re realize the moment or I re realize my life and it‚Äôs been making me feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with my head and that it‚Äôs more than just a disorder or something and it really freaks me out. my pupils are usually huge and I feel like my brain is fighting to stay grounded. Does anyone else feel this way?
Champagne was a bad choice,20,eihonq,2,
Time is passing. What the hell?,20,eicnw5,2,"Exactly what the title says. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is a dissociative thing or if it‚Äôs just me, but since I started dissociating, every single New Year‚Äôs Eve has gotten weirder and weirder. At first it was alright, but at this point it‚Äôs like... what the fuck?

Time is passing. Like, time is actually passing. And me being too spaced out to notice it or feel it doesn‚Äôt stop it from passing. I feel like it‚Äôs still 2017.

When I have a dissociative episode I lose all sense of time for as long as it lasts. But this is a more long term thing. I think I‚Äôve had some kind of low-grade constant dissociation for a few years now and it‚Äôs REALLY fucking up my perception of time.

Don‚Äôt know if anybody else is feeling this tonight but yeah. New Year‚Äôs Eve is weird."
what disassociating feels like to me.,20,ef8wrp,4,"im usually dissociated at like a 4/10 and then at school its like a 10/10. when im there i see all these faces, the same faces everyday yet theyre all so unfamiliar. i find it strange that everyone has their own face and their own thoughts. when i really think about it, it scares me. when im dissociated at school its not even a choice, i cant help but feel dissociated. my mind is blank all day and i feel completely empty of any feeling. ill try to think so that i can feel something but it takes so much energy and i dont trust my memory. i dont know whats true or real anymore. when i walk down the halls i feel like im floating through a crowd of souls that i cant understand. i cant connect with anyone, i dont even know how to anymore. i dont do any of my school work because it doesnt give me any sort of feeling of accomplishment or satisfaction, it just drains me. i sit all day listening to music, drawing, and sleeping. when i go into the halls i get this feeling of static or electricity throughout body, typically my head and arms. i think its probably overstimulation but who knows. when i show any sort of realness within me people get weirded out and think i need help. no one really likes me, they just like to talk to me cuz ill listen and offer advice based on my past traumas and whatnot. all i am for them is an ear. no one genuinely like all of me. theres only been one person who has and i know ive hurt her too and i dont want to hurt her more by putting all my feelings on her. i destroy everything within me and around me. time is passing by with out me recognizing it. things that happened months ago or even years ago feel like they happened not too long ago. i just feel completely empty of anything. i cant cry, I cant feel happiness. i cant feel laughter, all i can really feel it emptiness and anger. i just want to cut open every part of me to see im really even alive or if this is all just a dream or illusion. i dont care to live but i dont care to die. i just dont care. i am empty and i hate everything about myself, i only drive people away and think about myself and my emptiness. i dont know whats real anymore. its not even that i cant feel anything its just that i dont know how to feel anything if that makes sense. im just lost and trying to help the people around bit it tends to never work. all i want is to be there for them but it seems like i just dont know how to be."
The day that changed (destroyed) me forever,20,e8js5s,11,"This is gonna be a bit of a long read, but I got in to an off hand comment thread today that made me realize, this was the day that everything changed, and not in a good way. It hit me so hard and I figured it was high time I got it off my chest. Maybe someone here has some advice. I'm gonna do my best to keep it short.

I was 19 (32 now) and was ten foot tall and bullet proof. I had suffered from panic attacks but very rarely most of my life. I would take a .25mg xanax, but only when I REALLY needed it. I liked to drink beer and smoke weed, but that was the extent of my drug use. I never needed beer or weed, just enjoyed it. 

In the same month, both my best friends, moved to L.A., and my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me out of nowhere and moved away. Wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't return my texts? We had spent every second of ever day together for the last 2 years, and my friends were there 90% of the time. Now I was just out of high school, went from being surrounded by love, to never so alone... I was devastated, depressed, and broken hearted. I barely left the house. 

After maybe 3 months of severe depression I started to get these sinus infections. I would take a round of antibiotics, it would go away for a week, then come back. I was prescribed Percocet for the pain but I didn't take them. This went on and on for probably another 3-6 months. I believe I was sick mentally for so long that I became sick physically. This was by far the lowest point in my life so far.

Well one night, (I had a sinus infection again) and I woke up at 3am puking because I was in so much pain, my mom said ""we're going to the ER"" I never went to the hospital for anything, but she talked me in to it. When we got up there the ER doctor said ""I see you were prescribed Percocet for the pain, are those helping? I said ""honestly doc, I just smoke a little weed or drink a beer every now and then for the pain"" he said ""is that helping?"" Me- ""well no, not really any more..."" he said he'd be right back with a coy smile, and came back and hit me with the IV demerol. I went from the worst pain I had ever been in, mentally and physically in my entire life, to feeling better than I had ever felt instantly. I was hooked and I knew it. I didn't know how much trouble it woyld cause me until years later. 

They sis some scans of my head and sent me home. By the time I got home there was a message on the answering machine already ""mr. Sheehan, we found some anomaly on the x-ray, it appears there is something behind your right eye pushing on your brain, it could potentially be life threatening  and we have to do emergency surgery."" All I heard was, EMERGENCY BRAIN SURGERY. I started to bawl uncontrollably, I thought for sure I was dying, I have never been so scared before or since, I looked at my parents and said ""I don't want to go!"" They said ""we have to."" I knew they were right and all of a sudden the tears stopped, I felt like I was really far away behind my body controlling it like a video game and seemed to be insulated from the world, almost like reality was muffled. I didn't know it at the time but that was the moment it happened, the shock was trying to save me from the pain, but between it and the drug addiction starting in the same 24 hour period, there have been complications ad infinitum to this day. It was probably another 3-4 years before anyone was able to diagnose the dissociation, and same with the drug addicrion. 

Ok, that's it in a nutshell, I gotta go wipe the tears off my chest.


Edit 1: I really didn't expect anyone to read this story as it is a little long for this venue, so for anyone who took the time to read it and give feed back, I thank you immensly! I have known this was the day that changed my whole life, but I don't know if I have really recognized the gravity of it until I actually wrote it down scene for scene.


Edit 2: I guess I never specified what they found in my head, the infection had slowly turned into an abscess bigger than a golf ball in my eustachian tube, the tube that connects your ear to your nose and mouth, and well, subsequently tour eye."
I want to talk with someone,20,e72xsi,4,"I can't take it anymore, I just need to talk to someone. I can't get therapy right away, I have some interviews so I'll have money soon.... But it just isn't fast enough. I feel like I'm dying inside I think I need help soon, I don't even know what to do, I don't know what I'm feeling, I don't know who I am. I just want to talk to someone. I've been in a straight panic for 12 hours now, it really is just hitting me now that I've been having a severe identity crisis practically my entire life."
i dissociated so hard i took the wrong meds. i took my nighttime meds instead of my daytime ones. i remembered later on but i felt super sleepy an hour later. the rest of the day i spent thinking that some face was going to appear and i was super paranoid and scared,20,dmma97,8,
Sexual attraction?,20,cccmf8,7,"For those that dissociate during sexual activities, how the hell do you figure out what your sexual orientation is or who you're sexually attracted to? It's always been a giant question mark to me"
dissociation and total lack of consequences,21,ar7ud0,1,"So my boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. I cried for the first day, a bit of the second but since then I‚Äôve basically been an emotionless shell. I‚Äôm staying with my parents and am worried they‚Äôll think I was just faking being so heartbroken because I seem so unemotional. 

I think this is the worst my dissociation has ever been because I just feel so detached from life that I just don‚Äôt care about anything. I might get fired from my job but I don‚Äôt care. I might fail my final year of uni but honestly it just doesn‚Äôt feel like it matters. Nothing feels real. The last few days have felt like a nightmare that I‚Äôm stuck in. My memory is terrible, I keep seeing things (like my eyes morph things into other things and I‚Äôm aware of it but I can‚Äôt stop it). I don‚Äôt know how to explain any of this to my family but at the moment they seem to think I can go back to work and uni and function as normal. I can‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt want to. 

It all just feels like this isn‚Äôt really happening so none of my actions feel like they‚Äôll have any consequences 

(FWI: I have had history with dissociation as well as anxiety and depression and have spoken to therapists about it and they all just kinda said ‚Äòit‚Äôs just your way of coping. Deal with it‚Äô without really explaining it or helping me deal with it) "
Anyone else feeling like you're just observing life?,21,84xbpt,3,"I've been feeling like I'm not truly here since quite some time. I'm just an observer of this life. I'm insanely numb. Feeling like every day is a dream. I know that it's reality, but it just feels so dreamlike. Staying aware and taking control is so hard, when you're living such a distorting life. It's hard to care about it at this point.

Hey, it's my first post here. I think that I finally got some of my feelings into words."

"Everything looks super close but super far away at the same time. Sounds are super loud, I can hear everything.",20,m9kkr9,13,"Literally everything looks super far but so close.. I feel I could do anything without consequences, and that I‚Äôm outside of my body. Is this dissociation? Or am I in psychosis? Should I go to the hospital?"
I can't stop talking to someone who isn't there.,19,m6gc5x,14,"For a few months and especially in the past two weeks, I have been having conversations someone who I am (sexually) attracted to. I don't hear voices or actually see the person, but I look at a pictures of him a lot. I am 22, still live w/ family, have no job (can't find one and probably couldn't do it anyway) and am in college. I spend most of my days alone, isolated from my family, and fearful of leaving the house because of how I look and feel. For the past 7 years I have been socially isolated (and dissociated much of that time) and I have never formed emotional bonds to people (not even my parents). So naturally, I crave love and connection and have for years (but am disgusted w/ myself obviously). 

I talk to this person most of the day, sometimes looking in the mirror thinking I am talking to him while looking at myself. I do my makeup daily even when I don't need to to try and feel more attractive when I am talking to him. I am basically like [this lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uES3lA9OU), but usually less intense lol.  When I go to bed, I imagine him next to me. I don't think it's erotomania because I don't believe he likes me at all. I can pretend I am talking to him for hours, sometimes all night. I barely remember anything from the past two weeks. I have a therapist who does not help and I am on 30 mg of parnate a day. My depression is much worse since this has worsened, and I find myself exhausted everyday just wanting to be in bed or distracted. I feel like I am losing my mind. Talking to him has made me feel better sometimes, and I feel like it is the closest I can get to practicing talking to people since my social brain pretty much stopped developing at 15 when I starting isolating. Sometimes I laugh out loud, which I haven't done in years. But I feel so ashamed and weird. I just want to be normal, but I don't want to face reality, and I never really have and don't think I actually can. Does anyone know what to do?

Thanks for reading. Sorry for the long post."
Memories of dissociation as a child,19,m2hj6j,4,"I have dissociated most through my tween years until now and I just remembered this time when I was 10 or 11, that I was sitting on a bench at night and looking at a tree and the children‚Äôs playground around it. And suddenly it felt so unreal. It‚Äôs like the scene is in a movie and I can still see that image even now. I can remember I was talking a walk with my mom and she told me my dad needs to move to another city for his work."
Some conclusions,19,ldc39o,1,"Things I‚Äôve realized in the past few months
- detached states can provide security in times of stress and that‚Äôs enough to use it when needed
- there are a lot of complicated feelings around wanting to hide and the pull to be seen, even if a little
- I miss the people I love
- I wish I could love better
- isolation can be the trigger
- isolation needs to be reimagine
- I wish I knew how to better

"Dissociation likely from 2 family deaths, cancer, now covid.",19,k7h2ju,1,Is there a workbook to help me work through this tunnel I am in. Online courses? Good modern books on the topic? I really want out. Help please
Learned about this yesterday and want to ask,18,icosnt,10,"Just to say, I have appointment with my therapist this week also, just want to hear if someone else find this close to home, first hand source..

1. After i left high school 6 years ago i do not have properly set memory since then, like 2014-to this day all this time is one long ass day, without stopping last day and to new day begin. Basically most of the time when i wake up day after(every day) it usually feels like i'm continuing last day. Weird shit, have no idea how to make it clearer what it feels like

2. Woke up many nights in the middle of self convo in my head, my thoughts running and my head hurts from it. Some days while i'm trying to sleep i would catch some glimpses of inner talk, and when i try to remember them they are gone, whole memory, no idea what was i thinking. Also when we are at sleep, i've never woke up rested to this day in my life, no matter what. I guess some subconscious war is going on..  

3. Can not reach myself in a sense that i can not ""get it"" at all, no matter what i read, watch or listen, it comes in one ear and leave from another. I can't explain myself the truths about my life, big glass somewhere that prevents me from reaching to me. Nothing ""moves me"", i guess that's detachment. I didn't felt excitement when i got with my last girlfriend, wasn't exited when i started to drive this year, like nothing can shake me up and surprise me.. Or better to put, i ""can not believe that something happened"", like some period existed even though i have all recollection and memories, but it just doesn't feel real

Day to day basis - most of the time i spent in my head and thoughts, ruminating, making fights, having discussions, imagining myself speaking to someone etc. most or all scenarios you can think of. Im on autopilot and thoughts just racing and convo going. Sometimes you could enter my room and find me lying in bed, closed eyes, while i ruminate and daydream, or just sitting in my chair, looking at one spot and doing the same, or sitting in shower for 5-10 minutes doing the same"
"Addressing disassociation, medication or trauma related. I‚Äôm thinking both at this point.",20,i5clam,7,"Hi, my name is Val. This morning I was looking up ways to ground, and it said to find an online community for support.  I‚Äôm new to this group so please be patient because this is a whole new world or chapter if you will of my life. I believe I have been disassociating for awhile in my life, but I now know what it is called. Here is a post I made on another support group. 
 
I have decided that my posts will focus less on my mother, and more on myself. (Raised by narcissist mother, this is another new world for me, please be kind). 

Has anyone experienced dissociation because of childhood trauma, or trauma in general?

I noticed I am dissociating. I do have past trauma, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure why I am. 

I am seeking help for my dissociation through counseling, and tapering off a medication. We are under the impression that this medication I am taking is creating disassociation. I started feeling this way when my dosage for the medication went up. 

Anyway I‚Äôm wondering what are your thoughts? Experiences? And how do you ground yourself in the present moment?

What has really helped you? Have you experience disassociation when taking medication. 

I have so many questions lol. Thank you for reading."
"I think disassociation is appropriate, and not an illness",19,hm5dub,8,"I have no connection to anything or anyone in the world.

The entire world is owned by others and I have nothing, and have to pay to live in it.

I grew up without any of the above, so naturally I feel like I have no place in a world that only ever took from me.

My life fleets on by, without being experienced, while nothing changes other than my body aging.

I will never recover because I'm not unwell, given the scenario, my brain made the correct decision to disassociate and that scenario has not improved after 9 years of fighting for a life."
Constantly imagining being in a film watched by others and my past selves,19,gcz8n8,3,"Not sure if this is the ideal sub, but dissociation definitely feels to be a part of my unusual thought habits, and I'm looking to hear from other people with a similar experience.

I'll try keep this description short: For about the last 15 years, I have the very frequent tendency to imagine myself as if in a film, a real, documentary-like film, that is being watched by either other people (friends, parents, colleagues, particularly people who I want to see what I'm doing) or older versions of myself. 

The process: The more OCD manifestation of this process is that I often trigger it, like a tic, by tapping on a surface or blinking. I've managed to reduce this but it still happens.

Examples: Good: I'm doing something I think is interesting or funny or unusual, and I wish people could see me, but beyond wishing I *really* imagine as if they have a camera behind my eyes. Bad: rarer, e.g. when I feel I am being hard-done by and want sympathy.

The reason: On the simplest level, it's just a more intense version of '**I wish x could see my now**'. Except I do it probably 100 times a day and it's very intense. I am still able to live-in the moment to some extent, but I think this is obviously working against that ability, which is not healthy. 

The strangeness: I imagine anyone else who has this will have different versions or interpretations. For me, the strangeness, which I have completely normalised in my mind, will be that I imagine, say, 'people in the 1990s' or people in the '1800s' or 'my 17 year old self', seeing me in the present. In many ways these things aren't personal or emotional. They can be almost like a form of reverse futuristic fiction. For example, I might take pleasure in imagining people in the 90s viewing technology in the present day, and what they might think about it ('society has come a long way', or not, etc).

This may all seem harmless, but the OCD aspect, combined with the fact that it definitely seems like a short term series of dopamine hits, has made me interrogate what I do, and made me realise it might be damaging for mental health.

I'd be very interested to hear if anyone else does something like this. Obviously we all fantasise in this way to some extent, but for me it is near-constant and I suppose it represents a form of episodic dissociation, every day, every hour. I'd ideally like to cut down or stop. Let me know what you think.

**tl;dr:** I constantly fantasise I am being watched by others as a form of private entertainment, but I'm worried that this short term 'fun' might not be healthy. What do you think?"
Is this considered dissociating,19,garsvu,2,"I will add more to this if I can remember, apologies it's like 2AM here. But any input would be really appreciated I feel helpless in knowing for myself, I can't get a therapist atm and I'm too embarrassed to ask friends for their thoughts

I'm unsure if what I've been experiencing for years, especially as of recent, is dissociating; I'll try to explain it as best as I can.

During some points when I get upset, I end up getting emotionally numb all over my body, especially my hands, feet and in my chest. My body feels like there's nothing inside, just emptiness as if I was taken out of it and it remains a husk. I feel like I'm literally floating. (This aspect especially happens when laying down in bed, it feels like I'm unable to move)

I feel disconnected from the things around me, which causes me to lose focus. I can't communicate as well as I usually do, like I'm lost in myself and it takes some time to think of what I want to say if I even can. I don't think I've talked much with my voice during these experiences, it's been mainly over text.

I have been emotional during feeling this way before, but most of the time I end up lacking intense reactions and just go quiet. I'm either content in this or internally panicking

I feel like myself and the things around me aren't real, like it's some sort of simulation or fantasy world. Time goes by extremely fast, and after it's done it's hard to remember details even if it was something minutes before. 

And recently when thinking to myself about this feeling, I remembered I've had this same issue as a kid too. I don't remember much except multiple occasions where I was thinking about how everything is fake, and I would end up freaking out and try to stop it by distracting myself, I had assumed I was just thinking in an existential manner but now I'm not so sure."
Who am i??,18,euk0in,2,"    Okay so i‚Äôve been stuck in this disassociation state since last November (I have a traumatic past and something triggered a memory and my emotions just switched off and i‚Äôve stayed that way ever since) This past year my memory has gotten worse and worse but right now it‚Äôs the worst it‚Äôs ever been. i used to be out going and happy but now I don‚Äôt even recognize my voice when i talk, i genuinely can‚Äôt think of anything to say when having a normal conversation, i zone out during almost every conversation i have and forget where i am/who i am/what‚Äôs going on, i have ‚Äútunnel vision‚Äù and everything‚Äôs kind of fuzzy all the time, and sadly i‚Äôve lost interest in everything i used to love. Shit sucks. Does anyone‚Äôs else experience these? If so, how do you cope with it? and is there ANYTHING that could help at all to help it even a little bit?? I‚Äôve tried many different grounding techniques but they‚Äôve never helped me. Thanks in advance"
Is Constant Dissociation a Thing?,19,e9e0jh,8,"Most other people that I've talked to that experience dissociation only have episodes (like an hour to a couple weeks at a time of detachment from reality.) However, I've had it for as long as I can remember. It didn't really start bothering me until about a year ago though, because that's when I realized that it wasn't normal and that there's more to life and relationships than what I was experiencing. The only time I ever remember being connected to reality was a random hour a couple months ago. Other than that, nothing and no one has ever really seemed all there. Does that mean I'm going through something other than dissociation? Has anyone else experienced something similar?"
DAE put themselves in a situation where they knew they were going to dissociate today?,18,e3a0ag,2,"How did your day go? Please share your story. Mine is below. 

tw: incest mention 



I stood outside of my dad‚Äôs door for about 10 minutes thinking that I should just go back home. I felt guilty because I thought he was alone, but it turns out he invited his cousin over, the one he had sex with in his bedroom when I still lived with him. She was sitting on the couch. Everything was ‚Äúalright.‚Äù You know, that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not gonna say anything real‚Äù alright.  We just sat and watched TV. I zoned out as I‚Äôm so used to doing at his house. She was guilting me for ‚Äúleaving messes for my dad‚Äù because I left a used napkin on the microwave.  He was guilting me for not bringing anything. I helped him mash the potatoes because he doesn‚Äôt know how. We watched Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and they were commenting about how stupid it was and I was trying to explain that it‚Äôs not really just about a chocolate factory, this is a symbolic expression. But they didn‚Äôt really care, especially not when an Oompa Loompa mentioned how TV will rot your brain. 


He guilted me for not getting an oil change, which is funny because the only reason I need one is because I let him use my car for a year so he could get to work, and even when I wouldn‚Äôt mention that he smoked in my car even after asking him not to, he would guilt me for never paying for gas even though I only ever used it to get groceries ‚Äî and he didn‚Äôt help me pay insurance. 

I basically wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthere‚Äù for 4 hours. I didn‚Äôt even eat the mashed potatoes. When I was mashing them he just stood there and watched me. He saw me add the whole amount of milk and butter that he had in a measuring cup and made a comment about that. They were still lumpy. Worst off all he made one of his ‚Äújokes‚Äù about children being molested while we were watching Willy Wonka. 

I felt so free when he grabbed his keys to let his cousin know that he was going to bring her home soon. He runs on passive-aggressive nonverbal communication. Silence is golden... 

I left happy only because I had avoided an offer to go for lunch on Saturday. 

I don‚Äôt want to see him again. I‚Äôve had so many conversations with him about my feelings. I guess I‚Äôm supposed to be perfect and happy because that‚Äôll male him happy and maybe then he‚Äôll feel like taking what I say seriously. But I can‚Äôt do that even though I try to. I think it‚Äôs time to let go and mourn this relationship that I can‚Äôt make happen."
I cant keep living like this,20,dxkddv,2,I remember waking up one morning and I felt like I couldnt even recognize my own parents. I constantly zone out in social situations and Im already extremely socially anxious and Im just tired of not having friends. Not having anyone to talk to. I feel disconnected from the world. I know what caused this but Im too scared to talk about my trauma and Im just afraid of what the consequences might be of reaching out. I just desperately need someone to talk to.
A Sign,20,dkxzgi,0,"Today I spent 12 hours on a one page worksheet and I'm severely disappointed in myself. I don't remember what I did in between problems, actually I don't remember today at all. I don't remember a lot of things that should be remembered but I can't because remembering to remember is an unknown specimen to me. I forgot what I was going to say, so I'll just end this here."
Is this a Dissociation thing?,19,dgi77j,4,"Usually, when I have to give presentations in class, I space out for some of it, but I mostly stay present because I'm reading from a powerpoint or a paper and my anxiety keeps me alert (and very fidgety). A few weeks ago though, I was giving an extemporaneous speech (which is basically an improvisational speech from memory. Idk how to explain it really) and I remember starting the speech, but I then started to get really nervous after the intro. I felt like I was on the brink of a panic attack and then nothing. Just a total loss of those 4 minutes. I don't remember giving the rest of the speech aside from one moment where I stuttered and lost my place, but then it's blank again. I'm told that I did well (could work on gesturing and tone more apparently) and I received a 90% for it. We were supposed to post our opinion on how we think we did the night after the speech, but I couldn't remember any of it, so I made up some stuff about needing to practice more.

Anyway!! Has this happened to anyone else here? Do you guys think it's a dissociation thing because this isn't really how my dissociation works typically. I don't usually experience zone outs when my anxiety is that high."
Will I ever feel real again?,19,d3j9p5,4,I've been in a constant state of dissociation for three years. I've been to two different therapists but they were no help at all. I am beginning to think I will never feel normal again. Has anyone else experienced such prolonged dissociation? Has anyone gotten out of it??
23 Core Symptoms of Pathological Dissociation,19,cvfnnt,2,"Buckle up, r/Dissociation  today on our journey of continuing education I figured we should cover  some of the phenomenological domains of dissociation and what they mean. General  symptoms of pathological dissociation not only occur in persons with a  dissociative disorder, but also in persons with certain nondissociative  diagnoses (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, borderline personality  disorder, somatization disorder, psychotic disorders, panic disorder,  epilepsy, etc.). I consider the following six symptom clusters to be  general symptoms of pathological dissociation:

1. **General memory problems**.  General memory problems are nonspecific shortcomings in recollection:  poor day-to-day memory, ongoing forgetfulness, the subjective sense that  important events have been forgotten, feeling that poor memory is a  source of difficulty in daily life, and distress about poor memory. Such  memory problems are different from recurrent recent episodes of frank  amnesia. The trauma literature has documented the objective presence of  memory problems in persons with PTSD (Bremner, Scott, Delaney,  Southwick, Mason, Johnson, et al., 1993; Golier et al., 2002; Jenkins,  Langlais, Delis, & Cohen, 1998; Vasterling, Brailey, Constans, &  Sutker, 1998; Yehuda, Keefe, Harvey, Levengood, Gerber, & Siever,  1995). I believe that general memory problems have been overlooked as a  dissociative phenomenon. Some of these memory problems are assessed by  the amnesia section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV  Dissociative Disorders-Revised (SCID-D-R; Steinberg, 1994). Amnesia is  the first of the five core dissociative symptoms that are measured by  the SCID-D-R. Circumscribed Loss of Autobiographical Memory is one of  the 12 factors of pathological dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009);  that factor taps many of these general memory problems.
2. **Depersonalization**.  Depersonalization includes a variety of forms of felt disconnection  from one‚Äôs body, self, or actions: feeling disconnected, distant, or  detached from one‚Äôs body and one‚Äôs actions; feeling that one‚Äôs body is  strange, unreal, alien, mechanical, different, changed, or not one‚Äôs  own; feeling that one‚Äôs body and one‚Äôs actions operate independently or  autonomously, as if they were not directed by the self, and so on.  Depersonalization is the second of the five core dissociative symptoms  measured by the SCID-D-R. Depersonalization/Derealization is one of the  12 factors of pathological dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009).
3. **Derealization**.  Derealization entails perceived alterations of the relationship between  self and environment: feeling that the world is distant, far away,  foggy, or disappearing; feeling that the world has become different,  strange, foreign, or unreal; feeling that time slows down or stops.  Derealization is the third of the five core symptoms that are measured  by the SCID-D-R. The Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS;  Ross et al., 1989) also inquires about derealization.  Depersonalization/Derealization is one of the 12 factors of pathological  dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009).
4. **Posttraumatic flashbacks**.  Flashbacks are the core intrusive symptom of posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD). Every clinician who treats DID learns to dread the  power and destabilizing effects of flashbacks. Flashbacks can occur on  every channel of sensory and affective experience. They cause intrusive,  autonomous experiences of sight, sound, touch, hearing, smell, and  affect.8 Their affective intensity even causes behavioral compulsions to  reenact the trauma (Blank, 1985). At their strongest, flashbacks cause  the individual to lose contact with current circumstances and to become  completely re-immersed in a past traumatic reality. Uncontrolled  flashbacks are probably the primary source of anguish, pain, and  desperation that drive dissociative individuals to self-medicate,  self-injure, attempt suicide, and require hospitalization. Both the DDIS  and the SCID-D-R inquire about flashbacks. Flashbacks is one of the 12  factors of pathological dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009)
5. **Somatoform symptoms.**  Somatoform symptoms entail peculiar alterations of bodily functioning  that have no physical or medical basis. Most commonly, somatoform  dissociative phenomena affect movement (e.g., paralysis, difficulty  walking, difficulty urinating, difficulty swallowing) or sensory  experience (e.g., unexplainable pain, not feeling pain, tunnel vision,  blindness, auditory distancing, deafness, loss of physical sensation).  Some of these symptoms subsequently prove to be partial posttraumatic  flashbacks: reexperiencing or reenacting some specific interval in a  past experience. Other symptoms, like conversion disorder, classically  understood, may derive from a particular intent or wish. Conversion and  somatoform dissociative symptoms are measured by a major section of the  DDIS and some are assessed within the depersonalization section of the  SCID-D-R. Body Symptoms is one of the 12 factors of pathological  dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009).
6. **Trance**.  Episodes of absence-like staring and unresponsiveness have been  reported in severely dissociative individuals for well over 100 years.  This longstanding appreciation of the occurrence of trance in  dissociative conditions probably springs from the fact that trance is  easily noticed by an observer; trance has very visible signs. Both the  DDIS and the SCID-D-R inquire about trance. Trance is one of the 12  factors of pathological dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009)

**Consciously Experienced Intrusions of Another Self-State**

1. **Child voices.**  Dissociative individuals almost always hear the voice of a child. Child  voices may be happy, sad, crying, or angry. Frequently, but not always,  dissociative individuals also see (i.e., have a visual image of) the  child that they are hearing; this seeing may range from a strictly  imaginative picturing to a frank visual hallucination. Both the DDIS and  the SCID-D-R inquire about voices. The SCID-D-R explicitly asks how old  the voices are.
2. **Two or more voices or parts that converse, argue, or struggle.**  Voices that converse, argue, or struggle constitute the person‚Äôs  awareness that different parts of the mind are autonomously conversing  or contending for control: hearing two or more voices that discuss or  argue about what should be done; feeling a force or an other that tries  to control or change what one does; feeling or hearing an angry other  that tries to control one, and so on. This symptom has much in common  with two of Schneider‚Äôs first-rank symptoms: voices arguing and voices  commenting. The SCID-D-R carefully inquires about the presence of  internal dialogue or internal struggle
3. **Persecutory voices**  that comment harshly, make threats, or command self-destructive acts.  Persecutory voices are routine in persons with DID. Such persecutory  voices contemptuously degrade the individual via repeated namecalling  (e.g., stupid, worthless, failure, wimp, no good, whore, slut, bitch,  etc.). Such voices often threaten to harm the person or demand that the  person commit acts of self-harm or suicide. Persecutory voices have much  in common with Schneider‚Äôs fi rst-rank symptom of voices commenting  (Kluft, 1987). Both the DDIS and the SCID-D-R ask about the presence of  voices, but they do not specifi cally inquire about persecutory voices.  Persecutory Intrusions is one of the 12 factors of pathological  dissociation. (Dell & Lawson, 2009).
4. **Speech insertion**  (unintentional or disowned utterances). In speech insertion, words are  experienced as autonomously issuing from one‚Äôs mouth. Most commonly,  such eruptions of partially dissociated words come from an angry alter.  Patients occasionally describe this phenomenon as, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say those  words; somebody else did.‚Äù Although the SCID-D-R asks about partially  dissociated speech, no SCIDD-R publication has reported data regarding  this phenomenon.
5. **Thought insertion or withdrawal**.  Partially dissociated thoughts have two basic forms: thought insertion  and thought withdrawal. Thought withdrawal is experienced as thoughts  being suddenly taken away or the mind going blank. More noticeable (and  more distressing) to the patient is thought insertion. When this occurs,  strong thoughts seem to come from out of nowhere. Such thoughts may be  distinctly ego-alien; they often feel like they do not belong to the  person. The intrusive thoughts of PTSD patients could also be classifi  ed as partially dissociated thoughts. The DDIS assesses the presence of  thought insertion and thought withdrawal.
6. **Made or intrusive feelings and emotions**.  ‚ÄúMade‚Äù or intrusive feelings and emotions are unexpected surges of  feeling‚Äîpain, hurt, anger, fear, shame, and so on. Often, these surges  of feeling are inexplicable and frankly puzzling to the individual. Made  or intrusive feelings and emotions tend to be the leading edge of  partially dissociated intrusions from another self-state. That is, a  person who has only a few kinds of partially dissociated intrusions  (i.e., 2 to 4 kinds of intrusion) is still likely to have made or  intrusive feelings and emotions. Such partially dissociated emotions are  also fairly common in patients who have only a modest score on the DES.  Not surprisingly, made or intrusive feelings and emotions are fairly  common in certain nondissociative disorders that are characterized by  affective instability (e.g., PTSD, borderline personality disorder,  bipolar disorder, panic disorder, ADHD). The SCID-D-R inquires about  partially  dissociated emotions and the DDIS assesses made feelings
7. **Made or intrusive impulses**.  ‚ÄúMade‚Äù or intrusive impulses are described as coming from somewhere  else or someone else. Such partially dissociated impulses often feel  like they do not belong to the person. Often, such impulses are  experienced as part of an internal struggle, another part is trying to  overrule the host personality. Hostile impulses may surge from a  dissociated angry part; sexual impulses may surge from a highly  sexualized part, and so on. The DDIS assesses made impulses. Angry  Intrusions is one of the 12 factors of pathological dissociation (Dell  & Lawson, 2009).
8. **Made or intrusive actions**.  ‚ÄúMade‚Äù or intrusive actions are highly frequent in persons with DID.  These partially dissociated actions tend to be experienced in one of  three ways: (1) from a depersonalized stance thought of as inside or  outside of the body wherein the person just passively watches or  observes the self do things on its own; or (2) from an experiential  standpoint of being suddenly overpowered, taken over, controlled, or  even possessed; or (3) despite an intact sensorium, the person observes  that a particular part of the body suddenly has a mind of its own, and  performs an unintended act. In all three cases, the person tends to feel  that the behavior is not his (or not hers). The degree of the person‚Äôs  awareness of the source of these acts varies considerably‚Äî from having  ‚Äúno idea at all‚Äù to actually ‚Äúseeing‚Äù another part take control of the  body. The SCID-D-R inquires about partially dissociated actions. Angry  Intrusions is one of the 12 factors of pathological dissociation (Dell  & Lawson, 2009). Angry intrusions typically involve (1) sudden  unexpected surges of anger into one‚Äôs conscious mind and/or (2)  partially dissociated seizures of executive control wherein the person  has conscious awareness of being invaded and/or taken over by an  autonomous other.
9. **Temporary loss of well-rehearsed knowledge or skills**.  Temporary loss of well-rehearsed knowledge or skills refers to a  circumscribed amnesia for information that the person knows well and  would never just forget (e.g., how to drive, how to read, how to do  one‚Äôs job, etc.). Distress about Severe Memory Problems is one of the 12  factors of pathological dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009); this  factor is centered on temporary loss of well-rehearsed skills.
10. **Disconcerting experiences of self-alteration**.  DID experiences of self-alteration include the acute sensation that  one‚Äôs body has become small like a young child; switching back and forth  between feeling like a man and feeling like a woman; seeing someone  other than oneself in the mirror; feeling that one‚Äôs emotions, thoughts,  behavior, or body are not one‚Äôs own; discovering that one has changed  one‚Äôs appearance (e.g., hair length, hair color, cosmetics, apparel,  etc.) with no memory of having done so, and so on. Identity alteration  is the fifth of the five core symptoms assessed by the SCIDD-R.  Subjective Experience of the Presence of Alter Personalities and/or  Self-States is one of the 12 factors of pathological dissociation (Dell  & Lawson, 2009).
11. **Profound and chronic self-puzzlement**.  Self-puzzlement is not itself a partially dissociated intrusion.  Rather, self-puzzlement is the unavoidable consequence of repeated  encounters with the 16 preceding partially dissociated intrusions into  executive functioning and sense of self. Individuals who undergo  recurrent pathological dissociative intrusions are seriously puzzled and  confused about themselves. They don‚Äôt understand why they feel and  behave as they do; they are frankly confused about who they really are.  Persons with DID even have greater identity confusion than persons with  borderline personality disorder (Laddis & Dell, 2002)! Identity  confusion is the fourth of the five core symptoms assessed by the  SCID-D-R. Self-Confusion is the first of the 12 factors of pathological  dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009).

**FULLY DISSOCIATED INTRUSIONS INTO EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING AND SELF**

Amnesia  (i.e., fully dissociated actions of another self-state) is the sole  point of overlap between (1) DSM-IV‚Äôs diagnostic criteria for DID and (2)  the subjective/ phenomenological view of DID. Even so, the DSM criteria  address only the clinician‚Äôs judgment of the presence of both switching  and amnesia, whereas the subjective/ phenomenological criteria address  the patient‚Äôs detection of the evidence of such phenomena. A person with  DID can only discover, learn, or deduce the fully dissociated actions  of another personality. There are at least six ways that this can  happen.

1. **Time loss**.  The fact that a chunk of time has vanished can be discovered in one of  three ways: (1) a sudden, acute realization that ""something,"" (i.e., a  chunk of time) is missing‚Äù; (2) noticing by the clock or newspaper that  it is much later than one thought (e.g., hours or days later) and that  one cannot account for the missing period of time; and (3) being asked  or told something that calls one‚Äôs attention to the hitherto  unappreciated fact that one has lost time. Both the DDIS and the  SCID-D-R assess time loss. Amnesia is one of the 12 factors of  pathological dissociation (Dell & Lawson, 2009); this factor taps  time loss and the other five forms of amnesia listed in the following  (#2 to #6).
2. **Coming to**.  ‚ÄúComing to‚Äù is characterized by suddenly discovering oneself in the  midst of circumstances of which one had no awareness even 5 seconds  before. Coming to may or may not be accompanied by an acute sense of  having lost time. Dramatic examples of coming to include fi nding  oneself standing amidst the wreckage of one‚Äôs room or home; or  discovering that there are cuts all over one‚Äôs arms and fi nding a  blood-covered razorblade in one‚Äôs hand. Other examples include fi nding  oneself in the midst of a set of actions (e.g., vacuuming, cooking,  spanking a child, sitting at the breakfast table with a newspaper and  coffee) that one does not remember initiating; and discovering oneself  in mid-conversation with someone (when one was previously unaware of  talking to that person), and so on.
3. **Fugues**.  The classic definition of a fugue involves purposeful travel that is  fully dissociated. That is, fuguing individuals discover themselves  somewhere else with no knowledge of how they came to be in that place  (i.e., in their car, at the beach, at a nightclub, at their place of  work, in another city or state). Persons with DID not only have classic  fugues, but they also have at-home mini-fugues: waking up on a bed or a  sofa with no memory of having lain down there in the first place;  discovering themselves in an odd place in their home (e.g., inside the  closet, under the bed, curled up on the floor) with no memory of how  they got there; awakening from a nightmare to find themselves elsewhere  than in bed (with no idea how they came to be in that place). Both the  DDIS and the SCID-D-R inquire about fugues.
4. **Being told of disremembered actions**.  DID patients are often told by others about actions of which they have  no memory. Unremembered actions may include incidents of not recognizing  their spouse or children, angry words and actions, highly atypical  sexualized behavior, and so on. The DDIS inquires about incidents of  being told about disremembered actions.
5. **Finding objects among their possessions**.  It is quite common for DID individuals to discover objects among their  possessions (e.g., clothes, toys, toilet articles, etc.) that they do  not remember acquiring. Similarly, they may discover writings or  drawings that they cannot account for, or they may fi nd articles in  their shopping bags that they do not remember buying. Both the DDIS and  the SCID-D-R inquire about incidents of finding objects among one‚Äôs  possessions.
6. **Finding evidence of one‚Äôs recent actions**.  DID patients often discover evidence of recent actions that only they  could have done (e.g., a task completed at work, a room painted, the  lawn mowed, objects moved from room to room, etc.). They may also  belatedly discover the presence of serious injuries and even suicide  attempts that they do not remember.

What is this?,19,ctqf5z,2,"I can't even listen to my boyfriend say he loves me and wants to kiss me without my mind blanking out. 
I just get so overwhelmed and then my mind doesn't work. I can't say anything back. He asks me what I'm thinking and it's always nothing. Just silence. What is this?"
"Dissociation, glitches and confusion",19,cidiq5,4,"I experience these weird glitches in time. I could be trying to watch something or read something or have a conversation and it's like the autopilot mode I'm in gets stuck in this loop and suddenly jams and I blink a couple times and have microsecond blackouts and like the sequence of events/content read/thing watched rewinds and super fast forwards again really fast and then ends with jarring back into reality/real time but being disoriented or confused about what just happened. 

It's very disorienting and I snap out of it confused and I dont know how long they last or if it was real or something I imagined. Like the fast forward and shutter-blink eye back into reality seems quick like seconds but the content during the fast forward is... unknown? Sometimes short, sometimes long. I dont really know.

This happens daily. On bad days, it happens multiple times a day. I dunno how many exactly. Does this sound familiar to anyone else?"
no sense of time,19,c8cgq9,3,"my friend told me that i seem to have no sense of time, and she‚Äôs right. two days had gone by and i hadn‚Äôt talked to her, i told her that it only felt like a few hours. it‚Äôs weird because i have felt this way for such a long time, i never thought anything of it. i thought that it was normal. now i can connect the dots and say that it‚Äôs from dissociation. it all makes sense.

i often will do something such as going to a doctors appointment, later in the day i will think back to it and literally think that i went a few days ago or a week ago. 

sometimes time is really slow and others it‚Äôs really fast. in reality i know it‚Äôs not actually like that but it seriously feels like that for me, all of the time. it‚Äôs fucking weird. 

is this a common thing that happens to people with dissociation or is it less common? i‚Äôve seen people mention it before but not much."
25 Year Relationship May Be Over,19,c0lj9y,4,"I‚Äôve been with my partner for 25 years and have been in therapy the whole time. I wasn‚Äôt properly diagnosed with DID until last December so only now can I see the bigger picture. Our relationship has always been tumultuous with breakups (always initiated by him), but we‚Äôve always come back (always initiated by him). We‚Äôve worked together on major projects, consoled each other, supported each other, and we even own a house together. But this time it seems like he is really done with it and with me. There‚Äôs nothing I can do to make him trust me because I‚Äôve never been able to be consistent let alone control my mood/parts (personality) swings. 

Mostly I‚Äôm writing this because I am so angry that it took this long to be diagnosed. I even told one therapist years ago that I feel like two people. That I lost time. Why didn‚Äôt anyone else catch it? Countless therapists, some with focus on childhood sexual abuse. They all should have at least considered it. 25 years to finally see what it is and now the puzzle pieces fit together. It‚Äôs so clear to me that I‚Äôve had this forever and the first personality was triggered when I was 16 in response to being sexually assaulted. And I‚Äôm so angry that no one saw the signs and helped me earlier. My life could be so different."
DAE value their dissociation?,20,bvcufx,6,"I have been more or less permanently dissociated since adolescence. It ranges anywhere from feeling a ""fishbowl"" sense of slight unreality, to feeling my body as numb meat that I inhabit as a disembodied, identityless entity who has someone else's memories for some reason, to full-on blanking out and being told I acted like a confused small child for several hours. I also have psychogenic seizures.

The thing is, while these may cause some social hassles, I'm actually glad that I have the ability to detach in this way. It's made many very scary and painful trauma experiences less so (at least in the moment--I still have nightmares and flashbacks) and allows me to sort of take things ""less seriously"" because it feels like I'm in someone else's life. Losing time is the exception to this, I would say.

I often encounter people who are extremely upset about dissociating and seeking to change it (and I'm definitely not trying to trivialize those experiences), but I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way I do and has dealt with therapists or others finding you disturbing and trying to change you."

Anyone else feel different types of dissociation?,18,m4isbl,5,"‚ÄúDissociation is a break in how your mind handles information. You may feel disconnected from your thoughts, feelings, memories, and surroundings. It can affect your sense of identity and your perception of time.‚Äù

Does anyone else dissociate in different ways each time? Like depending on what caused it, I might have a few different symptoms in each episode. My therapist says I have BPD traits so some of this falls into that criteria also.

Right now I just feel empty. Removed from reality. It‚Äôs especially bad when I‚Äôm alone. I‚Äôm either emotionally numb (most of the time), or my emotions are dialed to 90-100%. Like I‚Äôm running on autopilot.

Whenever a bad thought enters my head and I start ruminating (usually about an ex), my vision gets blurry and my eyes suddenly feel heavy. It‚Äôs almost instant. Sometimes I‚Äôm asking myself, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù Other times, I‚Äôm just completely absent. Then there‚Äôs times where my vision doesn‚Äôt blur at all, I just feel floaty yet heavy and I feel a little removed from my senses. Touch feels weird and distant. Watching my hands or looking at myself feels off. Like I know they‚Äôre mine but it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm using them when they move. Movements kind of look like animation with some of the frames removed so it‚Äôs ‚Äúoff.‚Äù

When I have panic attacks I think I also feel a type of dissociation. I feel a lot of the same symptoms, yet everything around me feels ‚Äúhyper-real‚Äù and scary. And sometimes dissociation makes me anxious, but other times it‚Äôs just numbness.

Is this dissociation with some spells of derealization thrown in? Is that why they feel different?"
"Does anyone else experience something like this ( Sudden Paralysis, no muscle tension but mentally functioning)",18,lw9zl8,21,"So I've been to several doctors and because of my history of dissociative disorders they all think what I'm going through is dissociation. However it doesn't really feel like it and I wanted to see if anyone has similar experiences or an opinion whether it's really dissociation or not.

For some years already I have sudden phases (between a few minutes and two hours) where I am unable to move. I lose my muscle tension, fall down and cannot move anything except for my eyes. My mind doesn't feel affected at all though. I recognise everything going on around me and can respond without delay (I communicate to my partner through eye movements - up/down is yes and left/right is no). My thoughts are clear and my emotions feel normal. I personally don't feel any signs of dissociation that I would usually have when dissociating. In general my level of dissociation is not very high anymore and for me it doesn't feel like it's strong enough to cause such heavy symptoms.

If anyone could say something about this I'd be so thankful. None of my doctors could really tell me what it is and I'm desperate because it heavily affects my day to day life. Thank you so much."
DAE inner monologue in past tense,18,lug15d,6,"Like the title says, when i dissociate my inner monologue talks in the past. Its like im a character in a story and the inner me is the narrator?

Out of Sight Out of Mind - Feel Like People Don't Exist When I'm Not with Them,17,l645qo,8,"TL;DR
People don't feel real to me when I can't physically be with them, do you experience this too? What do you do to cope?

I have only very recently identified my dissociation for what it is. It was relieving when I started therapy a couple months ago.

I have been experiencing dissociation for a few years at least, the biggest contributing factor I've identified so far is the stressful event of my mom moving. Usually, when you go to college, you leave home and home doesn't leave you. My sophomore year, my mom moved from New England to the Southwest U.S.. I was forced to give up my pets, and half the stuff we owned, and then I was effectively homeless for the rest of my undergrad program.

On her travels she was often not reachable because of cell phone signal, and she had hardly done any planning so she was sleeping at truck stops and random places along the way. I would often worry she would die or get hurt and I wouldn't have any way to know because I couldn't reach her.

I reached a point where I realized I was not actively missing/worrying about her anymore because she just didn't feel real to me. I told her this once and she got really upset, which I don't blame her. But she didn't feel real, even if we did manage to talk on the phone she was just a voice in a box, and I felt no connection to her the way I had before she left.

I've had similar feelings when I was in a long distance relationship in college, and again in my current relationship when we were separated because of quarantine.

I used to try a writing exercise where I would write down facts about my life, who I was and who was important to me and involved in my life, but it didn't really stick. I knew the information to be true but just couldn't feel the truth of it.

With therapy I have learned some grounding techniques and for me I'm a super physical/tactile person. To really engage with something I need to touch things, and smell things. I need a lot of sensory stimulation to be present fully which is obviously not possible on phone calls and when there is distance. 

My current partner who I see fairly regularly still feels less real, and he has been kind enough to leave a peace of his clothing with me to cuddle/smell to feel more connected to him.

So, after reading, I wonder if you've had a similar experience? Are there other coping mechanisms that work for you? Especially things you do in public ( I can't exactly whip out a pair of men's underwear in the middle of the grocery store üò≠).a

I'm so grateful to be able to identify this experience and to have this lovely community to be a part of :)

Stay well everyone!"
Whenever I think about my last relationship I get a strong feeling like ‚ÄúI was a part of that?‚Äù,18,ks22ve,8,"Even down to the kind of person I was back then. The things I did then and even before then. I know they happened, but I don‚Äôt FEEL they happened if that makes sense."
New Year‚Äôs Eve was the 4 year anniversary of the last time I did a psychedelic.,19,kofk49,6,"Last night I was thrown into the most terrible flashback trip and dissociated to the point of feeling I was not inside my body, feeling like I was dead. It lasted 7 minutes of panicking hallucinating flashback trip then I just stayed dissociated for hours, I was so out of it I was falling asleep every time I closed my eyes at work and my Schizoaffective disorder symptoms went crazy, I heard singing and clear voices talking to me, at one point I heard a child‚Äôs voice beckoning me inside a giant machine at work, and felt like I was being tormented by ghosts all night.

My dissociation is getting out of hand & I want to find ways I can keep it under control.,18,kke2bj,4,"Hi there- I (17 F) am new to this board. I have been dealing with DD - more specifically depersonalization/derealization - for about as long as I can remember. It has gotten progressively worse within the past 2 1/2 years and is only getting more and more terrible. It first started with the weird ‚Äúout of body, perspective‚Äù type deal when zoning out & then got to the point were I would feel high (not in a good way) without ingesting any drugs. I have a terrible memory and cannot remember nearly anything from the past year that has happened to me and I am assuming that is my DD to blame.

Anyways, more recently I have noticed my DD is starting to mess with my vision. As im talking to someone their face gets all warped, or it looks like my depth goes out in my vision (say person was standing in the middle of the room & the depth perception goes out on me, said person looks like they are up against the wall when they in fact are not). Looking in the mirror makes my face warp, and things look like theyre warping behind me. Has anyone else experienced this? Is this DD or am I mistaking it for something else? How do I make this stop?"

How you're CREATING dissociation/dpdr by feeling in REVERSE [MIND-BLOWING],18,k0bcw4,2,"Trying to find an explanation for your emotions and understand what they mean before you feel them? üòè

The paradox is that you want to be spontaneous, quick, go with the flow, but at the same time you still want to have the control on how you feel and you get frustrated when you don't feel what ""you should feel"", you should feel more, you shouldn't feel this, it doesn't make any sense, it's not the right time etc.

Finding an explanation, cause, meaning, answer, story, justification for your feelings before you immerse yourself in them. And on the long-term you start to feel numb. You start to feel detached from yourself. And what do you do? You try to ""mentally fix it from above"". How?

By TRYING to feel, checking in, double checking, trying to so hard to feel, idealizing your old self and how much life was good back then, a constant mental effort in wanting and trying so hard to get your emotions back - and at the same time discarding spontaneous feelings when they come out of nowhere because they do not meet your logical criteria of how you're supposed to feel in this moment - and instead of just feeling without knowing why, you REACT with fear, anxiety and panic.

It's not a problem of not having emotions, it's a problem of - you guessed it - CONTROL. üëå

These are quick mental fixes from above to an unconscious problem. The answer is found not in trying so hard, but in RELEASING that control! You don't realize that you have the answer right in front of you, however uncomfortable it may be, the moment you stop trying so hard!

This constant mental effort of trying to change how you feel and editing your internal experience to another ""more pleasurable channel"" and forcing it to be different creates even more stress, overwhelm, chaos, distance with yourself. You want to be spontaneous but you're not willing to 'do' what it takes be really spontaneous: LET GO OF CONTROL.

I call this ""reverse feeling"" and it's a dissociative mechanism whereby you're putting logical prerequisites before the actual experience of the emotion.

Learn how the solution lies not in 'getting rid of it' but understanding what this mechanism is doing for you and if you really need it, keep it! No one is forcing you to get better, you can always stay where you are!

Getting used to feeling WITHOUT KNOWING WHY and BEING OK with it is one of the biggest favors you can do to yourself. Funny enough the moment you stop looking for the why, precisely when you don't care about it, that's when the answer comes to you.

Dissociating or Meditating?,17,jrt59h,6,"How do I tell which one I'm doing?

"Lately I‚Äôve had extremely strange, uncomfortable feelings when looking at photos from the early 2000s.",19,imy9of,19,"I have lived most of my social media life on our everyday platforms like Instagram, Twitter, but find more personal satisfaction in Tumblr. At one point Tumblr was extremely popular it seemed, now it is just like an empty space that lingers. I know a lot of people still use it, but the accounts I follow leave my feed so cold but it is almost just as comforting as it is uncomfortable to feel. It‚Äôs not what I use the most, not even really that often, because when I do it leaves me feeling strange for a while afterwards and I don‚Äôt understand why. 

I follow mostly 2000s aesthetic type accounts, as I was born right at the turn of the century so a lot of my early childhood revolved around the early 2000s atmosphere that these images remind me of. But it is not entirely like nostalgia, I‚Äôve felt nostalgia many times before and this is not like that. It seems like a really gross, disgusting heavy feeling in my chest, looking at just old toys that are no longer around, images with that early 2000‚Äôs quality, shows and old games and other things, everything about it- it gives me a feeling I‚Äôve never felt before with anything else in my life. I wonder if it produces the same emotion, or feeling for everyone else. It is eerie, and seeing such things make me remember things I‚Äôve hidden so deep in the back of my memory. It makes me feel like I need to shower. Or throw up. Or like there is something missing, about the way I remember and feel about this time period, my early childhood. I don‚Äôt quite understand it. Maybe it is a universal feeling. It is extremely subtle but it lingers. 

If it makes any difference, I struggle with mild depression, and have (loosely, I believe) been diagnosed bipolar in the past but I‚Äôm not entirely convinced it‚Äôs mental health related.. I just wonder if it‚Äôs a common phenomenon in memories of your early childhood or things that remind you of that, to make you feel off or weird, or empty, or unusual... 

Any response is greatly appreciated. <3"

Ask for help! Dissociation caused by seizures,18,hoe56p,1,"I finally asked got help earlier this year and started seeing a therapist. She mentioned that the dissociation I was experiencing might be caused by seizures. I wasn‚Äôt sure, but next thing I knew I was seeing a doctor, a neurologist, getting an EEG, an MRI, and getting put on medication. Though things aren‚Äôt perfect, I finally have some semblance of an answer. I‚Äôve apparently been experiencing complex partial seizures since I was a baby which affect my memory and my ability to pay attention to the world around me. I dissociate afterwards and often have headaches for the rest of the day.

I feel like this sub is usually full of discouragement and honestly, I usually am too. But I really really encourage anyone who reads this to ask for help or at least look into different options. I never thought this was a possibility, but I finally have some answers. This won‚Äôt solve everything, but it‚Äôs a start. I wish you all the best!"
When I dissociate..,18,hklosr,35,"Instead of viewing my body from the outside, as in viewing my body, I can sense my self out of my body, meaning it‚Äôs like my body and mind are aware that my consciousness is somewhere else. Is this also dissociation?"
Spiritual awakening fixed my dissociation,18,hhgem6,5,"I've had extremely intense dissociation for the past 4-5 years (before that I can't remember). It partially comes from gender dysphoria, trauma I have from relationships, and just the general desire to ease the experience of existence. I've been seeing a therapist over the past year and we did some techniques to help with certain memories but they hadn't made my dissociation any less prevalent. My dissociation is a mix of feeling detached from my body and feeling like everything around me isn't real, sometimes both. I have a lot of noise in my vision (not sure if it's visual snow) but it made me feel more disoriented in conjunction with my disassociation. These symptoms have been constant over the years and in the short times where I had felt present and grounded in reality it was extremely painful so I would go back to a dissociated state in an hour or so. I wasn't sure that I was going to ever find this feeling of presence, I didn't know what it even felt like.

I have never been a spiritual person, I didn't understand how people could be (I was raised Athiest and didn't believe in the tooth fairy, etc). Yesterday, I watched this 30min meditation to find your spirit guide, I've been wanting to start my spiritual journey but like I said before it didn't click. When I have tried meditation before it would be calming but it didn't ease my feelings of dissociation that much. This meditation was different, I totally met my spirit guide and I felt so much acceptance and love (that's a different story though). After I opened my eyes, I felt like a switch was flipped in my brain. I suddenly felt more grounded than I can ever remember feeling and didn't have any of the anxiety of feeling present that I had in the past. I suddenly felt like I was seeing things from the perspective that I was supposed to see from (not a sunken place in my head) and I wasn't worried that I would blink and have the day be over.

Yes, it has only been one day and maybe I'm riding the high of meeting my spirit guide, but this is relief that I've never felt with other ways of coping with disassociation. Even after waking up this morning (which normally makes me disoriented and feel far away from everything) I was fine and felt grounded. Generally, I'm in a better place than I have been, this is likely a combination of many things, but there was something about my spiritual awakening that triggered this change. If my disassociation comes back in full force I will update this, but I'm going to keep trying because this is the best that I have felt in a long time. I wanted to make this post because I haven't seen much about spirituality as a possible way to help with disassociation."
Does anyone get eye pain when they are in an episode?,18,gkepe1,26,
I‚Äôm drifting away from the real world,16,gj4l02,15,"It started about a year and a half ago. I don‚Äôt know why I think it was social difficulties I was having when I was 15. I turned to video games to ease my pain in the real world. It slowly developed over time and I became more invested and emotionally happy when playing video games or on the internet. It has continued to this day and every day of the journey I have been completely conscious of what has been happening to me. I have spent probably all of the last year of my life focusing on how to get out of this cycle. It has gotten to a point where I am so disconnected from the real world that I don‚Äôt recognize myself in the mirror. It feels like me or anything else in the real world is fake and I‚Äôm living in a dream. When I am on the internet I feel like myself and think like myself. At this point everyday I wake up and try to force myself to live real life. I try to do my homework every morning and each time I fail miserably. I truly feel like everything around me is false including myself. I have no emotions towards anything or anyone in life for that matter because it feels to me like everyone is empty. I only keep living because of the hope to feel normal again one day and have some sort of emotions towards anything. I want to feel like the world is real again. Over the past week this fight has become so much more difficult. Whenever I try to be present in the real world I end up wanting to kill myself. I haven‚Äôt done my school work in two weeks and everyday my parents yell at me not realizing what I‚Äôm experiencing. At 17 with so much of my life ahead of me it is logically a stupid idea to kill myself, but no matter how much determination I have to fix myself, I always find myself powerless. I‚Äôm only continue to live because I hope that this could go away and I could live a real life. It‚Äôs beginning to seem like a more and more distant possibility. At this point my day looks like this. I wake up and try to do my homework. I freak out and am unable to do any of it. My parents yell at me. I tell them I‚Äôm going to play soccer at the field. I take my car blast music and just drive highways going 100 and I cry and I think about killing myself. Each time I want to drive my car into a tree off the highway but I can never bring myself to do it. Eventually I calm down and come home. Then the cycle starts again the next day.  I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore and everything feels like a dream. I can‚Äôt recognize my own face and my hands don‚Äôt feel like mine. If things keep getting worse I will probably kill myself.    If anyone knows what‚Äôs happening to me I would greatly appreciate insight or help if some sort."
Is this dissociation? Or is it just part of my depression? Something else altogether?,19,g4i4o1,13,"I‚Äôm constantly ‚Äòzoned out‚Äô, day dreaming without dreaming, like brain fog. I can‚Äôt concentrate on conversations, work, reading, writing (I had to keep stopping and starting just to finish this post), etc. I would literally just sit in one spot forever if I didn‚Äôt get hungry or tired. 

Creating routines to help depression or doing CBT is impossible. I have no energy or motivation to do either, and I‚Äôm so ‚Äòzoned out‚Äô that I can‚Äôt even tackle the sources of this (such as walking, eating better, etc.).  

I also forget I exist ‚Äì I get stunned if I catch my reflection unexpectedly or if a stranger speaks to me (I can‚Äôt register that people can see me). Actually, I can‚Äôt register anything ‚Äì it feels like I‚Äôm in a bubble watching the world, like it doesn‚Äôt exist or its on a TV in the background. I‚Äôve struggled with rent, nearly on the streets but and yet felt nothing, can‚Äôt register the stakes.     

It‚Äôs not depression making me numb because I CAN feel things, it‚Äôs just that I enter this state whenever I do."
"hi, i'm new",18,fjvwd3,12,"so uh, i can't tell if i fell asleep or dissociated?

at night, about 4 times, i've blacked out (not fallen asleep, it was like a tv was shut off and turned on in the middle of a show), and feeling exausted when i come back. ik it sounds like sleep but i would come too like, upright, or in a position like laying on your side with your hand on your cheek proped up on your elbow? i'm bad at explaining.  this has happened once during the day. i also have these  periods of time where my head feels odd, things are swimmy, my visions feels like its in a focus limbo, like auto focus on a camera, and like, i feel myself dissociating and my brain tries to tell me i can controll it but i can't . my brain keeps telling me i'm faking but something feels like i'm not (i live in abuse and alot of trauma) i just don't know what this is or if its valid? i can answer any questions you have for me."
How do you accept that you dissociate?,17,f2dz05,10,Ive been in a dissociative state since Saturday. I‚Äôm exhausted and emotionally dull. I look at myself in the mirror and I don‚Äôt recognize myself. I don‚Äôt recognize my hands etc. The whole world feels like its a POV video game. I just want to feel real again. My therapist told me this is temporary but how do you accept it?
First therapy appointment,18,f0mw8i,2,"Hey guys, 
So it's my first post here but I just had my first therapy appointment today. I told my therapist about me dissociating so much and she told me there's ""nothing wrong"" with me and that what im experiencing is a ""normal response"" to having trauma. I know its not much, but it made me feel so much better and that I'm not crazy. I guess I'm not alone in this like i thought"
No trauma?,19,f09b0n,6,"So I'm pretty sure that what I'm experiencing all the time is dissociation. But I don't have a trauma. Granted, I can't really remember things from when I was younger than 14 except for a few things. But I feel like I would know if I had some sort of trauma. Of course bad things have happened, bad things happen to everyone, but I don't believe I have a trauma. So how can I have dissociation and how can I get rid of it? (I've had it definitely since I was in 1 grade because one of my memories are of me telling the teachers I felt like I was living in some sort of bubble)

Is this even possible?"
Told a coworker I been dissociating for basically all my life,19,etm8d7,2,"Idk, idk if I regret it now. Like why did I even do that. Maybe she‚Äôll tell other people. /: smh"
Am i going crazy?,19,etdcui,4,"Just to put things into perspective i'm 20 years old.
Anyway, Yesterday I had a few drinks and i went for a walk. As I was walking, it suddenly hit me that I'm ""me"".  A feeling of  urgency and desperation took over me and I suddenly realized I'm real.  What made me stop in my tracks is realizing i have parents, I said their names out loud, i whispered to myself ""ok you have a mom and a dad and a little brother that you love very much"" 
 it just seemed something strange, I couldn't remember if i had family and I had to remind myself they're real, their existence seemed foreign to me.

Keep in my mind my relationship with my parents is alright. What happened?  Should i dwell on this or let it to?"
done seeking help,18,erul10,3,"i opened up to one (1) person. just one. someone special. they supported me, understood me, grounded me. they let me crawl my way out of a bad dissociation myself, without pushing or bothering me. i opened up to them, told them my bad thoughts, my weird fears, how my hands felt like they weren't mine and how the walls were moving like sheets of paper. 

today, they left. took their distance. told me sorry, they can't be what i need.

i shouldn't have told them. i shouldn't have shown them what's in my head. i should've kept it close to me, written it down behind a grey face online somewhere. 

im ready to be someone again. i will crawl into her skin and wear her smile and kiss the girls she's into. i will be her, and she will make people happy, and she will exist in their world, and she won't need help. from anyone. ever again."
Question about dissociation,18,ennrnb,4,"First time posting here, I just wanted to share my experiences and ask if somebody has experienced the same and if it's dissociation what I'm experiencing. 

I had anxiety due to very stressfull and traumatic experiences in my childhood/teens my whole life and I'm dealing currently with a lot of stress and have also experienced disturbing things the last months. Also had a mental breakdown. 

Sometimes I have the feeling that I'm a different person, like very different with a different state of mind and even body posture. I started to forget things and events, my surroundings seem strange like not strange or unreal, but it's like I'm seeing them for the first time. 
My parents seem strange to me, I ask frequently myself if they are really my parents because I can't feel any emotional connection to them, there are times where I just sit and stare with a blank mind and afterwards I have to cry. I no longer recognize my friends and sometimes disturbing and painful memories are haunting me and I don't even know if this are my memories. 

My mom says it's just my anxiety, but idk, she don't know what I've been through and I can tell the difference between my normal anxiety/depersonalisation and this disturbing things that I'm going through right now.

Edit: Also Humans and the world seems so strange and alien, everything is just so strange."
My Experience,16,ekisbp,2,"Welp...I've been dissociating for a very long time. I think since I was a young child. I can't pinpoint the exact experience that caused me to dissociate in the first place, but I do know it stems from childhood trauma. I grew up with a very emotionally detached father who could hardly give me a hug, let alone tell me he loved me. I never really received love from him, even though I tried to do things that would make him love me. My mother on the other hand was affectionate, when she wasn't have a manic or depressive episode. See my mom suffered from Bipolar Disorder, along with other mental disorders that led her to self-medicate using drugs (i.e. meth, cocaine, heroine, marijuana, you name it). 

My parents to say the least were very absent and neglectful parents. I believe if it wasn't for my grandmother, I wouldn't be able to function as a human, I'd just be a human shape that feels nothing. 

Because I don't remember much, I can't really share a lot about my childhood traumas. What I mostly remember was seeing my mother overdose at 14, watching her light herself on fire at 10 (that one was a traumatic experience, but I don't remember everything that happened), watching her have psychotic breakdowns and threatening to kill herself and others...

I think because I was so desensitized to dangerous situations I couldn't recognize when I was one in. 

It seems so cliche to say this, because so many people have this experience, its actually quiet alarming. I am a rape survivor. I have had this happen to me twice...and I still have flashbacks and recurring nightmares from them. The second one more often than the first. 

I won't go into detail of the events themselves, as I know reading other's experiences can trigger others. Mostly the first time it happened I knew him, and he felt no remorse. Afterwards, I pretended nothing happened, blamed myself, and let him live his life. I convinced myself if I said anything...it would ruin his life, and I wasn't worth ruining someone else's life. 

The second time was a friend's cousin. I don't know his name, I don't even remember what he looks like. But I remember the feel of his body pressed against mine, I remember crying, I remember for once I tried to run away, and when that didn't work I lied there frozen in time. 

I remember dissociating while it all happened. Like watching a terrible movie..floating over myself. 

A year later I met my current bf, and I told him the story I hadn't told anyone but my best friend. At this point I had become a heavy drinker, depressed, and disconnected from the world. I lived in a never ending state of depresonalization-derealization. I couldn't function in the world...and by the time I was 23, it was a constant way of living. 

He convinced me to go to therapy..and there I was able to put a name to everything I was feeling...a reason behind my experiences...and I started to take control of my life again...I was able to be happy once more. I still dissociate, but now I can ground myself if I catch that I am doing so. I still have a hard time empathizing with others,  I still have a hard time connecting to others emotions and feelings. 

For so long I was devoid of knowing who I was because of circumstances of my childhood I didn't ask for and because of terrible people who took advantage of me. I've learned that my past doesn't dictate who I am now...and I have the power to take back those memories...acknowledge them...and walk away."
I lost my connection to life and connections,19,eiwvjv,5,"Recently. I've managed to overcome a lot of my disassociating and be authentic and feel fully. Until lately. I feel so far from what's close in reality. Just safe but silently suffering I think. Cuz I remember coming out of a bad bout of ptsd flare up and re...uh...awakening. learning to live without the triggers constantly pushing me away from me.



At this point I might be in an alternate place but things keep moving at the same pace. I don't recognize these hands or this face. But I know this place is where I reside. I look through the glass
And see this person who can't see me. I know we are one body. I know this. But I don't feel like I am me. ""I""


Anyone else feel themselves float away anytime someone expresses love or sympathy and can't stand intimacy?

Cuz that's how it's going and even music takes much listening before anything resonates. It's hard to be having a likeness to my feeling when my feeling is a lack of feeling"
Breathing and memory,19,e98jdq,4,"When I told my therapist about my dissociation and anxiety about memory loss, he said they‚Äôre likely connected but also pointed something else out that I‚Äôve been noticing all the time now. He said even when I‚Äôm just talking to him I take really short breaths or even hold my breath during conversation, then later need to take a really deep breath and sigh to feel better. I do this all the time and it‚Äôs subconscious at this point too, but i definitely think it adds to my dissociation. 
Has anyone else had this problem? I feel like it‚Äôs almost become worse after I started noticing it and it‚Äôs a cycle because it gives me more anxiety, which causes me more dissociation and blurred memories.
Does anyone else have extremely blurred memories, or even just anxiety about losing memory? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm losing that much memory but I have anxiety all the time that I am. I‚Äôm on an anxiety and depression medication as well to help with this but I haven‚Äôt noticed significant changes in this area"
I can‚Äôt live like this anymore,17,e3trgi,7,"I have begin to dissociate without realising and this time the episodes last way way longer. I have been ruining perfectly good relationships and get flashbacks If I‚Äôm by myself for too long. I feel stuck. It‚Äôs hard to explain to those whom I care about because I feel as if they would never understand that at times I 100% become someone else. It‚Äôs like I get possessed and it‚Äôs terrifying when interacting with new people. My sexual abuse trauma is finally starting to unpack itself, but it‚Äôs begun to interfere with my relationships and overall academic and job performance. 
I can‚Äôt be myself anymore I‚Äôm trying really hard and I am extremely isolated and disconnected from myself. This might not make any sense !! I‚Äôm throwing up from how bad I feel right now and can‚Äôt think too straight and just feel terrible for being such a complication for others in my family and friend circles"

My DID experience,19,dmxba5,5,"Dissociative identity disorder. A companion to derealization-depersonalization disorder. Imagine waking up feeling like you're stuck in a dream with no end, forced to walk around, attempt to live life and manage yourself like a human being should be able to. You've been told many times you'll never make anything out of yourself from the other bits of your personality that are fractured. The next day you could wake up developing an entirely new personality since it's a coping mechanism with no limits. But all in all, you're a whole person still yeah? Call it a mental illness, a spiritual experience, or a gift; it haunts you every single day of your life. No wonder you've changed your names many times, it's like a snake shedding it's own shell. Eager to find a new experience in new lights of consciousness. You notice everyone hates you being so spontaneous with the amount of italics and symbols you use to express it. Get help? No, they put you on reputake inhibitors that only make you numb temporarily, taking a toll on your adrenals and mind all the more. The only thing that stays the same for me day to day is my long term memory, I barely have short term before it instantaneously becomes etched into my mind. It's a numb yet memorable feeling. I've been told it will go away. I don't mind it though, after all it makes me who I am. But I would like a firm grounding to know the things around me are real, I want to see the faces of my loved ones without a silly blur in the way. I think it'd make me emotional yet ecstatic. Anyways, don't feel bad for me. This time around, I'm Zeph. The one that holds together all my observed personalities in one platform. I'm slowly regaining vision within my conscious experiences. I love you all. Take care now."
Don't like people talking to my fragments!,18,dkchby,0,"My personality is fragmented from childhood trauma and I just realized that I do not want anyone talking to my parts!   
They have to go through me.  Oh my gosh I am so adamant about this.   I realized this in an EMDR session where my therapist was trying to talk to a part of me and I hated it so much that I dissociated to the point where I couldn't talk and I could barely orient myself.  I have had a child part of me take over for about 15 minutes, and thank goodness that it is extremely rare.  I have moved all of my known parts into a ""house"" close to me and they can contact me anytime.  I check in with them daily.  My main protector part is in charge of security.  I guess I could also post this to r/DID"
unable to understand emotion,18,de1zyj,2,"i cant tell if this is dissociation but i‚Äôm assuming it is. majority of the time and when i‚Äôm in a certain state, i cant understand certain things, especially emotions. i cant understand why certain things make me feel certain ways. these feelings feel so familiar, but it‚Äôs like i‚Äôve never experienced them before. i feel completely blank, nothing, everything is a blur and these feelings mean nothing. everything i feel is fake. why am i so sad? why am i so mad? why do i feel these things in the first place?? why????? why why why why why."
Feeling like I am in a game,18,dcihbu,5,"I am currently on an exchange program and I feel like I have been dissociating more due to this.

my dissociation disorder is progressing and idfk what to do (Depersonalization/derealization),20,bxfgwx,7,"I have a very severe case of depersonalization derealization disorder. It started when i was in 2nd grade due to trauma and it has never gone away, and by never gone away i mean i am literally dissociating 24/7 and it hasnt stopped.  I ALWAYS no matter what feel like im dreaming and not in my body and it was manageable, i was high functioning, i could drive, go to work, etc, but as of recently, i  ran a red light (no one was hurt) I ran a stop sign ( no one was hurt) i hit a PARKED vehicle bc i just keep leaving my body and i dont know where i go and its driving me insane, ive tried grounding techniques, i squeeze ice, i blast cold air in my face, snap the rubberband on my wrist and it doesnt work anymore, i cant get out of this hazy dream that doesnt even seem real anymore, i just feel like an empty vessel controlling a video game character and i cant escape it, i feel like my hand will just go through anything i touch and the harder i dissociate, the more anxious i become because i feel like im losing my sense of reality and slowly going crazy and i just dont know what to do or how to fix it, ive gone to therapy for a while and i cant afford it anymore. i dont want to put anyone in danger i could never live with myself if i ever hurt someone.

has anyone experience this type of extreme dissociation? I lose time all the time now, my amnesia is getting worse and im having hysterical episodes bc im just so worried about whats wrong with me. To anyone who has this disorder, what is it like for you? does anyone even have it to this extent where its all day every day? how do you manage to live with it? I Was told by my prof whos a doctor in psych to maybe get an MRI to see if theres something wrong, but im scared  there might be-- idk, i guess i should i just dont want to be told im going crazy, the thing is idek what triggers it because i dont remember and my brain wont register it. I do have cptsd and ik that my childhood trauma contributes to this but the ppl that i know whove had or experienced it only have it periodically or had it briefly and it went away but ive had this for over 15+ years now. i just want to live my life normally, i want to see things the way others see it, i want to be able to register things as real, and touch things without feeling disconnected or feel like im in a physical body."
Is this depersonalization?,18,bs5e8n,8,"So I get these episodes where everything will start to feel hazy and distant, like I'm experiencing the world around me through a fog. Sometimes it's accompanied by what looks like TV static in my peripheral vision. Time doesn't seem to work the same way as it usually does (3 hours can feel like 5 minutes and vice versa) and I feel detached from my body, almost as if it doesn't belong to me.

I don't have any major trauma that I know of but I have had problems with anxiety since I was a kid, which I think would constitute chronic stress. Can anyone with similar experiences help me identify this?"
"Not sure what this is, help?",17,b6mddt,5,"does anyone else look in the mirror and not feel connected to the reflection? Not because the presentation is wrong but just likeÔªø ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs me, yeah I acknowledge that it‚Äôs me, anÔªød I‚Äôm fine with how I look, but I don‚Äôt feel connected to it.‚Äù Like I only look at mirrors to make sure I look okay, but otherwise I don‚Äôt look at myself in the mirror. It‚Äôs only gotten worse as I‚Äôve gotten older, I now feel a deep discomfort when I look at myself for longer than a couple seconds. Or if I do I have to focus on anything but my faÔªøce. So I focus on my makeup or my hair or my clothes or my whole body but it‚Äôs mentally blurred a bit.
 
Same with photos and videos honestly, I don‚Äôt like taking pictures or videos with me in it. I take selfies but mostly to check that my hair and makeup look nice and to keep record so I can repeat it, I don‚Äôt look at them long or really look at them ever again unless repeating the look. It just makes me uncomfortable. I like how I look but like when I see me in mirrors and videos and pictures I don‚Äôt have a deep sense of ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me!‚Äù Connection.

My f u c k i n g face??,18,a4zg0g,9,"Just had a scary disassociation moment and I wanted to vent, if this isn't the place then please delete :) 

Okay so rationally, I know that the face in the mirror is my face. Like logically I know that I never swapped faces with someone, or something else equally as nuts. But my ffffffucking god does it sure feel like my head and face don't belong on my body sometimes. I've been looking in the mirror ever since I was little, my parents thought it meant I was vain. But 90% of the time, I'm not even really ""seeing"" my face. It's like my eyes can't actually process what I look like. The second I look away, I can't even really remember what I looked like. I just looked into the mirror and got stuck looking at myself, frozen, watching myself breathe and blink. It didn't look like me at all, but I  know that it's me. It's the worst and I hate it. "
How do you feel about Dissociation Art?,18,8dj730,3,
Seems like most of us are lost here,17,7cpjxo,1,"We may not be able to change things for awhile, this whole thing feels like a lifelong process of being grounded (as a child) becoming ungrounded as a young adult, and trying to take your life back.

Cannabis use and DPDR,16,ktrdu8,16,"Background: I (20F) have been struggling with feelings of lack of presence my whole life, but in particular since I was 10 years old, when now I know a state of omnipresent derealization set in.

Through a combination of a lot of therapy work, getting myself into a healthier home environment, and I believe cannabis use, I‚Äôve started to come out of this derealization. I can‚Äôt express how crazy, amazing, and horrifying this has been (I hadn‚Äôt even heard about DPDR until late October).

From my understanding though, cannabis is thought to be a potential cause of DPDR. This has definitely been the opposite experience for me though, and the pattern of my emergence from this dissociative state really closely corresponds with a low and healthy usage.

Anyone have any thoughts on this or experience? This continues to be a wild ride and I‚Äôd love to hear some perspectives."
Dissociation vs depression,18,kmkqja,3,"I can't really tell the difference between the two with myself. Am I emotionally cold because of depression or because I am emotionally dissociating? Am I having a hard time getting motivated to do work because I'm depressed or because I'm not really existing in reality rn? I was initially diagnosed with mild depression and later dpdr, but I'm having trouble being able to understand which I'm having trouble with rn (or both). I'm going through kind of a low point rn and want to work on myself, but idk what to work on. And I don't have access to a therapist atm. Probably in a couple months. My previous therapist is the one who diagnosed me with dpdr, but we didn't get a chance to unpack whether my symptoms of depression are actually dpdr or whatever before I had to stop seeing them. I'm getting a surgery done in a couple weeks and I'm a little concerned about post-surgical depression. Or maybe worse dpdr since my body will be going through a trauma. I'm kinda rambling here... Does anyone else know how to deal with both or be able to tell the difference?"
i‚Äôm just want to be happy again,17,jx3syl,19,"I cant stop the thoughts that make me dissociate. It‚Äôs like my mind only wants to be numb.

I don‚Äôt even feel like myself anymore. I try not to cry but i can‚Äôt help it.

This sucks :(,16,jmpsex,5,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't think I've experienced much trauma in my life, but for months now I've been struggling with feeling like I'm not actually real/in control of my own body. It feels like I'm invisible and I keep getting freaked out when I look in the mirror. I know that it's illogical, but I just can't connect to the idea that I'm looking at myself in the mirror. It's like I'm not real. I exist within my head but my body is doing its own thing and I can only watch. 
It gets better and worse, but last night everything felt so hazy and weird. It was like everything including my body had been swapped out for almost perfect replicas. Nothing was real? I don't know how to explain it without sounding mad. It was like a waking dream, I got so paranoid that I didn't exist anymore. I felt like I was outside myself and it wasn't pleasant. 
This is really starting to interfere with my life. I can't concentrate or hold normal conversations anymore. I think I'll have to see a therapist or something to see how I can make this stop.

I think I'm finally coming out of it?,17,jk5ll9,10,"Hey everyone, this subreddit has been really great for having people to relate to about what has been the most difficult experience of my life.  Ever since it first started (dpdr) when I was 20 (26 now), I found it really hard to cope.  But gradually over time I got kind of used to it, of course with episodes in between.  The fog never really left though, and even as I'm writing this I do feel it a little.  But today when I was getting dressed for work I just had this moment of extreme clarity, like I could see everything in hd.  Just this feeling of calm wrapped in a subtle happiness.  After all this time and after having accepted it, thinking I would feel like that/this for the rest of my life, I feel like I'm rising out of the fog.  It's like I've come to this realisation that everything will be ok.  Dunno just wanted to share my good feelings, but also that even when you've completely given up, you can still get better and feel like a real human being again.  For those of you still in the fog, hang in there, you can do it!"
Experiences,17,jis8vb,9,"A big part of dissociation for me is the anxiety that comes with it, or preceeds it. What are your experiences with dissociation and anxiety?

Dissociating and driving license,16,j93bk7,13,"Hi there,

I was just wondering how everyone else managed to keep their licenses.

I don't feel like I dissociate and drive and never have. I'm just not sure what I could say.

If nothing else driving makes me feel more grounded. Guess my hands and feet are kept busy but not sure.

I have bpd with dissociation but some people have stated about DID though I'm not sure.

Thanks for the help!!!"
My interactions with family are like weekly funerals. For me.,17,iyl5jj,4,It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm being genuine but I‚Äôm not who they grew up with
Just want someone to tell me that they get it,17,iuv35g,6,"At some point when I was 14, I can't pinpoint the exact moment in my memory, my depression and anxiety morphed into dissociation, accompanied by intrusive thoughts that the world around me isn't real. For the past four, coming up five years, every day I've been rolling those instrusive thoughts around in my mind. I feel like I'm walking around in a dream, or a painting, obsessing over the questions of whether anything I'm experiencing is real and if I can really trust my senses. There's no answer to those questions, and there never will be, and it's like the slowest form of torture. 

I've told my family and friends about my symptoms, the hypervigilance and sensory overload and the feeling of detachment, and they understand. I think everyone has experienced what it's like to dissociate on some level, not to the same extreme as me where it's a constant state of mind, but still, people get what it's like to feel untethered in that way. What I don't tell anyone is how all that overwhelm makes me feel, though. I don't know how to tell people how long-term exposure to it has made me lonely and angry and exhausted, how it's made me obsess over the nature of reality and how that obsession is slowly bleeding me dry.  

The thing that's giving me the most grief at the moment is the loneliness. When I was 14 I had to work it all out on my own, what I was experiencing and how to get help. I had to explain what dissociation was to my parents, and I had to educate therapists who had never heard of it until I had the money to go see a professional who knows more about it. I had to write my own letter of evidence to my university to seek extra support because the letter they requested from doctor wasn't informed enough. I've had to learn to breathe through the fear by myself, to soldier on through basic tasks, to drag myself through the brain fog alone.

The only reasurring conclusion I've arrived at in regard to my intrusive thoughts is that at least I'm experiencing something. Whether life is exactly what it seems or if I'm just a brain in a jar being zapped at by a scienstist, or if it's something else entirely, it's still something. It's something, so I should try to make the most of it, try to learn as much as I can and do my best and be kind, just in case other people do actually exist. I figured that the chance of being born and being able to experiencing anything at all is so horrifyingly, mindbogglingly slim that even to experience the world with this detachment is some kind of privilege. I'm both terrified of and in awe of the world, and I think I'd rather see it like this than not at all. 

But I was 16 when I worked that out sat in the back of philosophy class, and I was alone, and I didn't have anyone to tell. I'm just so tired of being so lonely. I don't want to keep on figuring this stuff out by myself. 

My experience with dissociation has really shaped me as a person, and for how much it fucking sucks it's also taught me about my priorities, how to take care of myself, forgive myself, and that being kind to others is the most important thing, because you never know what's going on in someone's head. For better and for worse, it's a big part of who I am and who I'm becoming, but nobody else really knows that. Nobody really knows me. I just want to look someone in the eye and say all of this, and have them look at me in return and say yeah, me too. I get it, me too. It fucking sucks, I get it. I know. You're terrified. You had to grow up too fast and now you're all inside out and upside down. Me too. 
 
I feel like I'm just walking around pretending to be fine, going to the shops and doing my degree and hanging out with my flatmates all the while I'm painfully aware that nobody around me is experiencing the world the way I am. I'm so lonely in my own head, but too scared to say so to anyone because the prospect of doing so and still not being understood makes me feel a bit sick. I just want someone to tell me they get it."
I just realized that I dissociate from my dissociation,17,ijvmz0,1,"This just sounds very meta but I relized it yesterday.
I've been emotionally numb for as long as I can remember, guessing it started to creep up on me by the age of 15 or even earlier (I'm 29 now) I went on anti-depressants when I was 17 and has been on 6 differents kinds since then, none of them have helped. I'm just numb, there's nothing inside me. 


For a long time I thought that it was the anti-depressants that made me numb so I tried to wean of of them when I was 23, nothing happened, I was still numb and eventually had to start taking them again because some horrible OCD hitted me in the head all of a sudden.


Somewhere along the line, when I were a stupid idiot at 18 y/o I had a bad trip on something called spice (a synthetic drug similar to weed that later turned out to be highly dangerous and even lethal in some cases) I triggered dr/dp for the first time, about 2 weeks after my bad trip I went fullblown 24/7 dr/dp for about a month or two, it was completely horrible but eventually went away with time.


The panic anxiety/dr/dp was fine for a couple of years but due to me being a dumb ass I picked up smoking weed (real weed this time) around 2-3 years ago due to a bad break-up and it trigger my dr/dp again so I stopped (haven't touch weed or any other drug in 2 and a half years now) but the dr/dp is still here. 


So now I have both severe emotional numbness AND dr/dp, which I'm not sure if it's solely caused by drugs or if it's a combination of drugs, potential childhood trauma and long term stress causing an emotional burnout.


I'm just emotionally numb and deattached from everything 99% of the time, and have been for so long. I can't get out of this. I have given up. I don't know what's what, if the emotional numbness and dr/dp is caused by severe dissociation from unresolved childhood trauma or if it's caused by depression and a stupid choice of taking drugs a couple of years ago or if it's just me being broken from the start. 


If I actually actively try to think about it all I just feel so fucking hopeless and scared. If I'm aware of my dr/dp and the disconnection it just feels as if I'm going crazy, as if everything is unreal and a simulation, even though I know it's not. And about the emotional numbness I just feel so fucking sad, angry, devastated and hopeless, I can't get out of it.
I've been in therapy for a year and a half and I still haven't gotten anywhere. I'm still in denial and disconnected from my potential childhood trauma, I'm just nothing, lost and confused. 


So I dissociate from my dissociation and dr/dp because it's to hurtful, scary and hopeless to think about it."

Trauma & Severe Dissociation,17,hp5qrr,10,"So I'm pretty new to this so please let me know if I'm doing this the wrong way.
- - - 
Let me explain what I'm going through first. 

I am currently (finally) working on trauma work in therapy. We're actually starting to get into the nitty gritty of my trauma. And I'll admit, it's a lot harder than I ever imagined. I thought going through the event was the worst part, but honestly the recovery process is even harder.

That being said, this past week I've been extremely agitated and have a very very short fuse. Little things set me off and then I spiral.

Yesterday I had therapy and had a really intense session. I felt enraged for hours after our session. Well, then at dinner I chipped my tooth on a stupid boneless chicken wing.

I. Lost. MY. Mind.

I was so upset, I instantly became extremely agitated, my face got got, my body temperature started rising rapidly. For the next four or five hours, I had to sit and hang out with my brother because I was very dissociative. It was intense is all I can say. And I was afraid to be by myself and my own thoughts. 

So my question for you is, have you ever had a severe dissociative episode? And how long did it take you to call yourself down to a normal baseline again? I just don't know how to cope when it gets bad. I'm actually still feeling a little off today. 

Thanks guys. I appreciate you."

visualization it will feel really real. it's like i lost control of my brain and it's acting by itself, like i'm not really controlling myself. i'm afraid that i might do something terrible and i'm not aware of it, that i lose control.  


i mean, even writting this post is like i am not myself writing it, but my subconscious on itself...

Yo quick question,17,hd4nvq,5,"Does dissociation feel like daydreaming without the daydreaming? Like your eyes unfocus, your mind goes elsewhere but you're not thinking of anything? For a few hours? :0"
I'm glad that I've found about this sub and know about dissociation,17,hc3i4b,2,"I feel months passing by like days and days passing like months but most of the time im always behind in days.
Everytime someone asks me what day is it I ussually answer the date yesterday or much before time, sometimes it gets so bad that when I wake up I thought it was still a week ago, this actually made me miss a lot of things.
Another one is that I can't remember things years ago, I  also can't seem to remember much about last year, even things that happens just months ago sometimes.

I also don't connect with my friends anymore and never really talked to them ever since the lockdown 2 months ago, and I don't feel the need to.

I actually feel really peaceful now because of this, but I sometimes get bugged when I'm trying to remember something that I don't remember.

Sometimes I don't register what people say and have to ask them to repeat themselves multiple times. Or I don't believe my reflection is really me

When this happens I slightly slur my words or occasionally use the wrong ones,  or I can hardly talk or move at all.

Any loud noise snaps me right out of it, even for a moment. 

If this is disassociation, why might this be happening? I know it is often a result of trauma (which I have due to some things) but I know I don't have DID."

Been having this experience since Sep 23, 2018. I thought it was vertigo at first but I went to 2 ear balance doctors and they told me I have nothing wrong. I then went to 3 neurologists and they told me I have nothing wrong based on my CT scan and EEG. Even went to an opthamologist, he says this is not related to my eyes. 

My psychologist/therapist told me that this is Dissociation exactly a year ago, I believed him but I'm not 100% sure now because my new psychiatrist says that I dont have DID, he says I have psychosis. I went to 3 different psychiatrists since I believed I had Dissociation which was exactly a year ago and none of their meds helped and none of them except the newest doctor explain to me what i'm going through, but the newest doctor says i have psychosis.

Recovery?,17,fwuxse,13,"Hi people. Has anyone actually managed to recover from dp/dr?

I used to dissociate on and off growing up, but am dealing with an intense amount of childhood trauma at therapy lately, and the dissociating has intensified. The dissociating makes me fear intimacy and feel like I don't know someone I have loved for years. I feel totally disconnected from him at times and others I don't. It feels like a challenge for me to be sexual in any way.

I also feel like it is making me question my sexuality too. I identified as bisexual for years and now I just fear all the time I don't really know myself and that I'm actually a lesbian.

Does anyone relate at all? I just feel so dejected and confused. Wish I could snap out of it"
"crosspost from derealization subreddit, ADVICE thread",17,ew1y1h,0,"1-Change your environment. This is listed first because sometimes a change of scenery is all it takes. I usually find that when I'm feeling de-realized I've been in the same position / place for a while. Go on a walk, leave the bed, go outside.

2-Be easy on yourself. Do you find that you've been judging yourself recently for a situation that you're in? Try to be kind to yourself in moments like these and realize that your judgment towards yourself could be making this situation arise.

3-Reflect. A lot of the time when I'm dissociating and or feeling de-realized, I have a lot going on in my own life. Things lose meaning and feel fake, but it often-times stems from inner anxiety. Reflect on what is going on in your life and why it would be the case that you're reacting in the way that you are. Remember that de-realization is oftentimes a natural and instinctual defense mechanism to ""protect"" you from danger. If you are feeling anxious about life, notice how that might be seeping into your symptoms. Recognize that the lack of realness in your life could be triggered by external stressors and internal anxiety.

4-Open your heart. Admitting that you have a problem with de-realization means there is a reality that you know. Recognizing that it is unusual for you to be in this de-realized state means there is a baseline that is natural for you. Accept that you are in this state and recognize that you deserve better."

There's this constant sadness in me. I look back at my high school years and I was feeling exactly same. I'm lacking something. Maybe love, maybe sense of self, purpose, meaning, a real family, genuine care or for someone to care and love me. I had this my entire life.

&#x200B;

It really is just constant 24/7 emotional pain and I must be so disconnected from myself that I don't know what I'm lacking or the cause of this emotional pain. I'm just entirely emotionless now. It's almost like I don't exist as a person and rather I get to own %10 of a regular human being.

&#x200B;

I feel empty a good bit of the time and nobody likes the world-weary looking, sick of living, damaged, eccentric type. I read and try to improve as a person, but I always go back to being no more talkative than a cast iron pot. Do some people like this type? What kind of people? What if I constantly force myself to read, walk, talk or do things? Less time to ruminate will surely help? What's left to do? The 5 things you see, hear etc only help a tiny little bit, even if I repeat it. I'm just truly damaged and tired of life. Should I hide or openly show this quality? I don't know what others will think or if they'll even notice it as such."
Is this normal? (TW: Sexual assault),17,e55cvo,4,"I've been living with severe PTSD for about over a year now, due to being in an abusive relationship and being sexually assaulted. I had previous trauma in my childhood, but I never really recognized it as that severe and it was only until I told somebody that I realized it was in fact trauma. I've been struggling with dissociation ever since I was assaulted, but lately it's felt like it's getting worse. I will feel detached from reality, like I'm in a dream or like my body isn't mine and I'm just watching it from the inside. I've also started to have episodes where I feel like my memories don't belong to me; like, I'll recall them, but they are completely unfamiliar to me, almost like they're from somebody else's life. I've even had a few moments where I suddenly don't know who I am or I can't recognize myself when I look in the mirror. 

I thought all of these symptoms started after I was assaulted. However, I recently had a conversation with my sister, and I mentioned how I used to binge-eat before I lost weight. My sister responded very matter-of-factly ""well of course you did, we didn't have any food in the house."" I asked her what she meant, and she told me that there was a period of time in our teenage years where there was just never any food in the house. She said it's not that we were necessarily starving or anything, but that food was scarce and we only got to eat when our parents cooked for us. I don't remember this at all. I remember that we went through a period of time where we had very little money, but I have no memory whatsoever of not having any food. Is this normal? I didn't think I ever had a problem with dissociation before my assault, but what she said called all that into question. I do remember that I used to space out so hard as a kid that I would lose track of time, but I was usually daydreaming or something like that. I also remember as a teenager, I noticed that my memory was extremely hazy; I tried to tell my doctors and therapists that I couldn't remember anything I'd done all day, but they told me it wasn't a problem. I just don't understand how I could forget something so severe? 

Has anybody else experienced something like this?"
Is the inability to remember feelings* dissociation?,18,dw7dhd,4,"*pain, emotions, taste,..."

Dissociation and Childhood Trauma,17,dfynxz,6,"Well, here goes nothing. 

I think I've been dissociating as a way of dealing with stress. I don't remember much of my childhood, I just remember a few things and it's all about my mother being very abusive (still is but to much lesser degree, she probably is borderline and so was her father)

And all throughout school, (which school was start to finish) I would just remember feeling empty, like really not there, quiet kept to myself. Things at home never helped (except my sister I'm myself around her, she and I have been through a lot together).
I thought I just had horrible social anxiety and a good case of selective mutism(never got diagnosed but it was obvious) (a teacher trashed me accused me of faking it because she saw me talking to my sister in the market one time). 

Now I'm growing up I just thought it was my personality. First part of the puzzle was my father and I getting diagnosed with narcolepsy ( had a case of cataplexy at home), which has been causing fibromyalgia like pain for me. And then I realized I've had days where I felt normal like I could talk animatedly go up and talk to people and just overall felt normal. 

But those out number the days I've felt empty, not sad per se, just empty like I'm not here. So I don't know but the sypmtoms match and I'll probably consult a psychologist once I have the money but right now, I just feel like ranting a little. I still feel empty it only feels better when I'm alone, but the anxiety from the phone and such still creep in.

I get dissociation isnt exactly rare but I know its isnt a daily thing for ever person on the planet and that to me is what she made if sound like. It felt like she downplayed me and what I was feeling. I didn't tell her how I felt because, well I didn't have a full grasp of what I was doing at the time but wth.

ls it possible to full recovery from dissociation?,17,acbquy,10,"actually I m not sure I have this, but I have most of the symptoms. this started with a traumatic night for me a year ago and since I feel really numb. for example I watch a film but it doesnt effect me, I can shut down the computer anytime I want and never think about the story. my 6 years relationship ended a month ago but I didnt feel anything about it. I can remember my past but it feels like the person lived those moments wasnt me. I listen to music but it never feels like the old times. I always have a feeling like something is deeply missing, I cant describe what it is and even I cant describe it for myself. last week I thought I felt in love with a cashier girl, all the day long I thought about her and the next day she was gone, all my feelings about her just wanished. I can change my feelings and beliefs about something instantly and its not a talent... I want to feel again like the old times, I want to watch a film, I want to fell in love with someone or even I want to feel anxiety about something. whats wrong with me? I went to my psychiatrist yesterday and she thought I am lack of vitamin b12. is this dissociative disorder? is it recoverable? please help me. "
Frustrated with mental health professionals,16,9uwj01,9,"I just came back from a real useless psychiatrist appointment. I described how severe my dissociation has gotten and she really had no idea what to say to me so she just kept invalidating what I was saying. I am so frustrated and I feel like I can never get help with this. 

Over the years my different therapists have said I need to consult with my psychiatrist when I bring it up, and when I do my psychiatrists get uncomfortable, then say it‚Äôs not their problem, and then tell me to take it up with my therapist. 

I just feel so hopeless right now about finding help. I feel like I‚Äôm losing huge chunks of my life and no one cares to help me do anything about it. "
Something beautiful to remember [X-POST from r/bipolar],16,7di35f,0,
I had a bad dissociated episode yesterday and now I can‚Äôt remember anything the day before,16,ma8qbm,1,"So yesterday I felt super out of it, I had been for a couple days, I think since Thursday. Now feeling back to normal, I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt remember it like it was me. I can‚Äôt connect to what happened, but when I was in the moment I felt super .. horrible, and now I feel like that wasn‚Äôt even me functioning my body. Like it was another person. So strange. I felt like nothing meant anything to me, my stimulus check hit and I wasn‚Äôt excited like I normal would‚Äôve been, I went shopping and didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt want to do anything. Weird.. any ideas?"
Does anyone do this too?,15,ln2u3r,8,"It feels like I play these cognitive games with myself. I think when I started feeling emotionally overwhelmed I thought I could fix my problems in my own head since I had no one to talk to about it. I thought I could trick myself into forgetting things, pretending like things didn't affect me, denying things, tricking myself into being a certain way, etc.

I'm 26 now and I'm still dissociated. I don't know how to stop being dissociated. I feel like I do it to myself somehow but I don't understand how. I have been this way for so long I don't know how to stop. It always feels like I'm somehow controlling myself or something. Like a part of me is controlling myself and I can't describe it. I don't trust myself on some level it really is confusing and scary.

All I know is I don't want to be dissociated anymore. I want to feel like the old me again. I try meditating and all these somatic/being in the moment exercises but nothing works. As I'm doing it I'm constantly thinking that ""If I do this, I'll be cured"" but then another part of me thinks ""Stop thinking that because you're stopping it from happening"" I sound crazy.

Even when I talk to my therapist I feel like I'm only telling them things because that ""will cure me"" not because I actually want to. It makes no sense to me. I think I basically constructed this complex/thing in my head when I was younger and overwhelmed and now I feel like I can't break out of it. I don't know how.

I research about dissociation/trauma all the time. I keep reading about acceptance and all this bullshit. Like if I accepted that I was dissociated and miserable I wouldn't even be searching for this shit. Then it's like do I accept that I can't accept? Do I accept that I can't accept that I can't accept? And so on. It gets so meta and confusing. Life makes no sense anymore and I don't know how to go back to the old me where it was simple and I didn't have these crazy thoughts. I feel trapped by these existential/confusing thought loops. I just want to break free from the dissociation. I want to be me again. Can anyone relate or help?"
Dissociation and Adderall,17,lkstnz,5,"I dissociate in all degrees, from a day totally blank in the face and unable to remember anything moment to moment, to impulsive dissociation where I become erratic, dangerous, a flight risk.
Recently I began taking Adderall. I had never even considered taking it, but after a traumatic, emotional break I had been unable to focus. Unable to stay in my own body.
I am in between doctor appointments and waiting for a refill and I have been in a constant state of dissociation. I realize now as I look back on my days with Adderall (low dose) I was present. Calm and present.
I don‚Äôt want to have to depend on a drug like Adderall, but it has changed my life. I haven‚Äôt felt alive in over three years now.
Should I be worried? Am I getting myself into trouble using this drug to keep present? Can any of you relate?"
Is there a correlation between dissociation and headaches?,17,lj82ar,6,"I haven‚Äôt hit my head on anything but I‚Äôve been dissociating since yesterday (I think anyway. Brain fog, emotional numbness, blank stares, feeling like I‚Äôm underwater almost). Before I first dissociated yesterday I started having a headache and have been having headaches and dissociation on and off since, also pain at the top of the back of my neck. I‚Äôm not sure if this pain is caused by stress or if it‚Äôs part of dissociation or if I‚Äôm having a migraine or something?"

"i think I'm constantly dissociating but im not sure, any input?",16,l8e2tm,20,"sorry for formatting, am on mobile 

to elaborate: i have all of the other symptoms; 
‚Ä¢ life feels like a haze, like a dream; and when i realize it it comes crashing down on me that i'm constantly going thru the motions. 
‚Ä¢ i don't feel alive at all, and i have a lot of trouble remembering things about myself + my memories. 
‚Ä¢ i've had trauma in my childhood but also struggle w identifying it as trauma bc i'd rather put on a happy face to cope :/

i'm unsure if it's dissociation because i don't hear any voices in my head. i'm 95% sure this is cuz of dissociation and cuz if i did, i'd be a hell of a lot worse all the time... BUT idk if it's jus how i am or if it's a rarer symptom :(:( i did research online but couldn't find much about it. 

TL;DR: unsure if i actually am dissociating constantly bc IDK if having constant silence in your mind (not having any internal dialogue) is a symptom."
Dating with severe/chronic depersonalisation and dissociation (TRIGGER WARNING),17,kxkfyx,0,"Hey guys. It's been a while.

My doctor recent advised me that be believed the cure to my ailments would be to get laid ('Do you have sex? Do it. It's good for you?.) I smiled and nodded, realized he meant well but knowing little of my story. (I'm no doctor, but I am not aware that intercourse cures CPTDS and DDNOS, but by this point I am open to new ideas 

My first memory ever is being molested. I was coerced into giving this guy a blowjob - nuts and all. He said I did a good job. Guess he must've been 17. He was a juvenile criminal placed at the halfway house my dad worked at. I must have been around age 2. I didn't remember this until a flashback at age 17 after a near-fatal car crash, but I digress.

I don't remember much. It's all flashback and rarely accessible currently, but I remember the smell. That smell of genitals and excitement, which I guess you would call 'the smell of sex'. It's always there. Rather obviously, bodily encounters are rare, and never really at the front of my mind.

Lets move to the more 'romantic' aspect - say dating. Where you get to know each other, flirt, maybe hold hands etc. I will admit, that from the outside it looks terrible easy. 

However, each time I try, every single layer of protection embedded in me somehow takes over, and I am unable for a second to genuinly feel intimaticy. Whevever something resembles, I either fade away or blatantly self-obstruc to eliminate the situation. As you might imagine this bring some problems to the dating department. Probably doesn't help that I'm quite literal and have a hard time decoding body language directed at me, which is really rather stressfull.

When I get a potential female (I'm one of the boring, shameful heteronormative cis-fellows (hope I get that right)) for my self, it feel's as if there's a chasm apart us. I read once that flirting is a continuous serious of question - verbal or not - where the ansnwer is always maybe. I'll admit it sounds romantic and all, and I've seen some James Bond, so I get the general idea, but it's like there's something missing - a void you can't cross. You can easily see what's happening, and part of you know what's expected, but somehow you're somehow unable to reach out and cross that barrier to the world. or Life, if one was a poet.

I'm not sure what my point is here, but it might be twofold. Do any of you ever experience this - not akwardness, but rather distance, between yourself and new partners, and (this one might be for the ladies, and is not intended to offend of stir emoting. I ask as a scholar and a gentleman to understand the mechanics involved in dating/mating.) 

If you, as a woman was approaced by a potential partner, whom showed interest in you, and with whom you share chemistry, but you didn't immediately get a sexual vibe, would you write him off immediately?  Not sure this is a dissociative question per se, but I suffer severe dissociation and I'm the one asking #lawyered"
Have anyone felt something like this? It is dissociation?,16,kuwrys,2,"I have always thougth that I was feeling just dizzy and weak, but now Im questioning if its dissociation. 

I feel like my body is not mine, like Im wearing a suit that is not my size. 
Some times I feel like my body is heavier than it is and I need a lot of effort to move it so that makes me tired and my movements slower; but some other times I feel like my body its lighter than it should so it move faster, like I cant quite control it and Im clumsier. 
Some times its just some of my body parts, like I dont recognise my hands or voice, and feel they should be different like my hands should be bigger and my voice deeper. Some times I even freak out to see myself so weird and alien like. 

Also I tend to feel like life its a dream or simple not real, even if I know it is real. I usually feel like I dont belong to my enviroment, like there is some fog or something between me and the rest of the world, everything looks so distant and plain, like some painting.

I dont have a good grip on time, it just past so slow or so fast some times, some memories look so distant were they happend recently or some look so close but I dont know When they happend.
My memories looks so hasty and fuzzy, like I know it happend to me because is in my head but otherwise I would think it is a movie. It is so bad that I dont longer know the difference between remembering something and just knowing the fact that it happend. 

Have anyone felt something like this? It is dissociation?"

 During the first months, I was so affraid that It will be like that for a long time... Then, 1 year passed. I got more affraid...
I keep asking myself ""How much time will it last again?""
And now it's been 2 years...
It seem it will never end, or it will take some more years...
But I can't, It's not a life ...

And I don't have the time to heal

People still except from me to work, gain money, I have to pay stuff to survive and not be in street... But I can't. I'm not even able to work.
I did
During ten months I got a job ! I was happy... It was hard but Atleast I was having money to pay my roof... I endured everything... All the morning it was so hard to get out to the point I would trow up to have atleast one more day off... All the stress from my boss... Enduring the dissociation during the whole day while working...

I'm bad to exactly say how I feel, to really explain my pain...
But after these 10months, I exploded... I cried I cried, begging myself to not go, hurting myself, thinking to stop all that for good... But then I waked up my partner, asked him ""please take me to the hospital, or I will do something crazy""
Never came back to my job, just told them it was too much for me and that I was at the hospital...

I don't have a job anymore since some months...
I get a little money from the governement, but it will end soon...
Idk what I'm gonna do.
Idk what I can do.
I know, but I'm just not able to do it again, I'm not okay, I can't endure anymore... I don't want to endure, please"
This is why I love dissociation.,16,khhsp4,3,"My mind. My sweet beautiful mind can make up some far out ideas that I have begun to believe during the mids of dissociative episodes. 

Hear me out. 

Everything has a nature in and of itself. There are polar reactions, like simple magnetic attraction in every atom and molecular structure that our world is composed of. Simple factual chemistry where our beautiful sense of love is just a chemical reaction. What I love about science is that it shows us the fundamental building blocks of our very being. I love to pair science by complimenting it with the stories that occultists preach - mind over matter, and old teachings, how the bible says that forgiveness is freedom... Mind, body and spirit. Our awareness, our will and the physical realm. 

I don't know WHY I'm stuck in this body watching everything I do in some weird bizarre David Attenborough style documentary, but I am. I am HERE. INSIDE. My mind extends to the very bottoms of my fingers tips and that's where I realise that everything I touch and feel, it is my mind interacting with this strange set and array of compounds around me, causing motion and all of a sudden I'm understanding physics in a new way. My depression lead me to cope through dissociation and dissociation has taken me from a world that had only one insight, to a world where everything is so weird and bizarre, magical... A place where suddenly magic is real.  Our minds are tied to our bodies, there's no detachment from that. No matter if you travel on the astral plane, you will always have your soul return to your body, unless of course you were to be on the verge of death. I don't understand why my consciousness HAS to be tied to being a bloody human but what I do realise is that every damn one of us has a consciousness, no matter how big or small. People with disabilities of the most misunderstood or ""low intelligence"", animals, plants, everything in this cosmos breathes. Everything in this cosmos is interacting with the atoms beside it. We are ALL stuck here. INSIDE. 

So instead of suicide, I travel further down my minds realisation's of this strange place, instead of exploring the outer parts of me such as using my brain electricity to turn on a light bulb, I use my third eye to make all those sparkly colours when I shut my eyes turn into beautiful meditative imagery and psychedelic artworks. In this dark space of the mind I suddenly find my body floating like a stereo typical hippie floating during mediatation and all of a sudden my body is alseep, rested and my mind is awake and free, to do anything I wish. 

And this is when I can leave my body. This is where I meet beings of other places. This is where I cope with being stuck inside of myself. I am not sure if I will ever be able to answer why I, or we, or anybody or anything has to exist like this, but at least I've made it bearable. 

&#x200B;

IF you're watching yourself like a TV, you've just got to change the channel. Raise your frequency, but stay grounded. There's some very important reason we are who we are. Your mind is beautiful, you are art in and of itself, you are radical, capricious and you the fundamental of creation.

My more common dissociations are where I‚Äôd zone out completely and not be aware of my surroundings in the slightest, but lately it‚Äôs been much more of an out of body experience. I feel like my body is not mine and every sensation feels somewhat unfamiliar and wrong. I hate it it‚Äôs like I have a glass wall separating me from reality and I can‚Äôt shake it. It‚Äôs scary. 
Ive been under huge amounts of stress at work and school lately so I know that‚Äôs what brought it on, I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with it now that it‚Äôs here.

Dissociation mimicking neurological conditions?,16,i6q6a9,3,"Sorry if this is jumpy cant concentrate.

First time on this channel.  I went through what I consider to be a two-year dissociative hiatus a few years ago accompanied by serious health anxiety. After a series of bizarre physical symptoms, I became convinced I was developing some kind of neurological condition and committed my time to find out what was going on. Of course, my findings through a battery of medical tests were inconclusive and I stopped looking. Fortunately, with the right medication and therapy, or maybe time itself, the state faded and life went back to normal.

A week ago I woke up back in my dissociation almost like where it left off unaware what triggered it. It's like how I remember my previous experience, a slight disconnect from reality, and my identity with the overall mindset that I can only describe as perpetuating mellow edginess that never gets replaced by something reassuring. I can't shake the feeling the dissociation is an interference of something more sinister deep within my brain. This, or the dissociation itself traps me in a never-ending suspicion of a physical narrative that I'm forced to deem plausible.

Has anyone felt something similar during a dissociative state?"
Healing trauma that happened while Dissociated,15,hq0qc7,6,"Is it possible? I've had things happen to me while I was dissociated, and I didn't know if I could heal"
How do I bring this up to my therapist?,17,hldqkm,4,"I‚Äôve been exploring the idea of dissociation for awhile trying to figure myself out. Within the past few months, I‚Äôve started therapy for the first time and I also see a psychiatrist for medication management for severe depression (the kind where you can‚Äôt shower or leave your bed for 3months) plus adhd and anxiety (anxiety is pretty much under control)

I see my therapist every two weeks and as soon as I walk into the office, it‚Äôs like a switch flips. Suddenly I‚Äôm able to figure out all these things about myself and help give ideas to solve them. As soon as I get in my car to leave, the switch flips again. I *immediately* forget everything we talked about, tools she gave me, etc. it‚Äôs like it never happened. I feel like I‚Äôm not making any progress there. 

My psychiatrist and I basically discuss how the meds are working and try to figure out if anything needs tweaked. Right now I‚Äôm on Vyvanse, Adderall, lamictal, Wellbutrin, cymbalta, metoprolol (for bp/tachycardia and anxiety) and trazodone. Sometimes everything works, sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt. Anyway moving back to my point..

So if I could make a list of things I‚Äôve been concerned about that have led me to think I‚Äôm dissociating..: 

- I have no concept of time. I‚Äôm late for everything and sometimes days will go by without me realizing at all. 

- I have zero memory.  The 3 months I spent too depressed to leave my bed have been completely forgotten like they never happened. I don‚Äôt remember anything from before I was like 17 (I‚Äôm 24 now). But I do distinctly remember once I was with some friends in my backyard, zoned out for idk maybe 5m? Snapped back and had forgotten I was at my house. Someone could tell me something and 5m later I‚Äôll have no memory of even speaking to them. 

- I feel like sometimes I‚Äôm able to snap into different versions of myself? Not quite different people, just different personalities of myself UD that makes sense? There‚Äôs happy, productive me from 3y ago, aggressive and confrontational me from 1y ago, social and immature me from high school, etc

- if something happens that makes me sad, I can usually sort of disconnect myself and me feelings and feel like it‚Äôs something that happened a long time ago or something that didn‚Äôt happen at all. 

Anyway I definitely didn‚Äôt intend for this to be so long. How do I bring dissociation up to my therapist or psychiatrist? But also.. what if I don‚Äôt want to stop? Is that weird? It‚Äôs been a great (well maybe not so much) coping mechanism for me for so long and just feels .. comfortable."
There is no me,16,hj4ckv,3,"Here in my room, nothing is real unless I focus. When I do, the green door decked in vests and kilts and sweatshirts takes on such substance that it cannot truly exist - its too solid, nothing can be so real. None of it is mine, there is no me. The dark grey comforter that warms me is a thing of beauty fascinating to behold, but I'm not under it. My awareness has less substance than a ghost.

In the morning I will look at my children, and when I chance to concentrate I will see them as the most beautiful site I could imagine. And they will laugh with me and I will entertain them, but I won't be there. I won't be anywhere. Just a ghost bending light, faking life that's far distant from this time and space.

Like many apparitions from the old tales, I will burn to come back to the world of the living and be again with those I love. And if I can stay strong, they'll think I have. But I'll never fool myself. And my charade becomes more transparent by the day.

This is how I feel. I'm self aware enough to know it's bullshit - I'm here, real as anyone. But it sure doesn't feel like it. And I am always dumb and unobservant, slow to react. Always depleted of energy, near useless. It doesn't feel sustainable"
Nothing like a global pandemic and civil unrest to make me feel emotions again,18,gzcvls,1,What a time to be alive
Is it possible to dissociate for years on end?,16,gwz7v0,17,"Hi! Sorry for asking this, I know I should ask an actual therapist but my family doesn't really believe in that kind of thing (I'll be sure so see one when I've got my own money tho). 

Context (I'll label where it ends if you don't wanna hear my life story):

In middle school I started being intensely bullied by multiple people on a daily basis for the entire time I was in that school (being followed home, beaten up, spreading rumors, got molested in class once. It was bad. I've learned to stand up for myself since and am fine now tho) for the first year I was really depressed, would cry and get mad at people constantly, but the second and third years I didn't feel anything. I didn't cry for an entire two years. I even stopped being suicidal (again- I am fine now, I love life, my friends are perfect, I get ""depressed"" occasionally for a couple weeks on end but haven't been suicidal since 7th grade) 

Since then I don't really ""feel"" as intensely as one should (used to not at all) but I know what my emotions are and force myself to experience them by listening to music of that mood and saying to my friends explicitly ""I feel happy"" ""I feel melancholic"" ""I feel annoyed"". 

It's like seeing a scrape but not feeling the pain- you know you're hurt, but don't *feel* it for whatever reason. 

I definitely think I'm getting better, especially since my friends and the people at my new school are wonderful, but also partially because I've been working on it, but I don't know if it's actually dissociation (like I call it) or if I should be looking for some other cause.

End of context: 

I know dissociation usually comes in episodes, some can last hours, some months, but mine started and just stayed, so idk if it's really dissociation. It gets worse sometimes but never goes away, not even for a couple minutes. 

Does anyone have any input on if it's really dissociation/if it is, how I can work on it more effectively?"
am i dissociating?,14,gptrm2,11,"i thought i had dissociation disorder but i‚Äôve been reading thru this subreddit and nothing i‚Äôve experience has been anywhere near as severe but i think it‚Äôs getting worse. i‚Äôm 99% sure i have maladaptive daydreaming and i think that caused the ‚Äúdissociation‚Äù or whatever i‚Äôm experiencing - i would listen to music and pace/skip/run up and down my house and escape from reality and it would help me bc i‚Äôve been kinda generally sad for the past few months but i don‚Äôt wanna get into that. as much as maladaptive daydreaming makes me happy, it became a compulsion i guess, not in an ocd way (i have ocd and it‚Äôs sorta severe), just in a way that makes me restless until i give into it. maladaptive daydreaming never used to make me feel like i was dissociating, it just took me out of reality for a bit and i was sad when it had to end. i‚Äôve been maladaptive daydreaming (if that‚Äôs what it is) for, i‚Äôm pretty sure, most of my life, although i used to do it in different ways. anyways i think maladaptive daydreaming started to make me ‚Äúdissociate‚Äù bc the feeling of dissociation got worse the more i did it. idk if it CAUSED the feeling of dissociation but it definitely made it worse. i remember one time it was like 2am (which obviously would make me more likely for something like this to happen) and i was tired and i looked down at my arms and hands and freaked out because i didn‚Äôt feel like they were mine i guess??? like it felt like i was trapped inside someone else‚Äôs body or that my body wasn‚Äôt mine. and now pretty much every time i look at my body it doesn‚Äôt feel like me. it sorta feels like i‚Äôm someone else? like i look down at my hands when i‚Äôm typing and it doesn‚Äôt really feel like IM controlling them. when i look in the mirror i know it‚Äôs my face but it feels like i‚Äôm looking at a different person. honestly i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve felt like myself at all in a while, like it‚Äôs been a while since i‚Äôve looked at myself and felt like i was truly me. the feeling of not being me is really scary and i use maladaptive daydreaming to escape it which i think in turn makes the feeling worse so it‚Äôs like a cycle. 

another thing i want to mention is that for most of my life i‚Äôve hated my name and i went by a different name for a while, but going by a diff name made me actually like my real name so i started going by it again - but now, bc i used an alt name for a while, my real name doesn‚Äôt feel like me. when someone says my name it doesn‚Äôt really feel like they‚Äôre calling me, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre calling someone completely different either. i‚Äôve been able to get used to a completely new name, but i stopped using it bc my friends couldn‚Äôt pronounce it, and now i‚Äôve started going by yet another name and it doesn‚Äôt really feel like me yet but since i‚Äôve gotten used to names before i know it will soon. 

i‚Äôm just kinda having a crisis ab my name at the moment, idk why i just feel stressed about it. i‚Äôm tired rn and emotions are hard to describe. i‚Äôve also had ocd for pretty much my whole life and it‚Äôs lowkey severe (not incredibly severe but not mild either) so maybe the possible dissociation is something to do with that? maybe it‚Äôs a way for my mind to escape from the ocd and i just don‚Äôt know it yet? 

anyways basically i just wanted to know if this is dissociation or not. obviously no one here can diagnose me but i just wanna know if it sounds like it or not bc idk. thanks for any help <3"

Ever since I was...maybe 3 or 4, I've had an imaginary friend. Let's call him B. Pretty normal for a kid. In middle school my friends and I (all very mentally ill kids) tried to see if we could make imaginary friends ""real"" (fake sixth grade understandings of quantum theory, we got our hands on what the bleep do we know). The friend who popped up around this time was B. He hadn't really gone away, but he'd been....less around. When my friends decided to do this experiment, I didn't choose to try him out, he just kinda...was there.

Around this time, more ""friends"" showed up. Some where characters from TV I watched, some felt ""made up"". This continued until we went to high school. But in high school, more kept showing up. It was common within my real-people group of friends to let our ""friends"" ""take over"" our bodies. It led to some very fucking weird situations, and I remember most of them, but was absolutely dissociating for a lot of it. 

In high school I decided to get the most ""Prominent"" ones their own journal, and see about writing. I remember sometimes feeling like I chose to change my handwriting for them, and sometimes not. Even though I wasn't hanging with my middle school friends anymore, I would still ""let"" these ""friends"" ""take over"" my body. Still with memory, still dissociated the whole time. 

When I got into college some fucked up stuff happened and I didn't really engage with anything like that. Occasionally B would show up, and I would see him almost with my minds eye, in front of me, or in the room. But I'd hear his voice in my head as different from mine. I thought, okay, childhood crutch like a kids blanket or something. 

Recently, he's been ""showing up"" unprompted. It's normal for me to ""see"" him when I talk about him, but nothing else. Now he's just kind of around. Even ""took control"" once in late university for a few hours which was very strange. Again once last year after an emotionally intense situation. Recently, I've heard other voices similar to how I hear B's. Sometimes saying innocuous shit, sometimes to combat me saying ""I'm fine"" or that ilk with ""are you sure though"" or ""don't tell her"" or stuff like that. 

There's also been...confusion of traits about me with ones about B. Specifically in gender and sexuality spectrums (he is a gay man, i'm a lesbian, I thought I was a trans bi dude for a while).

I don't have DID, this much I know. I don't have amnesia, though I do have a shit memory generally. I'm also fully aware that dissociation and identity confusion are symptoms of BPD, and dissociation comes often with C-PTSD. 

This is just something that seems so weird, and feels only partially within my control, and has been happening for so long, I kind of want input to see if like, I don't know. Is this more symptoms of even more shit I have to work through? Am I being haunted? Am I making everything up in a way I can't stop? I'm stressed and I don't even know where to start."

Is it ever hard to control your body?,17,fmz52w,15,"I‚Äôm kind of new to learning about this and the therapist that diagnosed me was really bad.. we only had 2 sessions that she kind of dominated and then I couldn‚Äôt afford to keep going so I never got to know too much. 

But anyways, is it ever hard sometimes to control your body? Kinda like sleep paralysis but.. awake paralysis, to an extent. Earlier today I spent 20 minutes desperately trying to just move my arms. It‚Äôs not that I couldn‚Äôt feel them I just couldn‚Äôt make them move. It happens a lot, where no matter how desperately I seem to want my body do something it just doesn‚Äôt translate to movement or action. Sometimes it can be really bad because it‚Äôll last indefinite periods, and sometimes I‚Äôll lay in bed just dying for a glass of water within arms reach I‚Äôm literally staring at but can‚Äôt reach for, for up to hours. 

Is this part of dissociation? How do I like.. not..?"
Could you please help me understand what happened to me after a trauma? I think I dissociated for months,16,fg0rbs,7,"Hello,

I just found this community and was wondering if someone here might have some ideas as to if what I experienced was dissociation. I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here.

Without beating around the bush. 12 years ago I experienced a set of traumatic experiences including emotional trauma and s**ual assault. I don't remember the latter, only a few flashes of image/smell. Somewhere during the next month I stop remembering anything for about half a year.

 I have gone to therapy for years and always was very sure that I don't want to remember the trauma(therapists suggested that it might've been good to remember but I was always very adamantly against that idea). My psychiatrists also said that locking out a memory is a common way for brain to protect itself.

But to the half of year of not remembering anything. I never disclosed that in therapy. I also actually only heard how I was from my sister. she says that I only woke up to go to school and after school basically just went to bed and cried myself to sleep. Didn't talk to anyone. She says that when she'd talk at me I'd just stare at her for a bit and then turn around and walk away. Kind of sounds like I was on an autopilot. It went on like that for months.

I have no recollection of any of this. The first thing I remember after the traumatic period was that I was sitting on a couch in front of my sister and mum and they were crying and telling me that I can't keep behaving like this. And I had no clue what I did wrong. But I think I snapped back from there.

Now I have always had derealization moments ever since I was a kid. Also, what I later learned was dissociation when I had anxiety or panic attacks. But this seems somehow different. It has been weighing on me a bit lately.

What do you guys think?
Thanks so much to anyone who read this far."
How do I get out of it?,16,fe6qks,4,"I've been dissociating for like two days straight now. I've probably done this to myself by sleeping way too much recently and then just watching netflix the rest of the time, but now I can't seem to snap out of it.

Anything I can do to ""wake up"" that will almost certainly work? Its starting to worry me."
hello! Unsure if I have dissociation?,16,fdwgx9,6,"Just posting to get some advice :) Im unsure if I have dissociation or maybe depression?, I blank out a lot and sometimes just scroll on my phone without even looking at what‚Äôs on the screen. I find concentrating on tasks quite hard and find it pretty difficult to put in effort. I‚Äôm not really invested in anything or find anything interesting, I don‚Äôt even know what I like anymore or who I am. I feel disconnected from myself.
 I‚Äôm putting uni on hold because I honestly just can‚Äôt study cause all I do is sit in my head and it‚Äôs so hard put in the effort. Maybe I‚Äôm just lazy?

Grounding Techniques?,17,fa57y9,8,"I'm currently dissociating hard. I recently learned that I struggle with dissociation, so I haven't chance to explore grouding techniques. Do any of you have advice on how to explore grounding techniques that might work best for me? How do you ground yourself, and what sensory system helps keep you grounded?"
Dissociation intensifies while concentrating?,17,f8un8l,7,"Often when I'm very focused on studying/playing videogames/programming/etc. I dissociate harder than normal, infact I never dissociate as much as when I'm concentrating on a task, whether it's reading or doing the dishes.

Recently discovered my boyfriend definitely has this. Any tips that could help us get through it?,16,f64gz6,5,"In brief, he struggles with night panics and disassociation. He says he feels like his hands don‚Äôt belong to him and that he‚Äôs living in a third person view, he‚Äôs awake but he isn‚Äôt aware of his surroundings and feels like he isn‚Äôt him. It‚Äôs scary, he feels like he‚Äôs going to die and that he‚Äôs all alone. This normally happens during the night, typically triggered by something someone said to him during the day that made him upset or think about death. Could anyone offer advice as to potential solutions or ways we could deal with this? Thanks in advance :)"
dissociation but never away from my thoughts,16,f5hcoe,2,"If I'm ""gone"" it's more like daydreaming, momentarily lost in an intense thought (esp a triggering one) but I still see what is going on around me and I still am thinking a train of thoughts. I can easily snap myself back into what i'm supposed to be doing. I never dissociate away from my thoughts, if I'm dissociating I'm also actively thinking about something. My thought train will make me dissociate if I think of something triggering. 

&#x200B;

I rarely lose time (if anything I'm just lost in thought, I'm never just so dazed that time passes by and i don't realize it. It's usually I was distracted with an idea and was absorbed I guess is the word), I never experience the ""I don't remember doing this or having this conversation"". The closest I've gotten to that is putting things in the fridge rather than the freezer, which I guess counts but other than that nothing. My internal monologue is ALWAYS THERE. I'm never floating on nothing. I am always floating on a cloud of shit-thoughts. 

Just wondering if this is how it is for others. Why i can't even be ""free"" from my thoughts while dissociating? It feels really stupid. Like why does my brain think dissociation is helpful if it doesn't help me escape what is triggering me; my thoughts!!! I thought dissociation was a defense mechanism to ""get you away"" from something you can't process. so. is that happening? or... my brain gets overwhelmed with something that I legit cannot process in that moment so I will dissociate while I attempt to think it through? i don't even know."
Can anyone remember the first time they dissociated?,16,ehbzd2,9,"I visited this forum out of curiosity. Last year I had to move back in with my mother and bring my three year old with me.

I originally left her house as soon as I could at the age of 18 but due to unforseen circumstances have had to come back 8 years later. I need her support and help and that I am grateful for tremendously. But today we were having a discussion that of course turned into her putting me down about little simple things. I guess I can't feel any love in her voice. I help around the house and I buy things we need. Food/toiletries etc. I take care of my son make sure he has EVERYTHING he needs at my expense and I work 30 hours a week. I'm burnt out at times and I've been through physical, emotional abuse, neglect as a child, though nobody admits it, drug abuse as a coping mechanism... Etc...

Dissociation started at such a young age that I can recall the first memory I have of intentionally doing this. Just feeling invisible. Disappearing. It was great. I was pretty much invisible anyway. I no longer had to deal with the screaming, the fights, the alcoholic rage taking place in what was supposed to be my home. 

Being back in her house makes me realize how much I've abused the power of dissociation to the point some days I am not 'there' but am not aware of it until something snaps me out of it. 

Dissociating was and is so convenient when you deliberately control it but man, does it suck when it happens unintentionally from using it so much."
in need of help,18,eg02l9,7,"i have a history of dissociation (which is usually derealization) but it usually isn‚Äôt that extreme (unless amplified from an outside source like drugs).

for the past 2 days (now day 3) i‚Äôve been in this perpetual state of dissociation. it‚Äôs really odd because it feels like i‚Äôm going in and out of reality and everything is overlapping. i was fine when i woke up in the morning, but then when i the thought of dissociation just came to mind it was retriggered? is that normal??

i‚Äôve been stuck in this state for so much longer than i‚Äôm used and it starting to freak me out please any tips on how to end dissociation would be amazing"
My life is a bad trip,16,dvv136,4,"Reading posts of people talking about ego death on shrooms and LSD and how life changing an experience it is and all I can think is that I lose all connection to my subjective self on a daily basis and it's nothing special or spiritually enlightening. It's a pain in the ass not knowing who I'm going to be by this time tomorrow. 

As a side note, even reading descriptions of that kind of stuff can turn my brain to gravel and cause rapid switching and I don't know why I put myself through it >.<"
Progress!,15,cu0dx5,4,Yesterday was my first day being able to go throughout the entire day with minimal dissociation and no Xanax. I‚Äôve been going through an antidepressant switch which has made this all the more difficult.

New to this.,15,cflhku,2,"This is my first post ever, but today I woke up. I woke up and my baby was 6 months old and my son is almost 3. I'm pretty sure I cried for an hour, no one ever tells you about the loss with dissociation and having children. I've had dissociation my whole life and my kids are the only things that can snap me out of my fogs so when I look down and I don't see my two babies anymore but two children, it's kind of a huge reality check. I think I need to start grounding myself more so I won't have all these memory gaps."
I dissociate at the littlest stress,16,adzseu,5,"It's sad. I guess it has to do with my social anxiety and depression? But anytime I need to do many things at once, go out in public or do a very physically/mentally demanding task I dissociate badly. Which makes it hard to stay alert, specially in public. It's nerve wracking and it makes me even more anxious when it happens. I feel out of control and like I can't shake myself out of a bad dream. I get extremely clumsy. It makes me feel pathetic."
I don‚Äôt remember the last time I felt something,15,9qcrxl,16,Is anyone else pretty much always dissociated. I can‚Äôt work or function and it‚Äôs driving me insane. What meds/coping mechanisms have you found to work best for you?

... baby steps. If you're struggling, remember that recovery might be slow, but it is possible. Do not force yourself to be normal because you will regress. "
How I solved Dissociation,17,87ph24,4,"I may have found a solution for us. One day I woke up and felt more dissociated than ever and felt like there was no hope to get back to normal. I could feel deep inside of me one very slight possible way: I had to either give into anger and push through my dissociation until I‚Äôm free or give into sadness and welcome my dissociation until it no longer has an effect on me. The thing is, I have to choose one and not the other in order to escape, and to have fully decided which one I chose, I will have to feel I‚Äôve dedicated myself enough that there is no going back and no hope for the other option. For about two weeks I kept opting between the two options, never able to fully choose one and dedicate myself to it.

Then something amazing happened. I get in this really stupid argument with a dumb bitch and leave the situation weighed down by negative energy. After I leave, I feel angry and disgusted. Anger turns to sadness and then I‚Äôm just thinking about how much my life sucks, how I have no friends and how I‚Äôm stuck in these immature arguments when everyone else is actually doing something with their life. As sadness overtakes me, I can tell it is the correct choice and I fully dedicate myself to it. I let sadness fuel me and breathe in a way that causes me to feel like warm blood is flowing into a spot between my lungs.

The more I do this, the more I can feel my genuine emotion returning. After a few minutes, I felt the circuit was completed. Through genuine sadness, I could now access genuine anger, and through sadness and anger I could access every other emotion and was therefore no longer dissociated.

I hope this was helpful and if you have any questions don‚Äôt hesitate to ask below and I‚Äôll answer them best I can. üôÇ"

Maladaptive Daydreaming and thoughts of sex.,15,m79bjv,12,"Hello everyone.

I suppose I have a human need for intimacy and love at the moment that I can‚Äôt fulfill so I escape to those fantasies which don‚Äôt even really involve me since I think about other characters and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù how they would feel.

this is a new one ‚Äì dissociating because of art,15,lm6s67,2,"I just watched some online interactive theatre stuff. And I enjoyed it, but the comedian was playing with reality a little bit. Well, a lot.

And ooohhh man. I'm fine, I'm okay, I've gotten better at knowing how to handle feeling spaced out, anxious and disoriented. I trust that I'll be fine eventually, if not today or tomorrow, in a week at least. But it's a lot. And it's impressive. I don't remember art ever triggering my dissociation this bad ‚Äì Get Out and Midsommar weren't great for my brain, but this is something else.

I'm going to hope and assume no one knows what I'm referring to, because it was so brilliantly done and I wouldn't want to spoil it. But basically, I was made to feel I was also watching other people watch this comedian. We were in a kind of big zoom thing together. Zoom/skype/facetime stuff already cause me to dissociate more, so I try to avoid it. But I love this comedian and the pandemic is boring. So I was prepared for *some* dissociation. I watched other people, and how they laughed, sometimes didn't at all, or walked away, made tea, hugged their dog. For about two hours. It was fascinating and made me feel less alone, which was much needed. I was even made to feel I had talked to someone, one on one.

In the end, it turned out, all of those people had prerecorded their stuff. No one could see me, I could see no one. The idea was to show the audience how isolated and lonely we are, during covid.

Great, cool, very creative, genuinely pretty brillianty done. But when I closed my lapotp, nothing felt real and now my derealization is so, so bad. There's also just the fact that I really didn't need to be reminded of how incredibly lonely I am. Being isolated triggers my dissociation as well. Besides that, it's just very depressing. These feelings aren't enjoyable or fascinating for me. It just sucks and it scares me.

And I feel a bit weird about someone making such depressing art in such a difficult time. Especially when you're a comedian, oof.

I laughed and applauded when it ended but am close to tears now. It makes me feel like there should be a warning, but maybe that's completely ridiculous. You might as well give a sunset or anywhere loud or bright a warning. This is just not what I needed, am I'm going to try to find something hopeful and grounding to read or watch now.

Just needed to vent about it to people who get it."
If dissociation was a song lol,15,li5isw,2,
How do you know if you're you?,14,lgmzqh,16,"I had a pretty bad dissociative episode about a month ago and I thought it would go away, but after a therapist appointment I decided maybe I should bring this up here.

So I was in the shower when I realized that I didn't know who I was. I didn't know if I was still...well, let's say my name is Vegas. I didn't know if I was Vegas. It was like he had receded into my mind and suddenly I was left to take care of his body, and had the responsibilities he had, or that I had gotten him into. I didn't know if I was actually Vegas, or if I had just been trained to respond to the name Vegas, and that the real Vegas was in here, somewhere, but just didn't want to come out. And maybe he hadn't come out for years.

It took me about two days to feel like I was back to normal again. I honestly still cannot say if I am Vegas or not, but I still put down this body's name on all of my forms and stuff. So, I guess I'm him now? I don't really know who I am. I feel like I'm a completely different person sometimes.

Well, from that I discovered a new voice in my head. Combined with another one I found the week after, that makes a total of three voices, or more rather presences, in my head. It like I'm flying an airplane, with me as the pilot, one of the voices as my co-pilot, and everyone else is in coach. I try to talk about this with my therapist, but he keeps telling me that I'm trying to describe DID to him. I can't have DID, because nothing that traumatic happened to me. I think? I don't know, every time I try to access any potential memories about it I am met with a big door. And, frankly, I don't know if it's something I want to go through. I mean, it was agonizing when my therapist read all of my texts I sent him when I was not feeling good (possibly dissociated, I don't know), as they didn't really sound like something I would send him.

Anyway, enough about my rant. My question is, how do you know if you're you? What do you do if you don't know your name or you feel like you're someone else?"

Confused,15,kz3awb,4,"I'm honestly not sure if what I've been feeling is dissociation or not.

"first post, have been dissociating for years.& my therapists have never been super helpful",15,km94xd,2,(disclaimer: i‚Äôm not sure of the differences between dissociation / derealization / depersonalization so i‚Äôm not sure which i experience) i first started dissociating after a major family death my senior year of high school (which also sent me into a major existential crisis that lasted for over a year & was continually triggering) for the next year my episodes never lasted more than a few hours but they were super intense like i would be sitting in my bedroom & would have no idea where i was. the year after that (i was in a really unhealthy relationship that left me constantly anxious & triggered) my episodes got longer & i think at one point lasted months (i also got super paranoid at one point but i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a dissociation thing ?) over the last year ive had three major episodes that lasted a really long time & i have pretty much no idea what to do about it. ive brought it up to different therapists ive had and they‚Äôve all basically just told me to do breathing exercises & stuff i already do for my anxiety which i haven‚Äôt found super helpful. (they also never really explained it much to me & most of what i know has come from my own research) i‚Äôve tried different grounding techniques & obviously there‚Äôs no magic fix but i just don‚Äôt have any sort of plan or coping mechanisms in place & the anxiety that comes from the fear of having an episode is awful.

Dissociative seizures?,15,k7qig1,5,"I developed PTSD as a child through severe abuse. I wasn't able to get help for it until I was 19 due to people covering the majority abuse and not being allowed to talk about the bad stuff. I had a severe mental breakdown while at college. I forced to talk to a new therapist in the middle of the night by the police. I explained everything and they started getting me the help I needed. The therapist told me that based on my symptoms, I started dissociating as a young teen as well as hallucinations while I displayed classic childhood trauma symptoms which has been reconfirmed by 5 different therapist/psychologists. My full diagnosis is Dissociative PTSD (Depersonilzation and Derealization) with trauma based hallucinations, GAD and major depression. I have been through... A lot. I talk about it a lot in my post/comment history if you want details, but I don't feel like getting fully into it at this moment.

Anyways.

When I was 17, I started having these really weird symptoms. It started as just a normal dissociative attack... But my brain got super fuzzy and numb. Like, the tingling you get when your leg falls asleep but on my brain. My eyes wouldn't focus and I began stuttering. I... Just couldn't speak. Nothing past a single syllable. I got a neurologist but nothing came of it. Yet, my symptoms grew worse. 

I start off dissociating, just the typical, ""I don't recognize myself. Nothing looks real. Are these my hands."" My brain goes numb and tingly as do my fingers. My eyes won't focus. I start stuttering. My body starts getting heavier and heavier and I lose the ability to speak all together. I go into a stupor. I finally can't keep my body up anymore and I collapse. My body stiffens. I hyperventilate. I'm unable to move but my body is stiff. Other people can move me, but I can't. I go back and forth between hyperventilating and just constantly taking in air until I just gasp for air, choking. I start shaking while I just stare into space. 

It lasts... I don't know how long. But, I snap out of it when the fog is lifted off my brain. I still can't move or speak but I slowly I am able to move. Once I'm back up and I can talk, I go into a manic phase. I get super hungry and I end up acting very childish... Like... One day I started screaming and crying and throwing a fit because my sister wouldn't hand me my food... When... Normally, I wouldn't care. My brain is still fuzzy, just not like before. It wont go away until I sleep, which I'll sleep for 12+ hours.

I've spent 5 years trying to figure out why these happen. When I was in college, they would go from 1-2 a week to 3-4 times a day, 6 days a week. I ended up at the hospital so many times. I've had a lot of physical tests done and nothing came up.

This year, I came across dissociative seizures and I thought it made sense. I'm in the process of getting back into therapy... But I wanted to know, does it sound like dissociative seizures? Or something else? Does anyone else get something like this?

EDIT: I forgot to mention. In the past, very rarely, I have also would completely forget moment in time. I would just remember lifting my head up, not collapsing, just lifting my head. Then, a span of time would be gone... Normally a couple of minutes to a few hours, sometimes days. Its happened during conversations which is highly upsetting. Yet, there was once in college where I completely forgotten who I was and where I was. I was eating a candy bar and i lifted up my head. I had no idea where I was. Then I realized I didn't know who I was. I started panicking and looking around. Luckily I had my student badge on the table. I read my name over and over and studied my photo until everything clicked. I now carry my ID around my neck everywhere I go."
Has anyone dissociated for anything longer than a few days?,15,k3q038,17,"&#x200B;

My ex-partner *accidentally* drugged me and this caused me to have dissociative seizures, where I faded in and out of consciousness. tw- >!he then took advantage of me.!<

That was in march, and I'm coming on 8 months now where I've been continuously dissociating, specifically experiencing derealization. I have a therapist but I ditched him because he never talked about my dissociation when I did, and I have a new appointment on december 3. 

I've been in multiple car accidents (5/6 were with inanimate objects and 1/6 was with a guy who hit me on purpose), had 2 suicide attempts and been in and out of the hospital for some physical abuse. I'm saying this because it has severely impacted my dissociation and, I think, prolonged it.

I experience derealization due to a prolonged freeze + flop response that I've been doing since I was 10 years old. I just don't know why its gone on for this long.

 I've been doing research, after not doing so for months (I thought thinking about it more would make it worse but I've since then started DBT), and I've only read personal stories of people saying they've dissociated for at most, 4 months. 

**tldr; Most people seem to dissociate for days even? I'd like to know how much of an outlier my experience is so let me what your longest episode has been.**"

Losing time,14,evyl4u,4,"Alright, so I left the house this morning and remember driving for like ten minutes and then I was home and it was like 3 hours later. I went to at least four different places and evidently did everything I had gone out to do and then some based on the receipts and so forth, but it's,, gone. It's not like this type of thing is new to me, it happens quite a bit, but it's usually like I'm at home and presumably sitting in one spot for 4 hours with no knowledge that time has passed rather than like, getting a bunch of things done and driving and so forth with no memory of having done it? I assume this happens to other people but is there like, a word for this, like, doing things that *you* didn't do? I'm kind of at a loss right now"
I think I've been dissociating for basically my whole life :(,15,errvbg,9,"I just found this subreddit and wanted to bounce my experiences off other people since it sounds like dissociation kind of explains what I've been feeling all of my life.

The reason I came here is because a few weeks ago I snapped out of it for the first time in years.  It literally felt like I was waking up.  I can remember having that happen a handful of times before, but I've always kind of brushed it off as just an abnormal thing.

The reason is that I've felt things I could now describe as dissociation for as long as I can remember (I don't really remember much of my childhood though).  Since middle school and even now people have thought that I was a stoner even though I've never smoked.  I know that I have some weirdly long delay in my actions that I don't realize.  Other people have commented on it, though and generally noted that I'm always lost in thought.  I'm also monotone even though I don't intend it.  I also don't really have dreams.

Comparing what I felt like when I ""woke up"" to the rest of my life, I think the most significant symptoms are tunnel vision ( I don't know if I'd describe it as blurry, but maybe a little hazy too).  My sense of touch is really different (probably the most significant part).  Like maybe it feels like I'm numb all over.  The other part that I've associated with is people describing that it feels like the center of their person is located between their eyes.  When I ""woke up"" it felt like I was more in my chest if that makes sense.  I've always thought that this was just the way I am (or that I was high functioning autistic).

Now it's been a week or so since the time I snapped out of it and I've sort of been in and out of dissociation.  The trouble is that it feels safe.  Like, that's all that I'm familiar with and it feels kind of wrong to do anything else.  I guess part of the reason I want to change is I think this is a big factor in why I've had trouble with relationships (friends or otherwise).  I've been trying out this 54321 grounding exercise which does help sometimes, but other times I just keep on dissociating.

One other interesting thing is that for the first time in forever I'm having memories of my childhood.  Outside of a handful of memories I've never really remembered anything from before high school. When I'm actually grounded I'll just be walking around now and see something and get reminded of something from when I was younger.  That never used to happen.

I'm interested if anyone has had an experience like this and actually ""got better"" from it or has suggestions.  I'm kind of scared that I'm just going to go back to my ways and spend the rest of my life dissociating.

I'm also interested in learning about how I got this way, because I know that dissociation is usually associated w/ trauma and I've been like this since I was a young kid.  I know that I suddenly started having panic attacks around when I was eight to the point that I had to change schools and ended up being sent to a therapist.  I also started bed wetting and acting kind of sexually with my friends.  Around that time I have a memory of showering and scrubbing my chest until it burnt because I felt dirty, but I forget what prompted it.  Later on in high school a friend and I (both guys, I'm gay) tried hooking up, but I remember that as soon as I saw him naked I froze up and literally could not move.  I know that all of these things kind of point towards abuse, but I really don't remember any ""incident"".  I'm kind of concerned even if I do remember something because I know false memory syndrome is very real.  I guess I'm sharing this in hopes that someone else has had an experience like this and can talk to me about it."
Acceptance?,14,eldbeu,1,If something so bad happened to the point that I  completely blocked out my childhood then do I really want to go searching for it? I‚Äôm glad I forgot it. If my survival mechanism tells me to dissociate then why argue‚Ä¶I‚Äôm ok with that. Is there a downside to this way of thinking?
I‚Äôm so tired of dissociating,15,ehfmri,2,"I have days where I dissociate a LOT more than usual (today is one of those) and I fucking hate it. For me it feels like a mix of vertigo and an out of body experience, and with my vision getting SUPER blurry. I hate it because I can‚Äôt do anything while I dissociate and it makes me less productive in everything and I just sit there like an idiot. I try to do stuff to snap myself out of it but it never works and I always seem to forget that grounding techniques exist. Dissociating always gives me a headache afterwards and that makes me even more useless. (It feels so much like vertigo to me and I just end up laughing slowly to myself bc I get dizzy lol) Any tips?"
Best treatment?,16,ebgm2l,3,"Hello! I've been dissociating pretty consistently for about 11 years at this point. There was a short period of time (maybe a couple months) where I was pretty present and clear, but other than that it's been very consistent. 

I've had a lot of therapists and have tried a little emdr and dbt along the way. I've never really stuck with anything, but I currently have a therapist who is pretty helpful in general.

I guess I'm just wondering what types of things have helped other people who suffer long-term? I can google dissociation treatments a million times, but I think it would probably be more helpful to hear first-hand experiences so I can get a better idea of what I might want to look into. 

So please feel free to leave a lengthy comment or pm me about your experiences. Where you're currently at with treatment, things that haven't worked for you, weird/uncommon things that have helped you cope, etc. Thanks in advance! Trying not to feel totally hopeless about perceiving life as a dream, so I figured I'd post here! Lol."
Does dissociation influence how you view your gender?,15,eaxxi3,1,"This is something I've been thinking about recently, and I don't really have any other community to discuss it with, so I think this is the best place to do it. It might be a bit of a ramble, these are just the things I've been thinking about lately. 

For the longest time I haven't really felt a sense of gender. I've tried on a few different labels, like agender and demigirl, but none of them really seemed to fit me. Currently I feel like my thoughts and feelings on my gender most closely align with graygender, which is defined as when ""a person identifies as (at least partially) outside the gender binary and has a strong natural ambivalence about their gender identity or gender expression."" Basically that means you have a sense that there's some form of gender there, but you don't really have a strong attachment to it at all. 

For me I've always felt like there was some feeling, some tiny little thing there of femininity, androgyny, agender, and a little bit of masculine. But I could never really form an attachment to it, pronouns were never a big deal to me, even though my body is a very feminine body I just never quite clicked with it.... but I never clicked with a masculine or androgynous form of myself either. I wouldn't transition or anything because I just wouldn't have an attachment to any way I looked, so I don't see a point in changing what I have anyway. 

But lately I've been doing some more thinking about my gender, and how I feel towards it. I think that my dissociation really does play a role in it, but I don't think it's a bad thing. I don't think the way I see my gender is bad in any form. Lately I've been redefining my gender just a little bit. I don't feel like a girl, I don't feel like a boy, I don't feel like I'm agender. Agender is genderless, but for something to be genderless, gender had to exist there in the first place. I don't even believe in the existence of gender for myself, I'm way beyond genderless. There was never anything there from the very start, there's no gaps, there's no concept of gender of any sorts ever having existed at all in me. 

Now I'm going to say something that's pretty controversial, so I just want people to hear me out first. Because of this recent realization, that I am beyond genderless, I have started to want to try on it/its/itself pronouns for myself. Now, I feel like I should address some things because I know this topic is always an angry debate waiting to happen. 
For starters, when I think of myself and who I am, my body is not in the question at all. I feel like a soul, an existence, an experience, an awareness, that's trapped inside a prison. I don't view a shapeless polymorphic form of existence, or at least my existence, as being something that has gender. So where as they/them still rely on the binary to be the lack of a binary, it/its doesn't need the binary in any shape or form to exist as a gender neutral pronoun. 
Second, I don't think dissociation necessarily leads to a damaging and negative way of using it/its as a pronoun. This is because, since I don't associate myself with my body and I feel like a genderless experience, if people were to use it/its with me I'd feel like they were addressing me, who I see myself as, and not my body. For a very long time I've had issues with people seeing my body first and not understanding how I truly view myself, so it/its is actually validating in that way. 
Thirdly, I want to address the dehumanizing aspect of it. Dehumanizing isn't always a bad thing. It can be used as a bad thing, when someone is using it to treat someone as less of a person and undeserving of equal rights. But regardless, it isn't the only pronoun that has been abused in this way. Many trans women have been referred to as ""he"" and vise versa, but we don't see ""he"" and ""she"" as inappropriate pronouns to continue using. As well, there's a less negative side to the coin of dehumanizing. To assume to dehumanize is a bad thing is to assume that being non human or feeling like you are non human is a bad thing. Because I feel so disconnected from my body and the world/people around me, I don't exactly feel like a human. This isn't a bad thing, I'm perfectly happy not associating myself with the human identity as people who may not experience dissociation in the way I do are happy to associate with a human identity. It's not really a bad thing, just a different thing. 
Furthermore, many amazing things are typically referred to as an ""it."" Animals like whales and bears, cosmic phenomena like the sun, stars, and the universe, and earthly things such as rivers, trees, and clouds, are all typically an ""it."" But this stuff is all amazing and powerful. Humans use the terms he/she/they to separate themselves from everything else. I don't personally believe in this separation, and the pronouns it/its makes me feel more unionized with all of these fantastic things around me. 
Lastly, I don't think ""it"" should be used for anyone other than someone who chooses to use the pronoun. It's dehumanizing, in the negative way. But I do believe that if someone wants to be referred to as ""it"" then you should try your best and respect that and address the person as ""it."" Everyone just wants to have their pronouns respected, and just as someone who's trans will have issues being referred to by their assigned-at-birth pronouns, someone who wants to be referred to as ""it"" may have issues with it as well. I understand that many people have a problem with addressing someone as an ""it"" but if you talk to the person, understand its reasoning, and try then it will become less strange over time. As well, I know it can bring back bad memories for someone. But just as it may bring back bad memories, any other pronoun can as well. This person who chooses to use it as it's pronoun has probably done a lot of inner reflection and soul searching, you don't just make a decision like this over night. I've found myself actually reacting to it, when I hardly would even recognize any other pronoun. Furthermore, I think many, if not most people who choose it as it's pronoun will also have alternative pronouns people can use if they're just too uncomfortable using it. 

These are just some of my thoughts I wanted to get out."
"Everything feels very dark and twisted, like reality shifts to a very dim light. Is that dissociation?",15,e7jqoa,3,I know I have SOME dissociative stuff but my therapist thinks there's probably more than I realize. So just a bit ago I noticed things shift. I still felt present tho and my mind wasn't blank (idk if that has to be part of dissociation?) I just felt a little wonky and present in like.. a different reality?
Am I okay?,14,dgplqk,3,"When I get my period, I always feel detached from everything around me, and I forget where I am.

I‚Äôve noticed myself doing this a lot, right around my period. I don‚Äôt know if that has something to do with it but it is really weird. Any thoughts?"
Floating by,15,deip4j,1,"Hey I'm new here just joined because I can relate to some of the posts here and have had something weird happening for years which seems like dissociation. (Not diagnosed) lately it's been happening whenever I take walks, I feel out of it like I'm just watching someone else walk for me and I'm just floating with a body I'm attached to. Or sometimes it happens in the middle of a conversation and I just stop talking and space out for a couple seconds, usually looking at a limb like my arm and finding it amazing like ""Oh woah my arm exists"" or something. It also happens more if I'm stressed out. Does anyone know what this is specifically?"
unable to relate to memories or past self/selves.,15,ddoz4j,2,"forgive me if i'm poorly expressing myself, because it's hard for me to put into words. but i wanted to get this out.

i don't think i experience anything like DID (I don't have different alters and CPTSD feels more accurate), but i don't really relate to myself at different periods of my life, all who feel like different people. some seem more unrelatable than others. at various times, i have (thought that i) wanted things that i ended up not wanting and actively hating. i've felt things that feel alien to me now, for example in terms of sexual identity or gender identity that i don't relate to. i can't put myself in the same headspace.

the thing is, it really bothers me. i do remember those times, and i'm incredibly ashamed of them and i can't even talk about them to anyone else. i just want to pretend that those times when i felt like someone else... didn't happen. but i know they did. and i guess i am somewhat angry, too, because i never really developed a sense of self or the boundaries to pursue securely who i wanted to be and how i wanted to define myself because of always being treated terribly and having anything i thought i was or wanted to explore invalidated or ridiculed. i guess it's ironic that i feel the shame and self-hatred for things i actually *did* explore, trying to figure out who i was. maybe because i didn't get to do it to smaller extents when i was younger and i started later when i was supposed to already know that. maybe because the trauma itself made me confused about what i actually wanted and alienated me from myself in the first place. i guess it doesn't help that those times i don't relate to were often traumatic also.

but it's left me with this incredibly fragmented chain of lost years instead of a life story. i feel envious of my friends who can look back on their life as a continuous experience, and a fond one. i remember events, but it feels also like i was just born recently even though i am in my 30s. who ""I"" am is this new thing. it makes me just avoid talking about any events in my life because it's incredibly uncomfortable to talk about someone who had a different gender identity or sexual identity than you that is supposed to be you but you can't identify with. and it makes me distrustful now of anything i want and even more distrustful of who i am even though i think now i'm more content with that and closer to who i truly am than ever. it makes me scared that if anyone gets close to me i'm going to have to tell them about times i don't relate to and that they'll think i'm crazy for pursuing things that i didn't actually want. i don't feel like a full person because i can't even just talk about my life like normal people... which is, i guess, something i'm probably not alone in here."
dissociation at work... help!!,14,d49ddy,4,"EDIT: I was fine!! I kept mentally repeating that I was in the here and now, and I was ok! I didn't let myself think about it at all, and everything was okay :)

I work at an escape room, so naturally, there's a lot of stimulation and lots of things going on. It doesn't normally bother me too much - my social anxiety has really improved since I started working here - but dissociation is a problem... Again. 

I thought it went away. I've been healthier than I have been in 7 or 8 years. I feel like I've finally closed the book on depression, anxiety, self harm, C-PTSD, suicidal ideation, and dissociation, which I felt like I'd never get out of. 

I started at community college and it's going well, but my depression tends to be worse in the winter, so I can kind of feel it creeping back in. That emotional instability is what causes my dissociation to happen often. So I was surprised when I had a HUGE dissociative episode. I was giving rules to some guests and I suddenly just didn't feel real. I sort of got tunnel vision, and everything seemed either too bright or too dark - like the contrast had been turned up or something. I got dizzy and was more out of it than I've been in awhile. I couldn't feel my feet on the ground. It was so bad to the point where I had to tell them ""I'm not feeling well"" and had my coworker finish giving rules. I sat in the office for 15 minutes and tried to ground myself. It didn't work, and I started crying. I went to the bathroom and just sobbed as quietly as I could for another 10 minutes. 

I'm not really sure why. Around this time last year was the last time I saw my dad alive. He went missing and the police found him two months later; he'd killed himself. So I'm sure that's a big part of me just not being stable right now, hence the crying. I wasn't entirely sure why I was crying - I was anxious and stressed about the dissociation, but I only cry like that when I'm missing my dad and it's 3 am or I'm home alone. I think I was just overwhelmed - I don't really know. 

So now I'm worried about the same thing happening next time I give rules. The fact that it happened at work makes me even more worried; I'm terrified it'll happen again, and I'm trying not to worry about it because that just makes it more likely, but it's hard. I feel like I'm expecting it. And I can't just get dissociated at work all the time and have a total breakdown so I don't help with running rooms. I need to do my job, and I also need to not get dissociated in the first place - I feel like I've tried everything to prevent or lessen it. Nothing helps. 

What do I do??

TL;DR: I had an extreme dissociation attack yesterday at work and had a bit of an emotional breakdown, and I'm worried it'll happen again today because I'm almost expecting it and that just makes it more likely."
i dont know who i am,15,czpu9n,5,"i really really really need an answer. i dont know who i am. i dont know if im having an identity crisis or if a new alter is co fronting or if im just really badly dissociating but i really have no idea who i am. the name that i have (i dont want to say ""my name"" because it doesnt feel like my name!!) fits loosely around me. it doesnt feel like my name. its not my birth name though so i dont know if i just havent chosen the right name or if im dissociating. does anyone feel connected to their name? or is there always a bit of uncertainty... when someone says your name does it feel like you and only you or does it feel like just a name? ive felt different and people have commented on me acting different so i dont know if im me or not and i just need some help figuring out if its dissociation or an identity crisis or whatever. id ont feel like i have an identity and its making me panic"

Is it even possible to recover?,14,ckaqo3,8,"Any stories or just some hope about recovering from dissociative disorder?

Dunno, I just feel like I'm losing hope with this. My sense of time has really gotten worse within a year, I feel so disconnected from the world around me even though things are going so much better in my life. I've people who care about me and love me, I'm getting my own apartment in a few months and then a dog! But still, I can't feel connected to the 'real' world, I can't understand time well and all. Also my therapist is changing now after six? years. 

Anyways, I'm just looking for some peer support. Would also be great to read how other people are managing."
I realized I can‚Äôt be friends with my bff anymore and I feel spaced out,16,cg8c2v,4,"I realized she‚Äôs passive aggressive. Idk why I couldn‚Äôt see it before.

Dissociation and tattoos,15,cfi6sy,6,Sometimes I forget about some of my tattoos (because they‚Äôre in spots that I can‚Äôt see all of the time). It‚Äôs always a super weird feeling to look at one of my tattoos and still not believe it‚Äôs actually there. Even ones that I‚Äôve had for years.. even while looking at the tattoo it feels like it‚Äôs not my body sometimes. Does anyone else have this feeling?
Dissociation and social anxiety,16,cdtti8,0,"Recently had a realization that PTSD has cause mild/severe social anxiety for me this past year. Last summer I was met with some disturbing truths about my childhood. All these repressed memories came rushing back to me (of course senior year of highschool) I was already depressed because I was in a toxic/manipulative relationship and then got hit with memories about the molestations from my sisters soon to be husband that year. (They also had a child together).  She decided to side with him and it ripped my heart out because we were so incredibly close and she had practically raised me. But not even all that.. to make matters worse I started to dissociate in class with all these popular girls who I thought could clearly see me dissociating and having anxiety/ hyper arousal. I started to develop depersonalization and lost myself completely and that‚Äôs when I started to have social anxiety. Now going into college the first two weeks I pumped myself up and told myself I could do it but my social anxiety, depression and dissociation got the best of me so I started online classes. This year I plan to go back to campus and I‚Äôm sooooo scared. When I‚Äôm in a classroom I have hyper arousal so I‚Äôm constantly alert looking around/ at other people and then when my body can‚Äôt handle the overwhelming anxiety I dissociate. Only that makes it worse because I‚Äôm in my head not listening or concentrating on work but rather what other people are thinking and if they can see my dissociating and not looking at anything. It‚Äôs so frustrating. Some days I think it‚Äôs better I was never born so I didn‚Äôt have to be in this dreamstate my whole life... and with anxiety. Sorry I‚Äôm ranting..."
Different Types of Dissociation,16,cdqp4d,3,"I so love that this group exists. I get dissociation primarily as a symptom of cPTSD, but one doc gave me a separate dissociative disorder. 

Anyway. Do you experience different types of dissociation? Not just levels like spacing out vs losing time, but like...sometimes it‚Äôs more physical, others more mental. Minutes to hours. I can get the perceptual distortions (like the Alice in Wonderland feeling), or just feel like my head is too light, like a balloon. Sometimes it feels like SSRI Discontinuation. 

I‚Äôm in therapy for the trauma and we address skills and tools often, but oh, it‚Äôs amazing to find that a group exists with people who‚Äôve felt it."
I (26F) believe I dissociated experiences of abuse as a child,14,c76hr0,8,"   I've been thinking a lot about some events that took place as a child. I've determined, with a lot of evidence behind it, that I was sexually abused by a relative (possibly more than once). I had severe social anxiety growing up and I have severe depression. 
   I want to gain these memories (if any) back so I can know for sure. The constant wondering is bothering me alot.  I'm seriously considering doing hypnotherapy. 
   Has anyone had experiences similar and found hypnotherapy helpful?"
talked to my therapist about my dissociation,14,bw1mzy,1,"brought it up for the first time to her and she told me about the DES-II scale, so she made me do it. next time i go in, she‚Äôs going to score it and then we can go from there, she told i could possibly get a diagnosis of something. she also told me i could look the test up, i did and found another DES-II scale that‚Äôs similar. took it and my score was 58... it said that if the score is over 30, there‚Äôs a higher chance of having DID or DPDR.

now i‚Äôm patiently waiting for wednesday (next session). i‚Äôm kind of scared to talk more about it but also i‚Äôm relieved to be able to talk about what‚Äôs going on with me at the same time. 

last session i had with my therapist, we talked about the causes of dissociation and she asked me what i think might be causing it. i said my anxiety. then she asked me if i ever think about trauma and wonder if that could be the cause of it. now, i have never talked to her about traumatic events that i‚Äôve been through. to be honest, i really never think that i have trauma because i‚Äôve convinced myself that the things i‚Äôve been through aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbad enough‚Äù to be trauma. i‚Äôve been though physical abuse, emotional abuse and verbal abuse. i‚Äôm still going through emotional abuse and verbal abuse.

she doesn‚Äôt know about the abuse and i guess i‚Äôm going to have to tell her about it to get more behind the dissociation. i‚Äôm terrified. i‚Äôve never told anyone that i personally know about the abuse before.

when she asked me about trauma, it got me thinking some more. what if there‚Äôs other traumatic things i‚Äôve been though that i have repressed? late last year, i rediscovered that i was *very* close to getting kidnapped when i was 7, i‚Äôm 15 now and i‚Äôve repressed it all these years. it‚Äôs pretty weird to think about how i repressed that... i was on vacation when i almost got kidnapped, and for all of these years, i never once thought about the bad part of that vacation until last year. the rest of the vacation was pretty clear in my mind too. 

everything is very weird for me right now."
paranoia,14,bktknh,2,"does anyone else feel extremely aware that they‚Äôre dissociating but are also cognitively aware of their surroundings all the time? almost like you‚Äôre guilty of something and you can‚Äôt stop it? i just started working at this place not too long ago and i‚Äôm always walking around with a blank staring face but it seems that i can‚Äôt ever salvage myself or figure out a way to get rid of it, people occasionally try to get through to me but it doesn‚Äôt work and i can tell they‚Äôre frustrated which makes it worse. i know i shouldn‚Äôt care about that stuff but it‚Äôs like i just don‚Äôt know who i am anymore"
Nostalgia triggered something and I 'woke up' as a child,15,9t6zgi,5,"I've always sort of known I dissociate but I've never had something quite as scary as this happen.

I started watching a ton of YouTube videos at night about old cartoons I used to watch and the nostalgia hit me hard. It wasn't uncomfortable when I was watching it, in fact it was relaxing. I felt like I missed those days, but other than that I kind of felt like I was finally at home again.

Then the next morning I woke up feeling... Different. Usually, I'm anxious and daydreaming constantly. I'd rather feel anxious than depressed (I've been diagnosed with both but anxiety usually sort of cancels out the depression). When I woke up, it was like when I first started feeling depressed when I was a kid. Which is weird that I remembered that transition and that feeling because usually I can't remember anything!

I kept feeling strange and sad and I felt like my eyes were more open than usual. Everything was in focus and clear but I was so SAD and confused as to why life was the way it was. When did I get a job? HOW did I get a job? Where was my dad and why wasn't anyone taking me to work instead of letting me ride the bus alone in the dark? I'm shy, how was I going to survive alone at work? (Despite me being fine since I got the job. This was the first time I felt like I COULDN'T do it.)

I scrolled through my music and it all looked foreign. I came across, I kid you not, a high school musical song and i pressed play and it all made sense. 

It was like I'd woken up from a nap I'd started in 2010 and dissociated me had been living this whole time. That me had gotten me a job, gotten me to work, changed my hair, and generally taken care of me (and my childish mom) for years. 

2010 me was very upset that they hadn't been tended to when they needed it.

I felt like it wasn't fair, when I realized what was happening. Like I finally woke up, but that time had passed and my opportunity to be a kid was gone and it wasn't right. 

It was scary. Not only was I 'stuck' as a lost kid, but I was also terrified that I'd never be able to dissociate again. I missed the fog.

The feeling finally went away and I got back into my usual daze, I could literally feel the 'transition'. It was like i was unable to focus and I was even more confused until eventually I couldn't remember how to feel those emotions that younger me was feeling and I almost couldn't even remember that it had happened. I felt tired and hungry and dissociated me went about finishing work and feeding me and getting me to sleep.

Also the sense of 'me' was gone. I forgot again what it meant to be me and I was back to feeling like an empty shell of a human that has no personality or traits or anything that matters.

Has anyone else had anything similar happen?"

Harming myself?,14,mik4g4,3,"The more i look into dissociating the more i feel lost, is me obsessing over dissociating causing me to dissociate more and can it be harmful long term"
Disassociation?,14,m02qan,2,"I have been having a very difficult time the past few months, i would rather not go into specifics because its not just one thing, its a lot, but there was a moment when i was at a cafe and it all got so much, like it was the most excruciatingly horrible and painful mind state ive ever felt, i put my head down between my arms, then when i lifted my head, i felt nothing at all, not one thing, good nor bad, nothing whatsoever, i was still aware of all that was happening, i just felt immense tranquility, or maybe it was that to feel nothing compared to what i did feel like was perceived as such. 

Either way i just dont know, ive not been diagnosed with anything, ive never spoken about my mental health to a doctor or whatnot, and it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault, i just dealt with things wrong and they piled up too high against me to cause me to be pushed to that point where whatever happened, happened. 

I believe its something i phase in and out of, there are moments that slice right through it and i feel truly bs and full of despair, but i can also have a lot of fun and look forward to things as usual, its just that every so often when things look bad, it kicks in, almost like its like my mind tying to protect me or something, who knows.

It is so severe that i have heard my friend speak about his suicide attempt and felt nothing, the first instance happened before he did so, and ive felt it many times throughout the past few months. It‚Äôs something i feel stupidly grateful for, even if thats really bad, atleast it gives me some time to recover my will and when it wears off or whatever i feel ready to take on things until it gets too much again. 

Sorry for rambling so much but i just wondered what someone may have thought, i also apologies if its all offer the place, my thoughts are kind of scattered at the moment. 

Have a nice rest of the day."
"I feel like I can't focus, and I'm withdrawn into my mind? Is it dissociation?",15,lz1i3u,0,"Not sure if this is where tonpost this, tried adhd and they pointed me here,

In the last 2 years it feels like I've lost my ability to focus on something, I feel like I'm just mindlessly going through life, almost like I'm zoned out 24/7. I try to physically focus my eyes on something and I can't. Is it dissociation? I feel like I can still function fine, drive, work, etc. I also have some memory problems, I can't remember at all what I did at work yesterday. The biggest thing it affects that I've noticed, is playing the piano. I use to play a lot, almost went to college, but took a 2 year gap and I'm trying to re-learn it, but I can't get myself to focus on the music anymore no matter how much I try.

Is there any focusing excercises that I can do to help this?

Thanks, if this isn't the right place to post this just let me know"
Dissociation can be a miracle,14,ltnyk1,2,"I was freaking tf out a minute ago about to post in r/suicidewatch but then I forgot whatever I was worried about and now I‚Äôm a blank slate again. I may be almost brain dead all the time but at least not in a crisis constantly like I used to be like a year ago. Even when I try to resist it, it just erases more memory, like a safety system meant to keep me from stressing myself mentally. I guess that‚Äôs what it is, a coping skill. Probably not a good one but I no longer want to die now sooo üòÉüò≥"
How do I stop feeling like a thought process of the brain and start feeling like a human again?,14,loja6c,4,"Quarantine has destroyed me mentally and I'm an anxious, depressed, and paranoid individual. Over the last several months I've been feeling more and more disconnected to the point where I feel like just a thing in my brain. A metaphor: My brain and all its processes and thoughts are a ship, and I am just the wind observing and guiding the ship in directions across an infinite ocean. The ocean is reality. I feel like I'm an observer pushing my mental processes in directions instead of being a human. I feel like I'm observing this crazily complex replicating biological machine controlled by a brain. 

I also don't recognize myself in the mirror or who I am. I really feel like an amalgamation of a constant stream of thoughts trimmed up for what's important. I feel like a creation my brain created. My arms feel like tentacle-like appendages protruding from me to grab at things and shove them into my mouth be chewed up. I feel like an animal in a world where lifeforms consume other lifeforms. Everything replicates just to die or be destroyed either by itself or by another replication machine in this ruthless and hopelessly anarchic reality. 

I listen to music and feel like I'm not hearing music, I feel like I'm perceiving stimulus in my brain that my brain makes sense of and gathers it all up and creates the stream of consciousness. Me.

In short, I don't connect with myself. I am just a bundle of thoughts and processes my brain deems most important to my survival.

 How do I start feeling like a human and not a crazy weird pattern recognition machine controlling a body with the sole purpose of surviving?"
I had a huge insight this week,14,ll0p7w,1,"So first off, I‚Äôve never made a post on reddit before (!!!) so I hope I do this right? 
But it‚Äôs about 3 am where I live right now and I‚Äôm coming off of about 6 ish months of a combination of mania, depression and dissociation. Like really hard dissociation, sometimes my vision even gets really blurry. I‚Äôve been in therapy for over ten years, working through some really hard grief, emotional neglect, chronic depression and (although I didn‚Äôt know till I spent 6 weeks living alone during quarantine) dissociation issues. I finally found some tools to help get out of that, earlier this summer, before I went home to where pretty much all of my trauma happened. (I moved like 3000 miles away from my hometown, but visit sometimes cause my nieces are SO CUTE). I finally had enough mental energy, reconnection with my support network and time to take those recovery/grounding steps this week and I just woke up to a flood of some really, really amazing positive memories I forgot about (classic memory loss, smh). 
Im really grateful for all the posts on this sub cause they give me hope and insight and laughs and good vibes even when it‚Äôs hard. I know I‚Äôll probably dissociate in the future, cause I can‚Äôt control what triggers me but I also know I‚Äôm glad I can go to places like this, to my fave music, to some key people in my life (finally) to find the way out.
Keep going, I‚Äôm thinking good things for you, there are ways to get through it and get out."
There ain't room for the two of us here- New voices in my head,14,li2ox5,22,"I was just wondering if I can find anyone with a similar experience who has been going through this longer to get some pointers... I have (so far) 7 different voices in my head that are related to me in some sort of way (they don't necessarily look like me either, and there is one male when i am female).

I was in bed one morning last week and all of a sudden this voice says ""Hi, can I come out? I don't want to scare you"" and like out struts this teenage girl in my head. She told me she hasn't came out sooner because she knew she would scare me pantless (which is true). Later that day another person appeared and another one that night. The next day two more came out. The next day one more came out. two days later a man appeared. 4 of the 7 have names. 3 of the 7 are nonverbal. 6 female, 1 male. Varying ages from 4ish to 40ish.

I don't hear them audibly- they are definitely just in my head and talk in my thoughts. In this week I have realized 4 are different versions of me (2 past, 1 current/recent past, 1 current/future), 1 represents anger, and two are unknown and make me feel frightened/uncomfortable. They are largely positive, my therapist and I are incredibly grateful.

Naturally of course I freak out and reached out to my therapist and psychiatrist and then hoarded myself away all weekend because I had no clue what was happening. But now, I am coming to terms with it moreso and generally like the ones that are strong and talking. We have a good time together.

Do you guys have any tips on handling these guys? so far they aren't making me do anything, i just feel very strongly (one threw a fit when the psychiatrist prescribed a medicine to make them ""go away"", that was our first fight). What are some terms that you refer to them as? I don't like calling them ""parts"" or ""people"" or ""alters"". Related, do you have a term that you call all of you together? I've heard ""system"" but don't like that either. Have you told anyone? How have they reacted?

Thanks, I promise I'm not crazy. This is how I'm coping apparently from a recent trauma."
"Physical inability to speak at times, body not responding to input",13,lej5l1,6,"Sometimes I'll really want to say something but my body just.. won't respond. I can say something else but if I try to return to vocalizing the given thought my body just won't respond. Same thing happens while texting, it's like I physically freeze up and can't press the send button no matter how much I want to. It's generally around more emotionally sensitive things or in regards to making certain decisions, it feels frustrating when the moment passes and I end up not being able to say what I wanted to. 

Does anyone else get this and know how to deal with it or communicate effectively when it happens? I should note that there's no internal debate happening over whether I should say/send something or uncertainty of if I should say it, I'll 100% want to but feel a complete lack of control over myself"
Does anyone experience this?,14,kdamnq,6,"I know it‚Äôs common when people are falling asleep but trying to stay awake that they feel like they‚Äôre actually ‚Äúfalling‚Äù and then bolt upright/awake.

My vision seems to rotate and I often feel dizzy, stumble from a standing position, and get intense vertigo. I don‚Äôt think this stems from hunger, tiredness or anything else other than the general mental illnesses that I have.
Does anyone else understand this or know what I‚Äôm talking about? Is it a form of dissociation, and if not what is it called?"
"Would ""They"" Ever Understand the Frags?",14,kaaqlt,0,"There are *several* riders on this bus. 

One is forever in his abusers' clutches screaming to no useful purpose. But he never gives up hope. 

One -- a little older -- has imaginary friends and all manner of elaborate scenarios about them. 

One is forever wary and vigilant, believing his *extensively* educated ""radar"" is his only real means of survival. 

One can explain it all. But who else (other than some $200-an-hour professional listener) could possibly understand? 

And one sits out in the audience watching the others on the screen, fully aware of his inability to help the first four out of their mutually mystified straight jackets.

The explainer is the topic for today. He seems to have been [conditioned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fixing-psychology/201402/explaining-behaviorism-operant-classical-conditioning), in-doctrine-ated, in[struct](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+construction+of+reality+sociology&oq=social+construction+of+reality&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0l4.7012j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)ed, [imprinted](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_3784), [socialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), habituated, and [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology)) to believe that ""if they could just understand why 'I' am fragged, they'd let 'me' off the hook for all the crazy s--t the others say and do. 

But, of course, the explainer ""knows"" better: ""The 'corrective relationship' with *another* is as pie in the sky as reincarnation and 'another chance to get it all right.'"" And wonders if the corrective relationship really *is* ultimately an ""inside job.""

If it weren't for the guy in the balcony, the explainer would chew *eternally* on his mental toenails... terrified of what all the surrogate parents and bullies and potential lovers will think when they start to ""wonder."" The guy with the popcorn *knows* it's all just a movie that ends at some point. After which the others in the theater get up and leave, never having spoken to -- or heard -- each other. *Ever*.

Wouldn't it be great if the ""detached understanding, empathy and compassion"" the popcorn muncher has for *others* was enough to give *them* room enough to let go of their terror, their protectors, and their addiction to being comprehended by someone who really mattered. They *do* chill out when they know they're seen, heard, felt and *sensed* that way. But the shadows are still out there waiting for their cues. 

Mr. Popcorn calls those moments ""flashbacks."" The others call them ""intolerably frightening,"" ""unmanageably embarrassing,"" ""extremely tiring,"" and ""invariably disappointing"" (respectively). 

Life *is* far better than it used to be when the man in the audience didn't yet exist. The body has not attempted suicide again in 18 years. The fear, the embarrassment, the fatigue, and the sorrow are all manageable now. The feelings and sensations are just there to be *felt* One More Time before the clouds break and the weather clears again.

*""The feeling is always temporary.""*

Life on life's terms."
nausea?,15,k4vzsp,1,does anyone else get like random nausea from just dissociation? my dissociation makes things blurry kind of and everything like a memory so it might be a motion thing.
Questioning what happened here,15,k3h4sp,3,"Did anyone experience feeling like a new being in their body, hearing demeaning voices and child voices, age sliding, etc and an amnesiac barrier beforehand? And being stuck in that state for longer than you should have, though the voices and visual hallucinations ended?

And believing that you weren‚Äôt the person you were before and didn‚Äôt have the same identity
As that you 
And when you realized what it was...(me through research) your brain rewired to include the past you And their associations 

Because I had emotional amnesia, delusions that I wasn‚Äôt the same Amanda and I was a baby...i believed that my thoughts and words weren‚Äôt my own...
And obviously I split off from that consciousness     And formed new neural associations i guess But then regained my personality and all those old associations when I realized that I was the same girl"
ADHD medicine making me dissociate?,15,k3h40z,10,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve had some sort of dissociation for a pretty long time now, most probably as a result of childhood trauma. I‚Äôm not ongoing family therapy to address that trauma which of course, makes me dissociate more. For reference, as a kid I had the feeling of being in my own bubble, like if I was isolated from everyone around me, especially in crowded or school settings. I smoked weed a couple times from the age of 13 and started getting bad dissociation when I smoked, so I stopped and continued trying it a few more times but soon realized that most of the time it resulted in me dissociating, last time I smoked is September (made me see weird, kinda delayed in a way, feel isolated from the outside world, hard to move and feel like I kept waking up and drifting back to a sorta sleep while still being able to interact with my surroundings). Weed definitely triggered this sort of dissociation and I don‚Äôt plan on touching that shit again. 

Anyways, I got back on ADHD meds beginning of october (Vyvanse 20mg) and seem to be dissociating more (short periods but pretty much everyday) since i started. I made a test and stopped for a couple days this week and almost didn‚Äôt dissociate at all. I took them today and it started again. The thing is, I can‚Äôt just not take ADHD meds long term, as my grades suck in school and i have no motivation whatsoever without them. 

Anyone has similar experiences? Any other meds that didn‚Äôt do that? Stuff I can do to help it? I took an appointment with my psychiatrist about the meds but i‚Äôm curious to see if i‚Äôm alone in this and how i can help it."

im terrified of my own head,14,jpvvxc,8,"this is exactlt how i feel now. ive had dissociation for a while but this is the worst its ever been and i‚Äôll think to myself ‚Äúwell at least im noy paranoid or delusional because that would be bad‚Äù and then instantly i‚Äôll start overthinking all of yhe thoughts ive had, everything feels so far away. im convinced i have a brain tumor and it scares the living shit out of me. ive always had really bad health anxiety but this is the worst its ever been and out of no where. im so scared of it, the past few days have felt like a dream or a nightmare im so anxious and paranoid. i feel like  a little kid, im scared to be alone im scared of my health and im scared im going to die. im only 16 im so scared i feel so helpless and vulnerable and im so scared somethings wrong"
A positive-ish tale,12,jkqwq0,10,"I met my gf online and we met in person about a year later. I flew across the country, where I'd never been, to see her. We had also never video chatted or talked on the phone, the closest being a few brief snapchats. When I saw her, it was magical and beyond what I had ever imagined. I quickly fell into a rare, euphoric dissociative state. I stayed a week and the whole thing felt like a dream. When I got home, I was still residually dissociating so I quickly wrote down what happened each day in a journal because I know I wouldn't have remembered any of it otherwise."
Holding onto emotions and feeling like past is real,13,jkgp4m,12,"Hello. I've been working really hard to feel safe and have emotions come up as a couple months ago started with a great therapist to work on complex trauma. I've been able to cry more and my thoughts have become more noticeable as well as occasionally getting emotional at reading or thinking of things. It seems to come in waves, and in the past my memories have not come back until I've been able to stay consistently in touch with my emotions, which hasn't happened yet. I'm still having a hard time in the appointment feeling and having emotions while talking about things that had me crying and being processed between sessions.

Sometimes the day before the appointment, I start feeling more grounded and that my emotions are not as accessible and wonder why I do not feel as reactive. Wondering if my body and mind is unconsciously ""getting ready"" for therapy and tucking my emotions back inside me. 

I also keep having random moments that last a few seconds that my past is not real and things weren't so bad and life feels unreal and wonder why I'm even doing therapy. Wish these moments would stop.

&#x200B;

What has helped everyone stay in touch with their emotions? To combat the feeling the past isn't real? And hang onto and feel emotions for therapy appointments?"
Dissociation and sensory issues?,14,jj116c,2,"I‚Äôve always kinda wondered if my dissociation is linked at all to my sensory issues, or if they‚Äôre just seperate problems. My sensory issues are no where near as severe as my dissociation, though. 


Could it be something like because the connection, the tethers, I like to say, between my mind and body are not as secure as they should be I then process any input from my body in a weird way. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how it links up, though, because I‚Äôm too sensitive, so if anything it would mean that I‚Äôm too in my body... I dunno...


One of the worst ones for me at the moment is a constant tingling/ticklish sensation, I‚Äôm constantly twitching as if I‚Äôm a horse/cow covered in ants or flies or something. I‚Äôm constantly having to shake or move limbs, clothes, blankets, etc., accompanied by a fuzzy, blurred, stuffed-with-cotton feeling in my head. 


Just something I was thinking about recently"
"I want to feel ""real""",15,j67s43,2,"I've been in a mental breakdown the last two days and I feel I'm always in dissociation mode. But the last few days it's worsened alot since I've not been coping with stuff going on around me. I feel I want to burn myself with a lighter to ""wake"" myself up again. To get out of this ""haze"" or mental fog. I don't feel like im in reality. I don't feel I'm thinking straight. I feel I'm thinking in a ball of fog if that makes any sense. And I want to just start thinking and feeling normal again. I just want to feel real or ""reality"" again in this dissociation.

Feeling unreal my whole life,15,h7sv20,3,"All my life I keep having these episodes of feeling like I'm not real. Or that nothing around me is.
I remember in high school standing in a circle of friends, and suddenly realizing that it all just feels so distant and close at the same time. Like I'm standing too close and too far at the same time.
Also feeling like I'm not present in a lot of situations in huge groups. It stems from being interrupted whenever I try to speak, and then just ending up feeling like I'm not even there because people don't even seem to acknowledge me.
The moment I saw the words ""dissociation and depersonalisation"" on the paper from my psychiatrist when I went to get diagnosed for depression and anxiety everything suddenly made sense. But it doesn't make it seem any easier. I still feel like the times when I feel normal and tangible are shorter than the times I feel out of body and reality.

Does anyone know any good coping mechanisms? I'm starting to feel like I'll never be able to get over this and I hate that."

Did I dissociate in the middle of the night?,15,gvszwk,3,"So last night I woke up part way through the night and felt kind of like in a halfway dreamy state. Not too unusual, I'm not a super heavy sleeper so I'm used to that sensation. The weird thing was after a minute I realized that I was completely awake and still felt strange. The feeling is hard to actually put into words but it was almost like my limbs and body part were constructed. Like Bioncle or lego pieces or something. Everything fit together in a certain way. I got up, walked around, used the bathroom, and changed the thermostat. Still felt weird and like my perception of reality wasn't quite on point. I could physically see and touch my arms and legs and process them, but my brain told me they weren't right. Like a weird dream while still being awake. I can't really seem to find anything exactly like what I experienced so I figured I'd ask. It was pretty wack."
I don‚Äôt know how to tackle my demons,13,glrjmz,6,People have told me that I have to tackle my demons. I‚Äôm pretty sure that my dissociation is a result of self loathing and social issues. I‚Äôve reached a point where the words that come out of my mouth don‚Äôt feel like my own. No one really ‚Äúknows‚Äù me anymore. I don‚Äôt speak genuine words to anyone even including my family. I think this happened because I have a serious problem with rejection. When someone doesn‚Äôt like me it fucking crushes me. Before this shit I was a sophomore in high school and nobody really liked me because I tried to hard to be liked. When people began to push me away because I was acting like an idiot I took it personally and thought that i was a bad person. This series of events turned into some pretty dark depression and at this point I am just numb. I‚Äôm completely close off from everyone I care about. I don‚Äôt have a friend. I can‚Äôt have a truthful conversation. Every conversation I have is about something I don‚Äôt care about so I have to fake it because the only thing that I care about anymore is getting out of my current mental situation alive. I think the demon I have to face is my self image. To begin with I felt pretty shitty about myself. I thought I had a shit personality because no one liked me but it was really because I was trying to hard to be liked because I was lonely. I never really let anyone ‚Äúknow‚Äù me as a genuine person. I was just a middle schooler/high schooler putting up an act of what they thought was desirable in a friend. To compensate I tried really fucking hard in school like unhealthily hard. Rejection continued and sophomore year stuff got dark. Now I can‚Äôt recognize my own face. Nothing feels real. My hands don‚Äôt feel like my own. I haven‚Äôt done school work in three weeks. And I think about killing myself most of the day. I have been ramming my head into a brick wall for the past year and a half trying to fix myself and I‚Äôve had zero success. For some reason this makes me hate myself. If I can‚Äôt get over this shit what is my value. I can‚Äôt fucking live with being rejected while people out there have so many more problems than me. I‚Äôve been so blessed with my situation and family yet I‚Äôm too weak to get passed high school without falling apart. I know logically that none of this is my fault but I still hate myself for it.

Dissociation caused by drugs,16,gajp7u,6,"Hi im new to reddit so im not exactly sure how this works but id love a second opinion. I've been researching dissociation disorder and depersonalization disorder for months upon months now and im not self diagnosing myself at all bc i hate that but for months upon months now ive been having these 'episodes' (?) where i feel like theirs a peice of glass separating me from reality, feeling like im not really there, feeling detached like im controlling myself with a tv remote often. Then theres feeling like nothing is real and im not real and getting in my head. Ive done so so so much research but heres the thing, from what i remember ive had no traumatic experiences as a young child nor do i have depression or severe anxiety. I have talked to a Councillor about this multiple times and she thought maybe i had signs for depression and im not to sure of that. Although i used to take alot of different types of drugs in the past (weed being the main) but i was reading a article a while back that said that drug use can also cause dissociation and i took every drug on the list given, i used to be very into drugs which i now regret but anyway im just looking for some advice and opinions or anyone who is on the same page as me."
"how i have arrived here? I‚Äôm not quite sure, but I am so grateful. (searching for shared experiences & advice)",13,g9ii81,3,"I‚Äôm not quite sure how it happened, but I found myself here online & immediately created a reddit account. not super sure how all of this works, so I apologize if I‚Äôm posting incorrectly!

admittedly, I‚Äôve experienced the heaviest dissociation today that I‚Äôve had in a while. it is usually very consistent, and I often find myself staring forward, doing backflips in my mind, to figure out exactly where I exist, but today it covered like a blanket.
today has been the type of dissociation where your brain is filled with black ink, causing a roadblock in sifting for words, thoughts, and feelings to project outward. it‚Äôs the type in which I can‚Äôt bare to respond to messages, as I fear what I am reading is interpreted wrongly, and I respond with something that does not make sense.

somehow, I found myself here & i‚Äôm holding two very conflicting feelings. on one hand, the comfort of now knowing I‚Äôm not alone, not crazy, not singular in this experience is calming beyond words. in reading the posts here, I was able to reach a more grounded state- allowing me to make this message. on the other hand, it breaks my heart. the times and feelings of dissociation I have experienced have been rattling to say the least, and I wholeheartedly wish no one here had to know that blanket, that confusion. 

for all who have posted: thank you. I have tried to make sense of these feelings for a very long time, as they have been with me since the earliest memory I can grasp. to see dialogue, advice, and successes in healing from these experiences, is beyond calming.

I was trying to look for posts describing the most extreme component of my experience with dissociation & I couldn‚Äôt quite find it. I thought I would write it here in case anyone has had a similar experience or knows what it could be.

my closest guess is some form of dissociative amnesia. during difficult times, or even sometimes during periods of absent emotions, a very physical switch clicks within me. I am unable to prepare or see it coming. the best way I can describe it is through the way in which another person witnessed- also my first experience with this extreme dissociation. I was sitting in the car with my friend & we were asking each other about how our days went. something switched, and I was nothing- the only reason I know what happened is because of the other set of eyes. he said mid-sentence, my face went blank, and I froze. he said I stared vacantly forward, completely silent. I began panicking- sobbing because I didn‚Äôt know where I was, who he was, what I was doing, and who I was. I didn‚Äôt even know my name. I don‚Äôt know how I returned to my body, but these experiences are the most terrifying events I‚Äôve ever been through.

I recently captured what I believe to be the beginning of those states in video- I had no idea until I watched it. my friends and I were sending each other goofy videos of us staring blankly while neutral milk hotel played (very obscure content, I know, but you gotta find humor during this pandemic). as I watched our videos back, planning to make a dumb edit, I witnessed something strange. I sat there, with an expression of pure terror on my face. the most alarming part were my eyes. they darted quickly all around, shaking and moving in a way I can‚Äôt explain. I don‚Äôt remember this. in the video, my eyes eventually found my phone, and then I was back.

I hope I have explained this properly & I apologize for the massive length of the post. If anyone has any similar experiences or advice, please let me know. because I can‚Äôt predict these states, forgetting who I am, who is around me, and where I am, has definitely brought a large amount of fear into my life, because if alone, I fear I could get hurt.

thank you a million times for reading,
I hope your night is calm and bright."

Understanding Triggers And Trauma,14,fxasmo,4,"I've done some research since my last post here and it turns out dissociation is trauma-based, which now seems obvious.

[Help] Is this even dissociation?,14,fwyip8,4,"I really don't want to be insensitive and I'm really self-conscious about using the right words to describe the right things but this.. I used to say it was dissociation but now I'm not that sure anymore.. So if i could get some input on it please?

&#x200B;

Basically, I often describe it as The Zoning Out, where my eyes fix an invisible point and my mind just goes *blank*, no thoughts, nothing, just empty. You could even hear cicadas.  I'm still somewhat aware of my surroundings (in a sense of I notice their presence and physically see them) and it never really lasts long as I eventually come back since there's always someone interacting with me or noticing it. It happened a couple times while I was alone and it was very hard to come back by myself.

In the past it wasn't that much of a problem, it only happened a few times and never lasted long but recently I noticed it got worse (or just noticed how bad it was, idk). I would go to class and start listening then not even 15mn in I would just.. *blank.*  I don't feel like I'm leaving my body or smth like that, I feel more like going deep inside, from being actively doing stuff to observing it from the inside (like watching a movie i guess).. I described it to some friends as if my mind was a plug and suddenly it was unplugged and it was impossible for me to plug it back. No matter how hard I tried I wouldn't be able to refocus on the class, or when I did I would be so lost I'd go blank again. The thing was that I'm aware I do this?? and it upsets me not to be able to focus back so I go on my phone to feel like I'm doing something, when it doesn't change a thing but just spares the poor professor from meeting the cold and dead goldfish-like eyes of one of their student. I started skipping classes bc I thought ""What's the point of going to my lectures if I'm gonna zone out 10 minutes in? I won't remember it so better not go and leave my seat for a student that will actually focus and take notes."" Note that it also happened sometimes while I was watching something at home.

So yeah, idk if it's dissociation??"

Dissociation/Suicidal Tendencies,14,fkzxtc,8,"I am really tired all of these. I don't even know where to start. I suffer from PTSD and severe dissociation. I don't feel like that anyone, or anything is real, even myself. I feel like i am a puppet master who pulls the strings behind the curtains but never experience from the first hand. I experience seizure attacks sometimes because i fear that something ""posess"" me and i no longer be a human, or myself but a stranger. To come to my senses i self harm. Recently i started to see a therapist (2 months ago) idk if it helped. But my therapist said she post-poned sessions until April cuz of covid-19. Now im stuck in my home, i live alone. I don't have anybody but my demons by myself. Everyone i love turned their backs to me. Some of them just pretend like they care in order to do not feel remorse if i commit suicide and die. I really don't know what to do anymore. Today i wrote a suicide letter in  my notebook. 3 months ago i commited suicide, it was like in-the-moment decision. But now it's different. I never felt this close before. I just wish that i had a family or good friend, or lover who would never abandon me in these dark times. I don't live but try to survive, not on earth but in hell with my demons. Sorry if it's too long or sounds like gibberish. I don't have anyone to write to anymore.

Dissociation or Something Else?,16,ffxk9c,10,"Tbh I don't really know where else to post so I figured I would give this sub a shot. Basically I don't know if I am experiencing disassociation, depersonalization, derealization or something else. Since before year university, Ive been dealing with this (so around 5 years). Haven't gotten help but more recently have been looking into it and becoming contempt with the fact that I need to talk to someone. Before I went to university, I had an episode where I was high that made me freak out. Since then, everything hasn't felt the same. I looked at my parents and outlook on life differently. I think because of anxiety it has evolved to something else. I quit smoking weed almost instantly after this. I specifically have become hyper aware that life is in first person and that freaks me out a lot of the time. An example would be yesterday when I was driving, I looked onto a large city skyline and became aware of how open everything was and that I was experiencing it all in first person. I relate to somethings in disassociation but the thing is I'm a social person most of the time, and I always have been so I don't disassociate with people, more so reality, if that is even what it is. I don't know if this constitutes me as crazy or ""getting out of touch with reality"" but its just gotten to the point where I genuinely feel depressed that I don't have the same outlook on life anymore. Where I live, proper mental health outlets aren't a big thing and I want to see if anyone has ever experienced what I'm feeling?"

I was silent half the journey and other half I started talking about his stuff (break up from gf etc.). I just avoided the thoughts of what happened. Now I am sitting on my couch just staring at my phone and everything is numb. Everything feels a bit bad and no happy thought does anything. I opened WhatsApp and started writing something to my friend,but stopped. What's the point? It doesn't make stuff better.

I had responsibilities for today but all the strength and will has escaped my body. I know I want to cry, but I can't. There is only the big fat void.

Lost love,14,dlfl0y,5,I'm 22 years old and I'm dating probably the best girlfriend I've ever had. The thing is it's very hard sometimes I think impossible for me to feel love do to a traumatic childhood and terrible relationships especially the last one about 3 years ago. Then it took my heart 8 months for my heart to open up and really feel love then the 9th month I got broken up with on Christmas and so much followed after it was sl traumatic to me I felt like I was crushed as soon as I opened up and every morning I would wake to a panic attack my heart racing and the undeniable feeling of wanting to die. I probably didnt deal with my emotions well and at this point in my life I feel like I'm unable to love I think I've dissociated with the feeling but I want to feel I want to be able to give love to my girlfriend who deserves it but I find myself feeling numb and not being able to find love with in myself.

Dissociation/Derealization but no history of trauma....,14,cwwc2k,2,"so i‚Äôve been dissociating for a while, since i was a young kid (11-12ish) and that, coupled with paranoia and anxiety (+co-morbid depression, yay!) makes for a fun time. thankfully i‚Äôve learned to cope with my symptoms and am pretty high functional thankfully. 

anyways since last afternoon till today i had been dissociating the entire time and it made me want to learn more about my disorder and why the heck i even have it, especially since i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve had any childhood trauma? 

i‚Äôve had a pretty normal childhood, nuclear family, good schools, friends, etc; i do have a history of anxiety disorders in my family, so could it have been that i‚Äôve just genetically developed it/been predisposed? it‚Äôs ok if nobody here knows the answer - just glad that somebody knows what i mean when i say it feels like when you‚Äôre reading a book and realize you‚Äôre reading words and not seeing the story play out. hopefully i can figure this out."

I had a really traumatic day yesterday, my family kept pushing all my triggers and laughing about it. After the first hour or so I'm pretty sure I dissociated for the rest of the day. When going to sleep I realized that I probably was dissociating and still going. 


Today it feels like everytime I stop dissociating and come back to reality all my emotions flood in and I have really bad panic attacks. Crying, hyperventilating, shaking, etc. I get a really strong urge to hurt myself and get extremely suicidal. After a while I just go back to feeling like I'm a video game character. Like I pick what options I do, press forward to walk but I'm not that person on the screen. Everything seems muffled like I'm underwater and none of this is real. I don't feel like I can feel.

Now I'm also able to see that sometimes when I wake up from a nap or even just sleeping, especially after a 'bad day' I'll feel scared and confused and fuzzy. Like I'm waking up in some awful dream world that I don't know what to do in.

Things like the tendency to disassociate is a habit that your brain can toss out when it feels it is no longer needed by you to function. Of course, in order for this pruning to happen a lot of active letting go must be done on your part. For months this was very hard for me. It seemed like every time I so much as talked about disassociating with my therapist it would happen to me. I was creating this fear around disassociating that was inducing more disassociating. The cycle was vicious. Over time I learned to calm myself down. I realized that I am finding myself, and disassociating is part of that. I stopped being scared and altogether it stopped happening to me. I am worlds better, I still deal with anxiety but I no longer have terrifying and persistent dissociative episodes."

Official Resource Thread - PLEASE READ,15,8gjybb,1,"I would really like to build up our resources so that we can take action when we're having moments of dissociation or terror. Having a subreddit helps, but I know from experience that sometimes you need IRL help to bring you down. So I will be posting all resources I find that are relevant to DID/DPDR/CPTST as often as I can. I don't want anyone who comes here to feel helpless. And as always, if you are having a crisis please call 911 or go to the nearest hospital. That being said, my inbox is always open and I get notifications on my phone when I get messages so I will be here to help to the best of my abilities anytime you guys need it. Even if you just need to hear that everything will be okay.

Please feel free to share any resources that you find on this thread and I will compile a list and beef up the sidebar with as much information and resources as possible. We can do this!

My latest and greatest resource is [The International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation](http://www.isst-d.org/)

Also, the National Alliance on Mental Illness offers a  24/7 crisis line that you can text when you're feeling scared or dissociating a lot. They will text with you and offer advice and try to get you to calm down and they will also offer resources if needed. Most importantly, the mobile crisis line allows you to speak with someone who, if they determine you need this, can send someone to your house to check on you or get you medical attention. 

For the text crisis line, text **""NAMI"" to 741-741** and someone will text with you and get you calmed down or help you find help otherwise (I love the text line, because sometimes I just need to hear everything will be okay from a professional and this makes it so easy).


If you are in a crisis whether you're suicidal or not please call **800-273-TALK (8255)** to get with someone who can direct you to a crisis line specific to your needs. Or, find someone to just talk with you.

Thanks guys and I look forward to seeing what you all have to bring to the table!"

How to recognize when you‚Äôre beginning to dissociate.,12,misznj,2,"I have trouble with hard conversations or talking about my trauma. I want to help both my partner and I have the tools to recognize an oncoming episode of dissociation. 

I recognize that when I start floating away, no actual problems are getting solved. I want to be able to problem solve rationally, without getting overwhelmed and feeling like a basket case. 

I feel like grounding and coming back to reality after it‚Äôs already happened is one thing. But I want to be proactive with nipping these episodes in the bud beforehand. 

My partner doesn‚Äôt recognize when my eyes are glazing over and I‚Äôve gone quiet. He‚Äôs a Chatty Cathy, and will keep talking. It‚Äôs not intentional, and I know he feels bad, and doesn‚Äôt want to make it worse. I think it would help to figure out how to communicate when he‚Äôs lost me. How can I help both myself, and him recognize that oncoming state of overwhelm to slow it down and handle it gently? 

What methods do you guys use? What are some things that have and haven‚Äôt worked for you?"
Age regression during dissociation spiral? Has anyone else experienced this?,12,lxbsgi,3,"I‚Äôm pretty new to identifying my experiences as dissociation (both me and my therapist aren‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs the right label), so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong on anything.    


A couple months ago I went down a pretty severe dissociation spiral, to the point I couldn‚Äòt emotionally recognize my family or friends at all.  It was terrifying being in cars and hanging around with them.  Felt very much unlike myself, nothing felt real, you know the drill.  I was desperate to find an answer as to why this was happening so much more severely (and much longer) than usual, and that‚Äôs when I found out most people don‚Äòt dissociate or have ‚Äúweird days‚Äù at all, or avoid certain songs because it‚Äôll make their brain ‚Äúweird‚Äù.

Naturally I was concerned, so I looked into why this might be happening.  The answers the internet gave me only freaked me out more, with all that ‚Äúchildhood trauma‚Äú stuff, and especially the idea that I might have DID (don‚Äôt know why that came up before dpdr, but it is what it is).  Of course this only made everything worse.

I don‚Äôt know if I manifested this out of paranoia or if age regression is just a common thing among people who dissociate, but eventually one night I suddenly felt as if I was a child (I use the pronoun ‚Äúhe‚Äù for him but for some reason in the moment it felt important for my brain to note he was androgynous).  I was immediately gripped with an extremely strong terror and started hitting myself and freaking out until it stopped.  I think it then happened again a week or so later, but my memory is really bad (especially from around that time) so I‚Äôm not sure.  I still am very avoidant to hug pillows or stuffed animals, because I felt that was what brought ‚Äúhim‚Äù out initially, even though ‚Äúhe‚Äù hasn‚Äôt been a problem in months now.  Aside from my own overthinking, of course.

I‚Äôd really like other people‚Äôs feedback about this, as my therapist doesn‚Äôt seem to have any clue for the time being and is just focusing on stuff she can handle (anxiety, depression, you know).  Is this normal for people who dissociate?  Did I just manifest this out of paranoia?  Does anyone else relate to this?  Feel free to ask me any questions if you need."
Any advice for dissociative fugue?,13,lndfae,13,"
f, 19
Ive heard that dissociative fugue is when a person suddenly forgets his past life and associations due to a traumatic event or stress and have the urge to wandere usually far from home for a couple of months or years. (Also: If the person already started a new life it can happens that he suddenly remembers his past life again and forgets the years he lived his ‚Äönew/fake life‚Äò.)
This is exactly how I feel like right now... for months already.
Does anyone know if hypnosis can bring your old associations back? Or do they just come automatically?

Im just trying to find a way to bring my old associations back. 
In my case it was mostly due to lots of stress from university."
Grounding? Flow? Mindfulness? Meditation?,14,lfhr58,5,"I'll repost something here that I originally put in the Meditation reddit. But the answers there disappointed me.

What the title says. I find it difficult to get a grip on the terminology around mindfulness. Everybody says dissociation is bad, OK. We practice mindfulness in order to be more aware, and dissociation is the opposite of being dissociated. But then people say humans are the most happy when they are in a ""flow"" state, like, when they are coding or chopping wood or painting with all their heart, and that seems to me far away from mindfulness, too - hyperfocused attention.

So, physiologically, I don't really understand the difference in what's happening in each of these states :("
"First time posting, not sure if what I‚Äôm experiencing is dissociation or what. Helpful feedback encouraged :)",13,lajwji,2,"So here we go, all throughout my life I‚Äôve occasionally experienced very strong surges of what I now know is dissociation, specifically derealization I‚Äôd say, but also very strongly depersonalization. It wasn‚Äôt something that would happen very often, but it was prevalent. When it happened it always felt very uneasy and also very depressed, but not sad depressed, it just felt very empty and unreal. I guess the feeling was similar to being in the middle of nowhere all alone and having your stomach dropping.

 A specific incident I remember very clearly was when I was visiting my brother. He lived near a rec center so we went to the pool there and would swim, sit in the sauna, ETC. it was always a very good experience and I always had a ton of fun and I wasn‚Äôt stressed or anxious about anything. And all I remember was the second we left I got a super strong feeling of dissociation, I barely even remembered where I was and such and I tried my best to explain it but I couldn‚Äôt, and I still really can‚Äôt, the best explanation that I have is that it feels like I‚Äôm in a dream.

So this hasn‚Äôt been an issue ever really and it was just something that occasionally happened but recently it‚Äôs been happening more often. Like weeks at a time, I have recently started smoking weed, so I‚Äôm pretty positive that has something to do with it, but I only experience this once I‚Äôm sober, so I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it. It‚Äôs not interfering with my daily life too bad except for mild discomfort and unease, but i guess it does worry me a little bit. 

I‚Äôm not really looking for a cure or anything, I just kinda wanted to put this out here and get some input on to what this may be, and sort of get it off my chest. Any input or comment is appreciated, thanks."
First Derealization Episode?,12,la9o8e,1,"I'm sorry if I misuse terms, this is all new to me.

I have PTSD, panic and generalized anxiety disorders.  I'm no stranger to dissociation but last week something different happened, and I am honestly terrified.

I've been really stressed lately, I won't bore you with the details, but I was driving home and it hit me like a ton of bricks -- nothing was real, and I was completely separated from control of my body.  I kept driving as normal, but on the inside I was horrified (compounded by the fact that I had my dog in the car with me, who is my pride and joy).  Thankfully we were close to home and we arrived safely just via muscle memory, I guess.  As I drove up my long driveway I wondered where we were and why we were there (I've lived here over a year).

Then came another issue: I had no idea how to get out of the car.  It didn't occur to me that I could just open the door and get out; I have no idea how long I spent just sitting there in a haze with my dog whining to get out.

Finally, through the haze I gained some sense of control and very slowly opened the door, let my dog out and went inside.  I sat inside for a long time too, wrestling and trying to figure out what had happened and why; once I became more myself I was terrified that it might happen again and cried just from the memory of it. 

Perhaps the scariest thing: I resolved not to drive until I was more myself, scared that in my derealization or whatever it was I could hurt myself or someone else with my car.  I argued this with myself, remembering that I was going to go ride my horse later that afternoon so I should go.  I didn't *hear* the voice physically so much as hear it like you hear an internal monologue, but something said, ""why would you care? There's nothing particularly special about horses.  Forget about them."" And my entire life I've been devoted to horses, this is very much 100% not me. (Yes, horsegirl that's me)

Since then I've been very dissociated.

This is all very, very disturbing for me.  My panic attacks already make it difficult for me to lead a normal life and hold down any kind of work, but if this is going to be more regular for me I don't know what I'll do.  Am I safe when I have these episodes? Please, if anyone can offer words of comfort I'm really worried."
Dissociation and Insomnia,12,l1w9kd,3,"Anybody else with insomnia who's dissociation worsen things? We are prone to dissociation episodes and notice when they get bad again that it only makes our insomnia worse than before. I'd take our sleeping medicine for it but our mom criticizes us for not frequently taking our medicine, and I'm really not looking to deal with her berating us right now. It really makes things ten times more miserable."
Sertraline for dpdr questions,13,kwu6ux,9,"Hi, i'm a 19 year old experiencing derealisation which was the result of a weed induced panic attack a couple of years ago.. I have been in this state for 2 years and my therapist and psychiatrist think that I should go on sertraline, starting at 25mg and tapering up over a few months, prescribed for anxiety. I'm very conflicted on doing this. On one hand, these professionals I've spoken to seem confident that it would have a positive effect on my anxiety, and thusly my derealisation, and I've been told that unless there were any hiccups they were wanting to have me off it after 6 months. on the other hand I'm very nervous about taking any kind of meds, especially ssris, for a number of reasons. I am aware that they can have pretty severe side effects, some of which mimic the exact problems I am trying to fix, ie the emotional numbness I deal with from the dissociation. I've also heard some people online say that ssris caused either emotional numbness or murdered their sexuality which is obviously the opposite of what I want. I have a few questions for anyone with experience of sertraline and especially taking it with derealisation.

how bad do the side effects get? I've heard that you can get pretty severe physical effects as well as bad emotional ones, so was wondering how bad being on sertraline actually is, are they horrible and life ruining or just annoying?

what is the experience of being on sertraline like generally?

is there any significant risk of side effects lasting after stopping taking the medication?

does anyone have experience taking sertraline with derealisation (particularly when caused by anxiety) and what was your experience, do you think that it has a significant potential to help

sorry if this post is not allowed, feel free to remove it. If anyone has experiences with ssris other than sertraline that might be useful too :)"
Studying + Dissociation = Forgetting,13,kn1cgc,2,"When I am studying I have massively started dissociating I‚Äôll forget everything that happens and see that the whole day has passed and I haven‚Äôt moved or have no clue what‚Äôs happened, does anyone know what can help change or reduce this?"
How do I function when whenever someone is talking to me it causes dissociation?,14,kmtccj,1,"I‚Äôm dissociated every day. Probably for years or even since I was a kid. 

My mom and stepdad were verbally abusive growing up. I‚Äôve gone through a lot of trauma. 

Not one single conversation/words from them would ever be positive, even now. 

It feels like whenever anyone talks TO me I fall into a hole and can‚Äôt get out for days. 

This probably doesn‚Äôt even make much sense as I can barely read paragraphs and type."
I need advice.,14,kllwsi,9,"I feel like reality is broken. I don‚Äôt even know if this is entirely a dissociation thing, but this is the closest place I could think of putting it. 

So, I‚Äôm 19, my life hasn‚Äôt by any means been awful, but it also hasn‚Äôt been particularly pretty. Ive had a lot of pretty traumatic experiences. My dad was always pretty mentally abusive to me and for the most part caused the majority of my dissociation, along with the death of my cat. I‚Äôve also had numerous suicide attempts, one of them being especially traumatic. 

From around late middle school to high school, I‚Äôve always felt very different from everyone else. I don‚Äôt mean different as in I‚Äôm quirky or unique, but more so in that I just.. didn‚Äôt get it. I didn‚Äôt understand how everyone could be so caught up with such meaningless things. Everything just seemed so basic and uninteresting. I felt like I was just missing some vital key part of being a human. In the more recent years, since I left school, I‚Äôve been realizing a lot of really weird stuff about life that I really don‚Äôt know how to put into words here. Sometimes it just feels like I don‚Äôt know how to assign meaning to things. Everything just kind of.. breaks. Screens become meaningless pixels of light, trees and the beauty of nature turns into organisms just trying to survive. Nothing feels right.


It feels like I don‚Äôt know how to act normal when I‚Äôm alone, like I just never know what to do. Sometimes I‚Äôll just sit somewhere doing nothing but watching the time go by. 

Of course, this isn‚Äôt a constant thing, and I do generally enjoy life, despite me being fairly suicidal. But when it rains, it pours. It‚Äôs like this switch in my brain just turns off and everything just stops.

Picture it like this: your in a party, there‚Äôs flashing lights, people dancing, loud music. But then suddenly, everything just stops. The lights shut off, everyone‚Äôs gone, there‚Äôs no music, no color. It‚Äôs just you in a big empty room. There‚Äôs no emotion, no meaning, nothing. Of course in reality everything is still happening around you, but to you, it just feels like nothing. It feels like your seeing something your not supposed to see, like something behind the scenes of reality itself. This is what it feels like for me.


Adding onto this, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs entirely related but I‚Äôve always felt very uncomfortable looking into my own eyes. Like, it feels like whenever I stare directly into my eyes, I don‚Äôt see anything looking back at me, it feels like I‚Äôm looking at an empty vessel. 

I‚Äôve never really been able to get a good grasp on personal identity in general honestly.. but as I said, that could be unrelated.

Anyways, that‚Äôs really all I can say in terms of explaining my mind. If you actually read this far, then I appreciate you taking the time out of your life to take interest in some random stranger on the internet."
Non-panicky Dissociation,13,kkm7l4,8,"Does anyone else have episodes without panic? Whenever I find myself in one, I‚Äôm fairly numb. Sometimes I‚Äôm more depressed than anything else, sometimes it‚Äôs a bit painful... but I‚Äôve never panicked like so many people have described in other posts.

I‚Äôm not necessarily looking for advice, although it‚Äôs always welcome. I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else can relate to this experience."
I was out of it mostly and it came back because of self exposure technique,12,kfr76l,2,"Hi there, I am 23/F and figured out I was living with constant dissociation two months ago and started theraphy afterwards. I thought that I had DID kind of a thing because of the constant negative voice with me but there was not any other thing indicating it and nothing came up about it. After a couple of sessions, one night I smoked weed because of another stressor came up and suddenly my brain revealed a memory of a traumatic incident that took place 14 years ago. All of a sudden, I sarted to re feel my body and connected to my surrondings and rverything felt different. I can say that I was reborn and my consicousness have been altered. However, then this grief period hit that I couldnt stopped thinking that I have lost those years and the only thing I was thinking was the event and thought of myself if the event didn‚Äôt take place etc. After a week or so, I wanted to try some kind of a meditative exposure theraphy by myself to get out the thoughts related to it. Then, all of it came back... I am now anle to distinguish these distinct states and I am now back stuck in the dissociation mode. I geel like I have ruined it all over again and trapped in the freeze mode because of what I did to myself. However, there is also this feeling of hypervigilance this time like an anxiety feeling that I didn‚Äôt have before. Do you have any opinions or someone went theough a similar oath. My doctor said that I shouldn‚Äôt do anything about the memory but I disnt listen to him and I am so afraid that it is irreversible."
I'm not be as interesting as you think,14,k9dsdz,0,
Is there anyone that would like to chat?,12,jo150l,4,"Lately my mental health has been plummeting and I can‚Äôt afford to take pills or go see a good therapist right now. I have a few friends but they aren‚Äôt as helpful because they have no idea what I‚Äôm going through and when I try to explain it they get Even more confused. 

I think talking to someone that‚Äôs in a similar state of mind could help in some way  and I was wondering if any of you feel the same way? PM me if you would like to talk and maybe vent or need someone at the moment.

Ps I know there‚Äôs probably group chats for this but I‚Äôd much rather talk one on one."
A close call while grocery shopping,13,j3mp78,1,"So there I am at Stop and Shop with my purse on my arm, its bamboo handles feel a lot like a shopping basket‚Äôs, and I am of course in La La Land as usual, only half paying attention to what I am doing, and I see this cute little bag of brownies, and fortunately I catch myself just before I accidentally put them in my purse, half thinking it‚Äôs a shopping basket. I‚Äôm like the poster child for maladaptive daydreaming.

I being the one who, while dissociating when traveling (in an effort to connect with my subconscious utilizing Carl Jung‚Äôs technique called Active Fantasy/Imagination), got lost, misplaced my glasses, apparently stepped in poison ivy, became dehydrated, fell prey to heat exhaustion, and in a moment of confused desperation, walked into a stranger‚Äôs home looking for respite from the heat. (This was at the very end of June during the pandemic when sitting inside to cool off was not yet allowed in RI. Although it was in MA where I am from.) Then I was taken to the ER. 

Sedated without my knowledge, after agreeing to be transported to a nearby hospital, I woke up in a bed with an alarm, panicked, and ended up locked in the Neuro Stroke Unit for 9 days and a group ward for 2, unable to leave because they thought I was manic. Despite the fact that dissociative symptoms are not even a symptom of mania. Nor did I have a past history of mental illness, being then aged 50, and quite happy and successful, able to afford my own home, 1 mile from the beach, even though I am and have, with the exception of a brief engagement, always been single."
Feeling far away and my mind feels blank,13,ioton2,6,"Does anyone else dissociate this way? I also get this strange feeling in my eyes, like I have to shut them or cover them. I have also heard this is a symptom of overstimulation though. I feel like I have to space out, it‚Äôs the only way I can relax. I can‚Äôt think for more than like 2 minutes before I forget what I wanted to say or type. I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm getting my medicine today hopefully. I want it to stop. I feel nothing but want to cry at the same time."
"Emotionally numb but still ""feel"" emotions?",13,ijxxil,8,"I've been emotionally numb since March after a suspected negative occurrence with an antidepressant. But there's been this strange issue going on, where despite not feeling the emotion or being attached to it, my body somehow continues to physically respond to the emotion. 

For example, the other day my anxiety ramped up so high to the point my entire body was shaking. I couldn't feel the stress, or the anxiety, but because of knowing what reactions certain emotions have on me I've got a good feeling it was anxiety (+ stress). 

Does anyone know what I'm describing? I can't feel the emotion psychologically, but still have physical reactions. And it makes calming down difficult, as I can't feel the stress or calmness. 

As a bonus the same thing happens when watching something funny, weirdly I'll find myself laughing and get this buzz in my stomach, but there's no emotional depth. So I'm laughing but also feeling nothing."
I dissociate whenever I eat?,13,i9avi0,1,"Hi. I‚Äôve been dealing with dissociation for about a year now. Earlier this year, I had horrible body image issues and I stopped eating food for a few weeks. I mean, I still ate but probably less than 300 cal a day. I felt the most alive than I had in a really long time. Now that I am back to a healthy eating schedule, I‚Äôm always in a subtle state of dissociation. I noticed, though, that whenever I‚Äôm in a grocery store or after I eat something, I‚Äôm thrown into a horrible dissociative episode.

Does anyone deal with a similar problem?
Does anyone have any tips on how I can work on this?

I‚Äôd appreciate any kind of help. Thanks :)"
So many parts of me,13,i11bd5,5,"I feel like I‚Äôm always dissociating in and out parts of me but never fully present. There‚Äôs therapist me, drug addict me, young me, party me, girlfriend me, confident me, abused me etc. I can‚Äôt seem to figure who I am or why I should be here. No part feels right and the parts merging feels super wrong. I‚Äôve never fully explained it anyone (partially did some work with my therapist) but I just feel so fake/lost sometimes. Reddit seemed like the right place to put it."
what is disassociation for you?,13,hs82us,24,"hello there, 

i am aware that there are varying degrees of disassociation (mild - extreme). i have had anxiety and depression for years now & am medicated for it. 

Fo a while, i felt really good, awake, and aware, but recently i do not feel connected to my body or in my body a lot. when i am around people im actively aware of how disconnected and distant i feel. its such a mentally draining task to be around others when im in a bad day of disconnect/disassociation. unfortunately, this tends to be always. 

i guess im wondering what its like for everybody? sometimes when ive brought this up with friends they assure me ""i cant be experiencing it"" but i dont know what else to call these horrible feelings & i want to start feeling in my body again. 

any shared experiences or advice would be awesome

thank you."
A voyeur of your own life?,13,hi6exs,0,"A realisation that I‚Äôve been a voyeur of my own life for...well, for decades at this point.

Anyone else feel this way?

When I reconnect with my body, it‚Äôs truly disturbing just how...overstimulated it is, how anxious it is, how nervous it is, how seemingly without any real sense of grounding it is.

I‚Äôm just one big nerve expressing itself, and I have so little experience connecting with it."
Is this dissociation?,14,he032q,8,"Hi. I have CPTSD, and problems with dissociation. I've tried to be observant of my 'symptoms' and something happend some days ago, I Wonder if that was a dissociation.

I got a reeeeeeally heavy anxiety attack with traumatic flashbacks. I was triggered and i couldnt handle it. It was like i Saw from young-me' eyes. Suddenly everything went calm. Soft. I felt NOTHING. I really mean it when i say i didn't feel anything at all. My Body went slow, all my movement was slow. When i tried to talk, i talked slow too. Nothing bothered me anymore. I was a 'nothing'. It was like this a couple och hours, i don't really remember what i did or anything. I fell asleep easy and the next days was little slow too. I'm fine now, but when i ""came back"" it felt really scary."
Long-period disassociating after starting therapy,12,gz00xl,6,"Hiya, I've never posted here before, so hello!

So I started NHS therapy four days ago, it went quite well and the therapist was nice, but unfortunately, since then I've been completely unable to ground myself and have been dissociating really badly for like, all the time I'm awake and terrible nightmares when I sleep. I've been unfortunately having to self-quarantine strictly (no going to the supermarket etc) because I'm high risk, so I think that's not helped. 

My question is: is it normal to disassociate/depersonalise (I'm still shaky on the terms) for a period of three days after therapy? 

Thank you :)"
I am confused if I have made up my disassociation,14,gryxcg,4,I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs got better and I haven‚Äôt disassociated for a while but I can‚Äôt tell when I am and when I‚Äôm not. Like I get small feelings of it every now and then but I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm over thinking myself into. I‚Äôm questioning how bad it was cause I remeber it‚Äôs been so so bad before but I have had it for so long I can‚Äôt remeber what it‚Äôs like to not have it at all. I think I jsut havnt had it really bad for a while and I‚Äôm jsut starting to wonder if it‚Äôs gonna come bakc or if I‚Äôm in it right now and I jsut don‚Äôt realise cause it‚Äôs been like this for ages.
Duration of dissociation,14,gowwlu,5,"Does anyone else seem to dissociate for multiple hours at a time? This is the first time it happened for multiple hours for me. 

I was out of it from (super roughly) 11am-4pm. It's pretty scary stuff. 

I normally come-to within a few minutes if the anxiety is low, or a just a couple of hours if it's after a panic attack. 

When I came back inside and checked the time and saw that it was a little after 4pm, I was so surprised and confused. At least dissociation when being outside isn't all bad --- you get a nice tan afterwards!"
Empathy,12,gg41ab,1,"Has anyone dissociated for so long that they've lost the ability to feel empathy properly? I feel like I was a very empathetic person and then I had a stressful year which involved lots of work and alcohol and pressuring myself into socialising and being someone I'm not, and I kind of forgot that other people are real. It's like I pretended to be someone else for so long that now I struggle to feel my own emotions and connect myself with my brain again. It's making me mistreat people around me.

I have struggled with dissociation since I was younger but never with empathy I don't think. I still struggle now to empathise and have to really concentrate to imagine how they feel, because I went so long feeling like people aren't real and neither am I and I can't do any damage because of that.

Am I alone in this?"
I‚Äôm kinda freaking out,14,gcsw6u,4,It‚Äôs reached the point where I completely do not associate the face in the mirror with me. Weird enough already seeing and feeling everything like I‚Äôm sitting on my bed watching a video game cutscene and now this. My body is no longer mine. I forget the simplest of words every 30 seconds. My perception of time is all fucked up. I forget what I‚Äôm talking about mid sentence or sometimes forget I was even talking. How long do I have until I‚Äôm brain dead?
Any tips on how to get in touch w/ emotions?,13,g3k7jz,15,"Hi! New to reddit and this subreddit, so this might not be the right place to ask, but here it goes.

I've always had an extremely hard time dealing with negative emotions. I've always tried to ignore them or push them away when they arise. A year ago I got depersonalisation from smoking weed and life has been hell ever since, every single day. 

My therapist says the way back is through dealing with my feelings, but the only thing I feel is extreme anxiety/panic or nothing at all. A kind of emptiness. I don't know why it's like this. I just have a constant feeling that some part of me is holding something back, and I'm not able to ""let it loose"" and experience whatever is underneath the crushing anxiety.

Has anyone felt similar? How have you been able to slowly let go of the ""holding back"", and let stuff come out?

Any tips/techniques are much appreciated!"

Anxiety or dissociation,15,en3tb7,5,Ima 16 Yr old boy n diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression and a panic disorder aswell as some PTSD.

We didn't get far into the conversation but I just feel embarrassed of this happening, I didn't realize that my mind going blank was a first step in dissociation.. I'm embarrassed about showing bits of me to a new therapist , showing this vulnerable side where I couldn't do anything but sit completely still and quiet. 
There are points when this happens that have this very very safe and comfortable pause in existence and I just had to reach those points for a few moments to be ok but now this is all I am thinking about, how and what she thought, how I could let that happen etc I don't know I know it's silly to be embarrassed but I am"
touch averse,13,dwr67w,0,"recently i‚Äôve been feeling like i want to be held and loved and cared for but often when i get it it doesn‚Äôt feel right? i feel some sort of deep.... anger or annoyance or pain or something and i don‚Äôt know why. i go back and forth between being super cuddly and loving and just kind of aloof and on my own, i suppress it way more than my girlfriend notices but it does still affect us.

i feel like this is my fault, ive been looking into my trauma and just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on with me. but i think in the process i‚Äôve triggered myself a lot, i went too far a few times and tried to intentionally force a flashback or a memory or just any shred of validation which i realize now is stupid as hell and i wish i could undo it. i really want/need a therapist and all of this started because i wanted to help myself and look into my symptoms while i saved up to afford a therapist but i feel like i‚Äôve just broken myself more and i‚Äôve remembered things i don‚Äôt want to or shouldn‚Äôt have yet which was made clear (once by a voice in my head sternly telling me that they had told me many times i didn‚Äôt want to remember, as a warning after i had a flashback)

Dissociative mechanics,13,du8kov,11,Dissociation is a mechanism to prevent trauma/stimulation to be processed into the main consciousness. Even small things like someone telling you what to do will cause yourself to dissociate because being told what to do means that you will have to integrate the new information and make action. But people who dissociate severely aren't capable of planning to perform action because the mechanics of dissociation completely protects the main consciousness from experiencing any sort of stimulation.
My take on Dissociation ( Years Experience ),10,dtvq12,5,"Hello readers I had an ephiniy a few days ago and wanted to explain my insight to all of you I'm not sure if my insight applies to you or can relate to you, but I hope to bring some clarification or relatedness to you.

To begin with growing up I've seen two type of people some who do and take action and others who essentially live in their head and form scenarios of different otcomes to a specific event. Sometimes even day dream or fantasize and luster over scenarios, yearning for some to happen that never will but you keep replaying these moments within your mind hoping this will occur in reality.

As children we tend to use a imagination alot and visual certain scenarios and role play to learn. This can begin and continue into your teens and early adulthood. Being entangled in a infitie amount of thoughts and scenario's that aren't even real, which do not apply to the current reality in n some cases. This results in one not taking action in the present moment or the current state of reality. If you stay in your head 24/7 you really will get a feeling that your not connected to your environment and circumstances. How is the mind supposed to learn human dynamics
 Which can only be learned through interaction s which involves taking action. We must create action to take grasp of the present moment to form our current reality. I've been having a epic episode of dissociation for 7 years. As of today I feel like I have woken up and realized. My symptoms are feelings of not being engaged with others not feeling present in the. Moment, brain fog , memory loss , depression. Feeling like they can't form any relationship"
Feelings,13,dmhtci,2,"I think I have the hardest time sitting with any feelings that are pushed to the edge. I am talking bad day then more things pile up and keep piling on me. 
    I want to disappear but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs unbearable to watch me go through anger, sadness, disappointed, feel ugly, everyone hates me feelings and I feel like I am going to lose it but of course, I seem to keep it together on the outside. 
     I can‚Äôt function or focus until I resolve these emotions so they will disappear.  I feel like I am soaring on  adrenaline, heart is beating fast, and I am being suck into this hole. 
    How do you get through emotions that you can‚Äôt see straight or function normally? I wanted to take a drive which calms me down but I couldn‚Äôt even take a step in this direction. 
    When this huge emotional meltdown happens, I always dissociate which helps to not to experience it.  I don‚Äôt know if all my childhood  trauma creates such a hardship to experience feelings normally? Whatever is normal anyway! It helps to write this down to try to figure myself out.  I can see why people do drugs to not experience feelings and numb out? Maybe I was never allowed to experience feelings? If I could crawl in a box I would do it to shield me from this!!"
My (continuing) story of determining if experiencing dissociation or psychosis,13,dh7k7g,2,"I suppose I'll open up with explaining how some few years ago I had been (mis?)diagnosed with a dissociative disorder(unspecified) due to seeming to have some symptoms from each of the dissociative disorders, but not a compelling amount of symptoms from a single one of them to be given a specific DD diagnosis.

Looking back at this time, I feel I may have sub-consciously omitted facts out of fear of what type of diagnosis I would be given. I know during this time I had never reported the following:

1. I would have visual distortions/hallucinations in my peripheral vision, when, upon looking more directly, would disappear, so I knew clearly I was seeing things that shouldn't be there. They're usually of a horrific nature, such as horror items you'd see around this time of year during Halloween or scary movies. These distortions change in frequency, could have an entire month without any, could have a few every day for a couple weeks.
2. Schizophrenia *is* in my family.  I have at least two extended family members with it(not cousins).
3. Nearly every day, I feel others can hear my internal thoughts - obviously a delusional belief, but I usually recognize it's delusional after a minute or so of thinking it.

These symptoms I had never reported until, what I would describe, as a pretty severe metaphysical crisis I experienced just a week ago.  I realized just how terrified I was of being diagnosed with schizophrenia and I concluded that this fear, which I presume was in my un- or subconscious for the past few years, came to my conscious just last week. Thus, I went to my university therapist out of urgency. I decided to start anew with this therapist I never had before. I reported these symptoms and am going to soon be getting a brand new psych evaluation from the psychiatrist he is a co-worker with, where I'll make sure to again report these facts and symptoms of mine.

I'm still a bit afraid to possibly get this diagnosis, but something my therapist mentioned to me when he spoke with the psychiatrist about my situation, is that an anti-depressant I've been on since my last suicide attempt(about 5 years ago), can actually have this symptom of visual distortions in the peripheral as I described. Thinking back, I'm not totally certain I had these visual hallucinations/distortions before those 5 years, but it did seem to help calm my worries that there's another possible explanation. Still, I can't say the concern is completely gone. In some respects, I wish I was *not*  studying psychology and cognitive science(even though I love the subjects) because, well, it makes me very much aware of what disorders have what symptoms and I can't help but worry over it if it seems I'm experiencing those symptoms as a disorder is described to have. Anyways, I'm not sure what else to write out here, other than any support here is appreciated. Wish me luck this next week as I start fresh with a brand new psych evaluation."
Dissociation + roleplaying: can anyone relate?/vent,14,dg9lvm,2,"This has been on my mind for a long time, but I don‚Äôt really have anyone I can talk to about it.        
        
From the ages of 11-21, my friend and I would role-play as characters together. We were/are both very prone to dissociation. Anyway, this role playing thing took on a life of its own. It wasn‚Äôt just when we had down time, it became 24/7. We would text the role play, and we would literally tag messages that weren‚Äôt in character because we did the role play way more often than we chatted with eachother. Quickly turned into both of us in our respective homes not doing anything but living this other life for hours at a time, absolutely whenever possible.       
        
It was always a bit different for me than for her. Rarely, we would switch characters, but it was extremely hard for me and it was always her idea. The character seemed to bleed into my mind. I was still living his life in my head while living my own, even not roleplaying. ‚ÄúHis‚Äù thoughts stayed with me constantly, but they never really crossed into thoughts about ‚Äúmy‚Äù world, except that sometimes I would behave/react in the same way he would.         
        
The roleplaying situation ended suddenly and with a bad falling out with the friend. Naturally it was hard to adjust to just stopping such a big habit, but it was a bit more than that. Part of my bipolar disorder (I assumed) was this crazy overwhelming episodes of rage I would get. It just disappeared immediately after and i felt very alone in my mind.      
     
It‚Äôs been about four years since we stopped, but I still think about it too much. If I see something from that character‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs like I can feel it in my mind again and I feel more normal than I had without it. It just kinda fucks me up.."
I need someone to talk to I guess so here goes,14,dfcyuw,3,"I've dissociated a lot of my life. Tbh I'm unsure if it's because I had some sort of trauma that I dissociated through when I was little or just because I have depression and anxiety. I don't remember a lot of my childhood and it's all very blurry. I was getting better for a couple years, but I've just started going to college and I feel like I'm losing my shit.

It's similar to how it was before, but way worse. It feels like I'm living in a dream and I can't even tell what's real anymore. I'll live through days and have no memory of most of it. If you were to ask me what I did yesterday or last week I would have a lot of trouble answering; in therapy yesterday I had no answer when she asked about my week. If you were to ask me what I ate for breakfast it would take me a solid minute to even remember. My thoughts wander like crazy- it's impossible to focus on anything. I'll begin reading a sentence and by the time I reach the end the beginning has just kind of dissolved away. I ""zone out"" constantly, and I'm completely scatter-brained. I have conversations and moments after question whether they were real. Everything feels like a dream or a distant memory. I also get these like, episodes. I stop being able to talk; it's like I WANT to talk, and if someone says something I have a response, but I just can't get myself to say it. It gets to the point where sometimes I can't even move. I also get these moments where I feel like the world spins. Looking in the mirror or at pictures of myself is hell, using ""I"" and ""me"" statements is hell. Even reading this back it feels like someone else wrote it.

The worst is that I feel so empty. I feel like I'm living a complete lie. I say and do stuff but it's not me that does it; I'll be talking and suddenly wonder where the hell the words are even coming from. I haven't REALLY laughed at anything for ages; I just kind of let my body laugh at something but am actually just empty on the inside. I feel like I'm somewhere else completely and I don't know how to come back. The world has lost color; nothing is real. I don't want to exist anymore. I only really have one friend I'm actually comfortable breaking down in front of; everyone else I feel like I need to put on that mask for. I feel so alone, and so empty, and I don't know how to come back from whatever far off place I've gone to. I wish I could just stop existing. I don't even see the point of living anymore; everything is hell. 

I don't really know the point of this post; it's really late and I don't have anyone else to turn to. I don't know what to do anymore; I don't know how to function. I don't want to live like this anymore, but I don't know how to fix it. I've tried the grounding techniques but I always lapse into another episode a few seconds after I try to ground myself. I don't know what to do anymore."
Clarifying my dissociation symptoms,13,cm1oss,7,"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last October and since then I‚Äôve been immersing myself in psychological concepts like psychosis/neurosis and dissociation. I‚Äôve realized since my diagnosis that I‚Äôve dissociated more than once, but I‚Äôm having a difficult time figuring out what‚Äôs dissociation as opposed to something else. 

The first time I remember dissociating was during soccer practice in middle school. I absolutely hated going to practice because this one kid kept reminding me how much I sucked, during practice and at school. One time we were scrimmaging and I was about to shoot a penalty kick. Our coach blew the whistle and suddenly a felt like I was dreaming. I bent down, picked up the ball, and everyone on my team started yelling at me for getting a handball. The other side got the ball and scored a goal. I had no idea why I picked up the ball, but I remembered every second of it. 

Since then I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve dissociated a number of times while high on weed. Most recently I got so high that I felt like everything was bulging out at me, and I was losing awareness of my body. Like I was a mind  and nothing else. My girlfriend tried to calm me down but I couldn‚Äôt look at her because I couldn‚Äôt tell how close her face was to mine. (I‚Äôm also pretty sure this experience was more than just dissociation. My mind was also racing and I was hearing voices [probably isolated mania] and was paranoid I had schizophrenia, which I don‚Äôt.)

Sometimes I just blackout and/or go on autopilot on occasion, without being on drugs. Only for a few moments at a time. I have a notoriously bad memory, but I can usually remember if someone reminds me. Earlier today my girlfriend handed me a butter knife that I apparently put back in the drawer. I asked her where the knife was, and when she told me I had absolutely no recollection of her ever giving it to me or  me putting it back.

A couple of weeks ago a similar thing happened when we were at chipotle. I always get a veggie burrito so I was surprised to see that it cost a dollar more than I‚Äôd paid the day before. I told the cashier this and she said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you remember saying yes after I asked you if you had a steak burrito?‚Äù I definitely did not remember any of that. 

I have a proactive imagination so I assume my mind was elsewhere in these moments, but it freaks me out that I could be so unaware of the outside world that I forget things I do or say. 

Anyone relate?"
Forgetting memories for months or years,14,c1lgow,5,"Can anyone relate to completely forgetting episodic memories for months or years at a time? I remember new parts of my life all the time. Whenever a bad or traumatic event happens to me I bury it deep inside me. At a later date I remember bits, pieces and eventually the entire memory. During the remembering, my life is on hold. I become extremely angry as I uncover the trauma. I harbor resentment towards friends and family over things that happened long ago. When I meet with them we are in good standing, but in my head I am still going through the motions to remember these old memories. This is very troublesome. I am on autopilot and act shell shocked most of the time. Because of this, I have trouble with social cues and eye contact, which makes me look like a rude and uncaring person to a lot of people. I uncover traumatic memories, child abuse, embarrassing memories, and anything I was not really there to witness at the time, in full. It is like a very delayed processing. Do any of you guys have similar symptoms, and could you offer any advice? Thanks for reading."
Just need to let it out,12,buzgi7,2,"If you‚Äôre reading this, hello i hope you‚Äôre all doing better than I currently am.

My mind is boggled up with quiet, yet loud thoughts. It feels like my eyes can‚Äôt keep up with what I‚Äôm seeing. If i‚Äôm even really seeing. Sounds weird, but in this moment I have the heavy feeling of nothing being real. I went to the store and saw a lot of people and i feel like that made it worse. I wanted to run away and cry, but i managed to push through it. So i‚Äôm sitting here now feeling numb. I‚Äôve had these thought since 2014 and every time they come back it feels scary all over again as if i‚Äôve never experienced it 

I‚Äôm somewhere between wanting to feel nothing, but also wanting to feel something. My mind can comprehend anything it feels like even though i know it‚Äôs not true. Absolutely everything in my life is content yet these ugly thoughts continue to attack me. I only hope that one day I‚Äôll never have to experience these feelings again, but unfortunately i know it‚Äôs not true. I just need to find ways to cope and live past it.  It‚Äôs just scary. 

If you‚Äôre still here, thanks for reading. I hope you have a wonderful day."
I feel like I've been in some kind of mild dissociative state for years,12,btotlv,4,"I haven't felt like myself in years. I've always had severe anxiety, but in the past I still had a general sense of appreciation for life, enjoyment of life, and no problem having emotional connections to other people and animals. I used to be extremely patient, deeply compassionate person who deeply cared for the wellbeing and happiness of others. But now, I don't feel like that person at all. I feel as though I live in a constant state of agitation and anger. Things that used to give me the deepest joy now just stress me out and piss me off. I have lost all concept of who I am except some vague, hazy memory of once experiencing joy, compassion, fulfillment, etc. I know that I used to love animals and children. I can't recall many very specific memories of this, but I know it was a huge part of me. Now they just bother me and stress me out. I feel like my own daughter is not actually my child, and that confuses me, severely distresses me, and makes me feel like a terrible mother. I am not bonded to her like I know I should be. I used to enjoy so many things. I continue to do what I know is right on willpower alone. I no longer feel motivation, fulfillment, or joy from anything. I no longer feel love and compassion, except in brief, fleeting moments that usually only last minutes and occur every few months. I had been in a series if extremely stressful and mildly traumatic events and circumstances over the past, I don't know, 10 or more years. I feel like I finally broke under the pressure about 2 years ago. Now I am nothing. Just my body housing a series of operations, while whatever makes me 'me' is just miserably dragged along for the ride. 

I have recently moved into the woods thousands of miles from my home town and have been able to just focus on myself and my family. With all of the other things out of the way, so many things have been surfacing. During the long drives into town, I frequently find myself reliving and crying for things I couldn't even focus on while it was happening. Things that happened years ago that I never cried for then. The memories are hard but at least I feel something when they come to me. And then they pass and I am once again reduced to this bitter emptiness. 

I feel like I cannot live this way anymore. I am not suicidal, but I feel like I cannot live this way anymore. I cannot be this horrible person anymore that is all anger and pain and no love or connection to anything meaningful except in brief fleeting moments that only come once every few months. I feel like a failure and hate who I have become. I have wanted the exact life I am living for most of my life, and yet I appreciate exactly none of it. Gratitude exercises really don't help much. They really just make me feel more guilty and shitty that I cannot seem to appreciate or enjoy what great gifts I have been given recently. I thought leaving the situation I was in would make things better. But as far as I can tell, without the constant busy-ness and distraction, I can now really tell how crazy and fucked up and an uncaring asshole I have become. I have been looking for a way out the whole time, and it seems like there just isn't one. Even removing all of the stressors from my life wasn't enough. Even having everything provided for me isn't enough. My life is by far the safest and most stable it has ever been, and it's not enough. I still cant enjoy or appreciate anything, like some spoiled brat. Like some entity of anger and resentment and everything that I never was and hated the most has taken over me. The guilt is overwhelming. I am everything I have always been against. Ungrateful, dead to the world, cold, and bitter, amidst a picturesque life that has suddenly just fallen in my lap. I cant deal with the guilt of being such a shitty angry rude compassionless loveless asshole when in my new circumstances, I am surrounded by nothing but goodness and positivity now. It wasn't this way before, sure, but it is now. 
I wish I could kill just this evil part that has taken over me."
What does dissociation look like chemically?,13,bi2tal,3,"Like, your emotions are all controlled by different neurotransmitters, but what exactly causes the feeling of ""dissociating"" from a chemical/medical perspective?"
Anyone experience dissociation more often in dark places?,13,bfjsq6,5,"Especially in restaurants with dim lighting, I find myself dissociating much more in darker places than during the day. Anyone also experience this/similar weird relationship to light or know why this happens?"
Dissociative fugue - anyone using a tracker?,13,baob8m,6,"A few days ago my husband left for work and when he finally realized where he was it was almost a full day later and he was three states away, driving. It was terrifying for all of us. He‚Äôs had a previous episode, but it didn‚Äôt last nearly as long. His psychiatrist would like a tracker on his car as well as a wearable tracker. Can anyone share any suggestions? I‚Äôd be grateful. "
Is it worth to travel anywhere knowing I'm just not gonna be aware of it?,13,b3fsbi,5,I'm planning on taking a trip soon but I feel like there's just no point in doing so. I'll be in constant dissociation and derealisation so I wont remember half of it or enjoy the view or any aspect of the trip. What's the point of wasting my money? 
Does anyone else hate it when their daydreams are interrupted,13,b2uini,1,"I maladaptive daydream almost constantly and sometimes it can go on for hours. 

Occasionally someone will steal my attention for one reason or another and I'm unable to finish my daydream and i end up feeling frustrated for the rest of the day."
Dissociation?,14,ar3x37,1,"Sometimes I feel like I'm in a movie and everything I come into contact with be it a person or a new situation is a part of this story that's in my mind. It's like I get so lost in my thoughts, the story in my mind, and it's like I'm a character in a movie just reading their script....it's weird. 
When i'm like that I know i've lost touch with reality. Does this make sense or am i just being weird?"
PERIOD,14,ai28bv,5,Period makes my dissociation so  much worse
Voice Rumination,13,9si766,10,"DAE hear their voice come out and wonder where it is coming from? Every time I speak, my mind immediately starts telling me that it doesn't belong to me. It is very difficult to explain, but I feel so disconnected from my body that when I speak, I wonder who is saying it and who I even am.. It makes me not want to talk at all and is really killing me socially."
"Everyday feels the same, im stuck in some sort of loop",13,9c22ec,2,"So Ive had good ol depersonalisation for about 4 years now, overtime I think I developed what seems to be borderline personality disorder and have had a few episodes that alter personalities have taken over me but Im pretty sure I dont have DID because Im confident that I had no childhood trauma. Everyday just kinda feels the exact same, for the past like 8 months now, same obsessive thoughts, same huge amount of stress that I cant escape. My skin health is pretty bad and I dont get sleep often, and I just feel generally anxious and depressed throughout the day. I have never given up though, and just continue pushing through carrying this, and over time it has gotten better but damn the part where I cant manage my emotions and dont know where Im at in life is very confusing"
Dissociation survey,13,87rp1e,2,"I have conducted a survey for a project I am making to raise awareness for dissociative disorders such as derealisation and depersonalisation.

Trying to write how you feel.,13,7krb8n,3,
Do you ever feel like this?,12,525gyg,3,When you are in a conversation do you ever feel like you're not actually speaking and that your communication when you're dissociating is like an answering machine and that you're not really the one speaking? It's hard to explain like you're not speaking like you usually would and you're voice appears to be different.
Does anyone take SSRIs?,12,mhtwhs,32,"Ive been prescripted setraline (zoloft) for depression, anxiety etc and mood swings. i did inform the doctor i dissociate daily (im always flicking in and out, for longer periods when im tired or in social situations) but he didnt ask any questions about it and didnt mention it at all. just said he recommends i go on medication. im really really worried about taking SSRIs for many of the potential side effects and fear of the unknown, but im wondering how it could or if it will impact the dissociating at all? positively or negatively?? anyone else? currently not recieving therapy either which is another reason im so worried of starting the medication, without further support"

In a relationship and confused by dissociation.,13,lwqt1k,5,"My relationship with my girlfriend is great on paper, we're both kind to each other and make one another laugh, but frequently I don't really feel much towards her while other times I feel a lot. I'm having a hard time figuring out if that's dissociation or something relating to our relationship and how I really feel. Are there any ways to distinguish the two?"
is it normal to not recognize yourself in the mirror anymore also tw this is a vent,12,lv6qbk,36,"i cant tell if its getting worse or im just losing it

is there even anyone looking in the mirror

every fucking time i ask myself who am i i feel like i lose a part of myself 

i cant answer the question

i feel an guilt ridden empty feeling in my stomach

i don't know whats happening anymore 

im just really not safe with myself anymore

New here and I‚Äôm grieving,12,lp0pa2,7,"I‚Äôve had disso. All my life. I just started taking Ambilfy for disso (1 month) and 3 days ago all my voices stopped. 

I called them my peanut gallery. Some were mean and nasty but other‚Äôs were my best friends. I‚Äôm going through a break up and I need the advice, love and inspiration I got from the good ones. That advice you can only get from someone who has been watching every move and knowing every thought you‚Äôve ever had. 

It‚Äôs nice to not hear the nasty ones but I‚Äôm so lonely. I know they were all me. I know I have it in me somewhere but it was so good to hear ‚Äúanother‚Äù voice. It‚Äôs just so quiet and boring now. 

I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around it all. 

Anyone in recovery and wanna give me some advice?"
"Keep trying to sleep it off, but when I wake up I just start dissociating again",11,lnuuz4,8,"I‚Äôve been trying to take naps hoping the dissociating would be gone by the time I woke up but it just comes back when I wake up. 
Any advice?"
Coping Skills,11,kpumzj,10,"About six months ago I started experiencing dissociation. After it began to become severe I did some research and spoke with some people, but I am unable to get treatment at the moment due to insurance/financial reasons. 
I feel like I am not here, and have to constantly remind myself that I am real and that my surroundings are real. I feel like I am in a shell, and I can‚Äôt take in my surroundings. My vision is weird too, like sometimes things seem dimmed. There are moments through my day that I feel as if I have ‚Äúwoken up.‚Äù (Things seem clearer and my thoughts seems clearer.) I feel like I‚Äôm moving in liquid sometimes if that makes sense. I experience normal emotion although I feel extremely disconnected from it. I can no longer focus on the things I enjoy doing anymore. Most of the time I can handle this, it has become my new normal and I have hopes that it will eventually go away. Lately it has caused me to have day to day panic attacks, and I was wondering if anyone had any coping skills they could suggest that I could try myself?"
Loss of thought,11,koalv0,2,"This symptom started to become most evident in therapy. I can handle being detached from the real world when I'm isolated from everyone and no one talks to me. I can pretend I am functional to people who don't give a shit about me. But in therapy, when I am asked to talk about myself and my life, I start to lose my thoughts. Honestly, it freaks me out sometimes. 

I start to feel like I'm floating, like I'm drunk. Just, confused as hell. My therapist will ask me ""What are you thinking about right now?"" and I will be like ""I don't know. Nothing"". Because I really *have no thoughts*. I check out. It's really getting in the way of therapy. I am desperate to make some progress, discuss about my past, my feelings, but I am so muted. I can't just force my thoughts into my mind. They are BLOCKED. I feel stuck, and frustrated with myself."
My dissociative states make me feel like Odysseus when he thinks he has been with Circe for a only day but really a year has gone by outside her kingdom.,13,khsj1g,0,"Sometimes i feel like Circe has enchanted me and played tricks on my mind and my memories. I spend so much time dissociated in my mind that when I finally pay attention to the outside world I realize a lot more time has past than I thought.

Never been this bad,13,kckg4e,3,I‚Äôve never dissociated this hard. I‚Äôve never felt this far away from my body or sanity. I feel the intense tv ambient screen filling my head.

I can‚Äôt comprehend reality well and I just am losing my mind it hurts so much I just need help
Dissociation through Philosophical Thought,12,ka96yj,7,"(17,M) I noticed that extremely metaphysical thought patterns began with me at the start of the quarantine era. Whether this was from stress, being bored incessantly, or the seemingly homogenous nature of each new day‚Äî I do not know, because all three were present. Perhaps they intertwine in a complex series of cause-effect and positive feedback relationships. However, as time passed, the influence these thoughts had on me personally increased rapidly. I suddenly grew an unbreakable fascination with the universe and especially space time. But things took a more disturbing turn when I thought about infinity. To be clear, I had always understood the concept of infinity, but it hit different this time when I realized that physical space as well as time was just that‚Äî Infinite. 

Nothing and simply nothing (not a single thing I have ever fathomed) had occurred more non-real to me‚Äîthe idea that something could follow a direction forever and there would still be ahead‚ÄîTime would never stop‚ÄîThese two realizations led me to the massively disturbing (practically, self-destructive) hyper-meta question: ‚Äùhow is existence a capability?‚Äú That is‚Äî‚Äúhow, conceptually, can existence occur?‚Äù

I feel it is this that marked the beginning of my chaotically abstract descent. It felt as if the definition of ‚Äòreal‚Äô became very subjective which, consequently, cursed me with a severe ‚Äúbackground anxiety.‚Äù 

Since then, I feel like I‚Äôm on a decline. I struggle more and more with paying attention in school. Motivation has fallen, and therapy doesn‚Äôt seem to be very effective. When something representing ‚Äúthe human condition‚Äù occurs, it has left me with a sort of existential pessimism. Is there hope? The Wikipedia articles I‚Äôve seen to answer this don‚Äôt read indicatively so."
