It's hard to go through this life not even feeling real and feeling I'm a mixture of everyone I meet while also melting into the universe. I'm really hurt. Everyday is a struggle."
1,"Hello, I have recently started questioning if I have OSDD. I joined this site hoping for support/advice/related experiences. Before I continue I'd like to say I cannot access therapy at the moment (I hope to go in the future,) which is why I'm here. I have extremely few memories from my childhood, and those memories feel like they belong to someone else, it is like watching someone else live their life in vr. I know I have gone through traumas, but I can't remember much from before 2nd grade. In second grade I remember ""waking up"" (it was more like coming to) in class, I was confused, I thought: ""where am I?"" ""Why don't I remember anything?"" ""I have to pretend to be 'P'."" It was odd, like I was an older person in a 2nd graders body, but ultimately as soon as those thoughts came I told myself ""I can't think about this right now, I need to focus."" Then the incident became a fuzzy memory as I got older. As I entered my pre-teens I started have gaps in my memory but it always happened at night so I thought it happened because I was tired. I also started to disassociate heavily, 98% of the time I was disassociating/daydreaming. Even for now it is a large struggle for me though I have gotten better at identifying my triggers. I spent the last 15-16 years of my life looking at myself through other people's eyes, and I had no idea who I was, it always felt like I was trapped in my own body. Everytike I look in the mirror it is never someone I recognize and it constantly changes. I talk to myself very often in my head, but recently I realized it seems like I am talking to other people. I also talk to myself outloud, have conflicting opinions/emotions/and aspects of my identity. I never questioned it because I thought I had many ""personalities"" within me and it was normal for everyone with my experiences. However, after stumbling up DID/OSDD half a year ago I have been realizing I have symptoms in common. (I.e my ""personalities"" are very similar, they change in different settings.) Anyways, what prompted me to seriously consider the possibility of having OSDD is during a recent disassociative episode I remember acknowledging myself as a different person. Idk if I am just faking it or it should be something to consider further and try to figure out with a therapist in the future.

Summary:
I don't remember my childhood and have memory gaps where I don't remember doing things. I disassociate a LOT. I don't feel like I belong in my body, I heard other people talking in my head, I recently I believe another person ""fronted."" I cannot access therapy/professional opinion at the moment and would like support/advice from other going through the same thing and/or if you think I may have OSSD."
2,"Hi you lovelies reading. <3 I hope dearly this finds you comfy and cosy, and that you are all taking good care. <3 Please feel no pressure or need to reply or read. ♡ I think I simply need to vent a bit of how I feel for a moment, and am very thankful for this space existing. ♡♡ Thank you so, so much. ♡♡♡ So lovely, you are x *sends a cosy, soothing stream of warmth with sparkling stars <3*  ❤  

I feel as though my mind is fully gone, and that I have perished too. ): I am still very much physically alive and safe, but any light and lucidity have left me, as well as my personhood ~ I feel as though all that has made me 'me' is gone, which terrifies me. I think I could handle this change if it were only I affected, or I had no loved ones, but seeing how greatly it inhibits me from being any bit of use or good to those I love and adore haunts me, and there is only so much I can bear. ): I have had episodes of sitting for hours in paralysis, coming to, only to discover that I can become so lost and so vulnerable. Much of the time, I liken myself to little more than a zombie, with my inability to think, act, be, communicate, or function in any capacity as a person. I feel so horrified at the lack of dignity that one sentient being could possibly feel, and how immensely much can be lost. I have let everyone down in my life and it makes my heart weep. I used to be vibrant, beautiful, kind and caring and looking back, I realise how precious it was that I could come across other gorgeous dearies and be loved for my priorly whole self, and whole-heartedly love in tandem. However, those days are heartbreakingly gone now, and I am nothing more than a mindless, demonic ghost. ): To continue to allow myself to deteriorate in my loved ones eyes grieves me so much, and deep down in my heart, I know that it would be best that I let them go, so nobody need be saddled with me anymore. I wish so much I could be a huggy ghost and just give everyone a big, big hug, I would weep and hug with every last bit of my strength, so, so happily! Or even better, send all in my heart, every dearie precious, every last bit of my warmth and my strength. <3 This idea has also held me for a while! The idea of focusing my warmth and my strength outward, this sustained me and kept me going for months. <3 Yet, no longer can I even do this, and this has signaled to me that my time with them may best be up. ♡ My mind has flown away, and my last act of kindness to those I love would be to fly away from them too {'': *weeps with my whole heart* ❤ 

Thank you so, so, so much for reading, and for everything. <3 Please know that your needs, wishes, thoughts, and feelings are so, so immensely important, and are worth every safeguard and care. <3 You all deserve the absolute best, the loveliest of sunsets and skies, and so dearly I wish you warm and sweet days ahead filled with all dear and relieving. <3 *sends streams and streams more soothing, supportive, nourishing, nurturing, and sparkling stars, embraces, cuddles, cutie hearts, and everything to one's cosy delight <3* ❤❤❤"
3,"Hi,

I'm new here and had multiple dissociative episodes in my life. Mostly when I'm confronted to specific triggers / conflicts / perceived threats. I mostly just zone out and quit talking, walk away (like literally leave work in the middle of the day and make up sketchy excuses afterwards), freeze...

I had therapy for a couple of things, but honestly few tips / help about the dissociative symptoms.

Anyways, that's my story, but I was wondering what was the actual difference between dissociation, depersonalisation and derealization.

Maybe it would help me make sense out of my symptoms ? 

Thanks in advance (:"
4,"Sort of the opposite of feeling as if I am not real, which I have felt for the majority of my life. I like to pretend sometimes that I am the only real thing in this world and everybody around me moves according to my design. It brings me comfort and a sense of control. I don't feel like this all the time. I'm starting to repeat the phrase ""nothing is possible"" so I can erase anything in my reality that gives me anxiety. If nothing is possible then nothing is real but me."
5,"I've had a little experience with the strange state of mind and mood called dissociation (or the other names for it). It's a hard thing to describe. The mind sort of just wanders off some place and this makes the current experience strange. I may have done this lots of times but can't recall much of it except for a few occasions. Sometimes the normal sense of what is real gets a little distorted, like things appear slightly smaller than they really are, or more distant. If it's mild it isn't that disturbing. Stronger senses of dissociation can be unsettling. I've experienced that 'surreal' feeling a few times when something bad or quite unusual happened.

How would you describe your experiences with this sort of thing? Is it frequent or just occasional? Does it last long or quickly pass? Do you try to get back to 'reality' when it occurs, or just go with the strange state of mind for a while?"
6,"trigger warning bc i also talk about eating disorders

I don't feel like I'm totally in my body. I feel like I'm slightly in my body but not all the way.

i feel like a childs coloring book page. 

the outline. thats me. 

the child came and colored me in, gave me life and soul, but colored out of the lines. thats how i feel.

like im a venn diagram. 

the one circle is me. my body. the other overlapping circle is where i feel. 

sometimes i look around my apartment and it doesnt quite feel real to me, aswell. like its all made up in my mind and that this is all in my head. 

i know it isnt, but its how i feel sometimes.


this happens most when im under a lot of stress. like this week ive been eating badly... and tonight i binged. the stress of binging... of breaking my streak of no binging..... 

im just upset with myself. i wasnt sure whether to post this in eating disorders or here because it has both :/"
7,"Does anyone else have one (or more) alter(s) who has a disability that no other alter has? ...or they have it to a more severe degree than others when they are up front in the body? 

Or is there memory loss between switching between this alter and others so others within the system don't realise that one exists or the disabled alter doesn't know there are 'others' who can do things they can't? 

Just curious how common it is after reading a genuine case in the papers about a blind woman who recovered sight in 8 out of her 10 alters.
and another who had a deaf-mute alter who was triggered by fear of having to undergo an operation."
8,The Universe feels fundamentally flawed. I can't explain it at all. I don't even think I know what I'm talking about? It's spiritual I guess? I just don't get it? But WHY does it have to be the entire UNIVERSE?! I've never even left Earth for freak sake! Maybe spirits can pick up on things the body can't??? :confused:  :confused:  :confused:
9,"ive only noticed now that sometimes i feel like im observing myself. that im doing things manually. i zone out of things and lose focus easily, and this also means that my memory is quite poor too. i cant drive as i cant focus either. i cant live without a task list and planning, otherwise id be an unorganised mess. how can i cure this? or is it just tiredness?"
10,"I've been struggling with not feeling like myself today. I've been ""zoning out"" a lot (especially while driving), not able to speak, not being able to remember parts of my day, confusion, not feeling real. I immediately think it's my anxiety, but this feels different than my normal anxiety symptoms. I've always felt like there was something more going on with me, but never could understand what was going on or how to explain it or talk to others about it.

My husband thinks I need to see a mental health professional, but I keep putting it off because I'm terrified.

Help me understand?"
11,"I have 'many versions of self' but have also come to realise that at least one is a completely seperate alter who can function alongside whatever version of 'me' is up front. ... so that means there's at least 2.... the 'me' and the one that is not any child or adult version of 'me'.  

They act sometimes as a mother figure/adviser and stay in the background helping via passive influence when I'm trying to deal with real life stuff and sometimes as a child/teen to match the age of any 'little' that comes out so they have someone to play/interact with on their level. They like to play 'twin' to my 16yr old and they can actually co-pilot the body together so they can interact as conjoined twins would share control of the body.

I mean technically  'you' could only be one alter at once right??? to be another you'd have to first 'switch' to them?  ...so if there's another 'up front' with you then they have to be completely seperate from 'the self' otherwise it wouldn't be possible???"
12,"hope a moderator see this soon. can escaping on the internet such as listening to music , looking at girls in bikinis and online window shopping be a form of maladaptive day dreaming?"
13,"My ex girlfriend went through having an abortion 7 months ago.

Since then I have tried asking her to go to therapy together to unpack it and talk about it. Her reasonings were due to covid and our lack of jobs, and her fear of her disapproving parents.

She shuts down the conversation pretty quickly and then moves on. She normally would never do this.

Further she hates talking about it altogether and thus I had stopped asking.

She had been binge watching tv shows and movies and focusing on her health which is great yes, but its as if she was not at all thinking about it and that is understandable but I just feel like sweeping things under a rug and disassociating are more damaging.

Out of nowhere 7 months post abortion, she told me she associates me to the abortion and thus she couldn't be with me any longer. Again disassociating from her trauma, which I understand despite it being hurtful since I was supportive of her. But again, it feels like she was pushing the very thought and ANYTHING, counting me, under a rug to not think about again.

Finally its been 6 months post breakup and I ran into her sister at a grocery store. After catching up, I asked her about her sister. And she said ""Funny you ask, we talked the other day about you. I asked her what's he been up to. And unfortunately she said that she hasn't thought about you, searched you, or any of that.""

This killed to hear because we had a long relationship and I thought I was special to her in some way despite breaking up.

I felt like she was trying to disassociate me from her mind and life, sweeping me under that big rug of hers and not thinking about me.

Does disassociation ever catch up to someone and then they need to handle all those things they have pushed down?

Would she ever stop disassociating me do you think? 

Can disassociation last a lifetime?

I would love to be friends just like we were before dating... but yah she doesnt want me around due to the connection, and seemingly she doesnt want me in her head either."
14,"Hi everyone!

I've had MD since I think 3-4 years old, when I met my best friend and we had a very toxic relationship. I did not have any other friends and spent time only with this girl. My parents were also very controlling and I felt trapped all the time.
I used MD as a coping mechanism. There, in the world that I created, I was the rebel with all the superpowers in the world, a superhero, an orphan with cool friends and amazing boyfriend/husband. My trigger was music + moving in some way, mostly jumping but I could also swing on a swing. Later I realized I am also able to daydream in any moving vehicle (car, train, plane) and also while walking - if I have headphones with music in, I am always at risk.

I tried to quit many times, but it's like an addiction. I also have diagnosed OCD, which makes me self harm, and also have intrusive thoughts, and anxiety. I take medication. However, MD doesn't go away.
Recently I made another attempt to stop. It's been about a week. However, I am facing the problem I face every time I try to quit -
See, when I want to daydream I get this light feeling in my chest, as though there is a bulk of light that is trying to rip my chest and get outside, it is an uncomfortable feeling and so far this bulk only goes away if I daydream. I do not know what will be as effective with coping with this light. I think it might be just all my emotions turned into a physical feeling, I often experience that my emotional pain turns into physical pain.
Did anybody have the same experience?
I honestly don't know what to do."
15,"Hi everyone. I joined last night out of desperation really. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD and DDNOS a few years ago now. My dissociative episodes were largely when I got triggered or felt extra anxious and would generally last less than a couple of minutes. My therapist said she usually realised when I was absent but not always. I had sessions where I had no memory at all of what we’d discussed. I’ve also experienced what I just thought were horrendous short term memory issues for years... as long as I can remember really. They’re so much a part of me that all my friends and family take the mickey out of me for being so forgetful. It could be whole conversations I’ve had with people but I’ll swear blind I have no idea what they’re talking about, or it could be really important letters I’ve received but said I haven’t received and then months later I’ll find these letters stuffed in bags/boxes or even under my car seat and then I start panicking that everyone will think I’m a liar and that I’ll get a reputation for being untrustworthy and unreliable. I’ve messed up on so many really important things this way and it makes me question my sanity. I feel so stupid.

Derealisation and depersonalisation are so much a part of my life I no longer question it. It’s just like it’s totally normal to me. Sometimes it feels like I’m floating above whatever setting I’m in and looking down on myself and whatever’s going on. Other times I might feel like everything is in slow motion and I get frustrated as I want to press fast forward. Sometimes I can feel like I’m watching a film in one of those old fashioned projectors where everything is jumpy, sometimes it’s silent, sometimes there are voices and sometimes I can see the lips moving but the sound coming out of them doesn’t fit the scene, e.g. I could be having a flashback to something not very pleasant but all I can hear is one of these people talking about making cakes. Again, it makes me feel like a total nutter a lot of the time!

I’ve not really spoken about any of this stuff despite years of therapy with many different people... one of which I saw for 10 years! I always just thought these things were just in my head, that if I said any of it out loud I would be locked up or dismissed as a liar.

My therapy sessions have become deeper and more intense recently and I told her something this week that I have never told anyone else ever and had absolutely no intention of doing so! The moment I told her I automatically regretted it and wished I hadn’t, not because of her reaction because she was honestly brilliant about it all and she even said what I was telling her made perfect sense, but just because inside I felt so guilty and like they would know and somehow get me back for telling. It felt like a massive betrayal and it’s really scared me. It’s almost like I’m waiting for that bolt of lightening to strike me and wipe me out! I know that sounds extreme and dramatic but that’s the only metaphor I could come up with for the severity of my fear at what I’ve opened up here.

I always felt different, even as a kid, never felt like I fit anywhere, I saw and felt things others seemed oblivious to and my behaviours were just kind of weird really. I’ve always talked to myself... had whole conversations not just like ‘normal’ talking to yourself. I role play every single situation in my head... my head is never quiet and peaceful, it always feels busy and loud. I edit myself the whole time throughout every single interaction I have with people. I am very measured in my approach and careful not to bring about any kind of confrontation or aggression. If I’m in a situation that looks to be going that way I retreat inside myself and it’s like a braver version of me comes out and deals with it. I am aware of one side of me who has been with me throughout my adult life and I call her by her name and I know she is the part of me that deals with things if I get triggered. Other than her I have no idea what this is or how many other parts there may or may not be but with her I feel safe. I trust her because she’s sensible and grown up and knows what to do and how to handle things. I even debated whether of not to change my name by deed poll years ago wondering if I was called ___ if it would help me to respond to things the way she does.

This is where this weird post is about to get a bit weirder! I have 2 friends with DID and although we’ve discussed my Dissociation and I have great relationships with many of their alters as well, I never once listened to things they said and thought “I’m like that too”. I don’t feel that way. I don’t appear to have any different voices/accents/languages/genders.I don’t think my demeanour particularly changed much as surely someone would have told me over the years? I’m not really aware of much at all, I only know I’ve been absent at all once I’ve returned and I never have any idea where I’ve been of what has gone on while I haven’t been present.

My therapist who has worked with DID a lot said she can’t obviously diagnose me which I’m fully aware of, but she said she believes from everything that is now coming out she believes I am towards the higher end of the scale. Just hearing that has scared me so much as it seems more real now. I guess when covid dies down a bit I’ll have to have a chat with my GP and see if I can be referred back to my psychiatrist. To be honest CMHRS here are pretty poor in non covid times... this could take a while and in the meantime I’m just stuck with this, not really knowing for sure what ‘this’ really is.

I’m too scared to mention all this to my friends with DID. It was never a train I asked to jump on and I don’t want our friendship to become just about this whatever it is. Plus, in all honesty, I don’t see myself in the way I see them. I just know I have absolutely no idea who I am and I’m really scared about finding out, and yet I feel I need to know. Does any of this make sense to anyone? Sorry for going on."
16,what do you think.....would they have some sort of connection
17,"is this an example of depersonalisation.....if you don't see your body as yours so it affects relationships cos you think 'they're not my sister/friend/brother they just think they have a relationship with the personality they believe occupies that body'??

so you're seeing the physical body as more of a 'transport vessel' like I'm just borrowing it to get from A to B like borrowing someone's else's car to get somewhere??"
18,"I know it sounds like a meme, but I feel like I'm living in a simulation. So many things to wrong in my life, but they're so specific. Like, the very worst thing that can happen, happens. For example, let's say I need a specialist, I find a local one, within a day or two, the specialist would have moved to another (much further) location. As it someone knew I needed them, and then made it more difficult for me to find a specialist. 

Another example is how I feel different from other people. I feel like I'm much more aware of my surroundings than other people. I feel like I'm much more intuitive than other people. It's like people miss obvious things that they should've seen. I'm not sure what a good example would be because it's just little things, but they're so obvious. I've vented about this before and people became angry at me because they claim those things are mistakes or ""brain farts"". And yes, I accept that people make mistakes, but I hardly ever make these kinds of mistakes because they're so easy to not make.

Sigh. I just sound like I think I'm ""superior"" or something. But that's really not it. I just make the best possible decisions to avoid mistakes. It's easy for me."
19,"Since I was intentionally initiated of DID alters by my abusers into my mind ever since early childhood, the storing of memories is completely different than adults permanently. Adults remember memories in fading effects, but when a little child was inflicted of trauma severe enough, it can fragment the mind, creating a time-warp effect. This was when my countless of multiple identities were created, each has their own distinctive biographical memories, experiences and personalities. It means, I am being a toddler, child, teenager and an adult at the same time.

The traumatic memories inflicted upon me were in an infinite series, that I would die by being overclocked in my mind, if all of my walls would be opened, turning from multiple streams of consciousness into a single stream, without anyone killing me nor myself committing suicide. Think about a low-capacity computer that is being overloaded. I have been through hell and back."
20,"if you have one alter who was the main host for a period of your life and had a RL friend in that period but then there was a falling out...how do you deal with it if that alter has gone inside and refuses to engage with the RL person? .. but other alters/hosts don't have all the information on the relationship or about the person (so they don't slip up by missing important dates or information etc cos RL person doesn't know alter they see as 'their friend' is a multiple?)

Telling the person isn't an option, things end up on social media too easily and we're an highly covert system (even family haven't been told)."
21,Sometimes I am thrown out of my train of thought and feel that all things around me are out of my hand. I am in MY body but it isn't mine in any way that matters. There are things bigger than me happening all around me and I am just an animal made aware of its existence.
22,"Discovering information about passive influence of alters has been the missing link for me. There’s no doubt whatsoever that many of my responses are influenced by my alters without there being a full ‘switch’ but I’ve never found literature about this until today.

Another member here wrote about it saying that passive influence is more common than actual switching and I have to agree, at least in my case.

There have been plenty of times in my life where I’ve acted totally out of character. Behaviour that’s completely uncommon for me that I’ve been most embarrassed about. Not to claim that all my unwanted actions were a case of passive influence but some, definitely.

23,"So I am under a lot of stress at the moment (university, lack of communication from uni, covid, worying about family and covid, i moved house, my grandma has been diagnosed with dementia, i am visiting family over xmas and have deadlines due with no support from university as it is closed etc etc) - and I think it has all built up until I am suddenly experiencing awful anxiety. Not only anxiety but I feel completely disconnected from the world. I feel like I'm not really here every day it's almost as if I am dreaming. I am staying with my Mum and I get so irritable when she talks to me, I can't concentrate on what she is saying and I just want her to shut up and I snap. She doesn't look real either. Then I get so upset and feel guilty and cry. Sometimes when she is talking to me I'm so out of it, I feel like I can't take in what she's saying. My mind is elsewhere. I'm thinking of so many other things I think. It all makes me panic, its so distressing. Before I came to visit I was feeling sort of stressed but stable and definitely not like this. I'm hoping when I go home that I will feel better but I am also worried that I won't feel better and will be isolated which won't help me at all.

Has anyone experienced the not feeling real and the extreme irritability?  I experienced the not feeling real when I was about 12 and was going through a lot of stress, my dad told me it was mild depersonalisation (he is a RMN) and he told me to lie in bed, breathe and repeat to myself 'I am really here' and in all fairness, it worked but it isn't working this time but it is a lot worse."
24,"Hey, my name is Remus and about 2 weeks ago I took too much of my thc edibles and got too “high” and now I don’t feel real and can’t sleep. It is slowly getting better but 2 weeks ago I was in a bad state. I kinda feel a bit high  all the time but I’m not. What is going on? It’s really scary and I’m struggling everyday. I’m having dreams about my high like panic dreams. Any advice would be greatful 
Many thanks"
25,"Ok so this has only happened a couple times. I'm stumped. I went on Google and took some dissociation test that was probably not legitimate but the questions did make sense and all of the things added up started to make a bit click in my head. I've always just viewed myself as forgetful, with selective hearing. Ha! I'm almost 30, female. I've had a LOT of negative things happen in my life. I don't want to go into great detail I want to make this as short as I can. From what I've heard from other people who have borderline personality disorder and from a lot of research...it resembles my problems more than any mental health disorder I've heard of. I have had a couple of ""episodes"". The first one: I am a nail technician, I was home doing my sister in law's nails. All of a sudden I felt I had no control of my hands. it was a struggle for me to make them do what I needed. I was twisting my feet trying to ground myself to make my arms do what I was trying to tell them to do. I didn't feel faint or anything like that but it scared the hell out of me. Second: Fast forward a couple months. I'm at home alone on the couch. I don't know if I was triggered by something on television but I all of a sudden felt like I was ""gone"" almost light headed. Everything almost gets foggy. It scared me so bad, I already have paranoia most of the time. So I panic I think I'm going to drop dead right there. I called my boyfriend and told him I felt strange and I was scared. He calmed me down and I was ok. Now third: This one was yesterday. Similar to the last I felt light headed and gone, everything got almost hazy. This time though I noticed that my hearing was different. Almost blocked. Again I think I'm going to die and call my boyfriend. I laid down and tried to calm myself and it eventually passed. I'm scared I'm having mini strokes or something, I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm terrified."
26,"Hello. I have posted on these forums before regarding depression and anxiety. My ordeal was triggered by one pill of expired SSRI medication. That night, I experienced severe nausea and headache but it went away the next morning. Five days later, the first symptom I experienced was intense derealization. It was very sudden. It felt like my surroundings weren't real and I wasn't absorbing them. Also the coloration of my room was off and dull and I began having existential thoughts about reality and existence. I impulsively began waving my arm behind my head, suddenly realizing all humans can only look forward and not backward and feeling intense discomfort over this seemingly obvious fact. I began staring outside my window looking at the houses across the street, trying to decide if they were real or just some simulation inside my head. I questioned reality. It was uncomfortable and disorienting. At its peak, I began questioning my memories and whether or not they were genuine. A few days passed and the derealization subsided, but those symptoms were replaced by intense anxiety, rumination, and depression. 

I'm convinced this is all caused by SSRI (anti-depressant) withdrawal. I've never had these symptoms before, except for moderate anxiety, which is what my medication is supposed to treat. All my symptoms seem to fall under SSRI withdrawal and even the timeline itself (5 days) follows from what I've read.

Are derealization and anxiety intertwined? I'm back on my medication, and my anxiety is ebbing, but there is a nagging feeling of derealization lingering in the back of my head. I stare at certain objects and furniture items in my house, just to make sure the derealization is gone. It seems like more of a fear or anxiety of derealization but I think there might be lingering effects until my anxiety is almost totally gone. 

Please, can anyone confirm if derealization is tied to anxiety and/or depression? The mind trickery on my memories is particularly deflating, depressing, and exhausting. Also, has anyone else experienced derealization or any dissociative disorder triggered by medication? I feel better now than I did two weeks ago, but I'm worried that this experience has left a permanent change on my psyche. Please, any information, advice, response helps. I've felt almost hopeless through all this."
27,is DID just daydreaming .....daydreaming in the sense that youre just not toally aware of the present and you just drift off in to dream mode
28,"Hi again 

I think I've posted before but can't remember?? 

I seem to have 'different versions of me' rather than completely different alters. but some seem to be able to 'sneak out' without the main host at the time realising. 

We are a covert system and seem to have had 3 main ANP's over our life (to deal with 'public life - going to college, work etc) but have others 'inside' that were originally remembered as 'imaginary friends' when we were younger.  

We had been fine but after reaching the peri menopause period of the bodies life and then being isolated for a year due to covid (and needing to shield) the regular host/ANP seems to have vanished as no longer needed (no work/appointments to attend for months) and we can seem to be an entirely different person everyday or change throughout the day. 

Is this a 'mid life crisis' thing? or related to the menopause?  or just due to the isolation? (we're hoping to return to getting out and about once we've been vaccinated). 

Anyone had this with more frequent switches at midlife/menopause phase of life? ..or struggling with similar issues as a due to shielding alone for a year etc?

Thanks"
29,"Good morning everyone, nice to be here.
I wanted to discuss an experience i regularly had as a child, by the way I'm now 49!
The experiences were extremely distressing and I guess I'm trying to understand what was happening. From my interest in MH and as a MHFA, and my subsequent reading, it seems a good idea to finally try and describe the experiences and discover what was happening to me.
Only at night as a child from the age of 6 or 7, I experienced a feeling of sinking into my bed, as if the bed was swallowing me whole. I experienced loud noises and parents who were trying to comfort me seemed to be moving incredibly quickly, even thought they were stationary. I lost sense of perspective, so my arms would appear incredibly long or far away. Some items would appear larger or smaller than they should be, so for example a parent may appear in the far distance even they were in the same room. The whole experiences were deeply upsetting as it was difficult to describe what was happening to me a child. I eventually out grew it, by my late teens early 20's.
Any thoughts on maybe what I was experiencing?
Much appreciated all,"
30,"Hello everyone! 

I'm new here but wanted to ask your thoughts on what I am experiencing. Of course I am right now awaiting for professional therapy to help me identify it officially but its too long from now for me to patiently wait and do nothing. 

To the point: I've been having toughts of other people (imaginary) in my life since very early childhood. I remember just very few exact moments for the every year of most of my life and not much more. Recently I've been having gender and sexuality crisis as well as identity crisis that's reoccurring since I think always. I always when I think or talk to myself and other voices (they do not come from outside the head but just like my toughts) I will refer to me as to ""us"". Sometimes I lose control of my body and it does things that I do not intend on doing and I can just watch from inside. Few months ago I started seeing this voices inside me as full on people with exact looks and personality and likes and dislikes etc. Few days ago I started being open to my friends about me feeling like other people every so often and since that time I feel free and great when I can refer to my names as to which person I feel like and I'm sure I'm that person. They (people inside me) can finally behave as they want and as they would like to present themselves to my friends and we are discovering new things about all of us everyday. Most of us have slight amnesia after changing the person controlling body (we remember like what happened in last few hours but it becomes more and more blurry and its always like watching a movie instead of your memories and after some time we almost can't remember a thing from the other person time out. 

Of course I DON'T WANT TO look for diagnose here. I just want some clues as to what it can be. Sorry for the editing I wrote it on the phone. 

Sending love to all of you!"
31,"TW // drugs and related trauma

Hi, first of all I've never used a forum before so bear with me. I'm nearly 19, have a boat load of diagnoses you don't wanna hear about and I don't wanna explain right now, but here's some context for my question.

In november 2019 I had a panic attack while I was high, having mixed substances, it lasted 17 straight hours and I haven't been able to feel grounded in reality since. I've been working on it with my therapist, but thus far I've been completely unable to stop the dissociation even for a short period. I've tried several different types of therapy and I'm not ready to give up yet, but I'm starting to lose hope, I can't quite remember what it's like /not/ being dissociated anymore. My short term memory and attention span have also taken a huge hit. I guess my questions are: is there anyone out there who's been able to fully recover from this type of constant dissociation? How did you do it, and how long did it take? And if you didn't, how did you learn to cope with it?"
32,"a lot of the time i look in the mirror and think ‘ that’s not me’ 

i don’t know who i am anymore. 

i have these worlds of make believe in my head that i go to when i’m sad and i don’t think it’s normal, i make up whole new identities and personalities for myself, it’s when i feel the most like me. 

sometimes i sit and cry because i remember that i dream of happiness and a happy family but it’ll never happen and i get sad because my life is so horrible that i have to make up a new one. 

i’m completely out of it. in public, at the dinner table, with people i know, i feel as if i’m faking it. 

like nothings real anymore, nothing i do or say is real anymore. 

and i just completely zoned out when i’m with other people, i’m so stuck in my own head. 

i usually spend most of my day writing, reading and watching tv shows that i love, i’ve completely lost my sense of self because the only thing that gets me through the day is the made up movies and tv shows and books inside my head and i find it so sad."
33,"Hello, I’m new to the forum, here as I’m experiencing dissociation as a response to childhood trauma. I’m pretty sure it’s dissociation as I often feel like I’m floating away from my body or behind a screen. My psychologist agrees with me and we’re working on this.
But lately it’s been getting much worse in frequency and to the point where I find it very hard to move during an episode and impossible to talk. It’s very scary not being able to talk.  I was hoping that there would be others around who have had this during dissociation who could offer their experiences - I’m feeling very alone with it at the moment!"
34,"So I'm not sure if this is depersonalization let me identify it moderators. Due to covid our health care in this state has become very poor. You only get 5 min video call which is a shame. So I find it hard to cope with reality at times. I have this different version of me I like better. He's a rap star, has girls ,jewelry and what every player in the hip hop game could want. However I don't impersonate him he just exists inside my mind. I don't even talk about him to anyone I know. Am I losing it at all? Or am I just coping with harsh reality in today's America? Am I ok?"
35,"Hello :) 

Around November I started meditating everyday- only for about 20 minutes- but I was happy and thinking it would be good for my health. I started to do guided chakra meditations and each time it would come to my third eye chakra, I was making the mistake (I now realise) of forcefully concentrating very hard on that area. It would kind of vibrate and feel weird in my head and after the meditation I would feel really dazed. After a few weeks of this, I noticed that whenever I went outside I was verry sensitive to light and my vision started to blur. Eventually I was getting this feeling all the time, even indoors, where I feel totally detached from myself. It's almost like feeling drunk all the time. Everything is so weird and it doesn't even feel like I'm living in reality. When talking with people I start getting really paranoid that I'm not making sense and I can't even focus on them properly. It's like I'm looking at the world from under water. I feel a pressure in my head and recently my ears have been constantly ringing. It's driving me crazy. It's been about 6 weeks now and I have these symptoms from the moment I wake up to when I sleep again so there's no respite. 

I have been to the doctor and had a comprehensive blood test but they couldn't find anything and she's reluctant to send me to a neurologist and basically told me to come back in a month if it doesn't go away. She mentioned depersonalisation as a possible explanation but I don't think I have been particularly stressed. The meditation thing I can see as quite an obvious correlation but of course I could be wrong and this is a random neurological issue- but maybe I triggered that with the meditation?? Has anyone had any experience with this or could offer any advice to me? I fear I will never feel normal ever again. 

Maybe I just sound like I'm crazy 🤪

Thank you for reading!"
36,"Hello 
I'm hoping to get some advise on what the name is of what I'm experiencing and what can be done about it as I am presuming it's not normal but o have no idea where to turn.

I'm an extremely passive person and usually avoid conformation at all costs. Over the years I have been working on this issue slowly.

However on multiple occasions when a confrontation happens which i am not expecting I seem to just zone out. A colleague even commented it was like I wasn't even in the room.  Afterwards I'm left with very little memory of what has happened.

 This occured yesterday however I can remember exactly what was said but did not stand up for myself as I ""zoned out"". I'm left absolutely infuriated at myself for this. What is happening to me and is there a way I can ensure I ""stay grounded"" and ""in the moment"" as to enable myself to act properly in future?"
37,"Hey guys! I'm new here - 21 year old college student from Minnesota! It's a relief to finally be a part of a forum and conversation with people struggling from the truly indescribable confusion and horror of dissociating. I began writing this thinking that I would try and get advice or solutions for my health but I think I can really only find answers for what happened to me in the physical health field. I think it's important for me to share my story and feel validated by others who are experiencing the same thing when doctors don't always believe me. I want to help others with anything beneficial I have learned the past 15 months in case that could make a difference in someone's life. 

Here's my story (I apologize for the length, I try and keep it brief but it always feels like I'm omitting important details):

I’ve been dealing with a strange and awful undiagnosed gut condition for the past 15 months. I took the last semester off from school but I feel like I haven't really been there since the first half of my sophomore year, before this all began. My classmates are going to be seniors in the fall yet I still feel like I should be in my second or third year because it's all just a blur of pain and depression. I have struggled with social anxiety since age 4 and had selective autism in preschool and kindergarten. It improved in first grade, although it wasn't until college when I felt comfortable contributing to class discussions or asking questions. I was always shy and introverted, and didn't have a huge amount of friends, but I guess I didn't realize how much of my behavior was rooted in anxiety. In 7th grade I lost most of my friends and also experienced bullying for the first time and this really set my anxiety off. High school I did well academically, but struggled making friends or joining clubs until senior year and I missed out on a lot. I was always extremely tense and never seemed happy but I never considered going to a therapist or taking medication when I now wish I had. Beginning college opened me up in a lot of ways and I finally initiated more relationships, but I didn't realize that my social anxiety/mild OCD was turning into more generalized anxiety. During the school year, there was truly never a moment when my shoulders were relaxed or that I felt I wasn't being watched and analyzed by others, and my heart would beat at random times. I felt unsafe when working a fairly simple office job at my school. 

This all continued to build up, and I finally experience derealization/depersonalization for the first time two Decembers ago. During winter break, I saw something upsetting on my phone that made me break down, and suddenly I felt numb and I laid on the bed for 3 hours, texting friends that I was scared and didn't know what happened. It went away, but a month later came back post wisdom tooth surgery when I was on antibiotics and had my most severe anxiety attack yet. I felt nauseous, had no appetite or energy, didn't feel like a human being or like myself, felt sad and confused. I then got a case of the flu which set things off even more. Since the flu January of 2018, I have had extreme stomach pain/burning/cramping/lack of appetite/acid reflux, and the worst symptom has been brain fog. My brain fog takes the form of extreme dissociation with no mental or physical health doctor has seemed to understand. My therapist believes my dissociation is all anxiety based and not related as much to my gut, while my GI drs know what brain fog is but have never seen it be so extreme as it is in me. My head and gut have become completely linked, I cannot have a clear mind or escape the feelings of depression when my gut is in pain. 
  
My condition got increasingly worse after the winter and I wasn’t able to function, I couldn’t think or do schoolwork, I had no emotional connection with friends or family and was scared and paranoid most of the time. While I have struggled with anxiety for a large part of my life, I had never struggled with depression before or had any serious health concerns. I developed some asthma when walking, I lacked the energy to do anything, and I was scared of all foods thinking it would worsen the pain somehow. I have been to multiple GI doctors, Mayo Clinic, Infectious Diseases dr, Psychiatrist, Neurologist, and physical therapist. All of my friendships are struggling or falling apart because after 15 months it's too exhausting and painful to fake my existence and voice and laugh with friends. I struggle carrying on conversations with my parents, let alone strangers at coffee shops, relatives, teachers, or friends.

I have been tested for truly everything - Celiac, Lyme's, Sjogren's, Diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis, had an endoscopy, MRI, etc. I am now on my fourth anti depressant, which is Effexor. I have tried acupuncture, massage, epsom balts, teas, walking, sauna, and have found no relief. The only things that have helped are Probiotics - they seem to get my system moving and create a reaction that clears my stomach for maybe a week, and also my mind (I can laugh again, make plans, listen to music) and suddenly my body gets used to them and I go back to the fog.

I've really lost hope and can't think of any other tests that could be done. Talk therapy and mental health strategies have not helped me because this is all rooted in my gut and not my mind (although I have developed depression on top of this.) I guess I'm wondering if anyone else with dissociation struggles has also experienced gut pain or IBS. I knew the gut and brain were connected, but it feels like my gut is controlling my soul a lot of the time. I want to go out and live a normal life but I just can't force myself to care about anything when this fog is surrounding me at all times, along with extreme pain.

Sorry again for the length of this!! It's hard to relive in some ways, but I also think it's important to put my words on paper as I really lack any kind of identity and solidifies that I still have a voice in a way. Any tips/similar experiences/coping techniques would be hugely appreciated, thank you :)"
38,"Dissociation 
“Disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions, and identity.”

Honestly I can’t say I can remember a time I haven’t had this. It varies in strength from each day but in reality my memories are depleting due to the fact that I’m starting a new chapter in my life. My surroundings are definitely different my actions are definitely different so that make my identity different? I feel like I’m starting to get a little bit better at this but the drastic changes I make throughout the day make me nervous. It’s almost like a dirty confession thinking about all the small mistakes or glitches that I can make changes to. Very tiring and stressful. But it’s like working a job, you’ll get satisfaction out of it. 

🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠"
39,"I know you probably get these all the time so thank you for your patience. In the last few weeks, especially after talking to someone I'm close with who's a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I've realized that I likely have memories I'm not remembering. I remember a handful of small instances of cocsa and one small event with a grown up family friend. But because of other symptoms I have it seems like there's stuff I'm not remembering.

Last night I was already not feeling good. My chronic pain was acting up and I was struggling with some suicidal intrusive thoughts. We were laying in bed and all of a sudden I thought of something (which I no longer remember what it was. I have this thing where I can temporarily make myself forget what I'm upset about to help me calm down but this time I didn't remember it later) and my anxiety spiked and I started feeling uncomfortable and restless. I felt dizzy and light headed and when I looked at my arm it didn't feel attached to me. Overall I felt really uncomfortable in my body and anxious....

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions and I'll try and answer. Thank you again for helping me when I know what I'm going through is nothing compared to a lot of you. 💕"
40,"Hello other person reading this, and whoever else  :)  

My version of reality is different to almost everyone I know bar one other person who has schizophrenia, his hallucinations are mainly external, whereas mine are internal usually.

I am aged 25, and actually think I'm happy for the first time in my life and wanted to post it. If you are not feeling it then I'm hoping I can give some advice/experience.

I have recently changed medications from aripiprazole 3mg to 2mg 
flupentixol (A LOT OF TIME PASSED BETWEEN MEDICATIONS).

After years of psychology, psychotic episodes and general day to day life, I have labelled myself as BPD (borderline personality disorder) and who knows (literally) what else myself could be classed as.

To date, I know in my mind is me, the suicidal/depressed personality, and the angry/rage personality, there are other personalities but at the moment I'm stable and unable to really specifically label the personalities in the corners of my consciousness.

I am hoping others who may have some insight into this could give me some advice on how to keep my personality stable enough to live a full life?

p.s. I switched personalities/memories/emotion sets several times writing this"
41,I've experienced derealization pretty consistently for about 6 years now. Recently it's been really screwing with my relationships. I have a really hard time making the connection that my memory of someone actually shows how they feel. I have a hard time seeing people for who they are because there's some disconnect in my brain. My memories of them feel completely separate to who they are and how they feel about me. Has anyone else felt this? It's making me incredibly insecure in my relationships and trusting that the people I care about value me.
42,"I get deja vu often. More so in recent years. I mostly enjoy it in a strange way and recognise when it’s happening and just go through the motions. Recently though it’s changed. There’s been a mixture between deja vu, my dreams and my real life. One recent event has really confused me and made me question the possibility of multiple realities. I was in the kitchen, making dinner and listening to music from the TV. A thought entered my mind. “I must get that CD from my mums car because there’s that one great song on there I like.” Then I thought, I don’t have any CDs in my mums car. I hardly ever drive it and have never left any CDs in there. I can’t even use them in her car because it’s a new car. The thing is, I can see the album in my mind, it’s red with a circle in the middle with cartoonish drawings. The song I like is on the 2nd disc about halfway down the playlist. In my reality I have no idea what album this is or what the song is but I have a memory of it and being left in my mums car. Any ideas what’s going on??"
43,I see fake ppl
44,"I’ve often questioned reality and the point of everything. I’ve studied the simulation theory for a few years and sometimes it comes up in my daily life. NPC’s are meant to be part of any simulation or game and recently I’ve met a few people that tick that box. I’m a delivery person and a regular customer only reacts to me if I use certain words, professional words maybe? One instance was I knocked on her door with a parcel and she answered with a smile and said “good morning”. Nothing wrong with that but as a scanned her parcel, the scanner froze so I had to reset it. I joked this always happens in the rain! She stared blankly and looked past me. I said it won’t take long to reset, again no response, just a vacant stare. Finally it reset and I scanned it and gave her the parcel. She snapped out of it and said “oh thank you! Horrible weather today isn’t it” then wished me a good day and closed the door! For those few minutes it felt like the world around me crashed and reloaded lol! There was a very strange vibe. I get those feelings of disconnect often, like the world is just a form of simulation and I’m lost in it. I hope that makes sense! Has anyone else come across a person like this? A possible npc?"
45,"I don’t see why I have to do anything for anyone, and yet all I want to do is make everyone happy. I think about doing things to myself, others, and even my surroundings. Nothing harmful but just to feel like I’m actually alive. Everyone I know and see are saying there sad but I feel so alone when I feel like this. I know it’s not just me but at the same time I feel like the main character and nothing at all. I feel like I’m losing myself to these negative emotions, until all that’s left is hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt hurtttttt. My friends say I’m funny, but I can’t keep a steady weight. I want to feel pretty but I forget to brush my teeth and shower some days or eat or stop eating. Sometimes I eat until my stomach hurts other times it just hurts to eat or want to eat. I don’t think I’m fat. I’m really fucking skinny. I wish I could float away."
46,"Does anyone feel like you are just a robot without your self? Can you judge in the morning after sleep if you slept all night and slept or you have no feeling? Can you clearly remember what happened in the morning or, for example, remember on Friday what you did last weekend? Thanks (I write via google translator, so sorry for the mistakes)"
47,"I've been dealing with what I thought was Depersonalization Disorder for 1 and 1/2 years now. But in the last few months I have been at the er/hospital and thought I was having an episode and found out that my sugar was very low. I was told I was borderline hypoglycemic. At my last psych hospital visit, upon getting the results from my blood work they rushed over and made me drink about 6 cups of juice. I was told my sugar was 39. After drinking the juice it then shot up to 199. Here I thought I was just having an episode of depersonalization. So while in the hospital they were checking my sugar every 4 hours and whenever I felt funny. About 50% of the time when I felt like an episode was starting my sugar was in the 40's. 

Has anyone with Depersonalization ever also have hypoglycemia or diabetes? Also if you suffer from it you might want to have your sugar levels checked. Couldn't hurt right? I go to the dr today to discuss the issue and will update. Take care, Cyn"
48,"I'll get it out of the way and say that I feel bad ""using"" this forum as a tool to vent. With one thing and another escaping my attention this year, I don't have the same practice with my positive coping skills, and I don't have the same opportunities to safely socialize.

My main issue currently is stress, turned up all the way to panic levels, crying spells several times a day, feeling hearing seeing tasting STATIC. Racing thoughts, confusion, anger, hopelessness, I'm on track to go back to school in the Spring but I get so quickly and easily frustrated and vexed. I give up on projects and re start them two or three times in a day. Even today, I've made phone calls and filled out paperwork and made appointments and I want to feel GOOD about having accomplished anything at all, accomplished like I used to feel when I was doing good in my life like this. But those victories are short lived because in my mind the happiness at completing a task is drowned by this numbing dread that despite anything and everything I do, none of it is going to matter because I'm still like 8 people trapped in one body and we all fight all the freaking time anyways.

I'm feeling this rift between the different parts of what make me a whole person, and I hesitate to talk to anyone because when I talk about my... different selves, I just get this look, and people bounce.

I'm on track with my school's Counselling and Psych Services in the spring, I just have to make it til then. I'm getting my insurance worked out as well, that's my anxiety regarding going back to any Doctor visits, because I can't afford it until/unless I get back on Medicaid.

Tl;DR I'm a bunch of people who are stressed TF out and I appreciate y'all for being here"
49,"I mean, heard of an individual case. I almost wish I had one. Maybe then there could be a cure."
50,"Hi I wanted to know everybody's thoughts about this because clearly I cannot categorize myself as DID but still I do see some characteristics like DID in me. I have been even jokingly taunted by friends that I have multiple personality disorder because of how different I can be at diff times or that I am so lost or confused person (they have no idea I am struggling with dissociation).. however I don't have any blackouts (like usually how it happens to DID patient when a different part is taking over).. I just feel like I do have parts but not to the extent where I blackout.. it feels more like a context switch.. like suddenly I am on a diff wavelength on which I feel different, think different and talk differently and sometimes I forget what I was thinking just before the context switch.. I am still in the process of understanding what I am going through (well it took me more than 20 yrs to know that it is called dissociation in the first place).. I have recently even started talking to a therapist about this.."
51,"So, I’m diagnosed with bipolar 2, ptsd, anxiety. History of self harm, severe depression. I’ve never mentioned this other thing that I experience to doctors because I guess I’m afraid to talk about it. I don’t know, also it doesn’t happen very often, so I ignore it until it happens again. But it bothers me a lot and I dwell on it for a long time afterwards. At the same time though, I quickly forget what it really feels like. My memory of what actually is going on during the episode quickly fades away. The last time it happened a couple weeks ago I wrote down what happened. This is what I wrote 

in the bathroom putting hair up. All of a sudden it feels like the earth is very loud but muffled at the same time. Everything around me doesn’t feel real.it feels like my head is going to explode because memories or voices are going really fast in my head. So fast that it feels like the inside of my mind is spinning. Spinning and making noise at the same time. Then it stops almost as fast as it started. 

every time it happens my knee jerk reaction is that I HAVE to put music on. I need to have noise on to drown out what is going on in my head. After it’s over, I’m always tired. 

So what the fuck is this?"
52,"i hate feeling this way i am having newer and newer problems lately like i don't feel like myself everyday, i feel like everyone is against me, feeling like i'm not the person i am anymore i don't associate with my family because with trust issues i can't trust my own family or myself, what is the use of living if i problems for me just keep piling up i can't take it anymore i am talking to my doctor this month to maybe check me out again to see whats going on because i can't take it anymore i feel like i am going down a rabbit hole each day trying to figure myself out and i need to know what the meaning of my life is before i go to the hospital to get euthanized."
53,"Tough to talk about. 
Question - does early dissociation from traumatic events make it more likely to do the same with events older in life? I have other diagnoses so l’m asking to understand more about this aspect of my condition. I am not confusing them."
54,"I'm going to do the magnetic ressonsance, but am already scared, since the electroencephalogram, in which I allucinated, and to get to the clinic went through hell! First, I didn' t know were I was in a well knowed place, went to were I wasn't suppose to go and afterwards gave all my coins to the beggar who helped me take the ticket!! While doing the test, I talked to my mom and she answered, talked to the technician and uttered some noises. When she finished it, I asked her, ""did you hear anything from me, did I uttered a sound?"", she said ""no, it was all in your head"". I got home wanting to cry, but then I became emotionally numbed and irritated to every sound and vision. Went to my room and shoegazed for hours. I must wait for the results, but this doesn't seem like schizoaffective anymore."
55,"It was a mess yesterday! I had an EEG and I had to go to Lisbon. Things seemed fine till I got the first challenge. Buy a train ticket in a machine. Arrived at Lisbon and it was hell before I got to the clinic. Everything seemed like a dream and I was incapable of complex thought. Stopped at the wrong stations, had to be aided to by another ticket, tried to get one to were I was, etc. I saw the signs but couldn't get the meaning! As I'm diagnosed as a schizoaffective bipolar type for years, and took a lot of antipsychotics, I'm afraid of having other conditions."
56,"Firstly, I have no idea who I am but I assume this is the BPD. I know as a kid, the most I was ever in trouble for was chatting too much, I was blunt though not overly social which I consider down to my late ASD diagnosis. I loved and valued my friends over everything, I was daring, a bit of a prankster, mischievous etc. I was proud of my physical strength, creative and eager to face the world.

And now, I don't know. I often feel 'not human' making it impossible to talk to anyone new despite trying to make new friends, I constantly feel 'below' them and not worthy of talking to actual humans because themselves and their lives are so much more than mine. I turn it into a joke because I don't see any other way to deal with this.

I don't have many memories of my childhood at all. My memory is shocking, still. Remembering what I did even yesterday, takes a silly amount of thinking and trying to recall, and I still don't always remember.

I don't know how anyone sees me. I couldn't describe myself, physically or who I am inside, as a person. What makes me me. I look in the mirror and a lot of the time, don't recognise myself. I have no idea how friends, family, strangers or ANYONE would describe me.

When volunteering with the horses, up there I am quiet. They know nothing of my mental health, leaving me cringing when an overdose joke is made. I seem quiet up there, my voice becomes hard to use, I can't talk to people unless they talk to me.

I guess my family knows me as me, but whose that?

Drs, therapists, psychiatrists, I am so numb. A common feeling anyway (mixed in with the high and low swings of BPD) but again, I can barely use my voice. Therefore I don't get heard, or listened to. I remember telling once of an incident with a police and the nurse was shocked I had that in me. I don't know what I have in me.

I am different all day, everyday. I don't think I could ever describe myself, nor compare myself to 'real' people because I don't feel like one. aghh. My memory is non existent. Sometimes even big events escape me. Nothing is ever clear."
57,"Hi All,


First of all I'm new to the forum and If eel for you all going through your struggles. This shit is tough ad thank goodness for these kinds of forums where we can help each other (hopefully i can help people on here too).

So I've been really struggling recently with some symptoms which I will make a more detailed post about when I can get my head in gear to do so but I'd like to share one symptom which has been really hard for me.


Here goes...
I've been getting this feeling which comes on and sort of zaps me out of reality, where it's like I'm losing sense of reality o can’t process the reality around me, like I'm in the matrix or one of those robots in the show westworld which has malfunctioned and realised it may be a robot, and so now it can't make sense of anything.

I've looked into derealisation but it really doesn't feel like that as it doesn't feel like a dream and things around me don't look weird or fake...it's as if I can't understand reality or existence.

These feelings started in the last year...at first it was like brief episodes that I'd get at night when trying to sleep. I'd jump out of bed and try to ground myself in reality by looking at my surroundings or calling my mum...not sure if it helped but the feeling would disappear and I could understand the world and would get my awareness back...these 'episodes' got more frequent and longer.
I don't know what is going on and I don't even know if any of this is making any sense. I saw a phycologist for a cbt session and I think even he was struggling to make sense of it. IT's like a feeling of decreases consciousness or something. even while I type this I feel weird and ""out of it"" or disconnected or disassociated or derealised or whatever

I guess I thought I would write this to see if anyone else has felt anything similar?

Thank you all"
58,and sometimes I wonder if I actually do exist
59,"Ive been stuck on this for months now and i believe its actual nonsense but i literally cannot stop thinking about it cause im afraid of it being true in some way. Basically after a couple years dealing with depersonalization and derealization, i was doing better for a while then started having those existential thoughts again and also feeling like like im disappearing/not here feeling. Anyway the thought is wondering if anything actually exists... like i have comtemplated this day and night and the more i try to ignore, the more anxiety i get about it. The only relief i got was just chalking it up to nonsense and leaving it be but i keep getting reminded about it and how it so hard to even prove anything is real. Like would it be possible everything doesnt exist? this evolved in my mind to the question ""am i aware of nonexistent things? is anything real/existent?"" it doesnt make any sense i guess. Its gotten a little easier with time but i also feel like im going insane."
60,"I had an episode, only a few hours, of derealisation last week when I was somewhere I hadn’t been before. I have only had a handful of experiences of derealisation over a few years so consider myself lucky, but I noticed that each one of them occurred when I was somewhere new/with new people/in a situation I hadn’t experienced before.

I wondered if this theme is something others have experienced?"
61,"So i last month i experienced 24/7 derealization which was really hard so over time i developed these philosophical thoughts like what is existence? Do i really exist? Am i dead? What are humans? What is life after death .....
The feeling of detachment is mostly gone but it's still there is there way to deal with these thoughts?"
62,I sleep all the time nothing seems real I'm ready to admit myself I take Zoloft sertaline and lamotigue I'm so scared any advice would be appreciated.
63,"Hello everyone, i have suffered from depression and crippling anxiety for a while now and i feel like things are becoming even worse as time go on and that thing will just go downhills until the end.

  I am a guy who never made real friends and just got his family to support him and even then i don’t really connect with them, i do love them but i can’t be honest or have a serious talk with them so at most we have small task.

The person i love the most in this world is my Mother, very recently her health really took a hit since she had a AIT (mini stroke) and a pulmonary embolism and is currently at the hospital and it isn’t really kind on me, without her it’s simply impossible for me to go on but i’m not here to speak about that even if it’s linked.

The type of anxiety i have could be called pure existential dread: i simply can’t understand the world we live in, or at least while i understand it i just can’t connect with it, because of that i alwyas feel this feeling of being crushed and had to develop way to cope with this, it’s about to get weird.

So some peoples to cope with illegal drug or alcohol and while i do like a drink i don’t have that kind of coping mechanisms, instead i tried for a very long time meditation and mental exercise until i was able to forcedly shut down everything which bother me, including things like fear, any bad feelings like some of my anxiety and even a great deal of my own emotions when i just can’t handle things

To do that i created my own variation of the mental vault which i a meditation techniques which is supposed to help deal with traumatic memories or bad thoughts by locking them away in a mental representation of a locked vault, i originally tried to do this exact method but it didn’t really work that much for me, while it did have some results it just wasn’t enough with all the things i have to deal with, so with time i started trying to develop my own variation (which isn’t really that uncommon since the whole vault idea is just the basic generic version of this exercise) until one day something just clicked, why should i try to lock away the bad feelings i have instead of just trying to destroy them?
 
The iron hands were born: the principle isn’t complicated, a lot of things in these kind of mentals exercise is just pure symbolism to help the mind accept it more easily like the whole Vault image because vault are hard to breach and you can lock things in it, i choose hands because of the symbolism of cupped hands which are often used to hold something fragile like a small animals you don’t want to hurt or something which would usually fall out like sand, so if my mental hands were holding something this way then it mean it’s fragile right? Next part was thinking of them as made of iron since it’s a resilient material which can be considered kinda crude or brutish (steel may be more resilient but you need to be more careful to make steel, it’s far less crude then iron and i needed something for a dirty job) so now i had cupped hand made of iron holding into things that i just had to try to crush.

Of course things didn’t quite work out as i intended since apparently the mentals represention of my worries and anxiety can’t simply be destroyed be me imagining hand crushing them, what a surprise!/s

While i didn’t create the magical solution to all my problems i did create the tool that allowed me to hold on as long as i have but not whitout it’s little side effects, when using this i do feel better but can only use this for a while before my mentals image start to crumble and it stop working and the side effect are something that i now start to feel: while looking/crushing my anxiety in my mind i feel more confident but also just colder to everything since it’s seem it have some things of muting effect on my emotions, it’s now to the point that i have to fake every emotion when i use this mental technique and it started to affect them even when i am not using it: i feel like the iron hands forget a body of their own and is now trying to kick my ass with great effects to leave only the emotionless husk behind.

if you found this weird then it’s ok, i just need a place to vent sometime, it make things easier."
64,Does anyone relate to this? Please help. For the last couple of months. I am scared of the very existence of my mind. And that i have a conciousness..and that i think..and how can i be aware of what i think...what is a thought..what is a my mind. Who or what is me...like memories are not ny own. It scares me that i have a mind and memories..its like a demonic awful experience. Please help.
65,"Hi all,

I just want to see if anyone can relate to my issue as I am really struggling atm.

2 and a half years ago I had a pretty bad nervous breakdown Resulting in panic disorder, dpdr disorder and depression. I am just off my antidepressant meds now asmy mental health was in a bad way for almost 2 years straight.

mentally I am better. There’s no more panic attacks and I am more grounded and feeling part of the world around me again, however, I feel I haven’t physically recovered, which is something I haven’t heard about.

just a bit of background I was on sleeping tablets and xanex at night for a year to try sleep. It didn’t help much, then I turned to weed for about 6 months still didn’t help. Then I got pregnant and gave all that up and basically didn’t sleep much at all for the whole nine months. So I got why I was exhausted then. Now I am sleeping finally but I feel physically as bad as ever. My body aches so bad, legs pain, head hurts. All I feel able to do is sleep all the time which is so stressful since I have a new baby and am returning to work soon. I don’t want to live like this forever.

has anyone been through anything similar? Does this chronic fatigue improve after a long stint of sleep disturbance?"
66,"I can't see how CBT can treat dissociation (certainly in my case)?

Opinions?

So cbt changes the thinking process into more productive avenues while my dissociation is a switch, it completely overrides my thinking processes - ? - while I remain very articulate if task driven..? Like an autopilot that takes over when certain stresses flip that switch?

IIts that 'switch' that also gets flipped during episodes of eating (both are linked). In either case when that happens its like watching from the back seat, even emotions obviously expressed are not 'felt'?

So when there is a disconnect between action and reaction, how can cbt possibly help?"
67,"What I'd like to know is if DID goes with dissociating.
If you dissociate do you automatically have DID or are they separate. They are not together

68,"Does anyone else experience this too? I almost don’t mind having bad vision, because life around me seems like more of a blur. It makes it easier to retreat within and daydream, and it certainly makes reality seem less “real”. However, it isn’t always good because I struggle to feel truly present at times."
69,"So I've known my girlfriend for about 4 years now, but me and her had really been in a relationship from February of 2020 to September of 2020. The reason she broke up with me is because she said she was feeling empty and had mood swings on and off and said that she needed to deal with this on her own. That was when I found out that she had depersonalization disorder and bipolar depression. I always knew she was going through some tough times, especially with the abusive family that I've heard about her having to deal with them on a daily basis, but she never mentioned about having these mental health conditions until last month. I've always been worried about what goes on with her and I feel so depressed about not being able to actually be there to help her, implying that me and her have had a long distance relationship; now I'm really deathly afraid as to what is going on with her when she isn't texting me, always constantly worrying whether or not she is taking action on trying to treat her conditions, wondering if she is still thinking about me, and wondering if she is ok. It's killing me that I'm not able to help her enough. All I can do is offer her my love and support for her to be able to conquer her inner struggles, but I feel like it's not enough, especially if I don't know if she is taking any therapy and medications or not. Despite the fact that I know all of the available medications and forms of therapy for her to seek for her conditions and that I give her an infinite amount of love and support for her, I just feel like there is something else missing. If anyone has any idea on how I could help my girlfriend feel like herself again so she can finally feel happiness and affection again, please let me know as soon as possible. Give me any and every bit of advice that I may need to help her (aside from the available treatments that I already know about).
Thank you."
70,My very close friend has been suffering for a very long time with symptoms that I am pretty sure relate to depersonalization and derealization but her parents don’t believe in therapy and mental health struggles. She has never been diagnosed and I am in no place to “diagnose” her as I am not qualified and that would be extremely irresponsible of me but I need to help her. I don’t know what to do. I can’t tell her that I think she is experiencing this because I don’t know how she’ll take it and maybe she’ll think I’m invading her privacy so I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be really appreciated. Thank you.

76,"Hi all,

So.....things have changed dramatically. I have come off my AP (Risperidone) and I am still on Setraline 150mg. Apparently theres no meds to stop my alters and dissociating. I am in a year's waiting list for the dissociation clinic (Lucky me.. and thats only for an assessment.

Stress and Anxiety induces my alters and since Feb 2020 I have been dissociated clean if that makes sense but the stress levels have now rapidly increased. My boss has quit and another colleague is off, leaving me to take a load more work and having a 10% pay cut, with going without apart from Sertaline.

The only safe fail I have is promethazine, which sedates the **** out of me and I'm knocked out for ages.

Recently, I feel very close to dissociating but at the moment I can control it myself enough but do really worry what will happen if I do.

I told my wife to phone the crisis team and police if I do change though. 

My life has really changed, I have no access to money, I am getting divorced for financial reasons but my partner will be staying with me and controlling the money, she hiding the car keys and car documents. So if I do dissociate to an alter no financial damage can be done.

It's a really strange life at the moment..."
77,"Hi I was just looking for some advice really. Me and my partner have been together 20 years and a few years ago he changed and I didn't have a clue what was wrong. A few months ago we found out he has dissociation. The thing is every time he sees his parents he seems to change, his personality changes and he can become very angry.. this has been happening for a while now. He is very close to his parents too so he wouldn't go with no contact but every time he sees or speaks to them he gets triggered. Has anybody else been through this? or anybody who has any advice on the best thing to do?

Thank you"

79,"I don’t know what else to call it. I don’t choose to do it, it just happens. It’s like falling into my brain and being swept away with whatever I’m imagining. My mouth will move with the imaginary words I’m saying and my face will show the expressions. They’re usually conversations with people I know, but not always. Sometimes they’re faceless, nameless people who represent a type of person. I was at my best friend’s house and she asked if I was okay because she could see it happening. She didn’t know what was going on- I just said I was thinking about ignorant people. I kind of was. But I fell into it and didn’t even realize until she said something. I’ve heard of maladaptive daydreaming, but I don’t usually choose to do this. I just end up realizing it’s happening. A couple months ago, it was so bad I kept getting distracted from my tasks at home. I ended up just fidgeting and wandering from room to room until I realized it happening. Doesn’t last long, but they can happen often. I don’t think I’ve brought it up to my therapist yet. Anyone else experience this?"
80,"Hi there,

I am very new here...this is in fact my very first thread.
I have been struggling with depersonalization/derealization from when I was 15 (I had the first episode), but it was on and off my whole life (from when I was 19).
More precisely, I only had episodes of depersonalization/derealization which would scare me to death and I would panic, however I have always mange to distract myself (which in turn switched into the phobia of me staying alone, because I always knew if I stayed alone the depersonalization would happen). 

The past year it has buzzed during the sleep, like I would wake up at night derealized as if I woke up to the real world of emptiness and my whole was a dream, and that experience would scare me to the point where I would start screaming. 

Two weeks ago I got extremely stressed and started having an anxiety...though a week ago I woke up in the middle of the with a panic attack which for the first time in my life made me thoroughly think about my own mortality, which turbed my thinking into extreme awareness of the mortality, to the point where I started question what's the point of anything at all?
Then I started experiencing severe depersonalization and derealization and I am barely holding now. 
Please, someone that has ever gone thorugh the same tell me that I will not lose my mind...

So far I am only taking some Promethazine - antihistamine before a sleep (and I still wake up several times) or during the day if I feel I am getting an anxiety. I have had several sessions with a psychologist but I don't feel we are going anywhere with those sessions.

Please people let me know your suggestions or ideas, because by the end of the day I would appreciate an advice from a person that has actually expertienced this than a psychologist that does not understand how it is to be depersonalized. 

Thank you in advance,
Elena"
81,"Not long ago, I started at a new schooling institution (of which, is not relevant). The commute between this location and my home was at least a good 40 minutes - not something I'm used to. At all. For the last at least 8 years of my life it has been no less than five, so I knew that the new journey would be a..change. Along with the new schooling, of course. 
It would be surreal. And it was. 

But boy, did it hit me hard. For the first two weeks, my memory were barely functioning. It's like my brain just couldn't comprehend the existance of almost anything. Per day, (looking back, because in the state I was in at that time I could not have noticed for myself) I could remember a limit of three thoughts, or interactions. I would ignore anybody who asked me how my day was, not because I was blowing them off but because I simply just couldn't say. Was it bad, good? Who knew. I could only rely on how I felt at that very moment, but even that was hard to focus on because my eyesight would pulse and blur occasionally, making life feel like an illusion. 

Its been almost a year now. My memory has definitely recuperated, seemingly has fixed itself. But not completely. Sometimes I find myself staring at a wall, with my brain completely turned off; or I am fidgeting with something, brain still limp. Repeating things in my head, talking to myself, blurring vision, short attention span. Some of the things I have noticed. 

It's much more toned down now, but I feel for my own sake, I need to know. Is there something wrong with me, or is it nothing to worry about? And if so, what? I really have no idea and I don't want to google-diagnose, but I have nobody I am comfortable talking to (at the moment)."
82,"Hi everyone. I woke up Derealized on Jun 22 and had no idea what was going on. I then obsessed over and continuously researched my symptoms until I found out about Derealization. If I had to guess I would say it was triggered by many traumatic experiences and a panic attack I had while drinking Codeine. I’ve been around and sold drugs for many many years and never experienced a panic attack until I pushed it too far. That’s a short version of my DR story but the reason for my post is to get some answers about my recovery. I’ve gotten to a point to where the only time I feel DR is when I’m alone and can think. At work, with my girl or with my friends I have been able to live in the moment and very rarely feel it. I was wondering if this was a good sign or a bad sign. If it only happens when I’m alone now what should I do? As I’m typing this I don’t feel it too bad, but if I ever pause and think for a few seconds it’s like I can trigger it on my own, and the thoughts flood in “ I’m really alive, I’m really here, how am I controlling myself “ etc. and it causes some DR. I was wondering what I could do to maybe get over the last little hump of recovery."
83,"Hey all, I am not diagnosed so not 100% this is my problem.

But I do get really zoned out and in my head. Sometimes it is really hard to get out. Sometimes an argument with my spouse will bring me back. Is there a simpler way? How do y'all learn to start staying on the ground. Is there an easier way for me to come out of my head?

And has anyone else experienced this."
84,"It seems that I can't get over some problem overnight, so I try to cope in this kind of way. I just feel that people around my place can't be trusted.. fake rumors here, fake rumors there. Some people find joy in tormenting the feelings of others. I just feel so wronged by them. It's so unfair. I wasn't able to sleep properly because I really wanted to show those people that they're wrong!

I hate it when I struggle like this."
85,"Hi. How you deal when your brain is off? Last times my mind tends to be stuck or hyperactive, now that I think about it I ever be like that. I dont want to fall in drugs"
86,"I sometimes completely forget people I have known for months to years, this usually happens after a strong emotional experience with them before not seeing them for a long period of time. I either remember them in a tsunami of memories after a short period of time of seeing them in person again or it can take a long time if nothing triggers my memory of them. I have pretty terrible facial recognition and name recall, but it seems to be something beyond that. It can be like they've been completely erased from my memory. Has anyone ever had experiences similar to this?"
87,"There are times when I feel my mind taking a back seat to my body and actions. I do stuff that I have no control over, and all I can do are watch."
88,"Is being selfless benificial?Because im entirly selfless. Often times i place thing in the subliminal, due to this aspect of being set apart. How do i start being more for myself? It must have started with my fears and it will not end this way. If only i realized that being more in touch is so crucial.. It seems my self compitence is in the guitter."
89,"I have a really hard time communicating because when I speak, I find that the I am detached from the words I say. In other words, I don't understand what I'm saying, even though I am technically speaking. This makes it so difficult to speak more than one sentence, because after one, I'm already lost. Anyone know what this could be?"
90,"I was diagnosed with Depersonalisation around October/November in 2019.  Depersonalisation is an anxiety disorder and a quite disturbing one at that. It can often leave you feeling detached from yourself and reality around you. Some people get Depersonalisation or aspects of it when they feel extreme anxiety, which could last a short while. But some people, like myself, can have it constantly for months, maybe years. I have seen some cases online where people have said they have had it for 10 years and it’s still going on. But you can’t let other people’s experiences of Depersonalisation distort your own view, because everyone’s is unique to themselves. If you have it of course.

Also, Derealisation is very similar to Depersonalisation, but I have not real come across any differences between them. I have seen two professionals in the process, and one diagnosed me with Depersonalisation and the other with Derealisation.

The Reason I writing this is for people who have been in the same situation with me. I had scoured the internet in order to find the answer to why I was like this and how I could get out of it so I could feel normal again, so I could feel like myself again. A lot of sites and people’s experiences were helpful and I suggest you read others stuff apart from this. But remember, everyone’s experience of this is unique to them, and yours is unique to you.



I’m going to start off with a bit of back story to myself. I finished A-level when I was 19 and when straight into University the following September. My first year of Uni was pretty amazing. Being free from my parents was excellent. I was a regular drug user in hash, coke, ket, nos, you name it, I have done everything. Even K-pins, which are for people with seizures. Drugs were fun no doubt about it, but in moderation and only if you feel up to it. But don’t do them too much, I can only express that enough. Don’t not feel pressured by people who do them a lot. Think about yourself first, rather than others. I also drank a lot, I think I developed a drinking problem, I would drink nearly every day, sometimes even in the morning. Which isn’t good at all.

Anyway, my first year at Uni is not important, what important is to know what I was doing at Uni, and how much I was doing it. Which was a lot. Fast track to June after my first year. Normal day in the park, drinking and smoking, when out later to mates bar. Was sniff coke in the toilets. Just seemed like a normal evening, wasn’t even going that heavily compared to other nights out. Went home kinda early to be honest with you. The next day I woke up, boom. That when it started. I can still remember the day exactly, which is common in a lot of cases. I was in bed and everything around me seemed so alien. I felt like I was in a trip. I was so scared and confused to where I was. I’m pretty sure I started drinking to try get rid of this feeling. Didn’t work. From there, I can’t remember too much, but everyday was the same. The constant dread of reality around me. I would look at myself in the mirror and not recognise myself. I didn’t recognise my parents, my sister or even my dog. I truly felt so alone and so scared. I had these constant racing thoughts which would overload my brain to the point I couldn’t think of anything else. The thoughts were mostly existential and about the universe. Questioning reality itself. They were constant, every day, every second. No break. No escape.

I’ve always had anxiety issues. I have even felt this way before, but only for a couple days and after that, I didn’t think anything of it. I had aspects of Depersonalisation in high anxiety situations, but just never acted on it because it only lasted a short while. If I or my parents had spotted it when I was younger, maybe my life would be different. But how could we have known what was to come. It’s a very rare anxiety disorder, which in some ways makes me feel special.

So back to my story. I had this job at a bar in oxford street. Was very busy and very stressful. But it was good to do something, get out the house and distract myself from my thoughts. I wasn’t drinking at this point. Which was good. But one day at work I was alone in the dry room (were you store the drinks) and everything was too much for me, so I backed a cider (my preferred choice of drink) and I felt someone normal. Well I was able to cope. I convinced myself I had a drinking problem (which was true) and the reason I was feeling this way was because of how much I was drinking. I connived myself I was an alcoholic. I ended up drinking constantly at work. Bring my own cider or wine into work until one day I realised what I was doing to myself. I walked out half way through my shift, never to return. I told my parents for the first time about how I was feeling. Was scary, but they reacted well and were very supportive of me. It didn’t change how I felt, or how I was thinking. But I was nice to get that off my chest. I stayed at home and played video games and didn’t drink at all. And then I started my second year at uni. This is were it really began to go down hill.

I was living in a 8 person house in a single bed room. I was a shit hole, but it was nice to go back t Brighton (where I go to university). I was weird because for the first week. I felt alright. I started drinking again, but I felt normal and okay. No idea why. But as soon as I felt good. I got back on the drugs and drink. And by the time Uni started, I was back to thinking my existential thoughts and questioning reality around me. It ended up getting top much, to the point where I dropped out of Uni. My mum was not happy, which didn’t help my anxiety and my Depersonalisation, but in the future we both agreed it was the best thing for me.

I started to see a therapist. We explored a lot about me. But the more we talked about myself, the more my thoughts started to get crazier. I brought up my sexuality in one session, which then lead me to question who I was sexuality even more. That’s when I was diagnosed with Depersonalisation, the first time I had ever heard about my anxiety disorder. I recommend getting a therapist is you have Depersonalisation, if not talk to someone you love or trust. It really is the best way forward. Rationalising your thoughts and getting them out there.

I continued with my therapist and I ended up getting a job at my dad’s work. With me out of uni, I was doing nothing with my days, which is bad. You need structure and to feel like you have a purpose in life. I was good, working. Again, it took my mind off my “crazy” thoughts. Then came around Christmas. Had three weeks off work. I was still drinking and using drugs like ket and coke. During Christmas I went up north to see family and was again drinking heavily for three days in a row. I really wasn’t helping myself. I was stupid. The only way I thought to have fun and talk to people was through drinking. It came to new years. I was going to go out and go out hard. In my head I thought you must, its new year’s. Wrong mindset for someone in the state I was in. I was drinking again and doing coke, which so bad for anxiety. But I just wanted to have a good time. The next day I woke up at my mates, unaware of what happen for most of the night. I smoked a spliff and drank remains of glasses of wine. My mate gave the rest of his coke and was doing that throughout the day as well. I had family over for dinner. At this point I really didn’t care. I thought I’m never going to get out of this state of mind so fuck it, lets go overboard. I started for the first time not to care about life. The next day I woke up, went shop bought a bottle of Lucozade and vodka, went back to Brighton drinking that on the train ride back. God I’m writing this now and thinking how much of a spanner I am, and thankful for the place I’m in now. Anyway, after I got back, I bought a bottle of red wine and drank all of that and passed out in bed by 6pm.i woke up at 3am, not knowing where the fuck I was or what was happening. I truly felt like I was going crazy. I couldn’t sleep and I was so scared by the environment around me. I kept thinking I was going to trip out. This continued into the day. My heart was racing and pulsating. I thought I was going to explode. I called 911 and went to A&E. I sat there for 5 hours, contemplating reality around me thinking I was in a mental institution. When the doctor saw me, she said nothing was wrong with my body. Heart rate was regular. And my breathing was good. He said I was having a panic attack. Though he gave me some advice, which till this day I’m sticking too. He said, set yourself a goal. An achievement, something to aim too. My parents picked me up that day and I moved back home. I just let everything out to them. Still didn’t recognise them or who I was at this point

I started work again. 5 days a week, 9am to 6pm. I stopped drinking completely and no drugs at all. Things started to get worse, mentally. It was so confusing to me, I thought the answer to fixing my problem was to just cut out the drinking and drug use. This is when I thought about killing myself, to end this horrible thought and escape from the scary alien world around me. I would be at the train station, thinking of ending it. One point I nearly did. Taking yourself is completely in your own hands, at the end of the day, only you can stop yourself. But it doesn’t end the pain and suffering, it only passes it on to your love ones. I didn’t want that for my family. I didn’t want to put that on my friends. It wasn’t fair on them.

I talked to my therapist about this. It took me a couple sessions to bring it up, but I am glad I did. Telling someone you want to end your self made everything so real. Me and my therapist also discovered that in all recent sessions with him, I felt so real talking to him. He was the only person I really have ever talked to about my feelings. You need to talk to people in your life about your feelings. Not so they can know, so you can put it out there, so its not in your head. The first time I talked to my best friend about I felt and what was going through my mind, I felt safe for once.

Though doing this, I was still having these crazy thoughts, but at a pace I could manage and control. I then went to go see a psychiatrist. She put me on an antidepressant called Sertraline. It’s is good, it has made a real impact on my life. But the one thing I will tell you now, which will have a real impact on you. I took the leap. I let the “crazy” thoughts come at me and I was brave, I wasn’t scared like I usually was. I challenged all those negative thoughts with positive ones. You can’t let your anxiety scare you, because then you live in fear of it the whole time and let it control your life. I used to not want to go out see my friends, not even my best friend. But now, I force myself too. I don’t force myself to talk if I don’t feel like it, there’s nothing wrong with a bit of observation. You must take this slow and know things aren’t just going to suddenly get better, it’s a process, a hard process which you have to endure. And while you are being brave and challenging these horrible thoughts with positive ones, you will slip. You’re not going to master your anxiety straight away. You can’t beat up yourself up about it, no one is perfect and its okay to fail.

So, it is now March 2020 for me, during the corona pandemic. And from using these techniques, I can honestly say, I want to live, I want to be happy. Even with all the shit that is going on with the world, I’m just being true to myself, being who I am, thinking about me and thinking positively. I still have these crazy thoughts, but I don’t get scared by them anymore. But they are coming less and less.



There’s a lot I didn’t talk about, because if I was to talk about everything, we would be here till the end of time itself (if time even is a thing). I still doing have Depersonalisation in my life. You can’t fix it. It’s not something that goes away instantly. You have to look after yourself. You must think about what’s best for you. As much I love doing ket coke and drinking, I have now cut these things out of my life. I can’t say I won’t ever do these things again, because I enjoyed them. But I will not do them as often I did. Not even close to. Some people can do these things, other can’t. and there is nothing wrong with that. I have only drunk twice in the last two months and have done any drugs since new year’s. I still smoke hash, but I have found that calms me down. But that might not work for you and I do not recommend doing it if you have high anxiety at this point (if you are suffering from high levels of Depersonalisation). Over the course of my Depersonalisation, I have picked up going to the gym and running. Like that doctor said, aim for something. I am now aiming to run a half marathon in May. From barely being able to breath, I can now run 9 miles with ease. Exercising wont cure your anxiety, but it will distract you from it.

I was very lucky, as I was born with a dad who has a good job. With his job he gets private health insurance so that’s how I was able to get a therapist and see a psychiatrist. For some people seeing either one of these two will be to expensive. It’s not fair that some people are born with more privileges than others. I suggest seeing a counsellor or Samaritans. Just letting out your emotions is key. Especially to a loved one.

Another big aspect of me getting to a better place was through meditation. This is about calming yourself down so you can think more clearly. I mediate two times a day. Start with guided meditation. Just type it into YouTube and you’ll be sorted.

Going back to researching online. When I first saw that people were still in a state of Depersonalisation for ten years, that really scared me. Thinking I could be this way for years and years terrified me. But that is exactly the reason why people are in that state for so much longer. Depersonalisation feeds of fear, it only makes it grow. You really can’t fear your Depersonalisation, you must accept that it is part of who you are. You can’t fix it, only accept and move one with your life. It may seem tough to think that, but it’s essential to.

Try to investigate your own anxiety a bit, it is so personal to you. My anxiety is based around what people think about me. I always think I’ve done something wrong, when I haven’t. or if I have, it’s not as bad as I thought. I shaped myself around other people, doing stuff to try impress them which just wasn’t me. Which probably why I accumulate this Depersonalisation disorder. but now I think for me and what I want to do. I do what make me happy.

Honestly, during the heavy stages of my Depersonalisation, it was horrible and terrifying. But now looking back on it, I’m glad I went through it. I used to be a heavily drink and drug user, did no exercise, didn’t really care about life, was always thinking of the future and criticising myself on my past mistakes. Now I’m fit and healthy, happy, making myself laugh, smiling and just generally feeling good. Now if I didn’t go through the Depersonalisation (which I still have aspects of to this day), I probably would be ruining my life without even knowing it. I now laugh at my mistakes and learn, i don’t feel bad for myself. I feel happy for myself.



This is so easier said than done. I has taken me 9 months to get where I am and I will probably still feel out of place time to time. But I keep being positive and knowing life isn’t out to get me, we weren’t born to feel this way. And that there are people around me, that can help me, I’m not by myself. I am not scared anymore, I took the leap and so should you. Depersonalisation isn’t a bad thing, it will make you your best self. Trust me.



If this has helped you in anyway, I’m glad.

I can recommend some way to help calm down your thoughts. Please don’t be scared, remember that’s the key to changing. I want to help. And maybe you can help me too."
91,"When I hit my lowest points during the day I will normally start to feel separated from myself and I can hear my self-talking etc but when I look at a part of my body it moves so slowly but yet I know that it's not. Then i can't really feel my emotions, i know i am sad but i justs feel numb. has anyone else felt like this ?"
92,"When I started having panic attacks, I would start to feel sick and get physical symptoms such as headaches, Pins and needles but that’s not what terrifies me the most about my anxiety. 
I start to feel like I’ve left my body and I’m not real, as though I’m dreaming. has anyone else had this experience and were you given medication just for this?"
93,"I've read things on disassociation before and it seemed like it was similar to depression in some ways. All I know is in certain situations, usually around people, but can be in isolation, I'll tend to wander off emotionally. It's like there's some kind of block or something preventing me from feeling, interacting, or engaging in any way. I'll kind of stare at the wall or the floor or something and I can hear people speaking but it turns into background noise almost for a short time, then I come back, and wander off again, and it repeats."
94,"I feel so weird. But not really bad, just like really bad derealization and/or dizziness? Yesterday I already felt like as though I'd forgotten my meds the day before, light headed, but I don't think I did. Then I had an argument with someone and I felt way worse and since then I feel this strangeness far worse than usual. Maybe I'm just coming down with something (hopefully not covid...)"
95,"When I recall it
It’s as if they go mad
And burn every painting 
Shatter every mirror I have
Tear their hair out.

Then try to tear my hair out
Calling “you liar, you liar”.

It’s only the truth.
Yes it hurts. 
But it better than delusion.

“Take it away they say
Hide it burn it
Take it away
Get it out of here.”

Somethings happen we can’t understand for years.

But such anger as this?

That says “anything but this
Just burn it get rid of it...” why?"
96,"Hello, no one relates to me when i talk about this issue. I remember having this episodes - I call them like that - from age of 13. First episode at 13 - I was walking down the streets with my friends and suddenly - I felt like really strange deja vu from something I probably dreamed (even that night) and like my dream is continuing. My state of mind and consciousness seem on some different level. I ""feel"" like ( right now at 24) I'm STUCK in 2009 or any other year that passed. And even remember/recall a lot of things from that year (I would  probably not remember in this state of mind right now or forgot them). The strangest thing is - Everything that happened AFTER that year I'm stuck (f.example 2009) I emotionally feel them again! Like my aunt died in 2010, but my mind in 2020 is suprised and shocked like first time hearing that news! It's unpleasant and overemotional experience every time. Like mixed deja vu, dream feeling and past feeling at once. It last for 30minutes to few hours. Than it's all normal again. I experience this once in 3 months probably. Anyone knows what is going on?"
97,"I suffer terribly from anxiety and sometimes I have this symptom, which I thought was dissociation?

I happens when mostly when I’m at work around lots of people, I know I’m at work, but my mind feels totally distant from what is happening around me. 

Is this dissociation?"
98,"Hey everyone hope you're all as good as you can be. First Post here, only recently got a diagnosis of BPD and PTSD and not a lot of help from the docs with covid. For the past 6 months could be longer my memory is so foggy I've been dissociating like mad. I mean everything just doesn't look real its like virtual reality I can see it but its not right somethings not right, I try and go out to clear my mind and breathe in the cool air and I feel nothing, its like a breathless breath, I can remember how it used to feel, how calming the outside used to be the breeze in my hair, down the woods the beautiful scenery but now when I go I feel nothing from it, it doesn't look like it used too, its like being in a dream state, like looking at a memory or something. The worst thing about it is the time I'm loosing sometimes I'll end of literally staring into the distance for what seems like half an hour at a push and I've lost 4 hours of the day. And I cant remember what I done yesterday, it hurts my head to try think about it, I've had to stop using the oven because I keep zoning out and burning things almost had a fire the other week. I've tried all the grounding techniques I've read online but none help none snap me back. I cant remember the last time I was in touch with reality. I've ignored all friends my hygiene has went downhill, I haven't been keeping up with housework, everything in my life is suffering because of it and I'm worried about whats gonna happen if it goes on any longer. I don't even know what I'm thinking about while its happening that's the worst part at the time I know I am daydreaming it usually starts when I stress over something, I ruminate a lot but once I snap out the daydream all recollection of it goes too, I've always felt depressed and anxious but I've never felt so crazy in my life, like i don't even know what I'm doing the majority of the time if I try remember I actually get headaches and anxiety attacks. Has anyone suffered something similar? How do you cope and snap out of it? I'm at a loss and its driving me insane the time I am here and able to focus
Thanks for taking the time to read ♡"
99,"I've been looking how to deal with dissociation. All I get are grounding techniques and how to bring myself back to the present moment. But often I don't want to be in the present moment! It's often unbearable. It feels like I need to keep on getting breaks from being, I can't stay in the present moment too long, as I'm getting overwhelmed and need to switch off, to simply.. rest.

My life is not bad, I've got much more than an average person, I don't understand why I feel so terrible unless I'm dissociated. On the other hand having memory loss, blacks out, no feeling of time, and not being able to explain to friends what just happened, is nothing pleasant.

How to fight dissociation when I still feel I need it to survive? And why do I still feel like this?"
100,"Hi i'm new here. 
severl questins:

1. did it ever happened to u that someone says he knows you\alter, but you don't know who is he?

2. if someone meet u and they know you are multiple, do they have a name they call you or do they first ask like ""hi, how to pronounce today?"" or something.

3. if some of you know you'r multi, but some (call him bob) don't, and someone tells bob they know him. how would bob react? ever happen to you?

thank you very much!"
101,"Hello I am writing as my ex partner and I had a great relationship and she was very loving but then it just sort of stopped and she’s now like a different person like she reinvents herself and she’s very cold and we think she may have depersonalisation as she feels like a player in a game and detached from reality so I guess I’m asking if what I’ve described is something that anyone has also experienced and any advice you could give ? It’s difficult for me to grieve the same as I personally have OCD and I know our relationship ended due to mental health illness rather than just general issues . Thank you for taking the time to read !

102,"i dont know how can i feel ""normal"" again its like i am realized that I'm alive in this body and i can stop fear that . im even Anxious to look at my hands Because every moment it raises all the questions and anxieties about my existence dont know how can i be normal again and not scared My existence . What the hell is this how you can be afraid of your own existence .Has anyone experienced such fears ?

im dont know how to Explain my feeling It's like I feel I have something in my head , Feeling different before i was  smoking as if the brain is floating  

how can one return to being normal again ? 

and just one more question Does caffeine make it worse?"
103,"Hi, this might sound odd.. But I have a fear of talking / saying things without conciously knowing i'm saying things. Like some sort of tourettes with dissociation. I hear some people tell me things I said, which I can't remember. And I'm so afraid like sleep talking to people, is that a condition?"
104,I would get this weird feeling like I'm outside my body. Feeling like I don't really exist like I'm a pair of eye balls floating through space with nothing behind them. I wouldn't know if i've died already and this was hell or purgatory or something. I felt detached like nobody was home. Very empty and hollow feeling. It seems to be triggered by panic attacks that keep happening i need to talk to my psychiatrist about this :(
105,"I've read about it, I just can't decide if I have it or not."
106,"Well, my brain was off yesterday, but today I've touched a hot oven for check if was on, and yes, was on and I've burned my finger a little bit. What dumb. Well pain wakes me up from that disconection from reality, how can I avoid to fall again in that state?"
107,"Is easy to me to get out from reality, in auto pilot. When I'm usin my cell phone, especially. Is like I'm out of my actions. The only way is be hyperactive for avoid that but it can put me in stress."
108,"Hello to all. I hope you are well, and staying safe and secure, enough.

I'm a new poster. This will be my second account, getting my thoughts and ""journal"" up and out there, so it exists for real.
and maybe someone will care, or lend support or understanding. Maybe I can lend some back in return. So anyway...
here goes.

Here's another account of the things I deal with frequently, and seemingly to no sense or end.
It might not make a lot of sense in context, but rest assured there's lots more, where this comes from, that would sound a lot the same, from far ago... coming into the current present, and continuing.

A fast one today -- but i couldn’t just let another really messed up, strenuous day slip away out of memory like it never happened.



So, as with many of these events / days lately, in a row (couple weeks or so), even when it all really seemed done for a moment, a very bad / messed up day broke out again.

Day before yesterday (today’s 2020-07-15). Started out okay, and when we began talking, I was able to really progress and talk through and to and with girlfriend. She seemed a “her” again, and back. She was finally agreeing, and admitting, and saying sorry, and we were talking long about our relationship and being real, again... and going on into ideas for strategy / what to do better, how to get help... Then we ended up even talking about society, others, life, and all kinds of other topics. Before long it was just a good talk, that I stayed around for instead of going back to working on my stuff.

There was one section, which was one thing -- and we finished through it eventually, kind of... and she apologised and let it go and calmed down and all that, again... and I was pretty much done. But I admit, I said some more about how much I’ve been hurt through so many past events/ trauma and brought it all up, and I got hopeless and “downy” about it and said I’d had enough of all of it / this... and that she’s really got to see that and confess it, and make it all up to me. No more of this.

But somehow, we talked a bit too far, because at certain point later, triggers happened, and when even I just brought up the other days / events, so as to finally put them to fair rest, it only got her to go into defense mode again -- saying there were things I did, like I was responsible... and I continued to retell the stories, how one sided (her going insane and not coming back, over little things / nothing) they really are.

But... somehow, another worse one broke out, over the tiniest mention of the last few days ago, where she was truly (no less than ever before, and even worse in a way!) wrong and hurting me, again. This went on; before I knew it, I was dealing with the shrieking, crazed, unfair monster version again. Just overtly pushing me and the talk away, instead of solving it. Manically fighting me, pushing back.

But, I, pointedly and more than usual, stood by and stayed calm as it got to its worst... and showed that I would not back down or push away, and would keep waiting until she calmed and was able to finish it all. And just say a decent goodnight with me, and remember that we’d had a “good day” -- so much of it, was, earlier -- and let’s leave it be and remember that, as we leave for the night and say goodnight.

109,"I have been having moments, especially the past 5 months, where I suddenly don't recognize or have trouble recalling things, places, my family members and sometimes even myself. It all just feels blurry, I have known my family all my life but suddenly they feel very blurry and distant.I told my sister what I was feeling and I apologized to her if I don't talk much because there are times that she feels like a stranger but I am familiar with her, somehow. I would say the same about my memories. I have trouble with time and dates, I constantly feel lost with the days and I try to be mindful of the days lately but it still is confusing.

I feel easily confused and overwhelmed with my environment, when there are too many sounds or too many people talking at the same time, my brain just starts hurting. I have trouble comprehending things and I want to space out a lot. Sometimes when I stare at nothing I can feel my head floating.

During these past 5 months, I think I had a depressive episode and when I had a very intense mental breakdown, the day after that I suddenly felt high which confused me a little because I don't do any drugs but I felt great. Although, I was more spacey and I easily laughed at everything. There was even a time where I thought there were purple glimmering clouds in my closet and they were so beautiful, I didn't really see them but in my head they were there. I felt very whimsical. This lasted for about 2-3 days.

Now, I feel kind of normal which is numb but could this be considered as part of derealization/depersonalization?"
110,"There are two examples that I can think of right now that particularly stand out to me as depersonalization.

Whenever I'm in a romantic relationship, I never can get into physical intimacy. The thing that happens without fail is I sort of get 'caught up' in the act itself. I feel the touch, but I've subconsciously removed any emotional stake from it; as though I'm not really with my partner, and my mind is just caught observing the interaction happening. I'm so overly aware of the physical components of it to the point that it starts feeling like a silly activity.

I've always concealed this of course, in fear of offending my partner or taking it as me not being into them.

Another moment stood out to me earlier this year, when I had an internship at a really wonderful place. There was a really funny moment, and me and another person were belly-laughing until our sides hurt. Or, at least, that's what happened externally, because again I got 'caught up' in the act of laughter itself.

Why am I laughing? Am I just doing this to impress the person next to me? This is really funny, why don't I feel amused?

I have had moments like this ever since childhood, but back then I always took it as a sort of 'token of my intelligence'. Being 'aware of the world as it's happening'. I've realized, though, that it also impedes my ability to enjoy things as they happen.

So I guess I want to know whether anyone can relate to this, and if anyone does is there any advice you could give me as to how I could more fully enjoy things in the moment, as opposed to drifting off into space whenever I'm supposed to be emotionally invested? Are there any habits you've taken up to advance this?"
111,"Hello, I've been having issues with dissociative symptoms for a while now, and I've been wondering recently how to get a diagnosis for them. I was also wondering if that would even help. 
I made a post about my difficulties with therapists and psychologists before, and that leads to the question of if its possible to get a diagnosis without money or leaving the house. It doesn't sound possible to me, but I figured it was worth asking.

Thank you"
112,"I'm scared.....I dealt with depression/anxiety for the last 12 years and the more I realize all my life.  This episode and my last episode I can't help but feel is that it's all a dream.  None of this is real.....my worst fear is when I go to sleep, I'll wake up tomorrow and my family will be gone....like it was all in my head.  A sense of impending doom.  I'm terrified that this reality doesn't exist and I've made it all up.........I need help."
113,"My counsellor said that I dissociate from my emotions. 
I kinda get what that means but can someone explain it a bit better please?"
114,"Let me first say that I can't say for sure if I am experiencing dissociation, but I think I might be. I don't know what else to call it since it does feel like I am just watching everything happen but I am not driving a lot of the time. I am just a co-pilot right now...

But over the past month it's gotten really apparent that I feel more and more disconnected but I have been open with people about things I would not have been open about before. What's scary is I am anxious deep down and start to regret things I say, but I can't feel the anxiety. Which seems like it would be a good thing but...just knowing I am ""making a mistake"" but not caring because I don't feel anxious, that's scary. I am not an impulsive person so I don't know why I feel unable to stop saying things that I might regret. 

I also find myself caring a lot less about future outcomes of these may-be ""mistakes"" like, I still am overthinking sometimes about what could happen but it doesn't stop me like it used to. Again this could be seen as a good thing, if only I felt like it was me making these decisions...I am scared. I think I am almost totally mind-blind but the real me is still here just watching it all happen. I just want this mind control to stop. I'm not strong enough for this. But then again maybe I am. Just sometimes it really doesn't feel like I can do this...but I know I will come back to myself...I will kick them out of the car"
115,"So i had depersonalization for 4 years now , it comes and goes but gets intense especially on holidays/summer breaks where im sitting home and not spending most time at school , cuz school helps a bit keeps u busy . But now during the lockdown due to covid 19 am i the only one who had it severe ?"
116,"every single hour of the day i feel like im in a dream, my visions is very blurry like you just came insidce from being outdoors, i cant adjust to lighting everything is gloomy looking. it doesnt feel like im on the planet and i stop and think about that every few minutes and it scares the daylights out of me with anxiety. its such a freaky thing to go through. its been going on months now. i dont know if this will ever go away thats the worst part. ive been bouncing around antidepressants trying to find one that works with no luck and my derealization is worse than ever. i think i need antiphycotic medications like abilify or lithium because the ssri and SNRI's are not working anymore"
117,"Hi, I thought this thread could serve as a gathering place to talk, ask doubts, and share experiences about our inner parts and inner worlds. I don't have anyone to talk to about it, so I thought maybe there are other people too who can use this thread to share their experience, even though I know each person's experience is very different and personal. 

In my case, for example, I have an inner world in which center there is a tree made of pure light, which is the center of my Self. Around it there is a forest, where there is a school for inner children, also a library, and some houses in the outer circle where some parts live. I can't talk about some of my parts for example here in the forum or with my therapist, because they haven't given me the permission to do it (I mean, I can do it but they would get angry and feel hurt for not taking them into account, and I want to respect their wishes), I don't know if this happens to other people too. Some parts are from opposite gender, and they have different ages too.

Sometimes I hear them internally when I'm doing everyday life, like cooking or when my emotions are very intense, without ""entering"" inside through visualization, but when I'm calm and there is little stress, my mind is quite calm. When I'm in a regressed state, when I feel like a child or younger than I am, some nurturing parts help me and nurture me until I feel my age. Also, some of them are very wise and have knowledge I don't have -at least consciously-, and help me a lot, but they remind me many times that they are part of me.  

Before wrtiting this I have asked inside if there was any opposittion, but it seems that they are ok, and one sent me the feeling that it could be nice to know parts from others too. So I hope we can have a positive and helpful sharing experience 😊"
118,"Is like a contemplation state. Is ussualy try to overload my brain for don't fall in that state, I hate it. What is that?"
119,"I've suffered for around 7 years of being in a ""zombie"" state. I feel like I'm watching myself from behind my eyes, imagine sitting on a chair in the dark (almost like a cinema), however the ""screen"" is actually both of your eyes. You observe everything you do, everything you talk and interact with others but its almost like watching a carcass walking around. It's weird, you can stop reading if you want, this is more like me spilling all my thoughts trying to make sense of them. Being in this state also makes me numb, absolutely detached from emotions and even pain. However if i do feel sad or angry during this state, it's distant, almost as if I myself wasn't feeling all this however I KNOW that that's what this ""robot"" is feeling. UGHHH It's annoying trying to explain people everytime they ask about it. That's why I keep it secret tbh. It also affects my concentration A LOT which is absolutely draining since it affects my academic progress. :((((("
120,Need someone to talk too
121,It’s scary
122,"I'm not even sure where to start so just gonna throw all this out here...

Over the course of the last week or so I've been finding it harder to do most everything. From insomnia to panic attacks over the dumbest shit (like one day I couldn't find my keys, another I missed picking someone up on time, ya know stress induced stuff) to more recent (including tonight and partially now) feeling as though I'm having an out body experience. Not so much in the full I have left my Earthly existence but in the I'm sitting here typing but I feel like my sense have social distanced themselves from my physical form, like I'm 6 feet behind where I am.

It's rather trippy and not all that unpleasant but it won't go away. I've been up, walked around, went out side. It feels like I'm in a video game and someone set my view to over the shoulder then it got stuck. I'll properly end up sleeping this off but for now I have to work. I don't do much in the ways of that as covid has completely killed my job market (photographer) and all the events I would normally work have been canceled until further notice or reschedule for the fall. And with the protests and complete disregard for public safety in this country, it could be til longer. Anyways, I write and create for others, using what editorial knowledge I have so long hour of reading, re-reading, and trying to help writer convey proper information. (and not rant like some head spaced *enter colorful word of choice here* in the middle of the night on a forum) Any who, during all that my head feel farther and farther away from me and my existence seems split between my hands and my senses. 

It's hard to describe really. Like a floating balloon that's full of helium but is still tied down to a rock. I've been on drugs that don't work this well but I need to get work done and this is not helpful right now. Where was this during quarantine? 

Anyways, is there a manual way to reset without a nap or a grounding technique since nothing else seems to work. I end tried eating, usually helps calm and center my fat ass but even that didn't help. Not sure how to realign and snap back to my body. 

For info, I'm not on any drugs, legal or illegal. I've done the clear splashy stuff today. I eat a fairly regular diet. I take of my body, despite it being heavier than I would like. Aside from the bouts of insomina and previous mental illness (i get you're never really cured but it's not flared up for any reason in years), I'm not sure where this is coming from. I've not done anything to invoke this to my knowledge and while my work can be exhausting it's never been stressful to proof read and rewrite for people. So this whole feeling is rather new and still a bit groovy. Almost like a body buzz but without the harmony you'd get from weed or a beer, meaning there's no physical attachment to any of it. It's too weird for me. 

please advise."
123,"Hi guys,

I have multiple personality disorder (Lucky me..) and I watched split and then I watched Youtube with people who go ""you wanna speak with Gary do you?"" suddenly the same person speaks as Gary...

My MPD is not like that, my dissociation to a different personality takes an incredible amount of build up of stress and only then will it happen. Last time I dissociated for 6 hours in Feb and that's the last time. My aim is to not dissociate and let them win!

I feel it hard to believe others who say they have this condition and switch when they want to at any time. I know that sounds terrible but especially youtube young people saying ""OMG CAUGHT A SWITCH ON CAMERA"". 

My personalities some have OCD, all of them cannot do my day job, do you know what I mean?

I am worried the referral to the dissociation clinic will end up with me being rejected, when all I need to do is help getting fixed up."
124,"My lifes been weird lately. The topic of DID has been shoved in my face for like a month or two. It makes me reflect.
I was diagnosed with DID when I was only 13/14. The diagnosis kinda stays off and on. I question it a lot.
I grew up always wondering why theres more than one person in my head. I was embarrassed of it. When I got to be about 13 I mistook my most prominent alter Damien for a demon and eventually got diagnosed at the psychward. I lived in state care and had a lot of blackouts..
At one place every night I'd get in my PJs and then go to sleep. I'd immediately dream of standing out side of myself and watching myself get ready. I woke up with GIANT colorful bruises but couldn't remember where I got them. My friend thought I was mad at her because apparently I put my makeup and pink wig on after getting ready for bed and was walking down the hallways and ignored her. She wanted to know why I was acting weird. Maybe it's just a coincidence but after that place wasnt any better.
The next place was the worst place. One day I was brushing my hair and suddenly felt like a different person and couldn't remember the past few months. I knew enough to get by.. so I wasnt like ""omg where am I?"". However I couldn't mimic how I used to act, so people noticed I acted different. 
Somedays I'd walk through the doors of this locked facility to come back to the unit and couldn't remember where I just was. I'd just suddenly be back on the unit.
After leaving the problem hasnt gone away exactly. Theres been times things around my appartment where moved when I woke up (I lived alone.) However I dont black out as much. I just feel like those people.. Damien, the girl with pink hair, and others.. they get close and strongly influence my perceptions and mind. They tell me about memories I dont remember and we disagree on what really happened. They sometimes take over my mind it feels like, but I dont black out.
I'm not sure if what I'm experiancing now has anything to do with my previous diagnosis. I have to wait til some trauma center opens up for an appointment. My doctor recommended me. I just cant get it off of my mind. I'd appreciate anyone perspective on this issue."
125,"My mom has what I’ve always known as MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder) although it’s now known by the more common name DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder). Throughout my post, I may refer to it as MPD as it’s the term I grew up to know and call it by.

My mom was diagnosed with MPD back in the late 80’s, as Doctors were trying to unravel why she was experiencing black-outs, memory loss, un-accounted time periods, and feelings of dissociation. At the time, I was 7-8, my sibling a few years older.

To give some background, my mom was born and raised in England. She was sexually abused by her father, and his friends from the age of infancy to 22, when she finally was able to escape overseas.
The abuse was horrific. The doctors told me very little of the abuse, the rest my mom voluntarily told us even when we asked not to hear. The 5-10% of the abuse stories I have heard are beyond horrific, and it would be hard for anyone I think to comprehend and listen too, let alone the child I was when I was told the stories.  I don’t entirely blame my mom, as she also wasn’t in the greatest state of mind when telling  these stories, nor can I confirm if it even was her telling me the stories, or one of the alters.

In 1990 my mom started being sent to a treatment center down in Texas that deals with severe psychological trauma.  Her trips to the inpatient center lasted until the very late 1990’s and would normally be for months if not longer at a time.  More on these trips in a bit.

The doctors treating my mother have said at one point she had over 100 different alters or personalities. Again, I know the terminology may have changed over the years, but I have always used the term alter, when referring to one of my mom’s different identities or personalities.
Out of the 100 or more alters, which decreased over the years as they reintegrated, I only grew up to know 3-4, and it was those 3-4 that I mostly if not always spoke with.

During early grade school, it was quite common to come home from school and for one of my mom’s alters to be out.  Normally it was a child, and a particular child which is still present to this day and has refused to re-integrate.  Then there were the angry and violent ones whom again came out quite often, although I only really grew to know one in particular.
The child, a girl age 7, was the alter most known out of all of them, and spent a frequent amount of time out, playing with Doll houses, Stuffed animals, and speaking as a child.  This… is why when I hear people question the legitimacy of DID or MPD, I just think they should have walked in my shoes…and seen it happen almost daily for long periods. When you see you’re mom acting and talking like a 7yr old, and you’re 10yrs old yourself, that sticks with you. 

Over time as a kid, I became pretty accustom with how to ask for my mom back, even if I never understood what was happening in those moments. What child can? Even as an adult I never grew up to comprehend it.  It was way too much to process as a child, and it’s still too much to process today, even if I understand it slightly more.  Watching someone with DID Chang back right in front of you is very hard, putting it mildly, to comprehend.
The most violent alter, she was responsible for the constant screaming and self-harm. Implements were common to find around my mom’s room, all throughout her desk drawers you could find them stashed away.  When she left, my sister and I would sneak into her room to try to find them and remove them in hopes it would stop. Her arms which took the brunt, were covered in scars, probably hundreds, and if anyone asked what happened, she would blame a bad car accident she was in sometime in the 70’s.
The self-harm wasn’t limited to self-mutilation, as my mom grew an addiction to Tylenol with Codeine.  That was another branch of anger for me, the doctors who were constantly prescribing the Tylenol. If my mom could get something stronger, she would. Clonazepam, Ativan, Valium, her desk drawers were filled with bottles and bottles, and more hidden away just in case.  If an alter wasn’t out, she was high on some medication. 
If you asked my mom on a good day, she’d say the pills were for her depression, manic depression, and extreme loneliness. If we asked my mom most other days though, and begged her to stop, we were usually told “we” were the reason. Either because we hadn’t cleaned our room, hadn’t finished our homework, or were too busy with our friends and left her alone.  It took a very long time, into my adult hood to come to an understanding with myself that I wasn’t to blame.

My sister and I took very different approaches to the DID. While my sister refused to acknowledge the alters existed, nor speak with them, I spoke with them whenever they were out. I face it head on. I guess you could say, I developed a caretaker role from a very early age, before I even left early grade school.  It just became the norm for me, and I felt the need to want to help my mom.  I’ve always felt horrible for what my mom went through, and I guess developed an obligation to make sure I could always be there, and maybe fix her pain and suffering.
Somewhat of an extension to this, my sister was provided with a social worker whom made sure to shied her from my mom and the DID. I don’t remember my sister being home often, because if she was, my mom was out.  She spent a lot of time over at the Social Workers house with her husband and eventually they made her their god-daughter.  This without my parents permission. Maybe somewhat obvious, this has led to a lifelong divide between my sister and I, along with a lot of anger that brewed over the years. Not the god-daughter part, the fact that she was shielded from it all and refused to acknowledge the MPD.

If you’re asking where my father was, he’s always been in the picture, but he buried himself in work to survive and cope.  It’s not that he wasn’t there for us, he always made sure we had everything we needed, I’ve been to Disney World multiple times, he’d shield us when he could by having us stay with our Grandparents.  Even during my early adulthood, my dad sent me to live with my grandparents permanently for a year to be away from my mom.
I know trips and material things don’t take away from the fact at the end of the day, he did leave me alone with my mom for very long periods and it’s because of that, I’ve always have had a sometimes strained relationship with my father. 
That’s also why my mom felt lonely, because normally I was the only one home, and even then I just wanted to play outside with my friends, but more often then not, stayed inside to keep her company. Unless I was told beforehand, or was given a clue-in that her alters wanted out, and I should go play outside. 

Having friends over wasn’t usually a thing, because my mom would often speak out loud in voices you knew were not her, or she would randomly sing but again it wasn’t her. Adding to this because of her past, she always kept the bathroom door open when using it.  She refused to close the bathroom door as it was a trigger for her, her father never allowed the bathroom door to be closed.  It’s weird, but I grew to accept it.         

During my mom’s trips to Texas, I spent a lot of time alone, as my father would work late hours, and my sister was usually out with her social worker, who was the same age as my mom, and so she filled that mother role my sister lacked.  I guess for these reasons it’s also why I prefer to be alone even as an adult, I’m more of an introvert.
For one Christmas though my father surprised me with a trip to Texas as I hadn’t seen my mom in over 6 months.

As the years wore on from being a kid, to being a teen, nothing became easier or less frequent, I just developed my own coping mechanisms, as anyone might. My main coping mechanism were computers, and I’m thankful I did have that outlet, as it created a world I could escape too, even if just for a few hours and still in the same environment.

It’s amazing that even though I grew up around Multiple Personality Disorder, I feel as if I barely understand it still to this day.  I would often ask my mom what happens to her when her alters came out, and while she did try to explain, it’s hard to wrap my mind around it. There were occasions that my mom went into more vivid detail of where he personalities were located when not out, and where she went, but you’re trying to listen and process all this information at the same time.  Try to wrap your head around it as a kid… you can’t. Most of the time though my mom didn’t share to many details when asked, and even talking about it could trigger her or the alters, so I had to be careful.
It’s mind bending how DID works.  I can see why the public has a fascination with it, however I’ve always had a much different view, and more of a protective one at that.

While I myself was in and out of therapy since the age of 7, most of the therapists I talked to were more interested in asking questions about the MPD to satisfy their own curiosity.  It became a repeating theme with the Dr’s that they wouldn’t ask questions on how I was doing, but rather what happened when the alter’s came out, or what did my mom tell me about the MPD. Eventually I just stopped talking about it, and so even to this day I don’t talk about it to Dr’s.  I guess I’ve lost a lot of trust in Dr’s on where their true motive is when talking to me, and that’s not to say all doctors are like that, I completely understand that, it’s just that I’m far more protective and guarded unfortunately now as a result of the questions they asked when growing up.

Because of the DID, we lost A LOT of family friends, and my mom has always had a even harder time keeping friends around. As soon as you’d mention your mom has Multiple Personality Disorder, they’d start to picture Edward Norton’s Primal Fear movie, and or, run for the hills.  It’s unfortunate and sucks, which is why to this day I say nothing to people, and even my mom has learned to not mention her DID.
   
When my mom came over, she only had grade 4 education as her father refused to let her attend school, this was during the 50’s.  Before her diagnosis, she got her GED, attended nursing school, and eventually became an OR nurse. It’s amazing! But of course it was shortly after that her loss of time, black-outs, and periods of disassociation started happening, to the point she had to quit nursing all-together. 

I wanted to write all this because hopefully it can shed some light on what it’s like growing up with someone who has DID.  I did come out ok, I have a great job and a family of my own now, I’ve always stayed away from drugs and alcohol.  If the past taught me anything it was to be understanding.  I do suffer from major depression and anxiety myself, and while I have good days and a lot of down days, I’m always looking forward to the future.
I keep in contact with my mom, and talk often, but the MPD is never brought up. To her, she is healed. She is still taking Tylenol with Codeine, and has even recommended I take it for my depression which I politely declined. My father states my mom still has a few alters left, those will probably never re-integrate, especially the 7yr old girl who still comes out to play.  While my mom does have a therapist, afaik, it is not therapy to treat the DID.  Her DID therapy stopped sometime in the mid 2000’s.

I have to give my father a lot of credit, because many people told him over the years to divorce my mother. They’ve now been married over 40 something years.  I can imagine it hasn’t been easy on him, and he’s had to find his own coping mechanisms, but in his own words he isn’t a quitter. 

Thanks for reading! Hope this can be of help, and happy to answer any questions."
126,"What could this be? Feeling of slow-motion and my actions repeating in a loop


I used to get panic attacks quite frequently, but now I have learned to suppress them by distracting myself and refusing to allow the sensation to overpower me. However, I experience this weird phenomenon that freaks me out and often leads me into the feeling of panic.
It tends to happen completely randomly and i first got it after smoking marijuana and got it twice two months later out of the blue. Since smoking this marijuana I had had depersonalisation that has been getting better but this strange feeling has come back and has worsened my Depersonalisation. 
It starts often with a feeling of goosebumps on my scalp, and a cold feeling in my chest (like heartburn, but cold). My head feels heavy, I'll feel like I'm moving in slow motion, or that my sense of perception is either delayed or sped up. I'll be able to focus on something, but it's like tunnel-focus, I don't have an overall sense of whats going on. I feel like I can't keep my eyes or brain still, and I sometimes feel like I'm doing every action multiple times, like a rapid series of déja-vu. I get auditory déja-vu as well, I'll hear echoes of noises I hear in my brain, although sometimes slowed down or sped up. My head and neck feel numb and heavy. Sometimes I'll reach for something and I'll feel like I'm reaching in slow motion to an object far away. The sensation is not constant and I can sometimes suppress it the same way I would a panic attack by ignoring it and focusing on something else. These feelings cause me a sense of dread, and it becomes much more difficult to suppress panic because my feelings of going crazy and losing control are so much more exacerbated. 
First time I felt it was after smoking marijuana for the first and only time. Second when I was relaxed in bed and thinking about the incident. Third was in the shop when I was happy and not stressed. However I have been having bad stressful situations with my boyfriend and I don’t know whether this could have brought it on, or whether this is related to my depersonalisation.
Another thing to note: my senses are heightened after this has happened to me again and my touch feels somewhat strange and minutely delayed. I also have some double vision constantly which is strange.
Has anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know what it is, what causes it, and how to stop it?
Please help :/"
127,"Stopped 1/4 pristiq two weeks starting DP and DR, I took it back five weeks and added zoloft since 28th. I am so scare now. I don't know can I recover to normal. I am scare develop schizophrenia... but my doctor told me I am not. What should I do? Just wait the meds kick in again?"
128,"Hey guys. I think this is the right section for this, and if it's not I apologize. I'm a 26 year old straight male from New Jersey. I'm currently seeing a therapist once a week to help me manage OCD, and Anxiety, but I think something more might also be going on.. Basically, over the last 3 months, I've been suffering from HOCD and questioning my sexuality. 3 months later, I feel like I'm almost completely over that, or at least am able to accept that I have this and can manage it better than where I was at first, but some of the images in my mind felt so real at times and were disturbing. But anyway thats not really what this post is about. I'm like 95% sure I'm straight and there's a part of me that could be bisexual and I'm okay if I was. I'm slowly getting over that.

My issue now is, even though I feel like I'm over that type of OCD, I feel so detached from reality and lost in my own mind with random thoughts that are either not even remotely close to real to who I am, something I don't want to happen in real life, or just completely the opposite of my true self, and I'm afraid one day I'm going to lose control of myself to my mind, and do something I either strongly don't approve of normally, or possibly do something terrible to myself which I don't ever actually want to act on as long as I have control, as I very much enjoy life, but something just isn't right with me and I'm afraid one day I might snap and start acting on literally whatever comes to mind with no self control or thought and that would be terrible and not good. Right now I feel very much in control of myself but sometimes these thoughts in my head just are so far out there and seem so strange at times and it really bothers me how it's just not in sync with the real world and the rest of myself and who I really am.. 

It's like I feel like I'm forgetting what true real life situations feel like, I'm living my entire life through a computer and cell phone screen, either that or trapped in my mind which right now feels so foreign to the way I grew up and the person I've always been. I know something definitely doesn't feel right internally, most of the time. 

Is there a way to over-come this? Am I the only one who feels trapped in their own mind & not in the real world?"
129,"I’m new here. I don’t know what I am experiencing really, but I vaguely mentioned to my Colleague who is a psychologist, my experiences and she suggested I look into dissociative disorder. So here I am. Basically I feel like I am bodily present but more and more I don’t feel like I am mind present and I cannot control this. I have complete control of my body, but not my mind. I will be sitting there and it is like my mind shuts down almost. I see my kids playing and it just doesn’t become real anymore. I know they are my children still, but I do not remember anything in that moment of how I got to that point in my life. Like I am looking at them for the first time again, but at the age the are now. I have to struggle for a period of time to bring them back to me. To make them real again and to make my life real again. I don’t know where my mind goes during this time. I don’t know what I am thing about or what I was thinking prior to it. If I think back on my past I struggle with many memories of it. I have some, but stories people talk about like I should remember I often don’t. I remember almost nothing from my childhood. I have experienced things like this for some time now, but lately they have gotten worse. My stress is very high right now. I have been in an emotionally abusive relationship for 6 years. We have 2 children together. He recently moved out of the house, but continues to control a lot of aspects. Like he does not have a place to take the kids to watch them while I am at work, so he still watches them at my house and continues to stay here after I get off work until the kids go to bed at night. He stops by whenever is convenient for him. On the weekends I have to work early in the morning and I need him to watch the kids he will just sleep over here. If I do not let him, he will not watch the kids and I will not be able to go to work. He was continuing to have a physical relationship with me until I took him to court for child support. (I know I should not have continued to do that, but there is still a lot of emotional attachment I have to him I need to work through). There is a lot of history to our relationship that I probably need to go through some counseling to overcome and a lot of neglect and emotional trauma that I endured during our time together. I feel like he has played a significant role in contributing to my mental health state and has cause significant trauma for me. But I don’t know if what I have been experiencing is a dissociative depersonalization or what I am going through. I did reach out to my PCP a while ago because I was having anxiety and a lot of crying. He had ordered me some Klonopin prn and Effexor daily which I took for a month and stopped because I was just getting headaches more often and didn’t feel any different at all."
130,"I wasnt sure which specific forum to post this to but i feel like this fits well enough. I experienced a traumatic event about 2 years ago and afterwards i slowly but surely started feeling more and more apathetic, then i started feeling like life wasnt real almost like i was some sort of ghost just kinda seeing what was happening but not really experiencing it myself, i found out through google searches that this is probably some kind of dissociation or depersonalisation. It got worse and worse and now 2 years after it happened i feel like i have gone almost completely insane. Its gone beyond just feeling like life isnt real i now feel like i can barely comprehend anything and my mind just feels completely clouded. The apathy also grew over time, it started by slowly losing interest in things i used to enjoy, now its gotten to a point where i cant feel joy or excitement or really any strong emotion about anything. This is completely ruining my life and i feel like i am going more and more insane by each passing month. I am 18 years old now and was 16 when the traumatic event happened. The worst thing about it is that nobody knows. I havent told anybody. Not my friends, not my family, nobody.(not the trauma they know about that just not how much it affected me) This also means that i havent spoken to a psychiatrist so i havent been diagnosed with anything, havent been treated for anything and the mental illness is just growing because i havent told anyone. It wouldnt be hard to tell someone and im sure that my family would be supportive but for some reason i just cant. It doesnt even feel possible. Why is this? why cant i just open up to someone? It would make my life so much easier. Actually not even easier, but bareable. Right now im not really living, i cant feel anything. I need help and i dont know how to get it when i cant seem to tell anyone. So i am writing this as a total shot in the dark that someone might be able to say something that will help me get help. I just want to feel again. I want to live again. I have already wasted 2 years of my life and now that i am 18 more will be expected of me and in this mental shape i just cant do anything. I suppose that its possible none if this is related to the traumatic event as i diddnt see it as that life altering at the time. I was just very sad. But i have heard of trauma causing similar things to this and if it isnt related its a hell of a coincidence so i feel like it might be some form of PTSD even."
131,"I know someone whose coping mechanism is to pretend to be someone else entirely. They will pretend theyre a fictional character and act out scenarios in their head. The coping mechanism became just a daily habit of theirs but I know when they're really upset or having a breakdown theyll pretend their character is crying instead and it calms them. They told me before they sleep at night they will lie there and just act out these scenes in their head as ALL of these different characters. Like roleplaying but with themselves I guess? They said its all mental and they dont physically act any of it out. But I know they also insert people in their lives who are caring and loving to cope with the feeling they feel is missing? Anyone smart in psychology know what this is?  Im the only person they've told, they just want to know what it is. And im curious too"
132,"One year ago I have started to eat pristiq until one month ago I stopped it by my doctor, He said  decreased the dose for me is safe. My last dose is 1/4.But when I came off from it two weeks. i got uncomfortable few days after that I seem like disconnect to surroundings gradually.And My brain starting blank every day. I am so scare that I will develop Intellectual disability or schizophrenia or something. I told my family and they don't believe me. Doctor add zoloft for me last month 28th. I have lost my motivation and emotion. And I am feeling like I am dying. And my consciousness is losing. I will ask my doctor tomorrow. Who knows that feel."
133,"Hi.. So. I am undiagnosed. I would like to point that out. (This is about OSDD 1-b.)

But I have met two possible Alters so far? I made a post about a little named Emily. Still unsure about that. But yesterday, or the day before that I met Cody.

I was trying to talk to Emily, see if she was actually there. And I started getting bad dissociation so I closed my eyes, my head started spinning like crazy.

When it stopped a name came into my head. Cody. I didn't have that name ANYWHERE in my thoughts. I got a brief idea on who he was, and kind of what he looks like. His personality isn't too different from mine. He likes rock music, heavy metal, sarcastic ect. After that, I think he fronted and we were possibly co con.

I want to know if that is even a possible way to meet an Alter.

But also. I think my brain is just making it all up. I don't hear voices like everyone else does. I know every system is different.. But I can't help to think that.. I want to talk to a therapist, but my mom just thinks im possessed. (Which she also claimed DID and Multiple Personality Disorder are totally different, so I don't think her opinion matters all too much)

If this is real.. I want to know ways I can possibly get better at communication. Like I said, I can't hear voices, I've tried talking to them by thinking to myself but no avail. I tried writing, nothing, I tried talking out loud. But nothing yet.

What are you guys' opinions? Do you think I could be making this all up, or is it possible I may have OSDD?

134,"We are currently quarantined together, and he has a severe anxiety and PTSD from recent traumatic events that trigger the dissociation. I'm doing my best to help him because I care about him, but I don't know the best way to help. Sometimes he has trouble responding when I talk to him when he's having an episode of dissociation, so it's hard to know what to do. What helps you when you are going through dp/dr?"
135,"Anyone here experienced this kind of therapy or other forms of ""parts therapy""? I'm currently in the process of integrating my parts and am wondering if anyone has had any success with integration?"
136,"A couple months ago, I went through quite a traumatic surgical experience. While my physical health seems to be quite good, around a month ago I begun feeling very much not in the room. It almost feels like I'm here, and I can function quite normally but everything isn't real? Sometimes I can feel quite dizzy and I have also suffered with extreme anxiety during this time as well. It almost feels like my brain is processing the world differently. My concentration and memory have become terrible too.
Nobody I know has experienced these things, and I'm just scared that this is a physical issue as opposed to a mental one. I'm also scared that I will never come out of this state. 
Is there someone out there who knows what I'm talking about? And even better recovered? I'd love to hear from you, as I'm very scared at the moment. Thank you."
137,"So I'm a protector in my system and since today i think the persecutors in the system have ganged up and are pretty much bullying people in the inner world including me but also emily who is literally only 12! It's wrong and i've got f$ck all power to stop it because they don't actually reply to me. Any ideas for sanctions or something? eg if you bully us this will happen to you? How tf do I stop this nonsense?

Also any ideas for better communication bcz in the system lots of people can't rpely to what the front person is saying.

Thanks in advance.

also i think they're doing it bcz it makes them feel powerful or something? I think it's a way to get control?"
138,"Im in therapy which is likely to be moved online. I spoke to my therapist over email to discuss my concerns (I’m worried about dissociating and how this would pan out online, with her not physically there) and she said she would still see me face to face, but didn’t want to discuss any traumatic memories due to the likely possibility of going online soon. The traumatic memories are what I struggle with and why I dissociate, although I often talk about other stuff instead. I don’t feel comfortable sticking to her agenda. Am I overreacting and this is sensible? Thanks for any advice."
139,"Hi everyone. After posting here the last time, I started doing more research on the topic of Dissociative Disorders and found out that I have most if not all of the symptoms of OSDD-1b, which means that instead of having complete amnesia, I have emotional amnesia and feel disconnected from what happens and/or what ""I"" do, feeling that another person is in control of my body but still being able to vaguely recall some of the events during those times.
I'm trying to come to terms with it, trying to establish communication with the rest of the system, and so far I managed to identify some alters (personalities) and realized that theres a couple of them that are the most often to be co-conscious and/or co-fronting with me.
However, there's one problem I can see: I seem to be unable to let them do their thing. What I mean is that I often cling on to control and refuse to let go and let them do what they're trying to do. This is mostly the case when I'm calm and they want to do something like playing videogames, for example; in these times, it's like they're relaying their actions through me, like I'm trying to filter out their actions. For example, one of them really likes to talk to one of my friends, but when I notice it's him who is writing, I instantly start changing what he's typing, censoring him in some kind of way.
So I wanted to ask you if any of you has or had a similar experience and how I can make it so that my alters can express themselves more freely. 
I'd really love it if they could write me some sort of letter or short snippet explaining who they are and what they like and stuff. I feel like they need to do more things and have some fun, but since I've repressed this all my life and now it's kinda difficult to let them express themselves.

Have a nice day/evening"
140,"Today my thoughts were off, and i started to feel like everything was in my head. Like i cant think-thoughts, especially negative ones without them being played back for me and reinacted. It makes my stomach turn because of how negative my thoughts can be and how seemingly fake reality can be, which is why i want a help number.
Is there somebody i can talk to about this, my psychiatrist is busy alot of the time, especially now, and i already spoke to my therapist today. Not only was the conversation short, i really feel i need the extra help. Ive been inside my room by myself for years prior to this corona, and so alls i do is think- without an outlet of someone to discuss it with. If yous could help or direct me it would be much appreciated."
141,what is it like
142,"Ive had derealization & depersonalization since the 6th grade (im in 12th now) and its been getting a lot worse recently. i used to be able to reason with myself and although nothing felt real i was able to maintain that this was just a symptom of mental illness, and that everything was in fact real. but recently i cant do that anymore. i feel so lost, unable to find something to tether me to reality. everything seems so unfamiliar and irrational. nothing makes sense and i dont even believe that any of it is real anymore. its so frustrating and makes me feel so desperate and trapped. it feels sometimes like i am experiencing psychosis, minus the hallucinations. how can i get a grip on reality if i have no way of knowing if reality exists? its scary. i wish i could go to a therapist as i havent been to one for a long time but with this whole coronavirus situation, therapists are only doing video chat sessions and for me that doesnt work.... are any real people even reading this? who knows lol"
143,"Hi! Hope everyone is doing okay. I need some answers about something I've been struggling with forever. When I was 12 I had a visual hallucination (never had one since) that really scared me and caused some kind of anxiety attack. I started shaking and then suddenly lost all touch with reality, I couldn't feel the ground anymore, voices grew distant and it felt like there was some kind of invisible wall between me and the world. I felt like I lost control over my body and had to lay down. After a while I felt better. I'm 19 now and have been dealing with frequent episodes like this ever since, just without the hallucination and panic. In the beginning I always experienced a loss of control over my body and often had to lay down on the ground in very inconvenient situations, but over time, it has gotten less intense and I usually manage to hide the episodes completely, I just kind of space out a little, and usually noone notices, but it's uncomfortable and I am always worried I will never feel completely in touch with the world around me again (luckily I always do after a few hours of sleep). The episodes are usually triggered by sudden uncomfortable situations, wether they be psychological or physical (very often it's an uncomfortable encounter or a stressful conversation. When I was younger all kind of physical activity, gatherings of people, disturbing lighting etc. would also trigger it). Anyways, as I am quite anxious about my health I used to think this was caused by some kind of brain tumor, but recently I have been very bothered by the issue and thus decided to do some more research. So I stumbled upon this range of mental disorders and they just made a lot of sense to me. Do you think this might be what I've been struggling with?"
144,"For the past month or so since I've been quarantined, I've been noticing that my life doesn't feel ""real"" anymore.
It feels like Groundhog Day, for one thing. Every day is exactly the same and it feels like I'm experiencing it over and over again with the same results, but at the same time it doesn't feel like it's actually happening to me. It feels like I'm stuck in a dream and it's repeating on an endless loop. My dreams are starting to feel more real and vivid than actual reality.
I also don't tend to remember very much of what happened during any given day. I remember enough to know that it feels the same as the previous day, but my memory of any actual events is foggy. Everything kind of blurs together. My sense of time and my biological clock are screwed up as well.

Is anyone else familiar with this experience?
And what can I do about it?"
145,"Venting zone ahead
I just feel invisible like I don't even exist and I can't connect to myself and I don't know what to do 
I really really really feel like no one really cares right now
Most of the time I feel that but it doesn't bother me so much until it all hits me at once 
I feel no support from anyone with my life choices to be myself and I feel like everyone is just looking right through me 
I feel my mind changing like I am so different from how I was a year ago and I know things change all the time but it is hard for me to deal with because most of my life was so stagnant
No that I am starting to be myself it's a good thing when it's good but I guess I just still have times where I go back to doubting myself and that's what is happening right now
I feel and see myself typing this but it feels like my mind and body are always separate 
I feel like they are always separate but sometimes like right now it's distressing 
I just feel like everything is so pointless and I am just typing this to get it out because no one is listening to me but I don't want to try to vent to friends really 
I just feel so stupid and like my struggles aren't even real anyway because nothing is fucking real
Just a few weeks ago I was so close to being ready to do something that would really help my life move forward
But now everything is on hold with covid and I feel unsure of myself and powerless again
Fuck the untrustworthies. Yah...you are really testing me
I feel like the only thing here for me right now is music"
146,"I’ve experienced depersonalisation episodes for nearly 4 years now. I never really understood what it was and thought it was a medical issue so I had loads of scans and what not which as you can imagine made my anxiety and attacks worse.
I’ve actually been a lot better since I started sixth form but I still have a few episodes sometimes. Ive never been diagnosed but does anyone have any tips or similar experiences?"
147,"So I have had episodes of dissociation, DP, DR on and off over the course of time. But recently it's gotten really bad. There are a few other things going on in my head that are making it worse and I don't know if this is the right place for me to bring up those things. Like ""voices in my head"" kind of stuff.

Really don't know what's going on, and I'm not in a place where I can seek professional advice. But it's nice to actually get that off my chest 😅"
148,"Hi there.. I'm a 30 year old female suffering from what I can only describe as severe derealization or some other kind of disassociation. I spend my days in a dream, basically.  Nothing feels real.  The days fly by, and by the end of the day I question whether I really even lived it.  When I walk outside, it's like a nightmare or a video game.  It's so bright and large and overwhelming and I start to get flooded with these same feelings of ""Where am I?""  ""What is all of this?"" ""How can this BE?"" I'm terrified every single day.  The feelings are slightly less bad inside of my home, but still exist there as well.  I find myself looking around my living room and just unable to grasp that I live here, or that I'm here at all. Sometimes I get chills from looking at my kids or my boyfriend because they look so unfamiliar to me.  I, again, find myself asking ""How did I get here?"" ""Who are these people?"" ""How is this my life?"" It's not like I don't know who they are or remember how I got here.  I remember all the big moments in my life and every step that brought me to where I am today, yet none of it feels real.  My memories feel like dreams.  I cry when I think about my old life, how I could walk freely out of my home without suddenly feeling like I might float away, or take a hike without wanting to scream and cover my head and run back to my car, or questioning how everyone else outside isn't thinking what I'm thinking.  How no one else seems to be terrified of the world around them.  Why doesn't anyone else look up at the sky and think about how it is literally infinite?  That there is no end to it?  Why doesn't everyone else feel so small and out of control in this world?  I'm paralyzed by my fears. I can't drive a car more than a few miles away, I can barely walk more than a few feet outside my door to walk my dog, sometimes I can't even walk outside the door.  I have massive moments of what I can only descibe as panic while I shower.  It brings some kind of awareness to my body or something and I find myself staring at my limbs and wondering how they belong to me and suddenly panicking at the very fact that I'm alive.  I seem to live in this constant dream-like state with momentary bouts of ""reality"" that terrify me so badly that I retreat straight back into my dream state.  I don't  know what to do anymore."
149,In the middle of a panic attack or when I’m having a lot of anxiety I find myself detached from reality. I kind of get into another like story or situation in my mind. I stand still and after seconds or minutes I come back to reality and realize where I am and what I was doing. Anyone else has those episodes? :redface:
150,"Can someone talk through to a newbie.

Having which I believe are DID symptoms.

Would I be able to call someone to help advise on this?"
151,"I'm a 35-year-old woman and I'm suffering from 24/7 derealisation which never goes away. 

I had a traumatic childhood where my parents decided to leave our home country when I was twelve years old. They moved around a lot and at first lived in one country. We lived with my Uncle and his family and my Uncle was emotionally abusive to me and I would hide in my room a lot.

Afterwards we moved to Australia, but my parents kept moving places and I had to go to four different schools. I was stressed and unhappy because I was always the new girl and also didn't speak much English. I got bullied a lot for being overweight and my acne too and didn't have many friends throughout school.

At 14 years old I spoke to the school counselor and she said it sounded like I was depressed and put me on antidepressants. I'd also tried to commit suicide at that age. I felt suicidal periodically through my teenage years. When I was 19 my boyfriend actually killed himself.

After high school I made a lot more friends, got a job and studied at university. My life was overall good but I still suffered from depression and anxiety. I drank a fair bit of alcohol since I was about 16-17 years old, throughout my life.

It was in my late teens/early 20's that I first began to very occasionally feel like life didn't seem real. It felt like time was very slow and like I was moving through fog.

When I was 23, I was working 30 hours a week and doing some night shifts. I was a full-time student and just moved out of home. Then out of the blue began having paranoia and psychotic symptoms. Ones related to disassociation were that I felt like it wasn't me when I looked in the mirror at myself. And that my right arm wasn't attached to me and it was just a random arm. However I was aware that all my symptoms were actually not real.

I was in a psychiatric ward for a week, then got discharged. I took various antipsychotics for 1.5 years. They seemed to be helping but had awful side effects. Eventually I stopped taking them because of that and no psychotic symptoms came back.

Over the years I fairly rarely got depersonalisation. I felt very numb inside and like I had no emotions. Sometimes felt like my right arm wasn't attached to my body. Or that I was a robot on automation or my body was just a doll/robot being operated by another person. Or felt like I was out of my body and just looking onto the situation. This happened only very rarely and seemed to be brought on by strong tiredness or stress.

One and a half years ago I began experimenting with recreational drugs. I never really used any drugs before except a once in a blue moon puff of weed and tried MDMA a few times. 

In early 2018 I took MDMA (some probably fake/laced) eight times in six months. I took acid once and had a bad trip. After I took MDMA (fake?) in August 2018, I began to feel like I was completely off this planet. I had bad headaches for weeks, memory blanks/bad memory, paranoia, visual distortions. 

Eventually a lot of these symptoms got better. The only problem is the 24/7 derealisation. It just never stops. I always feel like I'm in a dream. The world looks foggy and blurry. I feel like I'm behind a screen or inside a bubble and separated from the world. Sometimes my surroundings look unfamiliar or lights seem too bright. My vision is blurry and always have eye floaters.

I'm never sure of my memories because they don't seem real. Or feel like my memories were only a dream. Doesn't feel like there is any difference between sleeping and waking because when I wake up everything still seems to be a dream. It feels like my life before this started was my real life and this is all just dreaming.

Any comments or advice? What helps/helped you? Any strategies or things I can do to alleviate this at all? It feels so awful and I so desperately want my life back."
152,"I’m not sure if what I’m about to share falls into the category of depersonalisation and derealisation, but here it goes: about 6 years ago I started to become acutely aware of my body, of things I used to do automatically, like washing my hands. I would observe myself in a kind of detached way and it was freaking me out. I would push away these thoughts and feelings as soon as they would arise, because I didn't knew what to do with them.

Then, a couple of months later, my nightmare started. One evening I went to bed after a normal day and as I was trying to fall asleep I was flooded with a sense of panic I have never experienced before. I got out of bed and looked outside my window and the world seemed unreal. What intrigued me is that I could feel the panic in my body but inside my head I was calm, more like asking myself “what’s up with this fear? I’m in no danger”. I felt better very soon after and hoped it will not repeat itself. However, it did and I would spend all the time in and out of these episodes. Physically my arms and legs would go numb and I would start trembling, sweating, rapid heartbeat. I would have a period of rest and then again, over and over again, especially during the night. I felt like I couldn't connect with people, I was talking to them but it's like I couldn't connect. However, the thought that was haunting me the most was the idea that ""I'm trapped in this world and I can't get out"". That I have to live here, in this time and space for the rest of my life. I knew it made absolutely no sense, but I couldn't get it out of my head and this was at the root of the panic.

Now, fast-forward 6 years, I rarely have these episodes, but sometimes it happens and I don't know what it means, what's up with this irrational fears? I used to believe nobody could help me because nothing, no person or pill could make these ideas go away...

Thank you for reading this long post, I don't know if I made any sense, it's hard to put into words these experiences."

155,Not quite sure what constitutes this? Sometimes my thoughts seem to completely wonder off aimlessly and I sometimes feel an unstable sense of identity. Is this a Dissociative Episode? How do I know or not?
156,"I considered posting this in the Self-Harm Forum, but the answer I need is probably here.

There are times I've had a dissociative episode while waiting for a commuter train ride home. No dark thoughts, no sense of doom; I just sit on the bench doing my best to remain in the moment, and stay put without panicking until my train arrives.

That loss of immediate reactive control is disturbing. Even though I NEVER have suicidal thoughts or intent of any harm whatsoever, I worry that - during the jumbled dreamlike thoughts occurring during a dissociative episode - I may just stand up and just walk to the edge of disaster, in spite of myself. To be doubly clear, the thought comes out of nowhere and the notion horrifies me -- I do not want to take my life.

And this is where it gets complicated: health assessments and doctor visits frequently include the question, ""Do you ever have suicidal thoughts?"". My best answer is, ""not willingly, no"".  But even that answer has the health professional automatically ""turning to that tab in the handbook"" and changing my answer to YES; then causing them to address that one thought among the other thousand I experienced and not treating the dissociation.

Am I giving the wrong answer, or seeing the wrong doctors? Both or neither? And is there a more appropriate Forum for me to be asking this? Thanks."
157,"My past T was not able to commit therapy with me further due to divided systems of my complex DID condition. It was another system that saw her and now I’m in a different system that wanted to see her and she said it’s too confusing. Between systems there is full amnesic wall without switching control. She told me I need a team in the hospital for treatment instead, due to if I continue finding different T all over the place, there’s no consistency of who’s in charge, as she termed. Don’t know what to do. She wanted a central alter to do all the appointment bookings, which is undoable in this case, for instance."
158,"Hi everyone 
Wanted to post this thread as I need some advice please.
I have been experiencing derealisation/depersonalisation since my mid 20's. But didn't think anything of it. I am now 34. Since last year summer time, it's got very intense and is lasting much longer than it did before. I was cycling home yesterday still having the d&d. At the crossing I heard my partner call my name. This was impossible as he was at home. And if he was really there calling my name, he definitely would of walked up to me. I'm not sure if this was in my head, or if it was another man talking walking the street, but I heard his voice as my partners. I do have very deep depression with general anxiety disorder. The depression and anxiety stop me from sleeping very well. What I need advice on is, has anyone else experienced something like this? Thankyou in advance."
159,"Hi! Okay so I’m new to this forum, and I honestly don’t know much about mental health or how to handle what I’m experiencing. I’ve experienced it for as long as I can remember. When I was younger I remember feeling like sometimes I wasn’t awake that I wasn’t real, if that makes sense. I couldn’t get grounded or preset where I was, and I’ve been told afterward that I always reacted slowly or delayed when I felt that way. I always thought something was just horribly wrong with me, and so I never mentioned to my mother or anyone else. Now, I still experience more frequent episodes where my brain feels like it’s not in my body? Or it’s full of cotton or muffled and disconnected from the rest of me. Nothing really registers and I have moments of feeling like I’m not real or the world around me isn’t. When I come out of it, all that time is hazy I can’t quite remember everything that happened. Sometimes it’s like I’m seeing stuff through a veil or a screen. I hesitated to do research because I didn’t want to self-diagnose and I couldn’t and still can’t afford to go see anyone about it. I’m afraid they’ll tell me I’m making it up or seeking attention. I don’t know what to do or if there are any strategies to help ground myself when I’m feeling that way"
160,"I came off Abilify close to when it hit me hard, but as I gradually decreased my intake dosage (with doctor's consent, eventually came off entirely) I was losing some cognitive reasoning, to the point of brain fog where I was all over the place, and while I was completely functional, it was enough to confuse me and make me worry. 

As the meds decreased, my brain fog increased, and I began to have depersonalization symptoms shortly after I came off.

To be honest, I figured it was withdrawal, being on meds my entire life and then coming off completely, I assume it would hit anyone hard. But to be honest, I'm not entirely sure.

I will add (if it seems relevant) that over those same months I burned out from golf. I wanted to make the PGA Tour, and was getting into the scoring range they shoot on TV, and over strenuous practice, and pushing myself beyond my means, I burned out. I lost a big tournament in Nashville, and I fell hard because of it, emotionally being disheartened, and never mentally recovered. I had a few months where I couldn't break 80, and eventually I put golf on hiatus until I could get my mind straight. 

My question is would my depersonalization be withdrawal related? And is there anything I can do?"
161,"Hi there. I have been feeling...strange I guess? Stranger than normal for sure. I *think* it's some kind of dissociation but its difficult to really tell because I can't ask anyone about irl. So I was wondering if people could give me some examples of what it feels like to dissociate, depersonalize, or derealize. I do understand it may be difficult to talk about that in a personal sense, so I don't mind if it's a general example. I just want to understand what each of those conditions are, and the differences between them because the definitions online are *too* generic and always end with ""see your doctor if you have any of these symptoms to learn more"" or something like that. 

Note: I wrote 2 posts, one about my condition, and another about why I cant see a doctor right now, if you want to read those you can, but they're kinda long"
162,"hey everyone,

lately i've been having a really tough time with stress, and depression, and it's led to a LOT more dissociative episodes than usual, they're getting pretty bad relative to my usual state. i've been forgetting most conversations i have and most lectures i just cannot pay attention to, i've also skipped/missed so many of them because time just slips. or i can't hear or see properly.

everything is starting to pile on top of me and i feel like i'm drowning. does anyone have any tips for clawing your way back on top of things, or in general dealing with uni while being foggy?"
163,"There was the worship program, in which via mind control programming through my complex DID system, my abuser has commanded me to worship him against my will, whom is the leader of the groups. He has stolen the value of who I am. Through the ritual worship routine, I was forced to bow down on the ground to praise him. I was forced to come in complete loyalty and surrender to his will.

There was the suicide programming also. My suicide attempts committed thrice, were probably triggered after the deprogramming process in therapy. There are angry alters and protective alters, and with the suicide category, it fits into both physical abuse and behavioral aftermath, as well. There are 4 stages of suicidality and mine was the last. I was referred to the P-ICU, psychiatric intensive care unit on July 2019. I was again being carried by the ambulance, hospitalized in the emergency department and have survived all. The physical injuries are all healed."
164,"Hello,  I've noticed that sometimes I get depersonalisation but I've only ever experienced it when trying to go to sleep. I remember having this almost every night when I was a young child for as long as I can remember, I would lay there trying to sleep but I would feel an outer body experience as if I was watching myself from the ceiling. I would be conscious during this and it would terrify me. I don't get it as often now but it does happen and its just as scary now. Sometimes I feel like I'm watching myself from the other side of the room but mainly from the ceiling.  Although I didn't have the best upbringing and it got really rough at times, I can't see a trigger for it when I was young. I have alot of mental health issues now (first starting from around age 11/12) but it seems to mostly happen when I've had a very busy day but I do get it randomly too even after a good day. 

I've been to see doctors and they don't seem to care, I want to know if it's normal to be going through this from such a young age?  Is it normal to be having this atall? 
Just hope I'm overthinking things. 

If anyone replies then I thank you alot! :)"
165,"Yesterday, I dissociated to another personality, Stephen for a couple of hours.

I get brief flash backs at what happened apart from that nothing, the feeling I cannot control what I was doing.

I asked my wife for a divorce but she wants to stay with me, but I feel like I am not safe for anyone right now and feel like overdosing."
166,"I don’t know where to post this. I need some help/advice. I have been falling apart for some time. My memory was so bad that I’ve had issues with how to handle anything. I didn’t feel real for awhile and felt as if I was dying. My mind was lying to me about what the real problems are in my life. I can’t talk with anyone because I feel like I’m crazy for having anxiety, panic attacks and depression. I wanted to die and I still struggle with it. I can’t talk with my husband about what I’m feeling. He gets upset when I talk about things. He plays video games online everyday. If he’s not working he’s online playing. Our kids grew up with Dad always on the computer. He only gets half of what I say most of the time. I can’t seem to make anything better for my kids.I struggled a lot when they were younger as I had no family to help.

I’m stuck without support to get better and feel guilty at the same time for asking. I have no life now other than the walls of my home. I can’t leave my house for a therapy appt. I’m afraid one day I may say to hell with life. I’ve destroyed everything that made me who I was. I never thought in a million years that I would be where I am at now. How can I move forward??

Sometimes I think if one person would have stepped when I was in crisis. I wouldn’t have spent the last two years waiting to die being in a depersonalization state.

I often think of my choices. 

1) Try to talk to family again for help, this would be my in laws, all I have are my parents. 
2) Live the rest of my life in my home unable to go anywhere. 
3) Move to my father’s house for awhile, to get away from my home situation. ( I left for a week 2 years ago but had to come back home because of my daughter) 

I don’t know what I should do. All I know is that I can’t continue to go on this way.
I found this forum and was really hoping to connect with others going through some of the same issues. 
It’s extremely lonely not having anyone to really talk too and scary as hell when you don’t know who you are anymore."
167,"This is really hard to explain. For the past 2 or 3 days, I haven't felt like I'm real. I just... don't feel anything? it's not that like everything isn't real,  I just don't feel like a human. I have a body and I know that, but it doesn't feel like it's mine? I know I've had a similar feeling before, 2 years ago, I think? But never on this scale before"
168,"Even if someone says they support me I immediately am suspicious of it. Doesn't matter how genuine it may be. I feel it's sus. 

I don't actually believe love even exists as an emotion to me anymore. I've been backstabbed and screwed over and rejected so many times that I've just desensitized my mind into filtering it out. I become numb to feeling ""included"" in any way and only think of myself as a lone wolf and sorta an outlaw. Not giving a fuck anymore about others or myself. 

The last time I felt ""loved"" was over 5 years ago and that's when I learned that she was a umm well to put it nicely in the sheets with everyone but me. Using me for things she couldn't get before. I left her cheating ass. Then after that I got over it and forgot about her then soon after realized no one wanted me in their lives. 

Now I was sad for a while and would ball my eyes out at my ugly looks in the mirror and, cried myself to sleep and ate so much I'd puke until one day I got really high on acid and realized no one needs me and I don't need them. It changed me forever emotions felt more distant but in a good way cause now I don't need the validation anymore. 

I think of it as shedding my weak skin. I saw different versions of myself as if reality was splitting into separate worlds with different timelines each with more extreme emotions and overwhelming feelings of intense self reflection.

Why do I need to love someone? I don't. No one finds me attractive in any way shape or form and I feel kinda the same way back. 

I've always been distant to everyone including my family members and I even have a hard time showing them any emotion at all. 

Being hugged or cuddled always made me feel a little trapped in some way and not as comforting as I wanted it to be. Kissing felt gross and didn't have much of a spark and sex just felt slippery and wet but only had a little pleasure. 

I used to feel so depressed at the fact that I was ugly or short or an asshole. Now I just think it's them being too picky and I gave up on trying to meet those absurd requirements. Love is a game and I'm a loser at it but not a sore one mind you. I've learned to accept my loss and the fact I'll be alone forever. 

My thoughts are all I need and all I need is me. Fuck all the set standards of how society thinks I should live. Not one person gives a fuck less than I can. After my experience with romance I'd rather die than date again at this point. They all either cheat or leave and it's only a temporary feeling in the end that causes more harm than good. Good riddance that shitfest of a fake holiday called Valentine's day. Cupid can shove that arrow straight up his ass so far it comes out his mouth for making me feel so ashamed and miserable for being single for all those years. Oh and fuck god too for those shit genetics too those certainly didn't help. 

Now off to another plane of existence see ya next time in this reality. Have a good one fellow traveler of the internets."
169,"Hello,

I had a diagnosis last summer of PTSD with depersonalization symptoms. I am going to find a new therapist to get a final diagnosis and a second opinion. I was wondering if anyone could relate to some things that I do, that has been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder. 

When I was a kid I played that house game, like many other children. It just never went away for me and when I got into my tween years, I was take from school and left very isolated (neglected/emotional abuse) and I would pretend to be characters. I had three set characters (plus the side characters- it was very detailed) and still remember their names now. But I would also pretend to be animals. It usually involved me having magical powers. This then led me to pretend that a movie character or anyone that I liked was watching me. I knew it wasn't real though.

I finally stopped pretending to be made up characters when I was 17 years old. I have not acted out other characters since then, except for my occasional regression into child-like tendencies. I am a little (bdsm). 

Now I go to school and work full-time. Everything is going well, mostly but I still find myself pretending that certain people are watching me. I will pick a spot in the room and imagine them sitting there watching me. It helps me feel less alone but I realize that it sounds crazy and I do not tell anyone about this. 

Can anyone here relate to this? I find myself trying to understand why I do this and if anyone else does it or anything similar. 

Thank you,
Rose"
170,"So I had an emergency psychiatrist appointment today. I’m not coping. My keyworker was meant to attend with me but they were short staffed so I had to go alone. The cmht provided a cpn to sit with me and get me back safely because I was so distressed I couldn’t get myself back. One of the many reasons I needed staff with me as I do every time I go out.

I get back into the building and lose time. Then it’s 2 hours later and I’m in the lounge with the police, paramedics and my therapist. It seems my aggressive suicidal alter took over but no one will tell me what happened to get the police involved. I’m injured but not badly. From what I gather from my feelings before I felt abandoned and angry and unheard and uncared for and like my needs weren’t being met. I think this triggered a switch.

The police were going to rake me to hospital under a section 136 but didn’t because I switched back and seemed calm and just wanted to sleep. I took medication and went to bed I just woke up."
171,"Hello
Ive dealt with derealisation for the past 3-4 years and I believe its gotten worse.
I originally went to get help for it and I came back with a completely different diagnosis (they told me the reason for my train of thought and delusions was due to an incurable neurological condition, they never actually treated my problem, just informed me of the possible cause).
At first, my derealisation was mainly delusion-based. Then it developed into a severe anxiety symptom (my detachment would induce panic attacks and anxiety). But now I fear my detachment is constant.
My derealisation (ill call it DR) was never ever treated. I was never taught, in my years of ""mental health support"" how to not detach myself as a coping mechanism. In fact, they offered me anti depressants, as a way to detach myself in a more controlled way, yet I was already constantly detached. Over the past year, in certain situations, I blocked out all feelings. I would trick myself into forgetting all anxiety and worry and just doing things rather than letting my train of thought warn me of my boundaries. I would feel nothing in bad times to the point where now I feel nothing all the time. To be devoid of emotion yet still have access to thoughts when mentally ill is dangerous. I feel nothing everyday, it feels so empty. I have moments of laughter, but never really happiness. This paired with my extreme loneliness and isolation (which I have been trying for a very long time to change) has shuffled me into the area of suicidal thoughts.
Ive dealt with suicidal thoughts in the past, yet I felt emotion. These emotions and my emotional awareness helped me overcome the thoughts to an extent of not actually going through with it.
Now I have nothing holding me back and the idea of taking my own life feels like a great solution when living is just this big empty void. Ive tried to get help. I believe in helping yourself works.
Id like some advice from anybody who has felt emotionally detached (like a constant detachment) and has either received advice or taught themselves to get back in touch with how they feel. I currently have zero ways to help what im going through. Forcing myself to do things that are supposedly emotionally impacting do nothing except remind me further of my state because again, nothing works. Even as a very anxious person, or a very socially shy person, those things almost aren't part of me anymore. I haven't overcome my anxieties, Ive just blocked them out that much that they don't occur in my head anymore. Even this I know isn't healthy. Music helps me feel things to some degree. But I can't spend my life creating false emotions in my head instead of experiencing them in this life.
Ive never been mentally okay due to my neurological disorder, but this is the worst ive ever been and I can see it happening but I cannot feel it. Id rather be crying endlessly everyday than feeling nothing at all constantly. Its almost as if all my emotions are there and everything im supposed to feel is there yet this big foggy heavy cloud of numbness is on top of them and has filled my brain. To think and not feel is something I don't want anymore.
Its the most distressing thing ive dealt with, and id take my days of daily panic attacks over this if I could.
Thanks for reading."
172,"I read somewhere that a trait of Narcissists is that they believe that the world is unfair to them. I spend a lot of time feeling like its so unfair that people won't accept me or see the ""real side"" of me or that employers don't want to take a chance on me. Does feeling this way a lot make me a Narcissist? I don't act arrogant but I'll be honest I do judge others in sometimes a hypocritical way, like I'm not always so deep or authentic of a person but I often see others as superficial. I guess you could say that I ""love and hate myself"". I don't know, maybe my problem is just that I analyze myself too much and identify with fleeting thoughts, others have told me such. Anyone else have similar experiences?"
173,"I had extremely severre antidepressant withdrawal then got into extremely severe depression resulted from burning out from work at a same time one year and a half ago. Physically sick too.
Now physically almost recovered
But mentally....horrible.  Dissociated (detached from town body) and depersonalized .....scared but that’s how my brain works.  Feel i’ll go crazy. 
On Prozac for 8 weeks after 3 meds failed before this."
174,"I remember the days when I was younger and I could sympathise with everyone, I knew just what to say to the people who weren't  feeling good and people used to come to me for advice because I could emotionally connect with them so well.

But I've noticed since starting uni 2 years ago, I've lost my sympathy. And I dissociate more than i ever did. I can still empathise pretty well but, theres no emotion there, it's just, ""I understand you. I have been there. It sucks"" theres no emotion involved.

For my whole life I've had anxiety and panic attacks, but this last year, my anxiety has lessened, panic attacks never happen and it's mostly just low mood and dissociating when things get tough.

I'm wondering if my loss of sympathy is connected to my dissociation."
175,"This is something that happens to me every time I am dissociated (I THINK this is dissociation but I am really not sure. Haven't had the chance to talk about it a lot with my therapist until today) I just left a therapy appointment and almost the whole time I felt a pressure in my eyes as if I was dizzy, but I don't have trouble walking. I felt myself dissociating before I got there, in the car (I wasn't driving by the way) I just felt my mind was gradually going blank and i was disappearing. I had a hard time putting my thoughts into sentences...tried to explain to my therapist I am just so confused about everything right now. I'm just confused...I don't understand...we tried some grounding techniques with the senses but it didn't help much. Now I am home and I just can't shake this feeling , but I don't even know what the feeling is...uncomfortable...eerie...unsettling...I don't know...I Don't feel sad but I am crying a bit...just overwhelmed"
176,"Hey guys. 
I am constantly dissociated for about 2 years now and I am looking for some techniques to get rid of it.
It all started after a ""near death"" experience or at least I thought I would die. I had anxiety problems and panic attacks for months after that, but I am done with that now. The only thing that stays is this stupid dissociation. I already know the touch, see, and hear technique,but it's not helping very much. 
I am not able to go to a therapist for now. 
I know you can't stop this in an instant and I am happy if anyone can give me some tips. Most of the time people only talk about the symptoms or their story, but not what helps them cope with it, so that's why I am looking here. 
Thanks in advance"
177,"Hi,
I've just joined the forum and it would be great to talk to other people in the same boat as me.
I was traumatised as a child and suffer from dissociation sometimes as an adult. I haven't been formally diagnosed but I tend to detach from my emotions and have experience of derealisation/depersonalisation.
I have been seeing a therapist for a couple of years now and have slowly learnt to trust her. However she hadn't seen me in a dissociated state until recently when I turned up feeling completely detached and barely able to put a sentence together. It took a while but I managed to explain what was happening and that I had been feeling this way for most of the week. I was quietly hoping she might have some advice for how I can try to get out of this. Instead she asked what I wanted to talk about for the rest of the session. I wasn't capable of answering that and kept apologising. She then asked me why I hadn't cancelled the appointment due to not feeling ok. I didn't know how to answer that either. She then asked if I wanted to end the session early, which I guess was because I was struggling to talk. I was quiet for a minute then apologised for boring her. She then laughed and said we would leave it there for today. It was about 15 mins before we were due to finish and she has never done this before.
I don't know if I'm overreacting but I feel a bit rejected by the way she responded to me. I felt like she was uncomfortable with the situation and just wanted me to leave. Has anyone else experienced something similar?
Thanks for reading my very long post!"
178,"hi, its currently 5am where i am and i havent been to sleep yet... ive always struggled to sleep for as long as i can remember, it takes me so long to fall asleep. 
i struggle really badly with my self image, and i find it really hard to talk to people i care for about how im feeling because i dont want to worry them or burden them or seem like im seeking attention for it. 
i have no energy whatsoever, even when i do sleep, i feel exhausted even when i do force myself to leave the house. its taking a lot of energy from me to try and explain what im feeling because its hard to gather my thoughts and put them down in a sentence. 
i constantly feel like there is something wrapped around my brain, like cotton wool in my skull, like i cant focus clearly. my memory is awful and it seems to be getting worse. I think this specific feeling started to become significant to me around 2 years ago. 
i have extremely vivid dreams, and some are so ordinary i mistake them for actual memories because my memory is so bad. it often feels like i am so hopelessly trapped within this that i see no other way out than seriously harming myself, i dont know what has kept me from doing so, i guess im looking for an excuse to not feel any guilt in it. 
i feel guilty when i eat or perform basic tasks to benefit myself. 
ive been attempting to get medical help since being about 15 and honestly I’ve felt completely fobbed off by all doctors, or completely terrified by how they have treated me. 
i am now nearly 19 and was put on 50mg sertraline around 3 months ago, honestly it didnt feel like it helped me at all, it just heightened my feelings of anxiety and inability to sleep. i have also experienced very tight muscles in my jaw and fatigue. 
almost 4 weeks ago, i was upped to 100mg sertraline despite my request to change to a different medication as it was standard protocol. since then, everything seemed to heighten. 
I was kept awake all night for no apparent reason other than the medication, which i do take in the morning. the following night i experienced what i believe to be hallucinations, i saw a big lizard like man in front of my bathroom door from my bed and a cat on top of a speaker just walking on the spot. this caused me to unexpectedly have a really large panic attack (thats all i can describe it as) and i was hysterical in tears until around 2am. I put it down to sleep deprivation. 
my feelings of intense sadness and suicidal thoughts are slowly creepinng back in, almost like the medication is doing nothing at all except causing some nasty side effects for me on top of it all. 
i have a doctors appointment booked for monday, but i came home to live with my mum for 2 weeks as i felt unsafe on my own. 
I feel like nothing can fix me, and no one will tell me what is wrong with me. I don’t know what to do."
179,"I was diagnosed with did back in 2012.

So i have a 16 year old alter whom is extremely destructive. She often self harms in such a way that requires hospital treatment and sometimes surgery and intensive care. Yesterday I found a suicide note from her and today I have found certain things that could be used to carry it out. I have handed them in to staff at my care home and made them aware of the situation and they are checking on me regularly but I’m at a loss as to why she does this. I’m not due to see my therapist until Tuesday but staff have said they will inform her of the situation tomorrow and see if she can see me. My keyworker is on annual leave which sucks bc my alter talks to my keyworker.

I guess what I’m wondering is how do I remain in control until this can be sorted? I have taken my meds and am just relying on hopefully sleeping until my therapist comes into work and taking it from there. 

My alter is obviously in a lot of emotional pain but how do I get through to her? She doesn’t seem to realise we are safe now. She is determined to not be hurt again so she doesn’t want to be here."
180,"It's Saturday and once again I am very depressed and can't even talk about it.

More and more everyday I wonder why I am still alive. I feels as if I have outlived my usefulness and I am becoming a burden on those around me. 62 years old and its seems I couldn't buy a job. No longer the man I used to be and I see the world has changed faster than I have kept up. I wish I could just end it all but would never put that pain or stigma on my family. Sometimes I think how lucky those individuals are that have accidental deaths. No stigma on the survivors and a clean exit.

I guess I can always hope for some crazed shooter - there seems to be more and more of them, especially here in Texas."
181,"I have delusional disorder.

I deal with delusions every day.

I'm very sick of them. I wish they were gone.

I usually ownly have one main delusion that takes all my focus.

I start fixing it by finding real life evidence to counter-believe it.

But when I counter-believe the delusion another one pops up soon after.

This has been going on for a while.

IDK where to put this. Having delusional disorder is so rare that their is isn't a forum for it (it would be silly to have one as well)."

184,"Hi all,

New to the forum.

I have four alters, it caused me to lose 3 jobs in two years, my driving license and a lot of my freedom at home.

I have been on an anti-psychotic since June 2019 and since this time, have only dissociated a few times after this and for a few hours. My last major dissociation caused me to be admitted to hospital.

I know tablets are damaging but I also know they work, they cannot harm anyone and their voices are quieter.

Is there light at the end of the tunnel? I don't really know....all I know is if I stop medication what will happen, do I risk it or do I submit.

I feel quite stable already but I cannot afford to unstable financially and my marriage couldn't take it.

My wife wants the old me again but I think they are long dead."

I've been under the impression that I've been suffering with depersonalisation for just over a year. That may still be the case, but someone recently said to me, what if it's fibromyalgia. A good amount of the symptoms are the same.

Just wondering if anyone has either or both, or even thought they had one then realised they had the other. Also anyone have an experience beating these?"

I seem to have some symptoms but it only happens when my anxiety flairs up really bad and this only started because of work don’t no were to turn as my manager (old store) is makeing it hard for me 😭"
189,"i don't know if this belongs here, so sorry in advance i'm very new to forums.

i guess i'm just really struggling to figure out whether i should get help or not, like i feel like this isn't normal but i can't be sure. i'm too scared to talk to anyone i'm close to about it and i need to vent somewhere. so here goes.. 

i have almost no memory from my childhood and up until mid 2018. most of the things i can remember from that far back are things people told me happened, not me actually remembering. and the few memories i've actually retained make me dizzy? like thinking about them for too long makes my head fuzzy and my heart rate picks up and i get dissociate-y. not a pleasant experience. 
it really screws me over not remembering anything and i've lost a lot of friends throughout my teen years due to that. fights i don't remember happening, things i don't remember saying, just things in general i don't remember. i just have years and years full of blanks. one of my friends actually said to me earlier this year that he thought i was just being an a**hole this whole time, lying saying i don't remember things, but i actually just don't remember things. and i feel so bad to hear that i've wronged someone or was a bad person at times and have no memory of doing it. and when they tell me i've done something like that i always feel like i would never ever do something like that?? like it wasn't a me thing to do? even with positive experiences, it hurts that i can't ever recall a memory someone else cherishes. the person in all those memories never feels like me. i'll look at old pictures of myself too and it feels so so strange. it's all so hard to fully explain. 

i don't hear voices or anything, like actually in my ears, but every day i have at least one slip up when i ask someone near me what they said and they didn't say anything at all. that's probably normal though. what i think's not normal is my own thoughts don't feel like my own. they're always racing and random unrelated things pop into my head and i have to take a second to process it. really bad negative thoughts too that come out of nowhere. i get lost just staring every day. lost in my thoughts and whatever. dissociating. time passes and i have no sense of it. yesterday i walked outside and immediately thought it was december 20-something, 2018, when it was december 31 of 2019. that happens a lot, and that's just one example. 
i guess i was kind of close though...

i haven't gone to therapy in months and months but i have been diagnosed with depression, severe social anxiety, and c-ptsd. i tell myself it's just the depression eating at my brain & stealing my memories away but it's freaking me out now, especially because i'm in a good place mentally and i STILL feel foggy, unreal, like i'm not in my own body and i can't remember ANYTHING ever. i feel like i'm going absolutely crazy. :low:"
190,"We've just started therapy but once we go home it's incredibly hard to remember what happened during the session - brought this up and we've agreed to write down a summary at the end! :)

Whilst the issue above should be pretty much sorted, there's still the issue that I will dissociate halfway through a question if it digs too ""deep"" into personal emotions... an example would be
""Why do you blame yourself for that?""
And I'll just completely and totally forget what we're talking about or what the start/end of the sentence was...the sentence and topic will have to be repeated about twice. It's super annoying and I was just wondering if anyone else has this so I'm not alone, and what they've done about it.

It's funny because my memory is exceptional on the whole...until someone asks something personal and then I can't remember anything at all, lol.

I think some of my alters also intentionally ""block"" me from talking about personal stuff too... for example I know exactly why I self harm but I forgot that I knew why when the therapist asked about it...weird... and I really trust her so it's prettyyy annoying that they'd literally wipe my memory for a while :(

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice or can relate 
:thanks:"
191,"Hi. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I was hoping I could get some advice. My partner and I have been together for a year and a half. This september she started showing signs of DID, when a child alter came out for the first time. She has been rapidly progressing with these symptoms but doesn't want to tell her parents, who we live with, that its been happening. There are now three alter personalities that have been taking over regularly. One of them is three, the other one is seven and the other one is a fourteen year old boy who seems to change in age sometimes. The child alters require lots of support and care as they are not as capable of doing things for themselves, especially the three year old who can't make her own food or drinks. 

I'm not sure what to do, my partner has just been given a new CAMHS worker who is doing really well with working on the symptoms of BPD that she has been displaying for a few years now.

What can i do to help my girlfriend and should I push her to let her parents know about her DID symptoms?"
192,"Is this normal? Or at least heard of?

This started after my meaning crisis/existential depression started. I have the hardest time feeling that feelings matter? Usually i tell myself ""im a living creature and if im able to feel, i shouldnt have to feel pain/suffering."" and try to go on with my day until it hits again. I feel numb to feelings. It like i know they are there but im not identified with them anymore. Not even with feeling good or loving. Empathy/sympathy is also mostly depleted or numbed down. I still try not to be selfish though as i always cared deeply about others feelings. But now its as if all feelings are insignificant? I get constant nagging thoughts that feelings arnt important, in anyone, especially myself. I think this started after i started meditation a year ago and after observing how thoughts and feelings just enter and leave, it feels like nothing that comes in matters? I feel hallow as an observer and no longer identify with myself as i used to. Especially after looking into spirituality stuff...Spirituality really made it worse because i started seeing the ego as imaginary, fake. And nothings real. I already had dp/dr before i got into spirituality. Now i dont know where im at now. I went back to thinking as an atheist again and things sorta make sense again. idk. i think about how everything is either ""good"" or ""bad"" and how everyone wants the good. Deep down i think i want that too. I want to be able to say ""i feel great!"" or ""i feel bad"" and actually feel and understand like i used to. But somethings disconnected in my brain? I just cant see the point in living or why its special either..."

What's really frustrating is that I have a permanent slight feeling of disassociation that never goes away - my head feels not quite sharp, slightly apart from the world, just a little bit foggy and full.

I have no idea how to reduce it though? Any tips for what I do to feel ""normal"" and sharp?"

Wanted to kill, I did not let that, now wants at least to do some justice.. But I know her well so I can not trust her. She will start will small revenge in the end she will like doing bad things and she will end killing people. She is pretending to save me if I let her, but nothing can save me. This will only do more harm to me.

199,"Hello !

I’m a 20yo young girl. I have been anxious my whole life like since I’m a little child, my parents never like to communicate with me when I was a child (When I’d talk to them they would tell me to leave them alone because what I would say was “pointless” to them) so I always had to keep every little and big feelings for myself, therefore I grew up VERY introvert, anxious and lonely.

Today I have to deal with a lot of mental issues but what I will talk about in this post it’s about how dp and dr are ruining my life !


My first dp/dr was when I was 17yo after a enormous panic attack. You know how we say dp/dr happen a lot when your life is changing well it was my case : I was in my first year college after graduating high school, so it was a new environment to me, I was about to reach the age of majority, so it was a big step in my life plus I met a lot lot of new people and in the other hand a lot of friends from high school was far from me, in different places now.

To be clear, I didn’t made this panic attack because my life was changing, I was ruminating about something else.

Therefore when I finished my panic attack I felt so weird, so blurry ! Usually after panic attack I return to “normal” But this time I felt like it was different, I was different, I was not me anymore, it was so weird... I felt like the memories I got from high school was not mine anymore but someone else’s ! I couldn’t understand what happened to me. Then I start to have existential crisis, my vision of life had change de and my life became senseless to me, I would everyday and every seconds question the things around me, the people around me, I felt like I was a robot that was doing things automatically. Apparently it was what we called cognitive dissonance.

I wish it would never happened.

Progressively, I tried to see the positive side of this phenomen, I thought it would help me to become less shy, to be more daring, to enjoy life more. I still felt like high school memories are not mine anymore but I went ahead though and progressively I start to feel way better.

Except that,

Recently after a panic attack I made dp/dr after AGAIN and it crushed me.

It was during the beggining of October and there were a lot of changing in my life : After 3 years in my former college I decided to go to a new one in a city far from mine. I just had my driving licence and I got my first job and I’m about to reach what a lot of people call the “international majority”

I’m sick of it ! I start to think ; So that would happens every time there are some changes in my life ?

I think the first time I overcame this because I was still in my teenage years, I was still perceived as a child you know (well yes it’s true that grown people may still see 20ish people as children tho)

Now I feel like my 3years college years memories are not mine, like my high school years you know and it’s scare me so much, that’s not how life is supposed to be, it’s supposed to be a continuity....

What if it happens again when I’m 27 because I will be about to get married ? and then when I’ll be 30, because I will have kids and a carrier ? When I’ll be 45/50 because of menopause ? What if it happens when I’m 65yo so I would feel my whole life never happened ? That’s so terrible I wanna get out of this...

This is terrible because now I’m afraid of getting old because I feel the more I grow up the more I take the risk to have dp/dr again... the irony is originally I was not afraid of getting old, to me it was natural but now I feel like it’s a fatality... I was ok with the fact that one day I would wake up wisely old with a lot of memories of my youth but now I feel like one day I will wake up and feel like a never experienced my youth, feel like I was old my old life....


Now I feel like my 3years college years memories are not mine, like my high school years you know and it’s scare me so much, that’s not how life is supposed to be, it’s supposed to be a continuity....

I’m trying to seek help but I feel professionals don’t take this seriously! feel I’m ready to take everything that could help me get out of this spiral; treatments, specific medecine, hypnose? I would even be ready to take some electro shocks if it was possible...


I remember in High school I couldn’t wait to be 20 I was not afraid of the furture but now I wanna go back to high school and live those years again before the dr/dp, even tho if I was depressed because the cognitive dissonance is WORST to me.

Now I’m becoming crazy, I’m making a lot of effort to not have a panic attack again in order to not have dp/dr but I know I can’t hold it forever so idk what to do..."
200,"I hadn’t realized what ive been experiencing was dissociation until recently. I thought for the last few years i have just been able to be progressively calmer. After it started happening my panic disorder had completely stoped and i only had a attack maybe 3 times since. I was completely fine with disassociating cause i no longer felt anxious, but i also dont feel much emotion at all.
    Its was getting progressively worse and i hadn’t realized but now its just part of my life. I hate it, i feel like im not in my body. My real life feels basically the same as my dreams and its hard for me to tell what’s happened in real life or if it was only in my dreams. I have barely any motivation for anything because i dont feel real and nothing feels real so i have no care for many things i do. Im failing all my classes at the moment cause i havent had any motivation in doing school work.
    I really want to start therapy but im so scared of it not helping or being given medication and it not helping and then feeling theres no escape from the nothingness i feel. Any tips on how to help not dissociate constantly?"
201,"I feel so remote and empty, i feel so distant, i dont feel like a person or human, please help me get round this."
202,"I feel like sense I broke down and went to therapy and she said schizoaffective that I’ve been way worse. It’s most likely anxiety but I feel like I can’t stay in reality much at all now. And then I hear other “me’s” in my head telling me that I’m faking it, that nothing is wrong and I’ve ruined my family’s lives by telling a shrink I can see spirits. But I feel like I’m going to float away. I mean I understand that’s not “real” .. I can’t just float away. I guess it’s like my spirit is going to float away. And I’m trying so hard not to dissociate but when I try to stay I forget who I am and what I’m doing here and everything looks so strange like it isn’t mine. But I feel like shit wasn’t this bad a few weeks ago before I started telling people about all this. Which makes me think maybe this isn’t really real. Just like a test run and I’ll get to reset and start this week over."

He thinks charlie just has a bad mindset when she says she isnt in control of the fact that another alter will kill her next year..."
204,"Hi all!
i have suffered from chronic Dissociation all of my life due to childhood Tramua .As I got older it gradually turned into something that was always there & always happening.for the longest time i figured maybe I was just daydreaming too often or maybe I was just a boring bleak person but over time I noticed certain things.like feeling extremely numb emotionally mentally and physically.not being able to distinguish reality from what was going on in my head.i noticed I wud have times where I felt extremely detached physically and could see myself.sometimes I felt extremely childlike and would shelter myself n this void n my head.sometimes j wud go days and weeks in this weird headspace only to wake up one day like wtf where have I been?i noticed I was never angry or even sad sometimes just extremely bleak and feeling like I was on autopilot.i started talk therapy finally in 2018 and emdr this year where I've been diagnosed.eventhough I have a better understanding of what's going on with me I am not able to make the episodes stop or lessen.I did have a 2/3 weeks period where I came out of it finally and was actually able to feel like really feel reality but soon after I experienced some negative feelings and I've been dragged backwards all over again. This is literally a living hell and no one understands. My interactions with love ones or anyone n General are misconstrued or misunderstood.i also suffer from major depressive Disorder and anxiety.sometimes I fear this is the rest of my life."
205,"Last October towards the end of the month I had a sudden panic attack brought on by feelings of unreality, all of a sudden I didn’t feel real, nothing around me felt real and I felt confused and scared. Following this I returned to my family home where I stayed for 4 months, I was put on fluoxetine 20mg and only left my bedroom around 4/5 times in the whole 4 months, my symptoms included;


Feelings of unreality
Not sure what was real and what was inside my head
People around me seemed fake and in my imagination
Felt like I was stuck in dream
Glass wall between me and the real world 
Questioning reality, such as what is reality and why this was
Questioning the meaning of life, such as why are we here, how are we here, is there a god 
Questioning what happens when you die 
Wondering what came before the universe and the meaning of infinite 




My anxiety and panic was sky high 24/7, constantly shaking, loss of breathe, sensitive to light and sound, hypersensitive. When this all eventually died down I was stuck in a deep hole of depression, thinking there is no point to life, we have no meaning, why are we here, we all die eventually and nothing we do matters, physically I was feeling numb, tired and empty. I since have tried different medication and doses, CBT therapy, meditation, read philosophy books, and had no relief from this depression at all, I am stuck in a deep pit of feeling suicidal, numb and lack of motivation as life has no meaning, nothing we do matters, no one knows why or how we are here, just overall what’s the point. I really don’t know how to beat this nihilistic depression, I feel like now I have allowed these thoughts to enter my brain there’s no going back to my life before, just enjoying the basic things and not thinking about all these big scary questions. 



When I saw a therapist in January she diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, PTSD and panic disorder."
206,"Hello I'm Hailey I'm new here, I'm still not sure how to describe what I'm going through or if I do/don't have derealization...?
I feel completely disconnected from myself, the world, and everyone around me, it feels like my brains been shut off? and I cant turn it back on It always looks like I'm dreaming, not fully there, experiencing things, or watching a film, I know it's me but it feels like someone else experiencing it, a good example I've found is from SpongeBob when plankton made the robot mr Krabs, in which I'm plankton and my body is the robot, as if I'm just puppet-ing myself around, I have memories but it feels like they aren't mine or I haven't experienced them before, I don't know who I am and I feel empty, distant, and scared, it's like stopping existing but the body is still here, I still haven't found a good way to explain it, It's been like this for over a year now and I haven't had a break from it since, I'm so confused, I confuse therapists when talking about it, it's like there's a thin wall of glass between me and reality everything looks different too I hope someone understands or can relate or I could receive some advice I just want to know I'm not alone in this and how to better myself, thank you. Sorry if I've confused anyone"
207,"English is not my first language. 
I am being treated at a specialist clinic for DDNOS. 3 appointments in and I dont have answers to the questions asked by my therapist. At home I experience an intense feeling of fear but cant find words to describe why og how. I am at the point where my story has been told and what comes next seems impossible to relate to at home and in theraphy. I dont know how I feel or what I feel. I've never been here in treatment before. How to deal? I dont know who of the different parts of ""me"" are here. Anyone who can relate?"
208,"I feel like there's another person living inside me. For years I have always tried to bottle emotions inside. This has caused me to constantly put on a face to be what the world wants me to be and keep my anger and bitterness inside. I think anger and bitterness has become it's own personality. Sometimes when I'm alone it feels like I am arguing with an angrier and bossier person. I don't trust people and it feels like another person inside me is forcing me to push others away and insisting that the world is not a place where I can trust people. Less than 2 years ago I named this supposed person dark me and after switching jobs this dark me was who I decided I was and went in the new job with a wall up and refusing to talk to people. When it was required to be nicer it felt like a different person came to the surface, a polite and shy person. This dark side of my personality has also recently been referred to as the boss because I feel like I have to satisfy this side of me and keep my distance from people so this side of me will be content.
I also think my confident and humorous side is also a separate personality. Sometimes I feel nervous talking to people, but will still feel like being polite and won't laugh easily. Other times I have no fear in the world and can be cocky and funny and sometimes when I feel shy and polite this side of my personality encourages me.
I have no idea what's going on with me. I feel crazy and don't know where to go to deal with this. I don't know if this is real or in my head and don't know what to do."
209,"Hello

I have been diagnosed with DID when i was at university in Brighton. At the time it felt like the first time i had been actually listened to. However i do not seem to have the severe symptoms that i see others have (from my desperate attempts to understand it). Friends have told me i switch into a little girl called Lucy, i do suffer amnesia and find things i have done without knowing. I have three distinct voices and feel i am constantly at odds with them. But i generally don't switch (other than what i was told happened around a year go) or have distinct alters and so forth. Other than being told i have DID no one actually gave me much information on what that meant. 
My real issue is i worry i do not have DID (I also have Cpstd and NEAD). 
Since graduating and moving back to my hometown in Devon my mental health workers completely ignore the DID and focus on my other conditions. Even when I mention the voices i hear they tell me its anxiety and stress. One even told me it was not a real condition which i completely disagree with but made me feel very vulnerable. 
I do take antipsycotics and am waiting for therapy. I just feel so lost and afraid and alone in this. 
I guess I am just looking for someone to talk to who believes me."
210,"am i a prick for wanting to dissociate from my family, brother, sister and parents?"
211,"Hi all,

I'll try keep this brief...I've had anxiety for a long time but the past 2 years I've been having an issue with a dizzy sensation which I think might be linked to derealization, which I think I might have?

This dizzy sensation will come out of the blue where I felt fine before...i get a very sharp and sudden feeling of dizziness in my head that lasts a split second and i get that 'stomach drop' feeling like when you're swinging back on a chair which goes through my whole body, I dont actually fall or anything and think from the outside you cant tell anything has happened.

Sometimes this has led to me feeling like I'm living in a daydream, I feel my head is sort of in a bubble and sound itself sounds different in my head but it doesnt actually sound any different (if that makes any sense) I feel like theres a slight barrier between me and reality and this is VERY overwhelming and tends to stop me from what I'm doing and cant hold conversations properly, this only lasts for maybe 30 mins at most. Does this sound like derealization?"
212,"So.. I guess I can try this, I don't intend to downplay anything anyone is going through, just trying to figure out somethings for ourselves. 
First, I have a headmate, but we've always been unsure of labels since he doesn't really fit in an alternate personality. But he's not really a typical tulpa, or imaginary friend. we're unsure of where to mention it to people since he kind of plays a big part in my life, adding in comments to something someone says and insisting I talk to him verbally, essentially just to make sure I don't go completely mute, without him I'd go days without talking and when I'd actually have to talk I'd find my voice failing. Does anyone end up having to explain alters to new or old friends that never knew?

and the second thing, depersonalization, being trans, and with social anxiety and PTSD, when I get a moment of disassociation, it is hard to break out of it, as bringing attention to my body is pointing out everything that testosterone did wrong, it's hard to even feel human at times, when people downplay transition, or straight up ignore it, or you have no one will stick around, how do you ground yourself?"
213,"Feels like nothing is real. We're not real. The Universe isn't real. The INFINITE isn't real. If nothing is real then what is? What is anything? What is everything?
???!!!
:panic::hankie::confused:"
214,I’ve  been having symptoms of derealization for over 3 years now. It feels like i’m in a video game 24/7. i’ve only felt real twice recently when i was under the influence of marijuana. I get super happy because I feel actually real & like i’m in reality again so my heart races & as soon as it slows back down I don’t feel real again. I just feel like a meer existence all the time. My brain has been screaming for the past couple of days and i’m just so tired of living. My seasonal depression is hitting and i’m just so exhausted from everything.
215,"Hello all! First time here. it’s a long one - but I need answers. Appreciate you reading however done a little TLDR, to mainly encourage you to read all, that’s why it’s at the top, 'cuse the ramblings. 😉

TLDR
Accidentally overdosed a supplement, containing THC, causing these thoughts
Never really felt myself, not understood why I’m here, constantly searching for more.
Bullied at school, my stomach played up when I was bullied and super anxious about going in that day, sometimes I got the day off, sometimes I didn’t - just dependent on how ‘bad’ I looked judged by my Mother.
Struggling through chosen career, ‘pretending’ to be a chippy, apparently, (please read on - chancer)
Fear with not making my family proud, I feel the pressure is on me to have children, partner etc, because my brothers a bit awkward and been seen for his success, not raising of family

I’ve been ill these past 2 weeks, with ‘stomach illness’
Collected my thoughts, sudden realisation of who I am. Is this me?
I don’t feel any discomfort in my stomach anymore, funnily.
Yet, I’ve a doctor’s appointment for morning - for the 3rd time in 2 weeks, better cancel that...
No second thoughts,, I'm going to have the rest of this week off, to get my head in check.
Please, please read the full... I NEED THINGS TO CHANGE.

School History
Primary School
Back in Year 4; I moved schools and had various medical issues, I had to walk around school with headphones due to making my ears hurt badly. This caused embarrassment and further questions / attention when I returned to school. I always remember the questions, and then the taunts and even counsellors getting involved to check I was ‘faking’. I didn’t try to make friends.
I remember one kid, always stays with me.
Asked “Why did you leave your last school?”
“Because I was harmed in the neck by another pupil”
“OK, so if I harm you, will you leave?""

And then proceeded to try. I called for a teacher, and he let go. Wait - this was before these illnesses. Oh, and had ‘stomach’ issues to have the time off..

Secondary School
I was about to leave secondary school, nothing untoward had happen except the verbal comments sometimes, and the odd punch (We’re kids, right, bound to happen). I was debagged, a few saw, the rest heard. “Oh, I heard”, I even had the guy who did this to me, say “I wouldn’t have done that if I had known” - Small dick joke.

Anyway, I shrugged this off. We were all released on study leave, it was my last year.

Job History
I tried to setup my own company, contracting, maintenance and repairs. I was in my middle 20s, and now 5 years on, in this moment. I realise I was out my depth. ""Chancer” - Been called that plenty of times in the Construction Industry, bah one for another day.

I paid my board money during this, but my mother did far more for me than expected. Gave it 5-6 months, then started working for someone. I appreciate it but haven’t paid her back, yet. If I do make it big, she’ll be first to get the share.

I feel everything I try; I jump from... Past 3-4 years I’ve had numerous of occupations, shopfitter, joiner, call centre, labourer, maintenance assistant. I seem to struggle to hold a job down, I hate to do things wrong, make daft mistakes sometimes…

I’ve been with this company nearly a year and I like but I feel it’s “getting to that stage” - it’s odd that just within 2 months, I underestimated a job and cost the company 2-3 days’ work without pay to cover my wages. I’ve only, tonight put the correlation together with this to.

I feel I want out of construction, it’s full of sharks, and back-stabbers... mainly how I feel about my colleagues, maybe it’s a side effect of the THC, but it all seems to make sense right now.

Family
Like any son, with morals. I want to make my family proud. I realised, tonight. My mother struggled a lot raising me, with my various health problems when growing up. She was ill a lot when I was first born. I feel I haven’t repaid her gratitude without going to university, you see my brother, was top of the class at University, and then within the 1st year of him graduating - they employed him to teach, wow. That still impresses me now.
My brother helped me through school all the way. I had no interest, although tried. I used to behave in lessons and be a good student. I left however with 14 A-C GCSEs, didn’t do too badly. He helps me draft letters and such to this date, I need to snap out of this.

Dating
I’m scrolling on dating apps, get close to people - stringing them on a little, but crafty. When it comes to the crunch, “It’s me, not you” phase - and leave, after sex. Sucks! I need to change this, so shitty. I’ve never ‘ghosted’ though. I’m scared, maybe of commitment, or my small dick?

Summary
Lately, I’ve been ill and depressed. My stomach has been playing up - IBS, this used to happen at school when I was getting bullied.
Not sure if it’s a way of my body telling me, things aren’t going smooth, please find an alternative.

What’s different? I didn’t get ‘high’ while writing this, although consumed some THC through a tincture. I’m going to stop taking this supplement from tonight, depending on your reaction I’ll even throw away.

Questions
Please help why I feel like this continuous feeling?
Have I suffered denationalisation from the courses of antibiotics from my medical issues?
Is it boredom, lack of achievement?
Do I require counselling?

My mother describes it as scared of commitment, commitment to job, commitment to girls (I date, but don’t get ‘close’ to people, when they get close, I tend to push them away, intentionally?!)

I went to counselling - 1 session, the ‘introductory’ she mentioned I could be an Over Sensitive Person*. I remember, she leant me a book, but I distracted myself from reading and handed back waiting for a text message off her as prompt, posting through her letterbox. I didn’t reply to the follow up texts afterwards or leave review on her page. Shit, I just feel shitty about that also.
*That everything I do, or act, is how people ‘represent me’ I feel it’s true, after tonight.

EDIT: Sudden realisation, I’ve been off work (2 weeks, 1 sick, 1 holiday) I’ve tonight, put the correlation together I’ve subconsciously been job hunting.

Am I fucking high, or is this the real me?


Noticed, I've followed in my father’s footsteps, he was always in his shed when I was growing up, he aspired to be a carpenter but ended up driving instead, limited opportunities when he was young around these parts (35-40 years ago)
Note, he didn't have a father growing up."
216,"Hey, so I don't even know exactly how or what to say.

I feel detached from myself, life seems to just occur around me and I am just there to look at it, not part of it. I feel like a spectator at a theatre and my life is what's happening on stage.

I can't seem to connect with anyone anymore, I am just there most of the time around people, not really having any input to give or react to what they say or do.

My relationship isn't far off either, while I am more open and talkative, it still doesn't feel like I am truly myself.

I feel a sense of loss of who I used to be and the new person that I am isn't to my liking, a badly fitting mask which I do not know how to take off.

Lately I've become even more detached, I have anxiety and depression (the later being something somewhat new) and the events in my life for the past 3 years made everything feel more and more intense to the point where I couldn't control my anxiety and sense of nothingness. As a coping mechanism (I think), I've started to just be less attached to anything, my anxiety is lower but so is everything, I just can't care or feel the need to react to anything or anyone anymore. It's a false sense of peace that comes with the price of losing myself with both good and bad.

I don't know what to call this but it seems to fit here."
217,"Hi everyone,
I’ve posted here a few times during my struggling with depersonalization, which is finally calming down for me now.

But I have another uncomfortable feeling in the process of recovery and wondering if anyone experienced this too.

I am feeling more connected to the world again but now I feel like I understand it differently than I used to. I see the days as meaningless steps towards an inevitable death. I can’t understand how I lived without this futility in mind and I don’t think I will ever live without this thought weighing over me again.

I feel changed since my experience and I feel isolated in my thinking. I tripped myself out my whole life with existential thoughts but could always pull myself back from them but since my acute depersonalization I can’t seem to escape the thought that I will die and be gone so what is the point in all of this charade that we call life?

It’s so morbid I know but I can’t help it. Anyone relate after long term depersonalization? Did you feel better in time?

Any feedback would be so much appreciated."
218,"We post too much stuff recently but

What can I do because I feel so scared all the time and like someone is about to hurt me and I have no one to turn to so I just feel all alone and sad and terrified of her father and the house...


And I keep on giving everyone panic attacks I feel bad because they're almost continuous over the last few days"
219,"Morning everyone.

I'm finding myself waking up and forgetting that I can make my own day, forcibly at that. I wake up in a rush, knowing I have nowhere to be, I wake up forgetting that I can smile, waking up to see in the mirror this sad human being staring back at me, they look somewhat familiar, normally in the eyes. Have you forgot how to smile? How long have you gone without just cracking one? What are your coping mechanisms for dealing with dissociation, can you remember to smile?

Ramble over.

220,"(Charlie)
Over the past week or so after we ran away, we've been having some trouble regarding emotions. None of us breathed properly even once yesterday, because we are all too stressed. First Jessy was brought out, and she was crying because of how scared she is of this house. Then Sally came out to protect Jessy and started crying too because she wasn't made to cope with this level, or kind, of stress.

So then we met someone new, called Daisy. She's really sociable and her name is quite fitting, seeing as she hides as a daisy when she's on the inside haha. 

(Daisy) I'm just there to helpppp~ helping is good :)

(S)
So then I (S) admitted something beforehand. I fulfil the persecutor role, I guess. Am I ashamed of this? No. I might be hurting Charlie in particular, but that is all completely necessary. My mission is to remove her from this house. Escape is good. I don't see any other way forward.
-
What absolutely scares me is that the parents aren't even ours. And yet they claim to be. It's not at all good.
-
Anyways, the point of this post was just to say that
*We have a new alter called Daisy, for coping socially
*S (me) is and has always been good, even if (literally) on the surface I have been causing apparent harm to Charlie. My next plan of action is to stop her from eating & drinking. Surely that will remove her?

(Daisy again)
Feel free to share your thoughts 🥰🥰🌸
Thanks :)

221,"I will feel awful mentally and during I feel like how I feel will never end and anything and everything about the future seems like hell. Also I can be balling my eyes out over something and then like the flip of a switch completely feel nothing about the situation. No more sadness no more anger, couldn’t even cry if i could. Anyone relate?"
222,"I don't fit in anywhere. I can't make friends anymore. I can't keep the friends I used to make. I'm so terrified of people. I isolate. I don't know how to communicate with people. I feel fake, unreal, I feel like a dream, a total lie. I have a phobia of myself. I'm self destructive. I feel like my human body is only a whole body mask hiding this weird creature I really am inside. I'm not human inside, like maybe my soul should have went into another life forum. Sad as it is. I do long for valueble friends. Maybe even a lover. But it feels so wrong, so foreign. I'd have to be a real human for that! :low:"
223,"Around midway last year I started getting the feeling of what one would describe as derealisation. for about hours or a couple days on end. I felt like nothing could be decided by me and I was trapped inside my own body with no choice but to sit back and watch in horror. THe world around me sort of fazed out. I remember feeling like this for a week at one point. The thing is, I haven't had a massive trauma in the past and I've never suffered with such things before. I havent gotten it in a while and it seems to only happen when Im most depressed. (I suffer from S/h and depression)."
224,"Today is just really weird. I feel out of place, i can't focus or remeber things, my head feels like its empty and spacey. I just keep zoning out and whenever i come back and move my head tp a different direction it feels like that trail camera effect where it lags. 

Things don't seem to interest me.

This happens every so often (not frequently) and the last time something major happened was on a long car trip. I was looking out the window and things started looking fake. The clouds are where it started. They looked 2D, painted onto the sky. Kinda like they were drawn on cardboard and hung up. Then the trees started looking the same. Like lines of background for a play or something, not like actual 3d, real items. The cars started feeling the same. Things just seemed off.

Currently I'm just feeling the first paragraph though, what would you guys say whats up? I'm not sure if its dissociating or derealism"
225,"My therapist who I've been seeing for over 5 years.  Has informed me that she won't be my therapist any longer.  Her reason I have to many medical problems and Dr appointment.  I may need major surgery.

228,"I have DID.  So, are my RA memories?  I think they are.  Cause of my reaction to them"
229,"I'm experiencing some type of depersonalization right now. Sorry, not sure if being inside or outside of the problem is more helpful. I'm going to try and describe how I feel. I guess I don't really feel anything. It's not depression, it's just over thinking everything around me. I'm over thinking what I'm writing in this, not sure if I've dotted my t's or crossed my i's. I cannot think my way out of feeling like this. If I could, I would. I think I get preoccupied with certain thoughts and can't shake them. I'm preoccupied now with the thought that I don't know if what I'm writing is making any sense, or maybe I'm not experiencing depersonalization, because that's what my mind is telling me. I'm preoccupied with thoughts when I'm just trying to get things done. I feel like I don't know if I'm inside or outside of the depersonalization, like it tells me I don't know whether or not I am in it. I am confused right now. I am thinking somewhat rationally, but I get preoccupied with things that don't matter at the time. Like I was concerned that I may have hurt my cat, when I know I didn't. Like I feel like the only way to get out of feeling like this is to go to sleep and I usually wake up feeling better. But I have no idea when this feeling will happen, like now that I'm writing this, maybe I'm feeling better. But then I try and get outside and do something, and I find myself confused again. I'm doing all right right now, but if I try to go do something, I will be all confused and not know how to do it. I feel like I am not making any sense. I get preoccupied with all sorts of things. Like, I won't know how to put my shoes on, or how to take a shower. Like I get preoccupied with whether or not I know how to open the door to my house. Help please."
230,"Does anyone have DID and other diagnosis?  I have DID, CPTSD and major depressive disorder."
231,"Hello all, 

I've been coping with dissociation and the such for quite a while now. I am glad it's a bit better now, the standard dissociation low is a bit higher than normal. 

I was wondering what your struggles are with dissociation/depersonalisation/derealisation in everyday life. Do you experience it as attacks from time to time or just a constant dissociation?

I have a dissociation that is almost 24/7 but there are better weeks and worse weeks, sometimes I get a sort of panic attack in combination with dissociation and I feel like the only thing holding me to this world is a thin thread (it's a very frightening thing). I am now in therapy and doing quite well :)

Hopefully you can shed some light on your struggles, coping with symptoms and how you feel about it."
232,"DISSOCIATION 🍄

I wanted to post about dissociation as it’s something I experience on a daily basis and I wanted to spread some awareness on this aspect of mental health. 

What is it? 
Dissociation is a psychological experience in which people feel disconnected from their sensory experience, sense of self or personal history.

Why it happens? 

For many people, it’s a natural response to trauma that they can’t control. It can be triggered by a one-off traumatic event or ongoing trauma or abuse. 
Some people choose to dissociate as a way of calming down or focusing on a task, or as part of a religious or cultural ritual
You might experience dissociation as a result of a mental health problem I.e. depression, anxiety, Post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder 
Or you might experience dissociation from alcohol, medication or when coming off medication 


Symptoms 

Feeling disconnected from yourself and your emotions 
A perception of the things and people around you as distorted and unreal 
Memory loss of certain time periods, events, people and personal information 
A blurred sense of identity

Treatments 

Various therapies including EMDR, CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy) and DBT (Dialectual behavioural therapy) 
Certain medications like antidepressants can help with related conditions 


My experience 
For a long time I didn’t realise what was happening to me. I felt like my body didn’t belong to me, it felt like I was watching from the outside and I wasn’t really there. Sometimes it would feel like I’m sleeping but my body is still moving and like I was disappearing. I often have to blink when my eyes would go blurry and foggy and pinch myself for a long while to get myself back to reality. I experienced various strange and quite scary symptoms. I often did strange things and made bad, unthoughout decisions during these episodes particularly when it got really bad and I was not with it. It had been happening far before I’d clearly started to notice it. At the beginning it can present itself in the most subtle ways and sometimes you just don’t realise it’s happening. The severity of my dissociation generally depends on the level of distress and anxiety I am experiencing in the moment, but it doesn’t always happen every time or have to happen that way. And other things. 

Dissociation can be scary especially if you have never experienced it before, but you don’t have to go through this by yourself. It is nothing to be ashamed of and your not alone. 

If you have any concerns please reach out to someone, a doctor, family member, friend, teacher, there’s always someone willing to help."
233,"I have recently come off my medication Citalopram 2-3 months ago.
A couple of days ago I was out as normal with my parents and suddenly became very spaced out and aware of time passing(I have experienced this a couple of years ago) my eyes became unfocused and I have since spent the last few days spaced out and not feeling myself, randomly bursting into tears. Is this dissociation? I don't feel normal and I don't know what to do"
234,I've officially given up on my daydreams. They've gotten too warped and it's become too exhausting to try to fix them all the time. I'm so unbelievably depressed about it. I don't know what to do. How can I stop the dreams becoming warped? I don't want to lose this part of me. It helps me deal with life. I'm so scared of what I'm going to do without them.
235,"Hi all.

So for a long time I have always had this feeling in me and up until I found out about different types of mental health and their effects I thought my feelings were normal. Now that I pay closer attention I want to know if it is something minor (which it probably is, I don't mean minor as in a mosquito bite so to speak, but more so if it is worth visiting the doctor about.) Or not. So when I go outside a lot of the time it doesn't feel real. Like I know I am walking, I can see I am, yet I feel like I'm not. Sometimes it feels like floating. Sometimes I'll feel like nothing is real and that the outside world is just a picture in my imagination. Although as I write this, it's weird, I can't remember truly the feelings or what I thought, it just sounds stupid as shit like I'm making it up. Although I'm not it feels it?! Weird.

Anyways, what I'm trying to ask is, does anyone else get that when they walk somewhere? Or if they do a task? They don't feel like they're doing it, they're aware they are but it feels fake? If so, what is it?"
236,"so i have been in floods of tears because i feel like i am not here and i feel i have lost myself .. so i started crying my eye's out like a baby , pain is all i felt , pain is all i feel sometimes .. if i'm not here then where am i , if i feel like i've lost myself it can be painful .. who else experiences this feeling of grief .... depersonalisation . derealisation .. dissociation i'm so tired of it all , i just want to feel here and ofcourse a lot of the time i don't and i question who is sitting here and i really do not know , one minute i feel like a broken child next minute i feel like a different gender, i'm always disconnected from myself and my body to the point where it gets too much . i hate this illness, it's a really horrible illness and it certainly feels so horrible at times . How do you cope with the feeling of not being there , feeling like you have disappeared into thin air and wandering who the hell you are? :-("
237,"I feel like I've been dissociating for years. I was diagnosed with anxiety when i was 13 and from then on the disassociation got progressively worse. I don't remember massive chunks of my past, I have conversations with people and rarely ever take in what they're saying, I wake up feeling disconnected and go to sleep feeling disconnected, I find it really hard to figure out sometimes if I'm here or not as nothing really feels real.
I've read about people dissociating for long periods of time but surely not this long? I just feel like I've lived the past 5 years of my life disconnected from reality 
I don't know if what's happening is disassociation, i just feel like I've zoned out and can't zone back in
Has anyone else had this problem?"
238,"Hello! I’ve had (social) anxiety as well as OCD for years now, and I’m finally getting my life back. It’s great, but I’ll still have serious mood shifts where I’m super happy and then go down to feeling depressed super quick. I can have a lot of breakdowns, where I don’t think straight and am in a dark place. And of course, I cry. Usually when I cry, I cry in front of a mirror (I just that’s just a quirk I have? lol). Seeing my reflection and also being in an upset state will sometimes make me feel really weird. This has been happening for years now, where once in a while I feel a certain way usually when I’m upset and/or seeing my reflection. I get a weird feeling of sort of forgetting who I am? I feel like the conscious person that I am at the moment is separate than who the person in my memories/the person whose name I have is. I’m sorry if this is confusing, I don’t know how to explain it and someone said to me once that it could be disassociation but I don’t know. It doesn’t happen often enough for me to believe I have a disorder, but I might be dissociating due to anxiety? I’m not sure. These episodes of confusion last about a minute at least. My memories feel weird during them. It’s hard to recall things and if I do recall them, they feel so distant, as if they’re from a movie I watched or something. It’s like I remember them all but I don’t. And I sort of just freak out while sort of asking myself, like, “ who am I?” “what is reality?” Type of things while crying usually. I get pretty scared even though I know I’m going through those things again. Thanks for any help :)"
239,"I've begun down the road of trying to get accepted as a candidate for ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) and I have realized I have absolutely no clue how it's going to affect my DID and I've never heard of another persons experience with both. This makes me nervous. 

I'm not saying I'm worried it's going to do anything impossible like make my alters disappear, ect, but ECT is just uncharted territory. For example, I think about how anti depressants often have an effect of suppressing communication between alters and so I know for a fact messing with the chemistry in the brain and whatnot can have an impact.

I really want to hear others experiences, if anyone does have any. I want to be prepared if there's any changes that may happen."
240,"So I’ve been going through a hard breakup for the last few months and it deeply affected my mental health.
Although I know I should let myself heal more on this matter, I find myself in situations where I’m attracted to someone and we end up getting involved, but whenever this happens my dissociation tends to get back or worse. I’ve pulled myself out of a deep hole with the help of the ones I trust but there is this situation that makes me feel like I won’t ever be able to be in a relationship again. 
Has anyone experienced something similar?"
241,"So I've been feeling this way for a while, except I wasnt sure why or what it was called. It doesnt affect my daily life too much, but it just makes life seem boring, meaningless, and weird. I'd describe my symptoms as feeling disconnected from my body, like my thoughts are separate from my body and when I look in the mirror, I'm not looking at me. When I focus on my own movements, it feels like I'm controlling someone else. I'm always experiencing this unless I can distract myself by talking to people or something else, but when I'm alone it's hard. It's like, I know I'm me and I am this body but it just doesnt make any sense to me how I can make myself move and think and everything without doing anything? But also when I talk to other people sometimes it feels like I'm talking to robots and nobody and nothing is real, or I'm talking to hallucinations. This doesnt happen as often though.

Anyway, does this sound like depersonalization? Or is it more of an existential crisis? And either way, what can I do about it?

Btw this is my first time using this forum so please let me know if I'm doing something wrong! :)"
242,What does it feel like to dissociate?
243,"I experienced derealisation as a teenager several times but it became very rare for many years.  But from about age 70 (now 79) it became more frequent, and I can always identify a sensory stimulus which brings it on, most commonly noise such as in a crowded place, and my immediate instinct is to rush away until it wears off (usually after a few minutes).  I started on Lamotrigine (low dose) having seen a doctor, which seems to have helped but whenever I’m out, particularly if I have to be in a particular place with no easy escape route, I’m always on edge and unable to concentrate properly on what’s going on.  I’m terrified of having to be at or near the front at any large gathering such as a wedding or funeral, and I hate long journeys.  I’ve had some CBT which I think has helped a bit.  Any suggestions?"
244,"Hi
For the past year(most significantly in the past year), I have been experiencing mental issues that I haven't been able to figure out. About a month after it started happening, I decided to call it anxiety (even though I really didn't want to because I felt like I didn't know what anxiety actually was). This was right around the time when I went through a pretty rough break up that lasted about an entire month of pretty terrible emotional pain. I remember at the beginning of this happening, I had an experience of for about 2 minutes, feeling completely separate from my personality, emotions, the influence so many things had on me, and from being human. I remember explaining this experience to my sister after it happened. Ever sense then, I've felt this numbness. Almost as if the very deepest foundational part of my consciousness, the part that is really you at the deepest level, was separate from the part of me that feels emotion and is human and that finds comfort in things and enjoys food and sex and things that I experience. I feel disconnected from that. The more interesting thing is that there have been several times when I've felt that part of me come back. It feels like I was holding my breath and suffocating and I just started to breathe again and I could smell things again and feel emotion again. And it's complicated, because I wouldn't say that when I feel this numbness, I still experience emotion and enjoy things, but it's as if they're not real, or they're not really impacting that deep part of me that they normally do, and that deep part of me feels separate even though there's still a part of me that still experiences those things. Hah, yeah it's complicated. I don't even know what I mean when I say ""I"" or ""me"".
Anyways, from what I've learned about dissociation, it's more of a response to something happening. Your body has learned to separate itself from emotion in order to protect itself, and it seems like it's more of a thing that happens in emotionally heavy situations (stressful job, family situations ect.) which causes memory loss for that specific time. For me, it doesn't seem to be specific situations. I've been watching myself like a cat watching a mouse for about 3 months for patterns that cause my mental state to worsen, and I can't find any. And when I'm feeling the numbness, it's more of a slow wearing thing that goes on for hours/days. And I also can't find any patterns for the times when that normal part of me comes back and I can smell and breathe again (as mentioned above). And yet all of this doesn't seem to degrade my motivation or life goals. I'm working full time and going to college in the fall, both of which have gone great. I'm the field manager at my job and was the top student in my class, but it all feels unreal, or like the human part of me is busying itself with all of that and doing a good job but whatever part of me that actually feels things is separate from that.
I hope this wasn't too confusing, feel free to ask any questions regarding what I said, if there's anybody out there.
Any time spent reading this and considering it is greatly appreciated, as well as any feedback or ideas about what could be going on.
Thank you.

245,"I'm literally at the end of my rope with my mental health, can't handle being in my own head anymore, I'm barely speaking to my family so don't get support from them, I don't have friends in the area I grew up in, one group of girls in particular have made my life hell, feel like everyone just sees me as this problem, especially my family, sorry for sounding so negative but needed to rant a bit or I'm gonna end up snapping  🤪"
246,"Okay, I have not told this to anyone but it is making me cry and I am lonely from it. I don't want to go to a doctor as it requires self love and my mind to witness me. I have done stuff and I feel that's it is too deep to share all the real story on a board because if you word the words Government then you are classified as completely surreal and crazy. 
In a nutshell, I have figured out that I was framed to have switches to other personalities and I thought against it. through using a story to create a false identity they told me that they are angels and that I had to write to create that part is fine. 
Then they made me to believe that I have a twin that had merged with me so I love him and he loved me. The designed it so that I would go against God aka love and be bitter and resentful. 
To stop me from trusting the real loving ones. 
My disassociation my mind completely ignores me as in me, I dn't hold any personality and all I do is lash out at myself and blame me for everything that has happened to me. I have been stonewalled, scapegoat, critized and ignored to a point that they made me feel that bad that I rejected myself out of my own body and after a period of years they the love angels tell me I am now me but that it is my own accord. (bull) why would I make myself be and do these things. 
These switches are not coming from yourself. There are entities who are infiltrating your mind and creating them within you. 
That sounds totally crazy I know but that in it self made me freak out. 
I heard voices at one point saying ""switch"" and a male would come out of me. I told it all to stop and shouted at them and all sorts and now I am apparently just me and now no one cares. 
I find it hard to describe, but my mind it has no memories, no imagination and it goes against me like a robot would and makes me feel like I'm just my head and no heart or soul. 
These two friends don't give a rancid care they think that I was being horrible reach out in terror and pain when stuff was happening and they just turned their back on me when I needed them. 
Now I feel I only had my mouth to protect me from what they were doing. 
I love me and other people and they continuously keep saying you are fear non stop in my head over and over again. 
No matter what I do they don't care and I haven't had anyone lovingly touch me for a while and this is what is scaring me.
No matter what I say I end up screaming at any voice I now hear. Then you hear them saying how out of order I am etc. 
I am trying to be me and the voices are harming me now loving me as an angel I am hurting because my mind does not hold any memory, the ego has a victim role and now the voices are going you are a diva. Like the switches have gone I don't hear them doing it and I used to switch into at least three different characters they made it out to be fun but now I think it's dodgy and not from love. 
I just want the real me back and I keep hitting me for the damage in my heart and going like If I don't have my guy I will die because I felt this male in me and I felt that it was a twin. No too much doubt in my head and I can't hear the truth in my heart. 
I need a personality and friendship I am so lonely and hurt I can't hack it anymore. I know some deep stuff has happened and that is what I don't like . 
They keep going on about how I am fear not love and it's being drilled into me ."
247,"Hello everyone! I could use some advice from people who know what I’m dealing with... I have DID but recently I’ve been dissociating a lot and losing way more time than normal. Sometimes it’s just for a minute, but then I end up doing stupid things like taking the wrong medication or driving in the wrong direction. I also recently started therapy and my inner voices have gone very quiet when they’ve always been loud and opinionated. I feel like I’m rapidly losing control and I’m not sure what to do. Any advice or suggestions? Has anyone else gone through a period like this, and how did you get through it? Thanks :)"
248,"Good morning all, so when I first saw a therapist I remember her having me take a dpd test on my second visit, I saw her about 4 times before I ran into money issues so it's been a while since I've been able to see her. The test made it seem like in order to have the problem you had to feel like you were watching yourself do things, but I've been struggling a lot lately and started researching it a bit, I've noticed other tests for it and people's experiences say it's not like you're watching yourself do things with no way to control it but more like you are watching yourself do things but through your eyes, you don't physically see yourself, and that's what I had tried to explain to the therapist when I told her I didn't know how to answer the question.

I have episodes where I feel like I'm watching everything happen but can't control it, but I'm seeing it through my own eyes, this happens worse when emotions are high for me.
I can be having an argument and realize that I'm going off and what I'm doing isn't logical and can sit there telling myself to stop and that it isn't a big deal, and it's like I'm yelling at myself inside my head just trying to control myself and I'm not responding to myself. I don't even know if I'm explaining this well or if it makes any sense :/
I have issues with not feeling like I'm real or like things around me are real, which I marked that I didn't feel like the world around me was fake in the test but I guess I didn't really realize how common of an issue it was for me at the time, I started noticing it more and more though.
It's more like I'm watching things happen through someone else's eyes and can't stop anything from happening, though I know that it's my body so I don't know if this is the same...
I feel out of control a lot and I constantly feel like there is something wrong with me but I can't place my finger on it, it makes me feel insane.
I don't hear voices or anything, I talk to myself but not in a way where it's like I'm talking to someone else, and normally not out loud, I've heard other people do this and it's normal, but then I will be sitting there and it's like I'll ask myself what I'm doing or something and I'll reply to myself inside me head. And then my anxiety starts spiking because it turns into full blown back and forth things which always turns into me feeling like in crazy but then I'm like you can stop this, you can just stop replying, you're doing this to yourself, you're not crazy, you're just being stupid, you just want something to be wrong with you, and then I'm like why would I make this up, why would I want something to be wrong?  But then I just start feeling more and more crazy, and I just don't know how to stop myself, I guess I just overanalyze everything. 
Does this sound like disassociation? Or am I just being stupid? 
Note to add that I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, I've also been perscribed Adderall, though the psychiatrist I go to never actually had me take a test for ADD or ADHD.

I'm tired and confused and don't even know what to do anymore, so often none of this seems real and it just leaves me feeling drained, I hate myself and I don't even feel like I know who I am anymore :/"
249,"This might sound like a stretch but is there a possibility that one experiencing amygdala hijacking could be living life off course from reality due to false memories produced subconsciously after said individual had a sudden onset of severe PTSD and anxiety from essentially running away from an exceedingly large amount of trauma without letting go causing bouts of emotional breakdowns. I digress, Is it possible for the subconscious to fabricate; in a way a sort of shield of false experiences lying to the conscious mind about outcomes in daily life and swaying observation in a favorable manner to essentially ""protect"" one from more potentially traumatic confrontations for fear of more attachments, or hiding a terminal illness, lost family members/ friends or something to that extent."
250,"Whenever someone does something that reminds of ways I’ve been treated in the past, I get “triggered” and this “other side of me” takes over. 

I would say this side is nothing like myself but, I barely know who “I” really am. I just have all these “sides” and while they don’t have names they definitely are like opposing personas and, very different from each other, distinctly. 

I spend so much time in these personas, that when I do come out of it, I’m just lost as to why... I was that way for a week and then, the next week I’m not anymore. I just, don’t really understand why I’m like this or how to make it stop. 

I thought that I could *will* it to stop, by choosing an identity and just sticking that, but that doesn’t work. My sense of identity is completely shattered and then I feel an emptiness in the “core” identity that is suppose to be like me the host. My therapist suggested that I lost touch with who I was before trauma and wants me to reconnect with it but I told her, “there is nothing there.” 

But yeah the personas just don’t have names and I dont understand why I become them or how to make it stop. When I’m in that mode I’m happy being that way or I think I have my reasons for being that way, but then when I come out of it I’m confused why I can’t be that way anymore? And I was certain that was me now, I’m always certain every time, and then, the certainty always fades. 

And so I just transition like, week to week, into different personalities. I feel like it’s a way of not confronting reality or avoiding it somehow, the things about it that I don’t know how to handle. 

I thought I could control it but the reality is I can’t so I’m considering opening up to a professional about it. 

My question is, is it possible to “switch” into alternates but they just don’t have their own names?"
251,"For the last few years, and more so for the past few months, I've felt numb and emotionless and unmotivated. It isn't there all the time but it seems to be there for a good portion of the day, especially at night and when I am alone. I've noticed that the empty feeling usually follows after I get some anxiety or if I start to think about self-harming or suicide.

Sometimes, it feels like time has slowed down and it's like I am stuck in a movie where everyone knows what to do but I am just here being unresponsive and uninterested. My mind can get foggy, as if it's somewhere in a cloud, and my memory has been terrible (sometimes I even forget about a conversation I had in the morning until someone reminds me).

I am not sure if this is disassociation or something else entirely (or maybe it's just me whining). But I do know that this empty feeling is a way of suppressing my passive suicidal feelings. In the past, I felt a lot more depressed and suicidal. But now all of that is tucked away. 

The issue is that this emptiness scares me. I sometimes intentionally make myself think about suicide and get myself to cry just so that I feel something. It's this weird war of tug between feeling depressed and suicidal, and feeling nothing at all. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or maybe knows what's going on with me? Should I be seeing someone for this? I am still able to go through life okay and I am able to laugh and smile. I just happen to have this internal war that sometimes rips me apart. I want to feel present and excited about life. Right now, I am just a lifeless shard.

252,"I have been suffering from depression anxiety/derealization for about 4-5 years I get extremely strong feelings of not being real and that the world is just a game or some sort made up reality and I'm really sick of feeling like this, I'm unable to do anything, I can't even do simple tasks like walking to the shop, my girlfriend of 6 years is getting sick of me not being able to do anything and that makes me feel worse because I'm stopping her from doing what she wants.

253,"ever since i was a little kid i’ve been having trouble with my life aspirations. things that affect it the most are movies, stories and music. one minute i have no idea what i want, then i watch Bohemian Rhapsody and all i can think about is how i want to be a singer. then i watch Ocean’s Eight and i want to become a criminal. then i watch avengers and i want to become an actress or a superhero. and the feelings are incredibly strong and i’m incredibly passionate about each of the jobs, but i’m worried because i can’t stick to one thing. is this a sign of some mental disorder?"
254,What is depersonalization and derealization?
255,"So for the past year, I haven't felt emotion. Not a bit. I'm posting here because I recently told someone IRL about it and they called me a sociopath, then told me to see a therapist. While I do admit, it's almost seeming to progress as time goes on, I really don't consider it a problem. I did a small bit of googling, and found nothing that I could see that matched. I figured I would ask for a second opinion from people who may know something, before I make a serious decision."
256,"Hi everyone,

I’ve had anxiety for a year now, but it has turned into depression lately. I’ve been feeling so weird but last night I think I might have had a psychotic episode. I truly felt like I wasn’t me anymore and that I wasn’t real, I thought I had imagined my whole life and none of it was real. I looked in the mirror and had a full panic attack because I didn’t know who that was looking back at me. I didn’t sleep at all because I felt so crazy all night. Today I’m not the best from it at all. I’m afraid to look in the mirror and when I hear my voice it sounds alien to me. Please help is this a psychotic episode? I can’t tell."
257,"Hello there,
I'm hoping someone on here can help me.
Just yesterday, I started having some kind of disassociation/ depersonalization ""attack"" and it has only gotten worse since. Problem is, I don't really know if it's any of the above or my mind is just hating me right now.

My brain feels kind of numb, it's like I'm in a dream or hallucinating but I know deep down that I'm not. Everything feels surreal and made up.
I can't concentrate on certain things like school work without messing the tiniest of things up and I forget words that I most definitely knew before. It feels like I'm getting stupid kind of and it really, really brings me down. 
I can't go outside for an extended period of time because I get nauseous and my vision is slightly blurry, but I think I need new glasses. It's better inside my flat, but still not good and I'm scared to hell and back because it hasn't ever been this bad before. I was always able to ignore it by doing other things like writing or drawing, but I can't anymore.

I also have to write a math exam tomorrow and I can't learn since concentrating is hard. Should I still take it? Or stay home one more day?

Please, if anyone out there might know if what I experience is Depersonalization or something similar, that would help me a lot.

Thanks.

With regards, 
Featherfall"
258,"Hi all :)

For a long period of time, I've felt disconnected from my body like it's alien. I've contemplated suicide and I'd like to really go ahead with just ending it as I've failed."
259,"I feel like after I cracked up at uni...which I’m convinced now was schizophrenia, I’ve always managed to hold an imaginary place or image where I sort of exist. Id created an internal self in my head here I thought I was ok. An image to everyone. Now it’s completely falling away. It’s like I’ve invented little worlds and acted in them. Now I feel spaced out, like nothing makes sense. Everything I’ve learned to function has been in my head imagined, not from experience. I feel utter terror and I feel my mind trying to escape. I feel I’ve pretended. I literately look around and don’t know what anything is. And whether a anything’s a dream or a memory.  I feel utter boredom, confusion, terror. It feels like I’m realising there was nothing there all along, I did loads of stuff and imagined stuff to function and exist and appear normal..so good I thought I was. Now I’m becoming aware  I feel I’m slipping away. Into a screen in my head a bit. It’s hard to explain but I’m certainly having trouble with basic functioning. I can feel my mind wanting to slip to a safe place..it scares me because it feels like all the coping stuff I’ve done to keep and imagine I’m sane is all slipping. It’s like a huge tensing in imy head that I can’t hold any more. Everyone’s saying it’s just anxiety, negative thoughts etc. But it feels like a whole lot more... like right at the bottom a boundaryless chaos where I’ll dissolve into everything-and disappear. It feels like I just don’t understand what anything is. And trying to act normal is getting harder. Any help appreciate. It’s like I’ve imagined what life is and what we do and lived in a safe image somewhere in my head. That tiny safe spot of self delusion has blown open. I keep pretending it’s just depression or something. But it feels like a truth I’ve known all along catching up with me. I’m trying to have hope, but it really feels like the only choice my brain has to avoid the terror of a fragmented ego is to retreat to madness. I also don’t really know who anyone is , they are all part of my safe creation that now doesn’t exist. it feels like I’m molding into my chair and the world around will just melt into a thousand molecules. And there’s the pain of seeing everyone loving and living and connecting  and I’m slipping further away. From something I only imagined I had anyway. There’s literately nothing I can think to do. Utter boredom and despair. So may as well drift off. It avoids the pain and horror of where I am. I also can’t think cognitively about things. Is there hope? I don’t feel I can return to normal because it’s the realisation that I never was  normal  in the first place . Always in my own world. Can I drop into the madness and return? There’s also a hate an paranoia coming in. That I’ve tried and pretended to but can’t feel and connect like everyone else. That leaves me mad and angry. And paranoia that because I can’t feel and am a jumble of nothing inside...people  aren’t  really really to me either. It’s like I’m on the edge of the rabbit hole. And I kinda want to jump in cause it’s better than all the pain and terror and hate. Any help or thoughts greatly appreciated. Doesn’t sound good does it? Lol 
And when we look at old photos, it’s like I was living it like a film from somewhere else. That it was never real. And it’s an anguish that all that pretend world has gone. I used so much energy creating it all and having a narcissistic image for myself and everyone. Its not just a depression, it’s falling into complete fragmentation. From an imagined heavenly perfect world I was in, to absolute hell. It’s a realisation that no one existed , just me reflecting an image in my head for other people. Who aren’t real. This is really bad. People created worlds for me and I existed with them. It’s so bad I can’t quite accept it all. I was an excited child thinking everything was amazing and perfect. A lot has to do with my daughter. That role took me to another reality where I existed. Now she’s older ...it’s all real. I really don’t know how to help myself or what to do. It was all a big self deluded narcissistic ride away from reality. And now it’s gone..there’s no role or mask...utter deadness...or terror ...agitation...rage..fear...and probably madness to escape it all. All the while never really thinking about anyone else. It’s like I can’t stand the boredom and emptiness and terror of just being ...I don’t exist...I need an image from people ...it’s like a reality to escape into. No one seems to understand or be able to help. It’s like without an image nothing exists. I’ve grown by copying and imaging and fantasy...not by experience and feelings and connecting and learning. . But by pretending ...even to my self.. like splitting off and watching a film of yourself. Someone must have some ideas. It’s like something has broken before I’ve even had a chance to live. It feels like right at my core is a tiny space where I hide ...in fear and hate...and if that’s seen it’s like a rage or shame...and madness ...it must stay hidden and safe..and I know this is the bit where people mediate and feel a connection ...mine has shut...and  madness happens if it’s opened. It just can’t bear to be opened. It feels like it will tear me apart. Like a volcano. Or an atom bomb."
260,"Hey, I just wanna say first of all that I don't want to self diagnose myself but it's gotten to a point with doctors that I have the choice of doing nothing or looking into it myself a bit more. I do plan on finding another doctor but I've tried so many.

So I'm always slightly dissociated but sometimes (quite often) it gets really strong. An example of this is I'll be mid sentence talking to someone when it hits, and first I forget what I'm saying, I start trying to grab the details which are still there, but then those details go and I completely forget what I'm talking about, then who I am, sometimes where I am. Then I come out of it and everything feels different. It's like I start perceiving the world differently and it makes me speak differently, hold myself different because everything just feels different. Sometimes I won't remember what I was saying at all, sometimes it comes back slowly or I get bits of it. This is how it is sometimes.

Other times it's different. It tends to last a lot longer and I don't forget everything really quickly. My head feels weird. It's like how when you're really stressed out and it feels like looaaaads is going on in your head. But all of that movement in your head has condensed into one thing and is pushing forward (I really hope this makes sense). It's not really a headache, just a very uncomfortable feeling that makes me dissociate, but when it passes it almost always leaves me with a headache. When this is going on I am very prone to snapping at the slightest thing and taking it out on those around me.

I have an awful memory too. All the days blur together and my days are often like they're split into sections. When I'm at work, I remember a lot about when I've been at work on other days, when I'm at home I remember a lot about when I've been at home on other days, and when I watch my TV show in bed in the evening I remember a lot about when I've been in bed watching TV on other days. When I'm not in each situation it's not like my memory is blank of the other situations, just very foggy. For example, I can't remember ANYTHING about what is going on in The Umbrella Academy which is what I'm watching at the moment, but I will likely remember everything later. 

There are two things I keep thinking about. One is BPD, because of how I can snap at almost nothing and I take it out on those around me. I can also seem to have all of the symptoms. However recently I've been thinking about OSDD and this is why:

As long as I can remember I've had ""imaginary friends"". Of course this is normal as a kid, but mine didn't go away. From the ages 10 or so to about 13 I played this game with my friends where we were all characters from Harry Potter. This was always so much more real to me than it was to them because for me the game didn't end when I got home after school. I was always talking to characters in my head, from various books and films, and I still do now though now I'm really not sure who they are anymore. They respond but it's not like I'm hearing voices, it's like another inner voice. When I was younger as soon as I got to my room and was on my own I would close my eyes and play with all these characters in my head. I don't play with them anymore, but I do talk to them. I also don't remember very much from my childhood at all. The memories I do have are more like images than anything else and they aren't many, and I have no idea when they are from.

Is there something I haven't thought of? Whenever I go to a doctor and mention any kind of mental health all they do is offer me antidepressants, which I don't want. I'm not going to stop trying to find a doctor who will listen but I don't have the money to go private. Could it be OSDD? BPD? I really don't know and sometimes I worry that I'm just making it up, but I know I'm not. If that makes sense at all..."
261,"My husband whom has ASD is displaying symptoms when angry that are confusing us both:

When angry he will end up saying out of character hurtful things, and then have no memory of them at all. The things are so out of charecter that he himself will argue why they would make no sense to say, and even sometimes thinks I made up him saying those things just to make him think something is wrong with him. 

Could this be DID? He doesnt do this all the time, only when angry."
262,"Throughout the years, another person started to develop in my head. I think it all began when I was around 14 and I've realized their presence but didn't know what it was. When I'd be mad and angry, I'd start thinking about murder, robberies and bad things that I could do... but when I was 15, I gave that person in my head a gender, an age and what they were like. They never had a name, because I didn't know who I, myself was. And it's hard, because when you don't know who you are, you really don't know anymore. I know it's not a disorder, because I'm not taken over, and I'm present for all of it. I'd say it's kind of like another personality, but not an actual different person. I guess it's an idealized person that I want to be, but I can't because I was born different. I never met my real father, but I have a step-father in my household and our relationship ended when I was 10 years old. He acts narcissistic and has characteristics of a sociopath, and he's always hypocritical about things. I think the person I created was in place of my father, and it feels good because I at least have a father figure in my head that can give me that feeling that I can't really explain. I can feel him around when I play certain music that gives me an adrenaline rush, or like I said, I'm furious and want to commit something bad. I've wanted to see a therapist, but opening up about this stuff would probably make them think that I'm insane or crazy... I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know what real life is, all I can say is I don't know because I simply don't know. I don't know what to call myself, I don't have a name... and if I do make a name, I start to think too much about it and want to change it again, I'm just stuck. I don't think anyone will understand this thread but if you made it here, wow."
263,"I also posted this in the BPD forums but after realizing this exists I think it may do better here? I'm clueless

I'm not even sure if this is triggered by my BPD, but I've been living in a paranoia-induced reality since fifth grade. 

I've never talked about this to anyone. Not my therapist, friends, family. No one. I developed the idea that my entire life was broadcasted through my glasses in fifth grade, like they had little cameras in the lenses and I was being livestreamed. Over all the years, it's infested my life. I have fake people in my life where I hallucinate them without actually seeing or hearing them, it's like I'm hallucinating the presence of a person I've built up all these years. I'll idly talk to myself for hours, leave or seclude myself from my friends when we're talking or hanging out to live out this. It's not even something that scares me at this point, it's just a fake reality that I'm constantly living out. No matter how many times I try and tell myself that this isn't real when it's happening, I brush it off like I made a joke. I just can't stop myself. I don't know if this comes from a coping mechanism from my abuse as a child or something deeper, but the only things I have that could affect this are BPD and DID (i also have dermatillomania and experience mania but I don't think those can contribute here), but I have no idea if my alters experience this paranoia-induced phenomenon. I don't know where to start looking for answers on this, I've never met anyone else who's experienced something like this."
264,"I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I am waiting for a diagnosis for my possible personality disorder, my mom says that she has talked to three other personalities besides myself. I've been through a lot, I don't know what to do anymore, I don't have many people to talk to that would understand at all."
265,"Hello... I could use some advise if you have any. My DID diagnosis is relatively recent but I’ve been dealing with symptoms most my life. I was able to hide them and never told anyone until they got so bad I couldn’t hide it anymore. My spouse is really struggling with this and he treats me like I’m a ticking time bomb, even though I am the same person I’ve always been. I’m not sure even how to help myself much less help him. Any advice for helping a spouse cope?"
266,"Hi, am looking for people who have been diagnosed with DID formally by psychiatrists. No offence to others intended, I just want to hear from those who have been through the diagnosis and are now living with DID.

Thanks"
267,"Hi, Im one of those who have this. I used to have it all the time years ago, not much right now, but im one of who have this thing, a lot. I never met any other who have this and always wanted it. Im looking for people who have this but doesnt look it as a problem, just a thing that happens from time to time, and is a thing to live with."
268,"Hi, I'm here to find out if I'm alone with this thing that's been happening to me for years. So, for as long as I can remember I've been dealing with this thing I could never explain and nor could my family doctor.. When I meet new people or even just see a new face around I feel as if i am them and my brain thinks I'm that person, I get new thoughts and see new things but only for a few minutes at a time then I'm back.. My brain makes me believe that I don't look like myself anymore or that im someone completely different and I lose my train of though frequently.. It had stopped happening for a year or two but recently at Walmart I saw this girl and she looked normal but then I felt like I was her and all of a sudden felt sadness and got lightheaded and that's when I finally talked to my significant other about it.. They didnt understand and I don't either if anyone could help me plz feel free to reply!!"
269,"Hi,

This might be a bit incoherent, but so is my mind right now. Yesterday went blank for me from about noon onwards and I'd like to know what happened after that. I got a phone call before noon, which was basically a close person venting all their frustrations about me to me, as far as I can remember. It was for a good reason, no doubt, but to me it felt close to mental abuse because I'm not good at handling any emotions at all. My phone says it lasted 3 hours, but I don't remember what was the rest of it about and I'm certainly not going to ask the person! Thank the worlds it doesn't show any other phone calls or messages after that neither on my phone or computer.
My phone also says I've ordered food around 15 but have no recollection of that. Judging by the signs I've eaten it. I was supposed to have a meeting at 19, never made it to it not messaged that friend I'm not able to come (which I would always, always do!).
This morning I woke up at 5 in my yesterday's clothes to a panic I was late from somewhere. Also, there's a palm-size injury on my forearm, neatly cleaned and wrapped up. Looks self-inflicted. No recollection of this. I only have one snippet of memory from yesterday: ""I have to do something with my face, can't go out looking like this"". That's it :(
I must have dissociated big time, but how to remember what the hell happened during the evening? Any tips?
Right now I feel pretty stupid."
270,"For the past day or two, it is like...like I am stuck in some euphoric state. Like the state when you just wake up and feel out if it...but I cant snap out of it. Everything seems dreamy or foreign to me...even my own husband looks different to me. My arms feel detatched or super long and my own voice sounds different..like its distant or something. Probably the weirdest symptoms are these strange intrusive thoughts/urges. The thoughts are more like I am being forced to imagine things and it cuts through my awareness. Its like almost going into hypnagogia while walking and talking. The other thing are these strange urges...like holding a glass and having some unexplained urge to squish it in my hand till it breaks, weird things like that. I dont obviously break it in my hand, but its weird that my mind has an urge to.

Does this sound like DP or are these symptoms too strange to be that. Has anyone else on here exerienced those really weird symptoms with their DP?"
271,im in university and i cant remember anything i am doing and i am failing because of it wich is stressing me out and so i dissociate more. and i cant get out of the loop
272,"Recently I have felt extremely detached from everything in my life. I have no reason to be unhappy. I have my mom and my five siblings and we're okay. I have a couple of good friends, IDK. 
When I was a kid my dad used to abuse me physically and emotionally, he self harmed in front of me and eventually committed suicide right after I turned 14. I was diagnosed with PTSD a year ago or so. Lately I've just felt like I'm floating all the time and everything around me isn't really happening. My doctor said it's probably dissociation but I don't understand what that is or why it's happening. I get lost in space and don't know how to act around my friends and it's becoming really hard to act normal. I started self harming just to feel something real, so I could actually feel like I was real. I feel like all of the people around me are drifting away or maybe I'm drifting away and I don't know what to do."
273,"I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. I used to be prescribed Zoloft and Xanax for 10 years. I was in control of life and my anxiety was under control as well as my depression. I had a great job. I was married. I had a family, my own place. Everything was great.

About 3 years ago my wife started cheating on me. I desperately wanted to still keep her. I loved her still but despite my attempts to keep her, she still left me. I was devastated. First I lost my apartment or our apartment, then next I gave up my job.

Things were deteriorating quickly. I cashed out of my job and took my money. At this point I was still mentally well seeing my psychologist and here is where things went downhill. He retired and from there I was unable to get therapy or medication anymore. It's been all downhill from there.

Today I woke up after barely sleeping and I was supposed to start a new job. I couldn't go because I started having an intense panic attack and I feel like almost out of touch with my body and perhaps I am going insane. The thoughts are so intense that I am now drinking to numb my mind. I have intense fears of losing control but today I feel like I finally have. I now live in my mother's house and depend on her but I have always had a phobia of driving and I just don't know what to do anymore. I basically have given up on life. 

Have I finally gone insane"
274,"Very rarely I get this feeling or sensation of being trapped inside my head and its like I'm looking out at what my body is doing or like I'm watching my body, almost like when you dream.
It usually only lasts for minutes but sometimes longer and it's like I can see myself doing something like shouting at someone or freaking out. I try to tell myself to stop and try to get my body to stop but it doesn't listen. 

I have also been getting this almost fuzzy headed feeling similar to that of a concussion but it makes things seem as though they aren't real. Like everything is moving too slow or everything is too large or something and honestly it's kind of terrifying...

Any thoughts?"
275,"Not entirely sure this is the right thread  but I get these very random and uncontrollable intrusive thoughts, only really once or twice a month and lasting about a minute.

It comes on suddenly and out of nowhere and it's thoughts like how weird it is that we're alive and I'll obsess on a particular word and how weird it is and then I try to cycle through words and concepts very quickly to find something I can make sense of and bring me out of it.

It's like all I can do is freeze and just try to get through it but I can't stop the thoughts and then they suddenly go away, it's actually really scary when it happens because they come from nowhere and honestly I feel like my heart is going to stop when I'm in an episode of this.

I have suffered depression & anxiety for over 20 years so feel it could be related."
276,"OK - I have had general low level anxiety for probably 10 years now, as a result of some long term trauma exposure. (I now realise - god how little I knew about my mental health back then - I thought I was indestructible!)

In the past 12 months I have had some episodes of high anxiety in the form of panics / flashes of impending death etc and also night terrors.

I can kind of rationalise and self treat those - with some mental respite and awareness.

However, what brings me to this forum is that I have now also had 3 or 4 episodes of 'out of body' experiences where I am - just for a short flash - not 'me' but something completely random, and somewhere very threatening. 

So for example, I am an insect - and feeling I am looking at the world through an insect perspective, but with human consciousness. Or I am floating in space in a different part of the galaxy unable to do anything but acutely aware of where I am. I am not centered in me the person, but lost in the random events of the planet and universe.

These are terrifying. They are not fun imaginative adventures, but genuinely terrifying. They tend to occur when I am quiet and alone, perhaps reading a book or listening to a book in the evening.

Can anyone else relate to these experiences??

PS - I use NO drugs. I take vitamin pills and st johns wort. I drink alcohol in moderation 2 or 3 times a week."

278,"Hi, I was wondering how people cope when they are dissociating..

When I dissociate, I cannot speak. I sit or lie very still, and silently cry. Its embarrassing... people try to help or get me to talk but it only makes it worse, and I can't tell them to stop or what I need. I can't even nod my head yes or no. I just freeze, like a scared child.

Does anyone have any coping skills or similar dissociative episodes?"
279,"I have done a lot of reading,have browsed many forums(not talking about this place though) and it is hard for me to believe there are truly as many people with DID that claim they have it.

Something I have noticed is the vast amount of people that make it seem/sound like DID is a fun or cool disorder to have,even turn it into a contest over who has the most insiders.

But this isn't a post with the intention of criticising or judging anyone(although it probably sounds like I am).I am just curious WHY anyone would fake it or even brag about it.

It is so obvious sometimes when someone is faking for attention,but WHY would they do that?"
280,"Hi, I am diagnosed with Dissociative identity disorder, CPTSD, OCD, MDD and a couple other labels.

I've been on and off so many meds due to side effects but have now settled on Lamotrigine for depression (increasing currently so it's not fully effective), prazosin for PTSD (brilliant). 

Nothing seems to touch the dissociation. I'm obviously in therapy and have just found a great therapist after years with one who crossed a few boundaries. 

I struggle day to day to feel as though I'm participating in life, I have memory gaps so sometimes it's hard to piece together the week.

Is there anyone out there who has DID in all its glory? I dont know anyone else with it and it's a bit of a lonely road."
281,"Hello.  I have never posted to an online forum such as this before and so am trying to muster the comfort to be as open and honest as possible. In lurking/reading through so many posts I often see a lot of replies regarding depersonalization and the posters seem (typically) more in line with larger “why am I here” type of grand purpose discussions.  This is not how I feel.  I am going to write this post and see what folks have to say and maybe it will offer me/you some clarity:

     I have a normal life (yes subjective, but just “typical”…wife, kids, dogs, career etc.).  My whole life I’ve had bouts of depression here and there but nothing long term or what I would otherwise consider troubling.  I always bounced back and found out how to work out any issues I had.  Fast forward to today and I’ve decided to venture out into the internet in search of answers.  I have started to have very real out of body experiences. Depersonalization for sometimes minutes, hours or even days.  I’m awake when this is happening.  I can see myself if you will.  Almost like I’m watching a film of my actions.  It typically lasts a few minutes here and there and would be when I am doing something like washing my hands for example.  I would notice that I was washing my hands but I was actually watching myself washing my hands (if that makes sense).  I get this frequently now, several times in a normal day I feel like events are happening or I am being present just I’m watching and can clearly see myself but it’s me performing the actual task.

     Please note, I have lost whole days like this…where I reflect on the day before I go to bed and feel as though I know these events happened during my day, but I can’t actively remember doing them.  This occurs during smaller events throughout the course of a day, but also there seems to be some longer term, issue that occurs as well.  I just figured I would reach out and ask what people thought.  Thanks in advance."
282,"I can't help but wonder why I'm human. Why am I in a physical form? What was I created for? Why am I not a spirit floating through time and space? What happens when I die? Is life on Earth just a game?

I feel like I lost all connection to humanity. I don't understand the point of existing and surviving. Why do humans want to exist? Why do we cooperate and feel empathy for each other? Why do we even care? Why act civilized ? Instead of just behaving like violent mindless beasts and just destroy each other. What is the point of things like love and happiness? Why do we get love and happiness just by existing? These questions fill my head 24/7 with no end in sight. I do nothing but sit and think all the time about these questions. I use to believe in a point of existing and morality. I considered myself a humanist. Not I see no point in interacting with others and life. I keep questioning everything about humans and why they act. I feel like an psychopath or alien observing animal behavior or something. I don't know if it is the DP just tricking me or something to think like this but I hate it and wish I could take the blue pill.

I feel like a monster"
283,"Hey there,

First of all, thank you for hearing me out.

I began to work a few months ago and i stressed myself out a number of times. I didnt (want to) realize that im surrounded by people with low morals: cheaters and liars. At first i tried to ""get into the group"" but later when i realized what kind of people i was dealing with i separated myself from the group, i tried not to accept/follow their habits. So i became the target. I was deceived and played with a number of times. And i didnt even call them out for it. They drained my energy completely.

In order to be a victim one has to act like one. I know this, thats why i blame myself for being stupid and naive.

Im a highly moral person, i always try to see the better side of people and forget their past negative actions. That, along with the basic perception that most people are inherently good is now broken in me. I dont know myself anymore (why do i have thoughts of revenge?)

It seems i sabotaged myself staying there for too long, letting them do what they do. They pulled me down, and as i can imagine they are now cheering that i fell.

Around the time when i realized whats going on, i developed tinnitus, a high piched ringing sound in my ear, along with constant dizziness which basically stops me from doing anything productive - search for a new job for example - and be a complete burden on my family. Also i have oversensitive hearing now, maybe that is what activates the dizziness. Im ~24 years old living with my parents. They have trouble anyway, i dont want to enlarge their burden.

Doctors found no evidence of physical cause, so it seems its a psychological issue. I have some will to live, but i dont want to live this way. Im scared that it will never go away. Its hard to concentrate. This is why im constantly thinking about ending my story here."
284,I'm having a severe depressive and anxious episode. Help! What do I do? My mind is racing and I can't think clearly. I feel horrible.
285,"hi. i've been fairly certain i have did since 2013 or so. on and off, i will occasionally ""forget"" about this; i'll ignore all my symptoms and go on trying to live a singular life. i guess i suppress it or something, or maybe something just takes the memories away for a time. but then i remember all the hints again and it all comes back to me. 

i experienced physical/verbal/emotional abuse as a child and have diagnosed ptsd. when i was young i had a hyperactive imagination (still do) and was prone to day dreaming and making imaginary friends. i remember i would be so scared sometimes that i would forget who i was and where i was. sometimes i would make imaginary friends because i was scared, so extremely scared, of.... i don't know what. or who. i try to say what it was, and my memory looks like static. but i know i was scared of something, every night, in my house, and that every night i would try to make something protect me. i was too docile and scared and fragile so i made up beasts in my mind who could sit at the foot of my bed and stay vigil while i slept. that was the only way i could ever go to sleep. that, and have the tv blasting at all times. i always wanted a guardian because of how helpless i felt

suddenly, at some point in late elementary school, i changed. well, it wasn't ""me"" that changed. i stayed the same, as docile and cowardly as ever. but there were these times where it was like a switch would flip (i have always described it this way), and i would get shoved out of my body by a different presence. suddenly, ""my body"" would scream and launch itself into physical fights at any perceived threat, and i would watch. it was like playing a first person video game, and then suddenly be thrown into a cut scene. the screen looked the same. i could still see everything i normally see, from the same perspective (wasnt outside my body or anything), but it was like watching a cut scene instead of playing as the character. i had no control. this happened a lot growing up. i'd be sweet and shy and unassuming, playing with my friends or sitting quietly at recess, and then i'd hear footsteps behind me and the switch would flip. i'd turn around and pin the person to the ground, and scream at them not to touch me, even though they never intended to. once ""i"" pinned someone to the ground and growled at them to stay away from me just because they wanted a book i had. at my house once, i distinctly remember my friend jokingly shoving me, and me whipping around and throwing him to the floor and holding him there by his wrists. when he asked me to stop by using my name, ""i"" growled at him and said ""that's not my name! stop calling me that!"". the real me just watched this happen, and didn't understand what i was seeing. 

this persisted into adolescence too. although for the most part i was able to blend into society a little bit better with age and the shifts got either less frequent or less obvious, there were exceptions to this. once i was walking in the woods and my very close friend was behind me. i knew that he was there, of course; we'd been walking together for a while. but out of nowhere-- i still cannot explain what triggered this-- something shifted. i picked up a tree branch, and went absolutely ballistic. i just started hitting him with the branch, over and over, and i dont know why, and i couldnt stop it. it was just happening. my body was full of this horrific rage and fear and desire to make him go away, but it wasn't ""my"" desire. it felt like the desire of something else that took possession of me that i couldnt control. i didn't stop until i was placed in a head lock

i think this has happened a lot in my life. sometimes i remember it and sometimes i dont. as a person, i have been noted to be extremely calm, sweet, non-violent and empathetic. i cannot even kill bugs, and am much more likely to feel sad than to feel angry over something. when i am angry, i use that anger to be passionate in my communication. i will express my anger with words, and verbal arguments to support my point. but when ""i"" get into these states, the anger is very different. it is very raw, and primal, and completely unregulated, and physical. i have often equated it to the feeling of being pushed out of the way of a moving car. these incidents feel like someone noble pushed me out of the way of a threat, and onto the ground, and i'm watching from the ground, looking up at him while he takes over and fends off all the threats. even when there are no threats. and especially when there actually is a threat.

with all this in mind, i have always been very attracted to stories about people being protected. like princesses with knights, or children being protected by spirits. those stories have always felt very true to me. as if i can relate to them, even though my entire life no one has ever protected me from anything. i even feel this way about my memories sometimes. sometimes i can't remember what happened to me as a child at all. even at my best of times, a lot of memories are obscured or missing, and i can feel their void in my mind. sometimes all i can say is that ""something bad"" happened to me. other times i can be a lot more specific, but it feels like i'm ""borrowing"" or ""stealing"" those memories from another place, against someone's wishes

i don't remember how this happened at all, but eventually i communicated with this presence in my mind. i started becoming aware that there was something or someone in my head who isn't me, but who is ""me"". a second ""me"" to communicate with, and that i've been sharing a life with for a long time. i always had a picture of a big black wolf in my mind when i thought about him. i don't think he always had a name, but at some point, i gave him the name ""lyall"", because it means ""guardian wolf"" and has the same amount of letters as my name. i know this sounds really crazy and i dont know when it happened or why. i honestly feel really ashamed about this, and have never told anyone about it/him because it makes me feel crazy. but i have always had lyall, and he's had a name since i was like 16 or so (i am now 21). 

sometimes i am in better communication with him than other times. sometimes he will be gone for a long period of time. sometimes, as i get more stressed or as i get closer to triggers (ex: holidays), he will be around a lot more. ""i"" will sometimes become very irritable and unstable. ""i"" will start having these invasive feelings that everyone i know is unworthy of knowing me and that i shouldn't trust them. ""i"" will become overwhelmed by the sensation that i need to push everyone who knows me away, because they will only ever exist to hurt me, and be very hateful and snappy to anyone who approaches me at that time because ""i"" believe that they are unworthy of me, and that they have only ever wronged me. but i don't actually identify with those feelings at all. i have a pretty low self worth, so i would never believe something like ""i'm too good for these people"". but thats the exact kind of thought process i'll fall into sometimes, or that will sneak into my head with this burning rage from some corner of my mind separate from me. this has lead to very unstable relationships with the people i love the most, much to my dismay. 

sometimes i will forget about lyall. well, i never *actually* forget, i just force myself to stop thinking about it and take care of a lot of things by myself, because i hate the idea that i might have did... i already have a lot of things going on with me that isolate me from everyone else i know, and make me feel very detached from ""normal life"". the idea of telling anyone i know in real life about this suspicion of mine is horrifying and paralyzing. i am so scared about letting this secret out of me, that sometimes i try to blast through my life so that i never have to think about it. but it always comes back to me. 

it usually comes back to me because at some point or another i am forced to become aware of this feeling i have deep inside me. this feeling that some part of me in my mind is rotting. although i have a normal life with normal friends and normal jobs, i have this sense that theres someone in me who is being racked with pain and suffering and grief and anger and horrific memories. it's like theres this tornado deep in my mind. except its not me. it feels like someone else is in here and he's constantly screaming, or being thrown against walls, or covered in blood, and i'm just doing my own thing while that happens over and over. i will very often forget about my ptsd even though i always have fairly consistent physical symptoms of it. it forget because i cant always remember what happened, or the pain, or what it means to me now. but then there are other times where i can feel the tornado much closer to me, or in front of me, taking control of me while i watch, angry and screaming and punching holes in doors and walls, and i don't think that's me. but of course, it affects me too, and makes me shut down and have to re-evaluate myself and my life all over again

i know this could be a lot of things. it could just be my ptsd or my hyperactive imagination or bpd or something. but the reason that i think it is DID, is because i do not want it to be DID. ptsd? bpd? i could EASILY live with either of those two things (and do, in the case of ptsd). if anything, they make me feel MORE human, because they give me reasons for the way i feel, and are much easier for other people in my life to understand. right? the one thing i DONT want to have is DID. yet that's the thing my mind always comes back to. why would my mind continuously revisit this if i hate it so much? if i don't want this to be the truth? why can't i just live comfortably in the idea that i have ptsd and a silly mind and that's why all this stuff happens? i can't, because it never feels like the answer. i know that there are walls in my head, i can feel them, sometimes more and more every single day, and i try to break them but something always holds me back. all the time, i feel memories and emotions that are not my own, i see myself move and speak in ways i can't understand, and i can't take the fake answers i make up for myself anymore. it's just not enough anymore. i'm tired of running away from the only thing that has ever made any sense to me and i don't know what to do anymore

i'm sure a lot of you will say that i don't have DID and god do i hope you're right. but trust me, there's nothing you can say to me i havent already said to myself in an attempt to make this all end. what would be more helpful is how to handle all these walls and all these blanks in my memories and all this horrible fears i have so that i can have some hope of exploring this possibility and understanding myself and what happened to me and what being my life has been shared with this whole time. i know today i'm determined to follow through on this and explore it all, but i'm worried that tomorrow or the day after it will be too scary for me and i'll try to suppress it or have my memories wiped all over again. i just want to try and figure this stuff out, and communicate with myself and whatever else might be inside me, and stop having my life be so unstable and weird and disconnected from myself and my desires and my intentions. please help me

ps: i'm on a wait list for therapy/meds"
286,"I've suffered from DP/DR for about 7 years now. My anniversary of my diagnosis has just recently passed. I've heard that DP/DR goes away on its own, especially if it's the result of heavy drug use. 

My DP/DR is trauma based. I won't get into all of it, but let's just say that over the course of two months, my life fell apart in more ways than one and I found myself like this, barely able to cope.

I don't know if any of you have experienced this, but I have a steady level of disconnect, but it gets worse with episodes. That said, the disconnect is always very bad with my left arm. To the point I sorta forget that it's there, and when I do remember and see it, I feel queasy, as if it being there alone is completely unnatural. I wouldn't quite say it's BIID level, but it's certainly disorienting.

Sometimes I wonder if I'm really even remotely the same person as I used to be. Sometimes I feel as if that girl died in the hospital, and all I am is her shell. As if I'm just half a person, and my other half died long ago. 

I want to feel whole again. I want to feel like I belong in my body. Feel fully attached to myself and the world around me.

I don't want to see the world through a lens. I want to be alive again."
287,"I had this sudden, unexpected feeling as though i was 'seeing sounds' or 'hearing colors'. Like when you are getting really high and you lose touch with real focus and what you are actually, physically looking at cause your brain decided to go batty. It freaked me out so bad, i thought I was going to have a psychotic break. I didn't understand what was happening to me. I wasnt sure if I was even physically there anymore or if I was dead and am now a ghost, asleep, or in a coma. It felt like a acid trip or something...but I didn't do any drugs, i was home all day. I had enough sleep, food, etc. I do have a severe anxiety disorder on top of a panic disorder, however this is new and came out of nowhere. All of these DRDP stories are like...people feel alien to themselves or everyone around them does.  Does anyone else feel their brain take over with intrusive images? Like your eyes are shutting off? Can anyone relate?????"
288,"I have non-stop Depresonalization and derealization. It been like this for 10+ years now.

Lately I've been doing better mentally, but I've been unable to identify if I am dissociated or not. I feel a lot more emotions and things around me seems to have depth, but I still cannot recognize myself in the mirror and feel like I have a blank identity still. My name doesn't sound like my name still. It's been so long that I don't remember what its like to not be dissociated.

Can any one here try their best to explain what it feels like?"
289,"So for the past 2 weeks I have done nothing but lay in bed and thought. And thought and thought. And yet more thinking. All of it philosophical in nature. About numerous topics ranging from utopia, morality, god, the soul, meaning of life, evolution, whether life is suffering, social darwinism, you name it, I have probably obsessed over it. My parents are worried about me but everytime they try to talk to me I push them away because they will never understand my line of thinking and reasoning. I only eat and use the bathroom when neccesary. Otherwise I laid there and I did nothing but thank to the point of feeling dizzy. My mind going from one concept to another.

Recently I read two stories that really freaked me out and sent me reeling into thought. The first one is called The Egg by Andy Weir.

The story is basically about how everyone is actually one soul in different bodies and everything about life is nothing but us hurting ourselves in life. The universe is an Egg and we will all become one singular god. This story scared the crap out of and made me convinced that is what the afterlife is going to be like. So many spirtual people something similar to be true and it scares me and now I feel like it is the truth. I kept thinking and analyzing about that line of thinking and came into fear that I have been enlightened. That I have seen the truth and there is no one else except me.

And then there was a 2nd story called Talking to God that I read. This story is similar to the Egg and then talks about how humanity has to go through suffering and conflict and war in order to continue to evolve. And then when we reach peak evolution we will turn into a god. Stories like this scared me and have me thinking terrible thoughts like how war is good and we must suffer in order to advance ourselves. That Social Darwinism is the fastest way to advance ourselves. I tried reading counter arguments to these thoughts but I am convinced they are true.

I feel so depersonlized right now and so dizzy. Anxiety nearly filled me the entire day and now I feel nothing but these thoughts in my head 24/7. I have lost my moral compass and now believe that suffering is a good thing in my head and humanity must suffer more. Im too tired to argue against it. I feel like I have become enlightned or something. Guys is there any truth to my thoughts? Or am I delusional and this is just the depersonlization talking. I don't know what to believe anymore."
290,"Hi,

Does anyone have positive experiences with focusing (as described by Eugene Gendlin), Image Streaming (Win Wenger) or Unified Mindfulness (Shinzen Young)?
It's hard to change everything yourself, especially when you've lost contact with yourself or have ''shrunken down'' and I believe support is important and it's good to change things in your environment, but it's also valuable to develop yourself.
They've worked for me in the past and were part of flowing out of dissociation, so I'm curious if this is also true for other people, if it may help someone."
291,"Hi, I didn't know where to ask about this but guessed it had something to do with personality, so I posted it here. 

I was just reading one of my diaries this morning when I found out something that caught up my attention. Apparently, since I was like 13 or so, I began a process of keeping my feelings only to myself, pretending to be alright all the time so my family nor friends would call me a ""crybaby"". I would also hide my sicknesses, even if they were painful, and pretend everything was alright. 

I think maybe that's when I started this process of repressing my feelings to the point that now I am emotionally numb. I can't feel much but like I am empty inside. My gradma and grandpa died last year and I didn't cry a single tear nor feel a single thing. It's strange since I was sure I loved them; I liked them a lot. Also a friend of mine committed suicide just two months ago, I did not cry for her either, only felt like I was floating, like my soul was leaving my body or something. I've been trying to force myself to feel something, like remembering the days we used to spend together to force me to cry or something. It happens but then I am numb again, it feels too artificial. 

Is there any way to go back to recover my feelings? Because this is too weird it can't be right. My family judges me all the time for being too emotionless. My father's been telling everyone about it, how he can't deal with me because I don't give him the love he deserves.I would give it to him but I just can't feel love. I only feel disgust. My friends say I am too distant and too much of a loner. 

Has this happened to you? Is there any way to revert it? :(
Thanks in advance."
292,"I am new here and not sure where to begin. I have never spoken with a professional. I was raised and currently still live in a culture where you just...get over it.

I can provide details as needed, but I have a history of childhood abuse (physical, verbal, mental). Somethings I remember vividly and other large portions of my past I can't recall as at all.

Due to recent events, I have to accept that I easily become irate and it's often disproportionate to the event transpiring. During these times, I swear it doesnt feel like it's me. I know I'm doing it, I'm aware of it, yet it's as if I am watching myself lose it from afar. Within minutes of regaining composure I am remorseful and apologetic. Is this a type of dissociation? I dont even feel like I know who I am. Any advice or direction?"
293,Does anyone with DPD/DR experience like nightmares and or really vivid dreams when they are asleep as this has been constant with me since having DPD/DR / Anxiety / Depression? Thanks
294,"I’m 20 and Recently I’ve been feeling nothing at all.. my grandad died 2 weeks ago and i didn’t feel anything towards it ... I have no motivation for anything I just feel empty and most of the time I care about nothing ... I am neither happy or sad I’m constantly in between seeing numb , and I don’t really know why. Sometimes I wish I could care and be motivated but I can’t .."
295,Does anyone know anything about this/ have any experience this? It’s something I’ve always done but it’s really causing me great sadness at the moment
296,"I don't know how to exactly describe this, and I don't know what to expect from posting this but here it is:

I realized I've been experiencing dissociation since middle school, when I feel my depression had really started. But it's middle school, you know? Everyone was going through it. 

Another part of it is that I always felt like I was being watched. Not past-tense, well maybe not recently, I don't know. I just remember being watched. Maybe that's important. 

I think the issue is that I dissociate often. I can max out my headphones and the music never seems loud enough, I can go outside and it's never as cold as everyone looks. Maybe it is. I don't know. Recently, I've been going through this weird brain-thing where things trigger memories from my childhood. It's like, a sudden nostalgic feeling of ""Hey-Remember-This?"" and I'm thrown back into this little memory briefly. 

Usually I can stop myself from being lost in it, but if I'm intoxicated it's a lot harder. It just seems so real, sometimes I don't even know if it's a real childhood memory, but they are always childhood memories. I link things together that have no real correlations, at least, looking back they don't. Maybe that's my creativity hitting a weird point. I brought it up to a counselor, but she said it's nothing concern if I know what reality is. 

That's valid. I don't know. Is this anything? Am I just overthinking? Is this anything concerning? I just wish I could stop being this way. I recently spoke to a friend, telling her I think I had a spirit following me. She said the air around my back felt heavy. Maybe she's also crazy. Maybe that's why I've felt watched, maybe that's the reason for every bad shit that's ever happened. 

This is really long. TL;DR basically, I've been dissociating for longer than I realized, childhood memories often burst out of the woodwork for no apparent reason, and I'm wondering if they are connected?? Maybe? Sorry if this was too confusing."
297,"I don’t really know if I have any partcialuar mental illness or I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, I’ve never been to counseling or any other type of doctor and now I am a little bit lots with my mental state and how to handle it.

I know that I dissociate a lot, as in constantly, I can barely listen to a conversation fully and my girlfriend always notices it and mentions it, I work in retail too which is sort of frustrating because I’ll get lost in thought all the time and make so many mistakes, sometimes I get sad about it but other times I feel to detached to really care, which to be honest just makes me more frustrated.

I know that in my mind there are different people, about 9 to 11 of them, some seems closer to me than others and some are more present than others, they feel very real, like I know they are in my head but they are like human, and influence my deaisions and mood at the time, they seem to love me and feel close to me but in the end it makes me feel a little lost from the world, maybe a little less human.

I know that my mood changes often, I do get depressed, suicidal, anxiety and so on, while I also get burst where I feel completely confident and happy and hyper.

I know that I sorta loose track of how to talk to people, like a isorta forget and can concentrate on a lot of stuff. Everything sorta feels all messy to me now but I’ve told you a lot already of what I do know about myself. I don’t really know how to handle it all anymore, it’s starting to seriously affect me and how I functions in society it seems, like I just feel so lost."
298,"How can cbt help when there is no thought or feeling attached?

When I am effected it's like I'm a tranced observer watching myself on ""autopilot"", I am dissociated from words spoken and even feelings being expressed. How can changing thought processes help when it's like an unconsious defensive function I can't influence and steer when in control?"
299,"We've all heard the saying, ""like a living nightmare"" but has anyone ever actually felt like they're living in a nightmare? Like still dreaming, a bad dream, even though it's reality and you want to wake up so bad? I've been feeling like this for a while, could it be my adjustment disorder coming back or something else?"
300,Hello . I am currently having trauma therapy for my issues and wondered does anyone know of other things or help you can get for trauma issues. I have had chronic trauma and also neglect as a child. I do things to help myself like trying to be self living at times. I use emotional freedom technique sometimes. I just wondered if anyone knows of any self help trauma books that could help. Or anything else that might help me other than the therapy that I am doing. I just had trauma therapy today. very difficult session. just been crying. find it all very difficult.
301,"Has anyone else been victim of systematic chemical violence? I even left my original country because of it! The biggest reason for the hatred for the country I left behind is deliberate bombardment by antipsychotics (Diagnose ADHD), cannabis (I told on 2004 for the ADHD-therapist that it causes psychosis), I might be hermaphrodite (female hormone antagonists) so why those people I left behinadjust don't leave me alone and check the mirror why I hate them!

302,":cry2: Hello Ive had dissociation for about three years now. Im terrified that its only going to get worse and worse to the point where Im completely unaware of my surroundings. Its slowly gotten worse as the days go by. I feel like im not in reality. Almost like if my life is going on without me but still being a part of it. I'm zoning out alot I feel like nothing is real anymore. I cant drive anymore because I get tunnel vision and zone out while driving. It seems to get better when im in the house with only the sunlight coming through the windows(no bright lights) but when I go outside during the day it gets so much worse. I have absoutely no friends because its made me have terrible social anxiety to the point where I cant talk without forgetting what words to use in the coversation and feeling like I just dont know what to say to anyone. I have a hard time even being around my family because I feel like everything I say sounds stupid and they're judging me because I just dont know how to talk to them. Ive been living with my husband and my son and dont get out unless its going to the store or doctors appointments so being around someone, unless its my husband and son, its just very awkward and terrible being around people. I dont see my parents much anymore so i get like this around them also. My memory is also terrible. I can hardly remember anything from my past, including people. I am also having a hard time making memories. I have epilepsy so this on top of epilepsy is making my life miserable. I feel like im slowly loosing my self. I dont know what to do because I have no support. my mother and sadly my husband also just tell me its in my head and im being a hypochondriac. I tell them these things and they just brush it off not knowing how terrified i am because they dont believe me. Its terrible. I feel like no one gives a crud about my well-being. I need advice as to how to cope with it and if there is any possibility that I can go back to my normal life without these symptoms. Thank you for reading this :)"
303,"Hello all
Sorry for my absence. Been both busy and in a bad place mentally! (Almost attempting suicide, that kinda stuff)

So I think one of the last topics that were created with this account was by my alter Robin.
She claimed she was ""my voice"" because yes she was one of the voices... Except it wasn't a psychotic symptom, it was my alters communicating with me (I did always mention they were parts of me!). I never realized that I had alters until one day one of the 'voices' took over my conscious mind and body.

I don't have a diagnosis yet. I just know I have alters and they are real to me. The stuff I experience seems to be very very similar to OSDD, if not the same, though I don't feel confident in saying anything more than this.

Aside from Robin (who is my protector) I have a child alter whose name is Lilly - she is around 8 years old but I'm not going to let her come here since you need to be at least 18 to do that.

Well this is kind of an ""update"" thread but feel free to tell me about your experience as a DID or OSDD system, you can also send me a private message. I'm always happy to talk to other systems.

Sorry if I did not reply to messages in the past month :)"
304,"With DID
Can alters know about having it while the main host questions it?
How fast can the switches be, and can they be involuntary? Could they be sudden and seemingly without warning?
Can alters have different illnesses themselves?"
305,"I got my dp/Dr from anxiety and it sucks it's such a horrible feeling but guess what ? It's not something you have to deal with for the rest of your life. Many and I mean many have really over come this. Dp/Dr is a defensive mechanism that triggers it's self to protect us, part of the brain that progress realism shut downs to cope with too much stress or/And anxiety that triggers it. I promise you won't go crazy or will be this forever. To cope and recover you must accept it , nothing is really wrong with you is your fight or flight instic going trigger happy. The second is cope with as much as its hard try to live your daily life go outside for walks and just try to distract your self which is the 3rd step. Not thinking about it it helps you recover , acknowledge is there but don't give it your attention. Exercise would help you on that yet you get to ground your self. Most important SLEEP enough. Try to keep a routine sleep scheduled and follow it. I also change my diet more chicken blueberries and yogurt seem to help and don't take no caffeine alcohol or sugary drinks or food. I also tend to pray and went back to being a Christian which to me it help me big time. It would take time it won't happen from day to another. You would start seeing results when your brain starts recovering from the stress. It's okay if you have your falls every now then none is perfect but practice makes you better. Don't give up I thought I would never recover and i was gonna live like this for the rest of my life but I was sure wrong. Now I feel I got a second chance at life and I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy but I'm glad it happen. I see life from a different angle but with sure more happiness and motive to do better. I wish y'all the best in your path to recovery. Its your own body take it back and live it up."
306,"Hello Everyone. 

I am new here to this site and this is my first post.  I got diagnosed with a Dissociative disorder recently.  One of the symptoms that bothers me the most is that I feel invisible like I don't exist. I mean I can see myself but I don't know how others can see me.  I don't know what other people are looking at when they look at me.  It astounds me how cars wait for me to cross the street because I feel like they should not be able to see me.  I simply feel like I do not exist at all.  

Some other symptoms I have are that I cannot recognize myself in the mirror (I see a stranger),

I don't know who I am psychologically, I have a weak sense of self. 

I hope all this makes sense.   I want to know if any of you out there share this symptom of invisibility as I feel all alone. Thank you."
307,"I grew up in a Christian home, which I took very seriously as a child till my late teens. To the point where all I wanted was to be a monk or a priest, and serve God. I was extremely dedicated, and was out to be the greatest Christian there was. I am now an atheist. My rationality and skepticism gears kicked in and fortunately, I was able to escape that horror show, that nightmare. However, life lasting impacts of my childhood remained. At this point of my awareness, the largest impact left with me is that I find it difficult to take this world, this life, seriously. I lived my entire childhood and teens dreaming of what's next, that this life isn't important, that it's a stepping stone to the next existence. I used to watch people and see them so caught up in, as I would see it, futile and insignificant things. They'd become irrate over silly and minor things... to a point where if I were faced with one of these creatures, it would amuse me, because it seemed so shallow to me. So weak. So short sighted. 

Now I dream of the stars, the galaxy, the cosmos; discovering and bettering. But I'm stuck in this mudpit, dominated by shallow, narrow-minded, automatons. The human race, in its current form, disgusts me. It's a selfish species. A rotten species. I feel like we deserve nothing. We murder, we kill, we lie, we cheat, we hide, we over use, we rape; we slither and slide like a ball of insatiable snakes. Fortunately, there are the few who lift the rest of us up; the Einstein's, the Sagan's, the Bronowski's, the Harris's, the Dillahunty's, the Dawkins's, the Hopkins's, the Jackson's, the Picasso's. 

I'm stuck with my genes and childhood conditioning. When I see myself, I see inadequacies. I'm intelligent, but not intelligent enough. I'm skilled, but not skilled enough. I'm talented, but not talented enough. I'm good looking, but not good looking enough. I'm well off, but not well off enough. I'm special, but not special enough. I'm a man, but not man enough. I'm am the 80 percentile boy. Very good, but short of being great at anything. This life, and it's ancient drama, caught me in its web and devoured me. I never focused on anything as a child, nor as a teen; nothing was more important than the next life. I'm a wasted being who could have been, but will not, as much as dreams now wish it. I was bound with mental suffering for the decade of my 20's. Oh, the pain. The depersonalization. The lone and broken wolf. My dear me. My beautiful self, come here and one day will go. Lost to nothingness. One of the many... cosmic jokes."
308,"Hey, 

I feel a bit awkward and like this specific dissociation issue is rather trivial and a lot less bad than other people have it but here goes. 
I have all sorts of mental health issues (PTSD, BPD, Bipolar etc) Currently about to start therapy again to try and pin point more specifically what I suffer from. 

The most recent diagnosis has been dissociation. No further than that for now. I dissociate in all sorts of settings, at uni, at home, at work etc. As soon as things get too overwhelming I zone out, which I don't actually mind too much, it helps me cope. 

I have started dating this lovely person, and the dissociation is at its worse when we spend time together. Like she doesn't feel real. I literally just got back from having dinner together and it feels like a dream. Like it never really happened. 
I think my brain is trying to make this unreal so I don't attach myself and get hurt again (attachment and abandon issues). 
It makes me ever so sad. This relationship looks like it could be something nice and healthy. And my brain won't let me have it. 
Has anyone experienced something similar/managed to get out of it?"
309,Hi I am new here and I would like to share my experience to see if anyone else is going  through the same thing. I think I have derealisation. I feel like I am in a dream or a movie that is never ending. I look out the window and I feel like I am looking at a movie scene or still dreaming and I get these strange feelings all the time. It is so hard to explain. I dwell on the past and wish I could go back so bad and knowing i cant ever do that is driving me crazy.  I also worry and dwell on the future and it gets worse the older I get. I also have trouble with change and its really bad at the moment. Like any small change makes me feel weird and now if I try to do anything i just feel weird. I had this after my first child was born but it wasnt as bad as it is now. I have had so many losses over the past few years that I am constantly grieving and i know i wont ever get over losing people and pets that I love. I just lost another one of my beloved cats and I am beside myself with grief. Also about 3 months ago my son and father disowned me for no real reason and then my best friend stopped talking to me. So now I have no one who cares about me and I have no one to talk to so I sit at home all day alone and isolated with just thoughts going around and around as I am a chronic over thinker which I am sure doesnt help. I am so lost and alone and feel like i have no purpose in this life anymore and no reason to go on. The very thought of going out and trying to find a friend does my head in and freak me out. These weird feelings are getting worse every day and I feel like my mind is going to disappear and not come back. I also get memory feeling triggers if i see something in  a movie or in real life and it makes my mind go back to that time in my past and not only do i see the memory but i get the exact same feelings that I had at that time in my past. Its so hard to explain. I am in a constant state of weirdness that even the thought of getting up off my seat and doing something else makes me feel strange. Does anyone have anything similar to this cause I feel that I am alone with these feelings and thoughts and I am afraid if they continue I will have no choice but to end it all. Please help
310,"Im not sure if this is the right forum to post this in, but something ive noticed is when things are not about you, especially in relation to everything that goes on (a timeline, a continuum), and when things you think are important, the second party told you that it was anything but

Granted there will always be a bias on perspectives, or what you expect in return, what happened is someone might have envisioned the picture of a person that played that role for them. Of which you didnt stand a chance. Its unhelpful in making me think that i would have got the same result for not even venturing out than get the same end result

311,"I have felt out of control and uninterested in my own life since I was 12. I just recently had my 18th birthday. One day, I woke up and wished I hadn’t. That general feeling of dread and monotony has not gone away a single day since it’s occured. Everyday I open my eyes and instantly wish I hadn’t. It’s really taking a toll on me, especially since my parents think I’m a piece of shit, and they don’t miss an opportunity to tell me that. Every goal I ever fixate on ends up becoming too overwhelming and challenging for me and I just give up. I have no motivation to do anything, even basic human functions. I don’t even want to clean my fucking room. I can never force myself to go through with something. I can never start anything I finish. Recently, I attempted to sign up for the Army, but my weight was over tge limit for my age and height, so I went to work. I went on a strict diet and exercise routine and lost over 12 pounds in 3 weeks. Then, I gave up. I stopped having any drive to pursue my goal, and stopped working out and quit the diet. I tried to relight my spark, but nothing happened. Because of this, my parents are pissed at me again. “You have no motivation! You’re doing nothing with your life, and everyone else your age knows exactly what they’re doing. Take [friend] for example, they have a plan and they’re passionate about it. What are you doing?” They say stuff like this all the time and it makes me disassociate even more. They call me a snowflake for getting hurt by the things they say. I have never told them how I feel, I am too scared to. They’d say “You’re just making up excuses, you have no reason to feel this way” and so on and so forth. It’s true, I don’t have a reason to feel like this. But I still do snd I can’t help it or make it go away. They compare me to everyone, from my 10 year old brother to my friends and cousins. Everyone is somehow inherently better than me, which is true. I’m working hard to move out. I already have a job and I’m trying to pick up another. There is an apartment by my job, and it sparked my interest. They got incredibly mad at me for this, and it instantly discouraged me from it. Yet, they still want me out and tell me they can’t wait for me to leave. My mother told me that about an hour ago. I still try and please them to the best of my ability. I’m afraid to kill myself because I’m afraid to hurt them and my friends. I feel like I am living for other people. I can’t live for myself. I have no interest in life itself. I just want to cease existing. I’m stuck in such a rut and I don’t know what to do."
312,"I've been here once before and now I'm here again.

I'll talk about the first time I ever experienced this, which was three years ago when I suffered withdrawals from my anti-depressant medication. It triggered off depersonalisation in me and I had it for roughly 3 months. During that time I went back on my anti-depressants and also went to therapy which both helped a ton. I haven't experienced it in 3 years...

until 2 weeks ago. I had a massive panic-attack and I guess that panic attack triggered the depersonalisation. I'm finding it really difficult to cope with because I also have anxiety and depression on top of this that I'm struggling with right now and it's making me think all kinds of crazy things, such as,

""Am I going insane?""
""Am I going to end up having a psychotic episode and killing myself or someone?""
""Do I have a brain tumor?""
""Am I even real?""
""Am I in a dream?""
""Perhaps I'm seriously ill?""
""Am I going to die?""

I feel everything is out of my control and my life is spiraling. I did have one good day throughout these 2 weeks, but today I just went back to feeling like this.

Is there any good advice out there on how to cope with this?"
313,"hi everyone
hum
this is strange to explain
ok
so i have been diagnosed almost three years ago with BPD and PTSD. i am still being viewed regularly at the hospital, that’s alright. 
the things is, i get really bad dissociation/depersonalisation moments since, well, as long as i can remember. my psychiatrist believes it has gotten really better since te forst time i walked into her office, but i doubt that more and more...
i have many situations i could recall and explain longly and boringly bit these, i can understand them, i can talk about them, i can deal with them (they also found me 130+ of iq, so i guess that’ll be useful.)
but. 
there’s one situation that peculiarly troubles me and makes me even slightly embarrassed...
the only tie i have really been able to make (because ues i’m that one idiot that googles their symptoms, read every article ever about anything related or not to what they might have amd get tp the hospital claiming they have brain cancer) and the onoy real tie i was able to make (other that dissociation) is alien hand syndrome
but, obviously, i don’t have any pf the neurological prerequisites, nor it’s about my hand. 
(that’s the part where it gets weird)
i’ve always felt really confortable in my body and what i looked like (i have passed my entire childhood with a father telling that i least, i was pretty, or else i’d be a waste of air) but there’s one part that makes me incredibly uncomfortable,
my feet. 
pr more exactly, my toes. 
(it isn’t weird. it isn’t weird.)
let me explain: they always have been quite alien like to me, i guess, but i really started to notice when i was 9/10/11. i remember i was reading a book, lying on ly bed, and my mum’s boyfriend of the time came in and made me notice that my toes and my entire foot actually but mostly my toes were dangling and hanging in a weird position, and when i looked at it i realised it was painful, but i couldn’t move them. so, i played it off. i have many other moments that followed over the years where i could just stare at them and find everything wrong about them. 
they’re so strange, alien-looking, like my heel is 1,5 inches wide but the front with my toes is like a good 4 inches, toes are weirdly smooth yet so asymmetrical with inconsistent, bumpy nails and weird shape and some are long and thin, longer that the others that are small and fat. on top of it, i am fair to the point where you cansee my veins UNDER MY FEET. it’s almost as if i could retrace my bone structure. 
it doesn’t really creates a problem in everyday life, just when i wake up the morning from i nightmare (my meds help me with anxiety but make me have weird dreams every night) it’s the first thing i see and it troubles me, or when i’m having a panic attack (like right now, as i’m typing this) it just makes me more confused, but it a way it makes me focus on something else. mybe it’s a defense mechanism from my brain to distract myself from thoughts like « everyone hate you you should cut and swallow lots of pills », you see?
it’s like the opposite of a foot fetish, witch could maje sense because the most accepted theory about foot fetishising is that the part of our brain that recognises body part sometimes confuses feet with genetelia, so...
i don’t know. 
i need to stop asking google everything (and look where i am. that’s probably the only real damage from that strange obsession.)"
314,"My daughter has been officially diagnosed as having sever Generalized Anxiety Disorder and severe Social Anxiety Disorder. However, after I posted about her symptoms in the Anxiety Forum, a person there said that some of these behaviors were not anxiety behaviors. In particular, I'm talking about disassociative  behaviors. I'm sure I spelled that wrong...anyway, she has not been cooperative in getting to therapy and she has another condition, a medical condition that could potentially be severely harming her. She has severe Vitamin D deficiency. About a year ago she went to a regular doctor and he prescribed that she take three times the normal dosage of Vitamin D for three months and then come back. She has neither taken the Vitamins, nor gone back. Vitamin D deficiency can cause early onset Alzheimer's and a variety of other conditions. 
She is an adult, married, with four kids, all living in our home. I think that not taking the Vitamin D is causing imminent danger to herself, and thus could mandate treatment in a psychiatric hospital, but I'm getting that death threats to herself or others are the only things that qualify as threats severe enough to warrant treatment against her will. Your thoughts would be much appreciated as I am desperate to get her help."
315,"I’d like to open up about an experience that I had. There was this one girl in my Nursing program, her name will be kept a secret, but she was “alright”. I started talking to her at almost the end of my 2nd semester in Nursing. Everything was going well, we were getting along well, I was interested in her and she seemed to be interested in me, but my “pure” intention was to get laid, I call it pure because I had no intention of hurting her. What really captivated me was her Instagram page, she was a gamer, just like me. I played WoW (World of Warcraft) and was a major geek, coincidently enough so was she and she was also a Virgo, just like me, all these coincidences created these funny feelings in me, which were a precursor to love. She was also Filipina (I don’t know if this matters but I thought I’d add this even if it sounds immoral.) She was Asian, which I really liked since I had always had an obsession over Asian girls due to my hobbies such as anime watching and manga reading and well oh well we talked a lot. We would talk everyday which built the “delusion” in my head that she was my girlfriend. (I don’t know if this is a delusion or not since I could never ask her myself if we were anything more than “friends”, if we were friends even, but based on what happened, which will be explained after, it seemed that she was not my girlfriend) so we proceeded to talk daily until the day where she flipped at me happened. She “insulted” me, and told me that she “doesn’t have a d*** for me to s*** on” which made me think that she was calling me “gay”. It came out of nowhere, and from a girl like that any guy would feel insecure so what I did was pretty evil (if she happened to be my girlfriend, which it seemed that she was not). What I did was go out partying with friends and hook up with a bunch of random girls, It was an easy task to do so, since I was 6’8, built and tanned. After the fact I proceeded to get back to talking to her and found myself falling deeply in love with her, a love that I have never felt before, it was an obsessive and cruel kind of love. After having some trouble distinguishing what was what, because of the mental issues that I was having, I saw this kind of “guide” on Facebook that was telling me that what SHE wanted was for me to tell her that I loved her and that she wanted to marry me, so I proceeded to ask her friend if she wanted to marry me, to which I go a straight “No” in reply, I also proceeded to tell her that “I love her” just like that, I confessed my love to her, which at the time seemed pure, since I have never felt like that for anyone else and have never met anyone like her. All this caused her to block me off Facebook, and not only that, I tried making new account (multiple) and talk to her again, explaining what I was going through which at the time seemed to be Psychosis, and that if she could help me out because I was in need of major help distinguishing what was real about her and me and what happened and what was not, in which I just got a no reply and another block. It’s been 4 years, and I have tried multiple times talking to her, now the questions are.

Will she ever talk to me again?

Did I do anything to her so that she would not talk to me ever again?

WHAT HAPPENED!?

Thanks for your time and for your input."
316,Please say yes :cry:
317,"Hi All,

I'm new to the community.

I'm a 27 year old female and After a stressful 6 months i think I have been experiencing depersonalization. Sometimes my limbs feel like they don't belong to me, like they are slower, when in reality they are moving just fine.
It feels like I'm in another world. Almost like a trance like state, and when this happens, I have problems initiating swallowing. It does not get stuck, and I do not have a lump in the throat feeling, I just have to maybe try twice if I'm distracted.
So basically I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced problems initiating swallowing while they have depersonalization? Also my first bout of depersonalization started after I had my first panic attack. 

Does this even sound like depersonalization?

Its really getting me down.

Any replies would be greatly appreciated."
318,"Hello all,

My illness could come under Anxiety, OCD and Derealisation so I wasn't too sure which issue to post under. In posting I'm just wondering if anyone has been through what I'm currently going through as sometimes it feels like I'm on my own and that recovery is unlikely. If anyone also has any advice on tools and techniques to overcome this illness it would be much appreciated.

I was first ill when I was 18, just before starting university. I hadn't been independent growing up and was both shy and bullied at school. The prospect of independence and pushing out my comfort zone at univesity was daunting to say the least. I started feeling depressed about a month before leaving but didn't initially understand what I was feeling but was just aware that I no longer felt enjoyment doing activities I previously loved and didn't feel motivated to do anything at all. Once at university I wasn't that outgoing but was fortunate to already have friends there and made some more. For the first few months, while depressed I wasn't struggling with university as much as I thought I might.

However, exam time came and with it I very much went into my shell, not leaving my room for meals and barely seeing friends. During this time my anxiety heightened and my first experience of derealisation began. As well as some conspiratorial thoughts I started to have thoughts that the world around my wasn't real and also that it may be a computer program with possible glitches. From this point on, while I never truly experienced anything that proved my theory I very much had to prove that things around me were real and that I also wasn't seeing things. This involved: seeking reassurance from others that people and vehicles I saw existed; keeping an eye on moving people to ensure they didn't disappear; persuading myself that people or things had appeared from nowhere; hoarding items as evidence that they were real; taking pictures of things as evidence that they were real; having thoughts that those closest to me may be involved in the unrealness; keeping an eye on my food when eating to ensure nothing disappeared; analysing past events to disprove their realness, counting people and items and not being throwing things away easily.

These symptoms worsened over the following month and I eventually left university in the February of 1st year, returning home. My symptoms worsened further and I even had to get reassurance that things I heard were real, eventually I was admitted to hospital and placed on medication. Just a few months later I was able to leave hospital, return home and eventually resume normal life. However, while my symptoms largely disappeared, at points over the following 10 years I would still check and hoard things.

In November of 2016 I had been working in a graduate job for a few months, it hadn't turned out be what it had seemed and I also worked away from Monday to Friday every week. This awful work life balance had caused increased anxiety and eventually I had to leave the job. Unfortunately the damage of the anxiety had already been done however and my symptoms deteriorated, once again leading to symptoms of OCD and derealisation.

Again, I was put on medication and quickly returned to a largely normal life within just two months, a much shorter timescale than the previous time I had been ill ten years previous.

However, in February this year I again found myself with some stresses in a new job and other personal issues. Initially this had caused some anxiety but was at a level I could deal with. Unfortunately, when driving to an airport in early February on the motorway a tyre had blown and the car had crashed, flipping in the process. Both me and my fiancee were fine and surreally were on a flight just a few hours later. However, on returning from holiday the shockof the accident, coupled with my previous stresses returned. Within four days of returning to work my anxiety was at its peak and eventually my OCD and derealisation started to set in.

Two months later, I am on medication and receiving therapy but don't seem to making progress. Understandably this is very frustrating just over year after I was last ill and also as on that occasion I had already well into my recovery by this point. Currently I seem to make some progress but then fall back to where I was soo enough, each time new symptoms also seem to arrive with the fall.

As such I feel the situation is somewhat hopeless and worry both that I may not get better and also that if I do it's going to a very long and tough battle, difficult when I already feel like I have given so much fight already."
319,I'm new here so i don't really know what category to post in..i have schizoaffective disorder and for about 6 months I've felt like I'm on the outside looking in. Maybe someone will know what i mean. I feel like I'm watching myself do daily activities and I'm in a haze. My therapist told me today it was a symptom of depression. Which i have been very very depressed but i didn't know that. I have alot of other symptoms. But I've never had a real problem with depression just with mania. I put on a happy face and stuff but it's just a front. My daughter also has dispersonalization. I feel sorry for her since i know what it feels like.
320,"Hello :),

I am 18 years old and have left university, having only spent one term there, because I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety (around December time). I am taking 100mg of sertraline a day to help me cope, and needless to say, I seem to be a lot happier. However, one thing that isn't improving is this element of depersonalisation/derealisation. My GP hasn't specifically told me that I have this, however, I have researched a hell of a lot and all of the symptoms seem to pretty much correlate to what I'm experiencing. 

I wake up every morning feeling so depressed, it takes me a while to get out of bed. Then when I finally do get out, I just don't feel real; it feels as if everything is a dream :unsure: . 

As well as this, it takes so much energy to undergo the simplest of tasks, i.e. brushing my teeth, showering, even merely walking anywhere. I just feel like I'm going to pass out/fall asleep any minute. Not to mention the debilitating fatigue and lethargy!! :low:

The vast majority of the time I feel as though I am watching someone else live their life. I feel almost automated or zombie-like (these are terms I used to describe the sensation before I read them on any article about depersonalisation). 

My issue is that no one seems to consider this a severe problem, because I am able to clamber about my day. However, I haven't got a job as I simply just lack the energy and motivation for one.

It is important to note that, in university, I discovered the pleasures of weed. I was smoking a hell of a lot in university and would sometimes even turn up to my lectures stoned. Nonetheless, I would not consider myself to have been, 'addicted' to weed as I did not feel any attachment or dependency towards it. I also have not done any drugs since November of last year (I stopped MDMA a while ago).

My point is to question whether weed is a significant factor when it comes to depersonalisation and anxiety; I had never experienced these disorders prior to university. 

If anyone could shed any light on my situation, because I have never been so confused in my life, that would be amazing! :peace:

Thank you!!!"
321,"hi, I am at a bad place in my life at the moment, but I am not looking for support exactly. I am however looking for honest answers in reply to this post whether they be negative or positive as I would always rather be hurt by the worst truth than fooled by the best lie. So if you think the worst may be possible, please don't hold back and tell me because that will help me confront the objective reality of the situation rather than delude myself into thinking everything is ok. I therefore am particularly looking for people who have suffered from both groups being Dissociative Identity Disorder and Depersonalization Disorder and Anxiety so I can compare symptoms which is why I have posted this to forums for each disorder.

Now, in respect to what is going on, I need to go back in the past. When I was about 11, I was being repeatedly bullied and stopped leaving the house, a situation I was comfortable with which was not necessarily due to overwhelming anxiety but just due to comfort. I became a schizoid somewhat.
When I was 15, I suffered a severe loss that to this day I have not gotten over. To cope with this, at the time I remember holding my breath and forcing myself to stop crying and it worked with the price of not being able to properly feel any emotion whatsoever. I was comfortably numb. 
When I was 16, I developed schizophrenia. The mental health system sectioned me and I was in hospital for two years and then again for another two. The anger I felt 24/7 towards the doctors, the staff, the people who were bullying me in the hospital and the objects of my delusions was so overwhelming that sometimes I found it hard to breathe and sleep. 

Up to the present day (I'm 26 now), not a day goes by that I don't feel overwhelming hatred for this entire world and everything it has done to me, but I managed to find somewhat of a solace in reading and sleeping. I have been out of hospital for a year and a half and was becoming positive about life despite not being able to fully experience it but out of the blue I developed more symptoms. Without going into it too much, my depersonalization-derealization got much worse. I want you to imagine the following: you'll be doing something and all of a sudden you feel like you've lost consciousness for a split second and a little palpitation wakes you up similiar to a myoclonic jerk which is where people nod off only to be abruptly woken up by the fact that their head has dropped. This is the symptom I am noticing along with all the feelings of loss of identity and unreality. Pragmatically speaking, my doctor thinks it is just anxiety but I think he's missing something. When these attacks happen (on a daily basis) I cannot think, speak or anything, it's like I have frozen or that I'm not there. I cannot tell whether it is a small panic attack or the beginning of uncontrollable blackouts. 

My question therefore is to the people with depersonalization-derealization disorder is do you ever have this and do you manage to live through life experiencing it but not ever blacking out completely?

My question to the people in the other forum with dissociative identity disorder and dissociative amnesia is whether this phenomena I am describing is similiar to what you feel when you black out and did it start like this?"
322,"I wasn't sure where to put this, and I'm not sure if this is a form of depersonalisation or not. 

I don't feel I have a strong, stable sense of who I am. I feel like I'm not really present, not really here with myself. I just feel like I'm an empty body, with consciousness but no identity or control. And I feel like I'm just asleep. I've tried looking within, but all I can find is emptiness. There's no one there. I understand why I'm always distracting myself all day, with books, forums, YouTube, games and movies, and why I'm constantly picking up my phone in a desperate attempt to find something to do. It's because there's nothing inside me. No one there. If I sit still and listen to myself, all I get is a great hole. Just emptiness. I think I've been like this for a very long time, years, but I don't know how many. I've just upped and left the building. I've completely lost myself. 

So I think, if there is nothing, I have to create something. If there is no-one, I have to construct someone. But how do I create something from nothing?"
323,"I thought it might be useful, maybe, to some people, to know some simptoms of dissociation, depersonalisation and/or derealisation.

I will put here my personal experiences, some of them lived exactly how they are related in speciality books, some not. I am not a specialist in this field, so these are my personal experiences, to be taken as that. Sometimes there were more simptoms amalgamated simultaneous, sometimes I experienced just one simptom. Some of them were interlocked with simptoms of PTSD.

The most horrible simptom of DDD (disociation/depersonalisation/derealisation, as I will abreviate this from now on) was that I am loosing my mind. This simptom occured when I was in extremelly stressful situations, repeated and of high intensity. Usually, the situation looked so desperate and without chances, that I felt I will go crazy. It is very hard to describe better what I felt, otherwise that to say that I felt I am loosing my mind. One is for sure: is extremelly painful. A lot of mental pain, unbearable. The most appropiate comparison would be with driving on the snow or sand and loosing control of the wheel at high speed and the cars is steering out of control. But the comparison stops here, as the mental pain cannot be describe and is awful and unbearable. General level of anxiety was extreme.

Visual hallucinations were other simptoms. They appeared suddenly, with no previous sign and looked very, very real. For seconds in a row I couldnt discern between reality and hallucinations, so vivid were the last. In these visual hallucinations I saw people and objects (for example trucks on the road) or other entities I cannot define (as a black tunnel, by night; or dense blackish fog, also at night when there was nothing, but the sky was clear; or animals passing the road by run - these I verified that didnt existed in reality as I checked with fellow traveler and he said there was nothing outside on the road). The people and objects from these hallucinations were with defined forms and colors and seemed 100% real. So real, that when I saw a truck, for example, I hit the break in order not to collide with it. The visual hallucinations had a duration of several seconds and dissapeared as sudden as they appeared. I never had auditive hallucinations of any kind. General level of anxiety was moderate.

Living in a movie. One of the most frequent simptom of dissociation was that I was living in a movie. Everything around me looked like was part of a movie which was playing in front of my eyes. All, the colors, the people, the landscape, the clouds, the light from the sun, everything looked like a stage from a studio and I am just a visitor. At the begining I didnt knew what is happening with me, I just felt bad, but latelly, when I found what is it from my psych, I didnt felt so bad anymore, I learned to identify the trigger and the simptom and not to be scared anymore by it. The sensation of being in a movie persisted, but I learned that it is an indicator that my level of stress went above my acceptable levels and learned partially to handle it and to try to relax and reduce the level of stress. Sometimes I was able to identify the trigger and to avoid or explain it to myself, as the sensation of living in a movie appeared suddenly, form a second to another. In this second I was ok, the trigger appeared and in the next second I felt like in a movie. General level of anxiety was high.

Being invisible. Some sort of living in a movie, but a little different, I felt like I am invisible to others. It was not very different from the sensation of living in a movie, but actually it was. I cannot describe the sensation entirely, I can only say that while when I felt like living in a movie I felt like I was a kind of observer, of a spectator, observing almost everything surrounding me, when I felt invisible I related somehow only to people around me, usually on the street. I felt that even if I bump into someone, that person it will pass through me as I was made of vapors or a fog, not from flesh and bones. The dangerous part at this sensation I believe that it was that I felt invulnerable, so I risked a lot, for example not paying attention to life threatening issues, like crossing a street and not paying attention to the cars speeding on it. General level of anxiety was high.

Living in an armored glass bubble. Somehow similar to being invisible, but I felt that I am living in a reinforced tranparent glass bubble, a glass bubble which protected me from anything surrounding. The suposed glass bubble was enveloping me for a radius of 1-2 meters around me, in all directions, like its name, a bubble. As I moved on the street, the bubble moved accordingly with me everywhere I went. General level of anxiety was moderate.

Forgeting things. Another simptom it was that I forget different issues. Sometimes I forget what I had to buy or what I had to do, even the simplest things. Sometimes I forgot where I put things or I didnt remembered if I worked with them. Another times I was forgeting was I was told by different people.

Time missing. There were situations when I observed that for certain periods of time I didnt knew what I did, like that time never existed for me. For example, I was looking at the clock and it was, lets say, 15:32 hours and when I looked again at the clock it was 15:37 and I couldnt tell what I did or thought in the 5 minutes elapsed. I could tell where i was, in what place in those 5 minutes, but otherwise it was like those 5 minutes never existed for me or were erased from my life.

Lack of concentration and coordination of movements. Frequently I could concentrate to the most easiest tasks, as grabbing a spoon and eat a soup without droping repeatedly the spoon. Sometimes I couldnt process the simplest information given to me. Other times I heard what one told me, clearly hearing and knowing what each individual word meant, but being completely unable to understand the meaning of the entire proposition or fraze, even if it was about the simplest things or ideas.

I will come in another post with other simptoms I experienced regarding DDD."

329,"So I've not posted on here before but really I think I'm looking for some sort of hope of guidance on what I should be doing with regards to life. My wife has just been diagnosed with Disassociation but they're also looking into DID but she hasn't has a formal diagnosis yet. 6 weeks ago she told me she no longer loved me, and then 2 weeks later attempted suicide however I found her in time. 

I know my wife is in there somewhere and that I adore every essence of her and her alters (although one is a bit of a bitch at times) yet she's so detached and says there is no future and I'm struggling to come to terms with that. She has weekly therapy but I just wondered if anyone had any advice, whether to take her word for what she says, It's over, It will never happen in the future and she will never love me again, or do I hope that the therapy helps her come to terms with whats going on inside her head and that maybe this is just an alter who doesn't want to be with me.

Regardless of this she doesn't wear a wedding ring and wants me to move out of our family home and that's still the plan because I need to sort my own depression and anxiety out before I could even attempt to try a future with her and our children. 

Any advice or thoughts would be amazing, thank you"
330,"Hi guys, so for the past 5 months i have been feeling very strange and not myself, I've been feeling a bit empty inside and very disconnected from people and myself. I notice I am doing the same things as I've always done, like laugh at the same things, but when i do these things it all just feels off and not normal, and i tend to get this horrible feeling in my head, which isn't brought on by anything, and just constantly think over and over why don't i feel like myself. In addition i have these mood swings daily, but even then the emotions don't feel the same. I think its due to the fact that 5 months ago i did some magic mushrooms with my friends, and the experience was good, but towards the end I did some weed, and i think it triggered a panic attack as my mood completely changed and i was very scared and felt down, in addition about a month later i tried LSD and again the majority of it was fun, but on the comedown, the thought that i don't feel like myself came back and it was horrible, and since then I've just felt very disconnected from my friends and family and especially myself, and the emotions i feel, feel very alien. Ive been to the my doctors twice about it, and they say I'm just having a bit of anxiety about it, and need to stop thinking about it, which could be true, but the past 5 months the mentality that i don't feel like myself has been in the back of my mind from the minute i wake up to the moment before i sleep, and so i find it hard to just forget, and despite what the doctors have been saying, i do feel that the panic attack i think i had from the mushrooms and weed has triggered the way I'm feeling. Sorry for a long message and if its confusing, its just very hard to describe, but any advice or conclusions you have from this would be very helpful. thank you:)"
331,"I'm worried that I may have DID. I know this will sound a little silly but I had a dream where I met a woman who said she lives inside of me. She said she was where my emotions come from. Idk if this really came from my subconscious or if it was just a dream. She named herself. None of my voices have ever done that. The voices I do sometimes hear in my sleep. 

Does someone with DID have insight into their own MH? I know when MPD/DID is mentioned in films that the sufferer isn't aware of alters. Is this accurate? I'm really worried about this. Not only do I possibly have a personality disorder but if I do have another personality its female. I know that sounds chauvinistic but why couldn't my alter be a wealthy playboy with a porshe?

I think I'll call my doctor today. Maybe he can talk me down."
332,"hi not really sure where to start. i just feel like one big messed up person and i realised recently that its been like this my whole life. I started counselling today. I felt really uneasy at the end. She kept such eye contact with me and i hate too much eye contact. 
Ive noticed this a lot more these last few years - it just makes me feel very uneasy - i hate it.
At the same time i hate silence - the therapist that i had cbt with used to say it was because i was anxious. He's probably right. I hate seeing people because it means conversation. I hate the fear that i get from silence when its with other people - i end up talking so much i think it puts people off of me. I don't know what i talk about so i just go on from one subject to another - some people can't keep up with my randomness! I get that I'm anxious and i think i understand why - but it doesn't help me change the way i am. If someone ever said i have to just be me - i don't think i could do it.

i have two friends (although i don't know how others see me - because I'm not sure if I give the appearance of being 'popular' - when actually I'm more of a 'loner' - the one no one really wants to be around. I can't ask people what they think because id look like I'm mad! 

counselling today was hard - it was at the end of the session when i felt the most uncomfortable. She said to me that she finds me very interesting and really wants to know more about me. She said that i told her so much but it was all about other people. She said its almost like 'i have no sense of identity' and she wants to know who i am? 

i can't answer that because i don't know anymore. i think I've been fighting my whole life through one thing or another that whoever i was meant to grow up to got lost somewhere along the line. And i just no longer know who i am. 

how to i explain this to her? and what does it mean? i just feel like I'm stuck on the outside looking in and theres nothing i can do other than watch this life continue to unfold..."
333,"trauma stuff cant stand it no more felt weak and pathetic today :'(. todays been extremely hard lots of fear lots of emotional pain..little parts of me have been very present at times and i have felt quite scared.. i didnt like all this in the past still is hard even now its not going on was crying loads earlier was feeling very tiny very small and scared and alone. tried some eft tapping on myself today a few times.. but todays been a day i dont want to try much,. just want it to leave. felt i was drowning again today in my emotions and so alone and very very lost.. im so tired and its so scary  and i just want some happiness :("
334,"Hello.  Im not sure Im in the right thread or not, but recently I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that leaves me in pain, emotionally imbalanced and with insomnia.  I also had a year from hell with a ton of trauma, including 3 surgeries.  I use to be a happy go lucky/ active person, so this is a blow to my self esteem and mental state... I just can't get back into my life bc it will never be the same.  I often think dying would be a better state bc Im so depressed and don't want a this type of quality of life bc I mourn for my old one.  People talk to me and Im not even present anymore, Im a shell of myself.  I think of people who have had their lives taken (like in terrorist attacks or some type of killing) and think ""that should be me - those people want to live"". I just feel so dissociated from the world right now and just want to either go back to how things were (which obviously can't happen) or I fantasize of dying (not suicidal tho) bc I just want all the pain to be over and to finally rest in peace.  Has anyone else felt this way?"
335,this illness is so upsetting i never felt so horribly alone its so hard not feeling like myself sometimes feeling unreal feeling like im not here feeling like i am disappearing and then there is the sitting here feeling like i am in darkness and in a bad world like this evening.. like i still in the past.. some calm moments today but this evening i just feel like i am in pain and suffocating in darkness very lonely aswell..these different parts of me are so hard to deal with sometimes not sure happiness exists wish this would stop now.. very lonely in myself this evening and feel like im going to cry.. dont get what this is all about feel really little..
336,really get upset at my depersonalisation and my mental illness and my inabilty to barely walk one minute outside of the house.. got very upset earlier after tryin to walk outside managed 30 seconds not even that.. ive no idea how to do things outside the house with my illness my symptoms all this trauma stuff i am dealing with.. isnt exactly fair.. pull myself down for things that i cant still hardly do when to others these things are so simple.. they can go on there walks and feel normal they can not spend every day feeling abnormal.. how i wish i was normal and well just for once day.. living in a state of feeling wierd pretty much all the time really really gets me so upset i never asked to be this traumatised..people say they are only symptoms and nothing to be scared of but regardeless it still affects my confidence and i dont like feeling wierd so much..how i hate all this :(
337,"Hi there!
I'm here because after being trapped in my own head fo almost 3 years now I want other sufferers to help me break out.
Before i start I should mention I had a 'traumatic' episode around 3/4 years ago, and last year I had a major depressive episode that manifested in psychotic symptoms.
I am in what I assume is a dissociative state that is constant. I feel as if I am watching life as a movie or through a screen, and I remain trapped in my head, detached, as my body goes on auto pilot and acts for me. Due to this, things in my life tend to go by in a blur and I have a poor memory (I am also diagnosed ADHD). When I try to ground myself I seem to get intrusive thoughts about death, and on top of this it's very frustrating as I cannot break out of these seeming glass walls in my mind.
I've managed to ignore this add try and forget I was real and existed at all, like I was constantly watching a TV show, but as I go into higher education and my decisions become more crucial I find I need to focus fully. 
Is the ceaseless dissociation a common thing? Have people found a way to end it?
I see an assigned psychiatrist who I can seek help from however dissociation takes a back seat as it is not threatening to my life or future.
Thanks for reading! :-)"
338,"split personality .. a part of you loving and desiring another part of you , uncomfortable and confusing

right so i feel like a part of me loves and desires another part of me , one this makes me feel weird and uncomfortable at times , i know when a part of me is desiring and loving another part because i can feel it .. why does this happen wiithin split ? and what can you do to stop yourself feeling uncomfortable and weird ? it makes me feel weird at times .. and it makes me feel like some sort of weird freak , the fact that a part of me desires another part of me i find to be very confusing disturbing and strange and i don't understand it, it makes me feel mad"
339,"ok so i am a girl i quite possibly have split personality and there is a part of me which is male.. this can be or feel disturbing .. i have a twin sister and when i look at her i often see myself , my therapist says this is because i do not feel here and because she is my twin sister , that a so called ''reflection'' then occurs, if the man is here then when i look at my sister i feel like a man and she is a girl .. i'm not sure if i am even making enough sense or describing this properly to people... does anyone understand this ? and how do you deal with feeling like a different gender when you are not one?  I will tell you , i often get angry with this part of myself , and especially when it makes me uncomfortable  . I have split but i'm aware '' when the parts of there , i do not know if it's called co- conscious or something like that , but i never forget what i have done or lose massive chunks of time  , i just get uncomfortable with some parts of myself and it feels hard to accept them"
340,"right now i feel so strange , laying here feeling like a head is laying here , it feels like a head but who's... i don't recognise who is laying here i feel kind of weirdly ugly and like a bit of a freak is laying here... i also a few minutes ago had a strange experience in the mirror, i've experienced this before .. my face morphed in the mirror , felt my features looked odd i looked weird ugly freaky strange and unpleasant and i couldn't see me at all . 

laying here feeling disfigured and like my features feel different , i'm so sick of this illness... i feel unreal dreamy , not here , sad , lonely , disconnected , cut off , weird and the noises around me sound somewhat distant as if i am in some sort of a weird bubble .. 

any tips on when your derealisation and depersonalisation feels bad ... any tips on how to lessen how bad it feels? i did try a emotional freedom technique earlier trying to tap on teh dreamy feeling but i'm not sure it helped enough.. frustrated its such an annoying weird and horrible illness 

but on the positive i'm somehow a little calm which is nice ..i just feel weird and i'm tired of feeling so weird"
341,"I've had derealization for probably over a year now. It mainly started with general feelings that my surroundings were not real or I was watching a movie rather than actually living. I believe it started with overthinking, ""how do I know any of this is real"" type thoughts. Its changed over the past year and I am fully convinced that I live most of the time derealizing if not all the time. I zone out deeply sometimes and snap back into reality which makes me feel stupid and inattentive. Also sometimes I will be doing my thing, acting normally, when suddenly I will snap out of it and have a moment of clarity like ""I just did all that but it doesn't feel like I did it, more like I was watching a movie of my life."" Its seriously beyond annoying because I know it's in my head, but at the same time, I don't know. Its like a civil war in my brain. Basically these have become normal to me at this point and don't really phase me aside from some anxiety or depression unless the sensation was strong. The symptoms I'm experiencing that led me to post this are thoughts that are making me nervous or feel like I am slipping further into dr/losing my mind. Its thoughts like ""how are people so happy in this society? We are nothing more than a brain and body, created to reproduce and die, yet we have set up societal systems, rules that everyone has to follow"" or even as far as thinking about things which bother me, especially upon seeing the facebook live killer's video, like what would it be like if I shot my dad, or my sister, though I know that I could never do that, and I find that I am literally scaring myself. This is associated with a symptom I know a lot of dpdr people experience, the feeling like you are going crazy, or might go crazy and do something you don't agree with, or that you are already crazy. I need to know of anything people have done to cure themselves of dpdr or even treat it to the point where it isn't as crippling. I FEEL LIKE I SPEND EVERY WAKING MINUTE  AS A PASSENGER IN MY HEAD. Any tips, seriously any, or even amateur diagnosis or further explanation of the disorder. I apologize for the length of the post, but I start to describe a little bit and find myself needing to give every detail that comes to mind. For extra information, I have visited a few doctors, one of which prescribed me with add and put me on adderall, and others who say I have anxiety and depression, for which I have been given wellbutrin. The possibility of ocd has also been discussed, and I am currently awaiting testing to receive treatment for focus and/or reading comprehension."
342,I am only on week 2 on my AD but in anyones experience how long until dissociation problems go away when you started medication? I have major deppressive disorder and GAD. Thanks.
343,"Hello, about 7 months back I had a horrific experience. One night I took one hit of pot and had a very bad trip. The next morning i still felt high. It lasted 41 days. I didnt feel like i had control over my body and my perception was.way off. I had severe brain fog and had a hard time remembering things. I couldn't read, it made my head feel even worse. I was told that I had a cannabis induced psychosis but I looked up psychosis and didn't have the symptoms. Many months later i stumbled upon depersonalization disorder and all the symptoms fit exactly. My psychiatrist says that it wasn't it though. I think he's wrong.

During the episode I went to the ER three times because I didn't know what was going on and I had severe panic attacks. I now live with constant anxiety and my chest burns. It never goes away. I tried every anxiety med in the book but only benzodiazepines and gabapentin helps. Only the ER gave me a few benzos but my doctors won't prescribe them. So now I take gabapentin and it helps for about half of the day. I can still get panic attacks.

I also have horrific nightmares and I take prazosin for that. I have fewer nightmares now bit I still deal with very vivid dreams. I often try to fight myself to wake up and it's very hard. When I wake up from the vivid dreams I feel that same high disassociation feeling. It is also hard to keep my eyes open and focus. My body feels numb, it's difficult to move. I feel as though I'm still dreaming while I'm awake and moving around. It is a very intense feeling. It lasts usually 1 to 2 hours. Last night I had a bad episode and I keep getting that high feeling every so often. It has been happening a lot more often, about twice a week now. I don't know if it's a form of sleep paralysis or linked to depersonalization. Anyone experience something similar and what is it exactly? I know some of my other mental illness may contribute. I have bipolar disorder, ptsd, generalized anxiety, and apparently a sleep disorder."
344,"Hi, I know everyone's experiences are different so I thought I'd share mine. I often get physical symptoms where I lose sensations in my body, nothing looks or feels quite right, the floor underneath me seems to tip and sometimes everything feels too heavy. Thankfully  I don't have multiple personalities, it's more like instead of running as a whole, complete person there are lots of fragmented bits which make me up but which run independently of each other. I have a lot of trouble with being unable to recall old memories which I'm hoping might come back as I go through sessions with my psychologist. My memory day to day can also be pretty shabby, too.
One of the strangest symptoms is that sometimes I struggle to recognise my own face. I know it's mine but it doesn't look quite right, it's like there's a mask or a skin over it that isn't familiar. I also struggle with severe anxiety issues, too. I'm looking forward to reading through posts to see what other people's experiences are, and I'd be grateful to know if others experience the things I do, too."
345,"I have dissociative episodes when I am anxious or stressed. I get disorientated, don't know who I am or where I am. I have been told to take Lorazepam when this happens but I don't always remember to take it when I am having an episode. 

Until recently these episodes happened infrequently, when I was out and about. This was scary, but if I could recover enough to get home I was ok.

In May I had a severe dissociative episode which started in the doctors and carried on through most of the day. I was taken to A&E where I was hearing voices and seeing things that weren't there. I was eventually hospitalised in a psychiatric ward. I was there for several weeks because I was made homeless while I was in hospital.

I came out of hospital in mid-June and was moved into a council flat. Shortly after I lost my job (I'd only been working since the 10th April) as I'd been off sick for too long in my probation period. 

I'm now struggling a lot with living on my own for the first time in 4 years, and with money worries due to my benefits not really covering my outgoings. 

I am having minor dissociative episodes more and more frequently. I finally got to see me psychiatrist last month, and she just said I need to be less anxious and more mindful, but she didn't give me any ideas about how to do this. I'm struggling to get to my appointments with my care coordinator because I'm struggling to get out. I'm having to do things like food shopping online for the same reason. I'm becoming very isolated and feel let down by the medical profession.

Does anyone have any advice or suggestions?"
346,"Hey. Basically I've fucked up so much &#55357;&#56865; I have DID which is dissoicative identity disorder and I use different identitys but one of the identitys I had a baby (although I dont) its just what I thought and hear voices about. I was very suicidal so the service (not on fb or on here) conctated the police they have just phoned me and It was a policeman asking me if I was using this identity at first I said no as I'm scared but then he said its very important I tell him otherwise he will come round and seize my phone and then I put the phone down as thats all I want to say but since they have phoned a few more times so I dont know if they are on there way round now. fuck fuck fuck &#55357;&#56865; why cant I stop it ""the identitys""?! I cannot fucking stop them! They have been in touch with my mum aswell but my mum and all my family are in a hospice atm (my auntie has been taken to a hospice today). She has cancer. My heart feels like its stopped. Please dont judge &#55357;&#56476;&#55357;&#56475; The police have just been round aswell and fucked off, asking me not to worry these services and waste there time. Ive just had a big cry and harmed myself. I feel absoloute shit with everything thats going on &#55357;&#56468;&#55357;&#56866;"
347,"Does anyone struggle with feeling like you're not a real person, or wondering if you're really here? I don't mean on drugs, but stone cold sober. I mean sometimes not really being sure you're a real person, and looking in the mirror but not feeling connected. 

It helps sometimes when I press my palm against my partner's palm, I feel more in my body. When I'm alone, I feel all spread out. Or like I am only my mind, and I forget I have a body also. 

Does everyone experience this too?"
348,"I'll cut to the chase: 

Has anyone else had dissociation episodes that damn near mimicked some sort of brief psychosis? Because this is the strangest crap I've ever dealt with and I've dealt with some weird stuff. 

I have a long history with dissociation and memory problems. Some people have memories of doing things with me that I don't recall to any length, and sometimes it's just me not feeling real, or feeling that I'm looking out through my eyes but I'm not really in control, or that my limbs aren't mine, or I just revert inward and the world outside ceases to exist. This has been forever. Was in therapy at age 6 (although I never spoke a word) and it's been downhill since then--or before then.

Now, my issue has been that I get caught up in unrealities as a reaction to stress (it seems?). A god of Egypt gives me messages, a coworker controls my body and refused to let me be present, taking my thoughts e.t.c. . . and when I initially spoke to a professional about this, psychosis and prodromal schizophrenia was discussed, given I have a history with brief hallucinations, including voices, and paranoia. But what I hadn't mentioned to her, until just recently, is that this has been going on for upwards of three years. It took me a long time to feel okay enough to start being open about all of this.

These episodes will only last days to weeks, very rarely a month, but are nonetheless distressing and take up a lot of time of mine, and because of the frequency of occurrence, it doesn't fit the idea of brief psychotic disorder. When I come out of it, I realize how ""unreal"" it was (although I don't when I'm in that state) and I end up not being able to remember when it started or what I was upset about in the first place. In fact, after some episodes I""m pretty refreshed, simply because I don't remember why I was so stressed out. My psychologist got an idea that rather than an indication of psychosis that it's another form of dissociation, and I hear psychosis and severe dissociation can sometimes be very similar.

So, can anyone relate?:confused::confused::confused:"
349,"Hi!

This has a brief background but it is more about a newer coping skill and would like your opinion on. 

Many years ago I was diagnosed with DID and through many years all my alters have pretty much integrated on their own. Not that I don't notice another every now and again but they are not a present part of my life, which made my life pretty crazy. 

So nower days I notice that the best way for me to fall asleep at night is to ""pretend"" or mentally act out situations. It is all imaginative and I do it in my mind but I don't control it persay. Meaning that however it starts I just mentally do whatever would feel natural- with no consequences-. So I might run or argue or hide or even switch. None of it is real life situations but it could be a feeling I guess. Am I the only one who does this? Is this a weird coping skill? Sigh... 

Thanks for reading

350,"Hi, I've had mental health issues for many year from childhood experiences. I started seeing a psychologist a few months ago who has now diagnosed dissociative disorder. 

The main thing I'm struggling with is the fact that I feel that I want to die. I've discussed this with the psychologist who advised that is one of the personalities trying to protect me (most of them do!). Although I've spoken to her about how I feel, I don't feel able to speak about the steps I've taken. I've now stopped taking my medication with a view of stock piling so that it is there, whether I decide to take it or not. I'm scared to tell anyone about this as I know that I will have to get rid of them and don't think I can face that. 

Sorry for the long windedness of the post and if it makes no sense, I'm just not sure what to do."
351,"This happens on a spectrum and isn't always super bad but when there's loud noises, either actually loud like powertools or just like a rowdy classroom, or fluorescent lights or basically any lights that i focus on wrong, everything shifts and I shut down. My body feels unreal and my communication skills go away, and my entire consciousness feels like its retracting into my head until I become only my eyes. It doesn't get that bad most of the time but I've had it my whole life (I'm 19). I don't like it and I just wanna know why because nobody seems to understand

My many selves: how I learned to live with multiple personalities | Mosaic


I must admit to a certain amount of scepticism due to (a) The massive increase of incidence of DID since the 80s (b) The significant increase in number of alters people claim to have and (c) The rather uneven global distribution of DID."
353,That's what it feels like. Like I'm losing control. I have to ask Sally to be with me tonight. I'm supposed to go to fireworks where there will be ALOT of people. I'm nervous. I'm hearing bad things from the voices. I'm wanting it all to end but I won't do anything.
354,"Just for a bit of background: 
I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder back in 2010 but I didn't show signs of the illness until later in life so I remember what it's like to not have any symptoms. I find one of the most frustrating aspects of the illness is the issues of dissociation.  The unfortunate part about that is I can remember what it was like to be coherent, clear minded and in the moment so I know what I'm missing and it can be frustrating. Anyway,  I don't have any traumatic background in my life so I can't say there's a reason for being detached which can make it a little harder to know what to do to ground myself; all I know is this seems to be more of a problem at night because during the day it barely happens. It's not something I ever ventured to try to fix for whatever reason grounding never really came up too often in therapy. 

I would love if some of you could share what you might do to keep grounded. I'm open to any insights anyone might have."
355,"I've been doing trauma psychology for a few months now and a few times I have been so confused and dazed by what's gone on and blanks on my memory.
Last week I felt awkward. I dissociated again and it ended up with me coming back to the real world with my psychologist holding me rocking me in her arms telling me it's okay and that I'm safe. It's just made me feel so awkward there's obviously rules on place about physical contact but that went way beyond a high five which is our limit on touching. She told me the next day that I was trying to hurt myself and she had to stop me from doing that but I have no memory of it. Ive not acted in any self harming ways for over a year so why all of a sudden and what makes it worse is I don't remember any of it. 
I don't really.know what I want people toreplu but I needed robust get it out there and I didn't really want to tell anyone I know personally
Thanks for reading such a long post in advance"
356,"I've experienced bipolar disorder for years but when I've been really, truly depressed, I've had mood congruents (delusions and hallucinations), and also episodes of dissociation that can last hours or days. I've often been diagnosed with a mix of problems based on this alone, but I was just wondering if anyone else has had dissociative episodes linked with depression?

The best way I can describe it acting as a coping mechanism is like... I become so dissociated that emotions no longer exist? I've had it read back to me ""like the shutters come down"". The way I've tried to understand it is that my emotional and mental state is too dark for me to fully function and I become a slowed-down, non-responsive version of myself that feels unrecognizable. The out-of-body experience happens and it's like time and the world around me becomes irrelevant.

I call it dissociation because it seems like the most appropriate term, but clarification is also welcomed. So my ultimate question is whether others experience dissociation like this - if it truly is that - and if so, how do you cope? Does it actually help or hinder other depressive symptoms for you?"
357,"...something reminds me I dissociate?


Not every single time but, pretty often.
A week ago I was describing what depersonalization is to my friend and my head felt weird. That's a sure sign I'm dissociating. Then I looked at my hands and thought ""...these... are not mine???"" and yeah, you know the drill.

Yesterday during therapy I took a test and one question was about dissociation and bam. Weird feeling in my head. Couldn't focus. Dissociation."
358,"Hello all, I originally didn't want to post about this since I don't want to overthink stuff :scratch: but maybe not asking makes it worse.

So yesterday I experienced something weird. I was having an argument with one of my voices. I felt... very strange, it's hard to explain. The best way I could possibly describe it is, like having nausea but in my brain. Then suddenly everything became out of focus, and I felt like I was in a dream, I saw the word in slow motion. I was standing, didn't close my eyes or anything. Then I remembered I've read somewhere that when dissociating, focusing on your surroundings can help you snap out of it. Please note I know nearly nothing about dissociation, but that was the first thing that came to my mind. It worked, my vision went back to normal and the slow-mo effect stopped. The whole thing only lasted for some seconds but it was very intense. Was this dissociation? Or something else? Sorry if this question sounds dumb, don't mean to offend anyone!"
359,"Not 100% sure if I'm posting in the right place, but **fingers crossed**

My mental thoughts have been all over the place. Last week I was very suicidal, failed, but made me realize ""non-existence"" is something I seek feeling. Laying down in dark places, blasting music/white noise to block out the word and thoughts, always makes me feel the most at peace.
But, another issue has been feeling like I'm homesick of alternate reality selves. As if all my life I have been swapping between realities and the person I am in those realities, and I'm at the point of missing being some of them.
Sometimes I feel like I have alters, sometimes I know I do, and other times I feel like it's all in my head. 

I've been diagnosed with BPD and Bi-polar by different professionals. My current therapist calls me bi-polar, but i find her so hard to talk to about all these issues. One, she is known to end up being on her phone during sessions; though on days when I literally can't talk I don't blame her. But besides that, every time I first see her my mood can snap from ""all of these things are wrong"" to ""everything is AMAZING!"" 

....I just don't know what's going on, and would love some feedback. Again, sorry if this is in the wrong section; please let me know where it would belong . 
It is my first post."
360,"I don't know if I do have dissociation because I don't really know what it was. When psych put it on my report I thought is was completely wrong and she had misunderstood what I had said. 

I will find out more about it if I can."
361,"I don't know if this is a common thing, but starting back maybe a couple months ago I began to have feelings of my body being too full as if their were two separate entities inside me if that makes sense. Along with that feeling I also felt like I was in a foreign place even though I was in my own bedroom. Like everything I was seeing and feeling was mine but not like a separate part of me owned it. I closed my eyes and tried touching my face like a blind woman to see if I felt differently, but no not even my flesh didn't feel like mine. Along with those sensations I also felt someone screaming in my head I didn't hear anything I just felt it. My ears were ringing and my head was pounding I could feel the pain in the scream as well almost like the other entity in my body was in pain or was frightened and wanted to get out. I never actually heard the scream it's almost like the echo of it if someone were to scream in a large room. The feeling of my body being to full didn't just go away either it kind of subsided drifted away rather than disappeared. I don't know what any of this means, but if anyone has any advice or maybe have had a similar feeling then please feel free to reply."
362,"In this post, Magdalena Antrobus, PhD student on Project PERFECT, interviews Michelle Maiese (pictured above), Associate Professor of Philosophy at Emmanuel College, whose recent work centres on dissociative identity disorder.

MA: How would you describe Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)?

MM: It formerly was known as multiple personality disorder. Although theorists sometimes describe DID as a case in which two or more subjects inhabit a single body, I find it more plausible to suppose that it involves a single individual who suffers from delusions surrounding identity.

363,"Could this be related to DID?  (mentions a resurfaced memory but without details)

I recently had the experience of recovering a memory that had been repressed or perhaps more accurately, disassociated from.  In fact it seems I may have even recalled and spoken of the experience I recently remembered before, but I cannot recall specific instances.  It is as if I spoke of it, even that would slip from my memory.  An hour after the memory surfaced I fell on the floor screaming and screaming and over the proceeding few days have gone through various emotions with rage surfacing most recently.

I called relatives I lived with when I was hospitalized in a psychiatric institution with psychoses.  (I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.)  They told me the traumatic memory I recalled is real.  We didn't know who did it, but the residual scarring was documented in the hospital.  I will be trying to get my medical records if possible.  I do not remember any of this either.  According to them I claimed my mother did it.  I was told by my sister my mother had indeed hurt my back before, but I can't remember the event or how badly.

When the memory resurfaced it was my father.  I know how he did it and I am sure it happened.  The memory did try to go away again and I became confused as to whether it was false or real which was why I called my aunt and uncle.  In any case, something DID happen.

Now for a few years I have had four spirits/entities/personalities that I've had the impression represent aspects of myself or my whole self channeled through a particular form.  Mostly I have experienced them as spirit guides, but I had an incident in which the Shadow and I reversed places -- I was an aspect of him and he was fully in control of my body.  I also had an experience in which Tiger (a gay sensual protector) possessed me but in that incident he did not control every action.  He was able to fill me with an intense energy and give me an erection to give me a headsup that a particular person was attracted to me.  I finally had to end that particular relationship -- it may have been a warning.

Until recently I have not had any possession experiences.  After the memory surfaced I first called immediate family members to get verification.  They are all in denial.  My mother showed absolutely no concern, did not ask what happened when the memory resurfaced, did not ask if I am okay, and promptly hung up.  She later chastised me for asking my grandfather about it.  My grandfather first said he was not sure, then denied it.  My mother and grandfather are alcoholics so they would probably have a hard time remembering, but I know my step grandmother probably would.  However I do not speak to her, and no one will ask her for me.  It was after this that I called my aunt and uncle and they verified that it did happen or something very similar and the way in which I remember it happening is the way the doctor said it happened.

A day after this rage surfaced -- not just rage related to the memory, but rage in general about how my family has treated me.  They do not know I am about to relocate.  My grandfather is the only one I thought I might have a chance of reconciliation with, so I called him about a particular incident that occurred with his wife that he has been told happened not only by myself but my mother and sister.  He accused me of imagining it, insinuated that I dreamed up the memory of the abuse I had, tried to cut me off, yelled at me, cursed at me, and hung up.  He did all of this even though I informed him that sometime in the future I will be moving (he doesn't realize that it will be in 3-4 weeks) and that if he didn't come clean to me he would likely never see or speak to me again.  I suppose he would rather cut me off.  Essentially he already has.  Over the years he has barely spoken to me and he gave me a ridiculous reason for not doing so.  He practiced many techniques of evasion, blame, or using his own suffering as excuses to negate mine and deny my right to disassociate from abusive family members.

So today on my bike ride home from work rage surfaced again.  I decided to walk my bike a bit as I work overnights and I was tired.  I also felt like taking a bit slower journey home.  When it surfaced I felt myself transform into Shadow.  I can still recall what happened like I did the last time, but this time the experience was different -- though I did have the sensation that he controlled my body as last time, the distinct impression of sinking very deeply into myself and becoming utterly passive was not as intense.  The most intense feeling was rage, but it was no longer overwhelming -- it was as though someone else was handling it for me.

He spoke to me through my mouth in a very deep voice unlike my own.  He said, ""I AM YOUR PROTECTOR.  I WILL VANQUISH YOUR ENEMIES.""  He also communicated to me inside my heart, telling me his enemies are not flesh and blood but the heart, that he will not do anything that will result in my harm or get me in trouble.  He said he will haunt the hearts of the wicked and that he is the defender of the gentle and meek.  He had a very confident and courageous gait.  He walked around my yard.  No one was out, but he was wanting to introduce himself to my friends.  He called my aunt on my cell phone, but she did not answer.  He wanted to have the pleasure of meeting anyone who is my friend.

So he walked in my house and sat down on the couch for a long time.  The rage was there, but it was like it was not mine.  Finally I felt like I was coming back into my body a little, but like he was still partly in control, too.  I didn't want to remain alone with him, so I called my friend.  My voice was a mixture of his and mine.  She did not recognize my voice at first.  So she talked me through it until I began crying and crying, and I said, ""I am very, very good!  I am very, very kind!  I am very, very, very special!""  I cried and cried.  The rage was gone and I was me again.

Every time I have experienced Shadow as a disembodied spirit he has been very gentle and kind to me if dark.  When he was in my body today and my cat got outside he was very calm and got him back in the house.  He held him so gently and kindly and my cat was being especially cuddly and happy about that.  I got the sense that he was very loving and kind to anyone or anything that I love and that he will never ever do anything to hurt me or get me into trouble.

Since my emotions have been coming up it has been hard, but I have felt better.  Since that experience this morning I have felt no anger, no rage, no disquiet about how my family has been treating me.  I am ready to move on, relocate, change my number, leave them behind forever, and I'm not upset about it at all, merely relieved.  I have suffered from low self-esteem, depression, and lack of confidence in the past, but now I feel like I'm ready to make a change and I am more than capable of doing all the things I thought I couldn't do before and that my family told me I couldn't do.

So far as I know I have not changed into any of these personalities without having a memory of it.  I have always been conscious of the change happening so far as I know.  Of course I also have evidence now that I have blocked out memories.  And there are other things I'm told happened that I cannot remember.  I have also lost blocks of time in prayer.  So I do have the experience of disassociated memories.  But I remember the times I have been possessed by one of my personalities.

I also must say that I have known since they first appeared to me that they are aspects of myself, or that they at least reflect aspects of myself, by certain aspects of their appearance, emotions, tones of voice, and so forth.  Three are not human, and the one I believe is the ""boss"" is a human shaman.

I know this is likely a form of disassociation.  I have experienced disassociation in many forms -- blocked memories (only recently discovered), one out of body experience, zoning out to the point that I could not hear or see anything around me.  When the Shaman has appeared to me in visions I've also had the experience of her taking me completely into a different world to speak to me and I could not see and hear anything around me.  In fact I did not have conscious recollection of the physical world around me when this happened.  I flashed in and out of this alternate world when I was working at fast food and it was disrupting my work.  That began with visions of her that culminated in being transported to an island where she was singing and dancing.

So I'm pretty sure this is disassociation.  But could it at all be a form of DID?  I would be very very grateful if anyone could give me any insight.  Please do if you can.

Also after I relocate I will be getting back into therapy to deal with these issues.  Please give me any insight if you can.  Thank you."
364,"He has DID (diagnosed) and chronic depression (diagnosed) and a couple of days ago he had an episode(?) When i was asleep, he hurt himself and got into bed, i heard him get off the computer and get into bed but i had no idea what he had jusy done or that he had switched to another personality. He had a cut on his arm. 

I cant imagine how he felt/feels because even i was a bit scared when he said he had no recollection of what just happened, since then hes gone to see family a fair bit away to get away from the stress (my other thread about atos explains it) which is what probably caused this episode. Hes been voice and episode free 10 months until this happened
Im now worried about when he comes back, do i go back to how we were before the episode, will he be fine? Or do i have to be on 24/7 watch incase he switches again and does something more serious.

Im trying to remove all the stress before he comes home (complete documents etc) but i dont know what else to do. 

What do i do? How do i support him? :(

Ps sorry if the font is extremely huge (seems like that on my phone)"
365,"Hi all,
firstly if this is in the wrong place please feel free to move this thread. 

I'm posting this on behalf of my other half, I'll start off at the beginning. 
Last year my OH had a very bad year, he attempted to kill himself by trying to OD on medication + alcohol, he's self harmed as an attempt to take his life and has self-harmed because of his other identity taking over and hurting him. (I don't understand completely about this because when he ""takes a backseat"" things get blurry and its hard for him to remember and so it's even harder for him to explain this to me). In short, he's self harmed and had various suicide attempts - my OH has Dissociative Identity Disorder and a range of other things.

He has an ATOS assessment next Tuesday that I can't help but worry and worry about (I have anxiety problems myself so I'm going mad :p) and I want to know if they are made aware of his past suicide attempts and self harming (all of which was last year no less) are they allowed to remove his ESA entitlement? 

My OH moved in with me from his fathers home to me (213 miles) and has managed to improve his mental health a lot since, but we rely on his ESA. If that ESA gets revoked we will loose our home and I think my OH may relapse because having a home gives him his freedom and has been told by his old Mental Health therapist that his DID is brought on by stressful times (he worked last year which is exactly when his DID took over incredibly) 
Any advice is wonderful because I've been through it before and I know full well that when we go to this assessment that he will not have a qualified mental health worker and instead have someone that knows absolutely nothing about his mental health illness.

Sorry for the ramblings.

TLDR: My partner has dissociative identity disorder and has a history of self harm and suicide attempts, are ATOS legally able to give him the all clear despite him being an obvious liability. And what do you think they are going to do?"
366,"I feel like I shouldn't be posting here because I have not ever been diagnosed or even evaluated for any sort of dissociation or dissociative disorder. But I really don't know where else to ask. 

It seems to me I have some odd experiences. Like a strange way of thinking? It started several years ago when I first realized that people look 'odd'. Like strange? Strangely shaped? Walking upright, hairless, that sort of thing. Just really strange, especially compared to all other animals. (Recently this 'strange shape' feeling has been applying itself to certain words. Like suddenly a word will look wrong to me, or the spelling will look 'ugly'.)

Ever since that I started to sort of think differently. To preface, I've never used any type of drugs besides OTC or prescribed medications. I've never abused drugs either or been drunk or high. 

Sometimes I look at my arms/hands and think how very small I am. I'm a female and am 5'8"" and am of normal weight. I'm not small really compared to everyone else. But for some reason sometimes it happens. Just my hands seem so so small. Maybe like a child's hands. Or like maybe I feel like I should be something much bigger? 

Sometimes I'll get a feeling that is very hard to describe. Like my arms are far away? Or like I'm stepping back? Those aren't exactly the right words and I know when this happens that everything's attached and working normally, but it's this weird empty feeling (especially in my arms, which I suppose are the generally most 'visible' part of my body to me? The most of 'me' that is clearly seen.).

I off and on have hypnopompic hallucinations of various things (commonly of things that are 'otherworldly'). I have no idea if these relate to dissociation at all, but thought they might be relevant.

I sometimes have feelings of things not being real. Sort of like reality is only a game (a facade)? It's all very hard to explain. Simple things, everyday ordinary things sometimes seem ridiculously improbable to me (such as our world and universe existing how they do, the existence of simple machines, or the idea of human invention/intelligence/creativity). The fact that I am a person sometimes seems improbable. The fact that I am 'in' this body sometimes seems improbable or strange. Sometimes life itself (all life, not just my own) seems improbable.

My mind also seems to make things up sometimes or adapt too quickly to stimuli. I sometimes look at trees and think they look unreal, like some sort of video game graphic (I think it has something to do with the multitude of leaves). I once played a lot of minecraft and for a few moments started seeing the people and things around me as blocks. When I was a child I once was reading a book and 'woke up' to find my teacher in the middle of a math lesson (when I asked my classmates what was happening they said the teacher had tried to rouse me and couldn't, so left me to read.). I once watched a forty-minute documentary on conjoined twins and the next time I saw a person I wondered where their other half (their other 'person') had gone before remembering that most people are not conjoined. 

All these things don't really seem 'normal' to me (and writing about them sort of brings about that far-away, empty, step-back, almost 'cold' feeling I sometimes get) but I have never have had problems with memory loss (other than that I sometimes forget words, for example 'pocket' and 'worksheet'). These feelings don't interfere with my daily life in any significant way. I've never ever had a psych eval. 

Does anyone think this is this some sort of like... mild derealization? Or does my mind just work differently?"
367,"Hi everyone.  I need serious help.  I feel I could have a breakdown at any moment.  I have severe depression, bad anxiety and have been dissociating full time for a while.

Sorry if I have spoken about this on another thread but I can't remember if I have.  Very confused.  My therapist wants to continue with inner child work but I'm afraid to go there again.  So what's the point of therapy then?  What are we going to do - - talk about the weather?

I am barely hanging on by a thread, hour by hour.  I don't think it's a good idea for me to drive 1 hour to my sister in law's today because I won't be able to focus on the road or speak properly.  Too much fear.  What has become of me?

Eating, personal grooming, contact with people irl, exercising daily.  My therapist said to be sure I do this at a minimum daily.  So robotically I do it with full on dissociation.  I feel overwhelmed.  I'm just staying alive, not living.  I'm afraid I will be like this forever.  I am so afraid of everything.  Please help.  I'm losing it.

P.S.  I don't know how that angry face got there.  I really don't recall putting it there."
368,"Hi Folks 

My life is just one big day dream, is yours?

Everything I do doesn`t seem real, I don`t feel real, I look in the mirror I see a 40 yr old man but inside there is a very different person; it freaks me out.

Am plagued with thoughts that keep me low which is something I`ve done since I was a kid being brought up by emotionally neglectful and physically abusive parents; am terrified that my children will turn out like me which I desperately don`t want to happen.

Am hypervigilant, waiting...waiting...waiting... is that car going to career off the road and into me? where am I going to go when it happens? 

I talk to someone, an adult, am not listening to them, am trying to stop my self off punching them in the face, keep having the spiraling thought of `hit them on the jaw as hard as you can!!` this thought scares me, sometimes i can feel the adrenaline flowing and my body trying to lurch forward all the while am desperately trying to stop myself; its physically tiring, these are just a few examples of a multitude of thoughts a day.

Recently, I`v begun thinking about suicide again, to the point where I am making myself feel sick, I want to hurt myself again: something which I done a lot in my teenage years, I have a lot of scars on my arms quite deep, people question me about them and I cannot answer, my mind just blocks any answer from coming.

I`ve noticed after a year of psychoanalytic therapy that I was still hurting myself by exercise to the point of collapse; but its the only time I feel anywhere alive or real; this is something that happened a lot during my formative years, a physically abusive father who beat me like I was an adult, afterwards I would feel...

I remember going to sleep in my teens crying thinking that I would never wake up again, that was very scary, now I just feel guilty a lot, but that`s a lot to do with my splitting up with my daughters mother 5 years ago, something which I still very painful today.

Like I said, I live in a day dream, yes I focus on writing this but it doesn`t stop the fuzzy feeling of being wrapped up in cotton wool. My memory is much worse now than it was, I`ve always struggled to get my words out; except when am feeling different and I come across a really confident person (maybe that`s my alter ego trying to integrate), its very strange how I do that. 

My memory is weird, because, I can read a page in a book, then ask me a question about it and I couldn`t reply with the answer because it`s not accessible or even worse only partially accessible. Even reading a full book, I can only remember fragments, not even a general gist. I know am dissociating and hypervigilant which is causing a problem at the point of trying to read something, but, this is what happens all the time, my life is very fragmented, I know we don`t remember absolutely everything but this is not right.

Anyway...

Back to the day dream"
369,"I was just diagnosed with dissociative disorder.  Not sure if I'll be able to function.  I don't even feel scared. I just feel nothingness.

Could it be from recently talking (for about a week) with my ex boyfriend who emotionally abused me?

I was working on inner child work and my therapist said maybe we did too much.  I think it may have something to do with talking to my ex bf.  He has been killing his pets and being very aggressive and very delusional/paranoid.  Was calling me a million times a day.  I think it may have stopped because I haven't heard from him in a while.

I don't think it's safe for me to drive because I totally can't focus.  Does anybody have any ideas as how to carry on and get better?  Thanks for any thoughts."
370,"Has everyone on here (or the majority) experienced trauma - - maybe in childhood or in an adult abusive relationship?  Sorry to post so much on here but I don't know what else to do while I wait for an appointment with someone hopefully trained in treating someone with dissociation.  

I experienced and witnessed abuse in my childhood, followed by a recent relationship with an abusive, crazy boyfriend.  He was threatening towards me, threw things around breaking them against the walls, gave me threatening looks, abused street drugs and alcohol, was paranoid that the mafia was  ,keeping track of him/us,  (computer, phone and his apartment in general), constantly on the lookout for cops who might arrest him and have him committed to long-term psychiatric care.  

Recently he has viciously killed all of his pets (we struck up a ""friendship"" again for about a week, but we're long distance so I'm not scared.)  I now do not respond to his voicemails.  After our relationship was over he said when he was living with me he was ""texting"" a transexual escort.  He said all they did was text but I highly doubt that.  I have never been cheated on before.  It was a blow to my self esteem big time. 

Anyway, I know I shouldn't even recall what he did to me (all above stuff), as it keeps me stuck and not moving forward.  Sorry my posts are so long.  Mainly curious as to whether others have experienced abuse and whether that has triggered dissociation.  I am dissociating full time, not just in spells.  Thanks."
371,"Hi.  My depression and anxiety have gotten worse and now my therapist tells me I'm dissociating.

It got worse after I started up communication with my abusive ex.  We are no longer in contact.

My therapist suggests the way to my healing is through looking at my childhood.  We tried that for a while but then we stopped because I was feeling overwhelmed.  She believes we need to delve into this when I am ""ready"".

Has anybody seen good results with inner child work?  Thanks and have a good day."
372,"I don't know if this the right forum to be posting on but I hope someone will reply to make me feel supported.

How much loss can a person take before they go bonkers?

Divorce, safe home, relationship, sweet Douzey my beloved dog, admitting that my mother barely loved me.  Feeling so much sadness and isolation because of it all.  My husband divorced me because of my depression.  Ex boyfriend was an evil, abusive man who keeps calling me even though I tell him to stop.  No respect for boundaries there.

I am just feeling so much SADNESS and Pain.  I can't believe after all this time I'm feeling this way.  I think a lot of this has to do with depression.  That's why husband left me and I allowed  myself to stay in an abusive relationship.

At least I'm feeling something as compared with feeling nothing yesterday and my therapist telling me I was dissociating.  All I want is to be happy again and live a full life with some love in it.  I don't think that is too much to ask of the Universe.  But it's been like pulling teeth.  I feel like I'm getting worse not better.  Just don't know what to do.  I just feel so lonely and isolated because I am.   Therapy doesn't seem to be working at all so maybe I should get a different therapist.  I'll stop for now.  Thanks for reading.  P.S. Any thoughts on my circumstances and what I should do?"
373,"Backstory:

Years ago I was in a terribly toxic relationship. Both of us were bad, but I must admit mine was mostly reactive abuse. We were both in love, I think, but we hurt each other more than anything.

One year at Uni, I had moved into a new house with people I didn't know. So I took them to the society that I loved so they could get to know me and my friends, and the ex was there to try and sabotage everything. So I told her that everything was done, and she was cut out. That was it. And my housemates and I went home, with me profusely apologising. 

Cut to one hour later, I get a call from my friend and my ex's housemate. They needed me there ASAP. She was trying to kill herself. So I get there as soon as I can. She'd severely injured herself. I start get towels and holding it to the wounds, ambulances are called, she's screaming in my ear that I ruined her life and she couldn't live with out me. Her housemates are too scared to come in, but they inform me she's also had an insane amount of pills and what else. 

During the abuse I'm getting from her, I just stop. I stop functioning. And I don't know everything what happens next. I can't remember. The only thing I can remember is her leaning over me, as I'm slumped on the floor not functioning, laughing in my face at how useless and cowardly I was. She also cries and yells that I'm letting her die. She flits through both.

Somehow, about 30 minutes later I'm sitting in my back garden, away from her house. Apparently my friend had driven me home and she was in an ambulance. I'm sat in the garden, with a lit cigarette in my hand and I can't even take a drag because I'm shaking so much, and that's when my housemates find me. White as a ghost, with eyes that apparently don't blink. And I'm not sure what happens next. I wake up the next morning, fine, and I can barely remember the night before.

Aftermath:

I get CBT and therapy, and they help me process this information. I get told that I dissociated and went into a fugue state. Months go by of going to therapy and it feels like I can cope again. CBT is a fucking god send.

Present:

I've started a new job. It's my first time waking up at 7am every morning, working until 5ish and going home. I'm getting enough sleep, kinda, but I'm constantly exhausted. Dealing with people all day, trying to keep the depression and anxiety at bay is exhausting. A week and a half in, I notice I'm starting to randomly disassociate. It feels like my head goes light, and I'm about to faint. It feels like I'm having these deja vu moments that don't make sense. These memories that are what I'm seeing in real life and yet I know it's not, I think. During these episodes I genuinely can't tell what's real. Normally, they last anything from a few seconds to a few minutes. But they're terrifying. I feel sick down to my stomach. I have to respond to people in real life, so I have to decide which thing I'm seeing is real and respond accordingly, even though I'm not listening.

I don't know how to either stop, or cope with these. I've tried doing what my therapist says, which is to tap things to try and anchor myself in reality. But I can't tell what reality is. I ended up not going to work today, 10 days into a new job, because I couldn't tell where I was and who I was talking to. Which was my home, and mother. Even now, I've slept longer and woke up later, I can't remember what really happened this morning, and if it was a dream or not.

TL;DR: Trauma from the past, CBT fixed it, resurfacing dissociative episodes, please help me."
374,"I can remember as far back as 14 and having what I now realise was depression (not moody teen syndrome) which came in waves. For some reason it never occurred to me these thoughts of wanting to harm myself or suicidal thoughts were anything out of the ordinary. Throughout my teens (around 16 - 19) I took part in regular drug use, it eventually lead to smoking enough cannabis every night to sedate a baby whale. Through out this period I also took cocaine, speed, methadrone, ketamine and mushrooms (where my first experience of derealisation occurred and I had a god awful trip). After taking the latter at around seventeen my mental health began to deteriorate, every time I drank, the next day I would I would get a crippling anxiety where I wouldn't leave my room and think everyone hated me. Again this didn't seem out of the ordinary, my behaviour while intoxicated usually wasn't great. I dropped out of college at 18 partially due to lack of motivation and partly due to the fact I thought everyone hated me, id sit there bursting to go to the toilet but force myself to stay because I knew they'd all be talking about me when I left. I continued on like this with not much change until just after my nineteenth birthday, in between this time I found when I took ecstasy or got too drunk I got this feeling that I was detached from reality and nothing was real. This feeling would usually pass within an hour or when the drugs wore off. After my nineteenth birthday something happened and a lot of people in the area I live genuinely did hate me, this fuelled my paranoia and I was convinced a mob of angry people were coming to get me. I was peering from behind curtains and pacing about the house like I was demented. Fortunately I had a family holiday booked a few week later and I seen this as an ideal time to cut the drugs and get away from everyone. Whilst on holiday I drank heavily all week. Upon getting into the terminal at the airport to head home, something started to happen, I had the feeling I was on mushrooms again and the terror that came with it soon followed, it was as though I was going to fall through walls and I hadn't awoken that morning and was in fact stuck in a dream, Faces didn't look right voices didn't sound right and I certainly didn't feel right, long story short I was hospitalised with no English speaking doctors doped up and sent home. This feeling did not pass or ease for almost four months, limbs didn't feel like they belonged to me and I was in a state of terror 24/7, I kept giving myself another month to feel better or i'd kill myself as it was no way to live. Eventually it started to ease slightly and to this day it is still lingering. I have days where I feel okay and days where I almost feel as bad as I did when it first started. Any changes to routine can trigger it. For the last four months I've been prescribed propranolol and sertraline but have not mustered up the courage to take them, I am terrified they may worsen the DP or DR. Has anyone had any similar experiences with this and has any helpful advice about medication relating to my problems that I have mentioned? or even a similar experience they would share? (I realise I've written a lot). I should add I can calm myself from panick attacks now half of the time and I have a key worker I can phone when I wish to make an appointment as well as a great GP, also a psychiatrist I see every few months"
375,"Hey guys, this is my first post so here goes,

Not entirely sure where to post this but this seems like the right place...

My mind is completely blank every second of the day. There are never any thoughts in my head. It is always empty. And even if I desperately try to think, I am unable to generate thought. I can’t picture or visualize anything in my head either. It is just darkness. I can’t focus on literally anything even entertainment: from YouTube videos to movies to video games to reading, nothing. Additionally I have almost no functional long or short term memory.
 
Whatever this is has destroyed my life. I can’t function at all, I can’t keep a job, I had to drop out of school do to my poor academic performance, and I don’t have any friends: I just live in perpetual sickening empty agony. I’m in my twenties and for the past several years I have been living at home with my parents and barely existing.

Anyone else experience anything similar to this?"
376,"Hello, everyone. I need some advice. I am starting to feel like a real life Pinocchio. 

When I was a kid, I daydreamed and played pretend just like all of the other kids. But while that went away for most kids by the time they hit their double digits, it only got worse for me. 

You see, I have an issue of not talking about ANY of my problems (but that's another story), and this means I rarely ask questions regarding help or advice. So when I was about ~8 years old, and I actually was in my own world even MORE than when I was younger, I didn't think much of it. I'm just a kid, I'll grow out of it. Besides, I'm happy like this, I thought to myself.

Fast forward a decade. I am now approaching the end of my teen years, but instead of the problem getting better, it got worse and worse. It never seemed like a problem to me, so I never did anything about it; after all, zoning out doesn't seem like much of a problem when many of your peers are doing drugs and breaking laws. The real problem, though, is that I actually did not even acknowledge this as a problem. I didn't even know what dissociation was.

It was only about three months ago that I actually realized that there was something seriously wrong with what I was doing. I had become so dependent on this method of tuning out the world completely that I didn't realize the implications of my actions. Add in a teaspoon of depression and a dash of anxiety, and you've got yourself a recipe for disaster.

But here lies the problem. See, most resources that I have found do not consider my case. Most instances of dissociation, depersonalization, or derealization are linked to PTSD; something traumatic happens, and that person copes by detaching themself from the real world. There are ways around that, teaching people how to ground themselves and bring themselves back to their normal lives.

But I don't have PTSD. Even more troubling, I don't have a ""normal."" My ""normal"" IS dissociating. I literally cannot go more than an hour and a half (on a GOOD day) without feeling mentally fatigued and zoning out unintentionally. It doesn't matter how interesting the subject is to me, I just can't do it. It makes daily life next to impossible, because I just don't want to do ANYTHING besides sit around and tell myself stories. 

Really, my question is... where do I even begin?! It's legitimately scary because I cannot function hardly at all, and I have absolutely no experience at being ""with it"" and breaking away from this bad habit. I have no idea what to do. I have tried the whole grounding method, butt it doesn't seem to work. I have tried binaural music, sitting in a dark room, pulling my hair, setting little goals... nothing works.

Sorry for the super long post. I just felt it was necessary to cover all grounds. In summary: can someone please help me?"
377,"A few months ago I had a weed induced panic attack. Ithe was only my 3rd time trying it. Ever since then I have had this off and on feeling like I'm/ things aren't real. I have a therapist and he says I have anxiety. But what I need to know is can you have this ""anxiety"" as he says I have 24/7 to where it makes you super spaced feeling along with feelings of unreality? I don't hear things or see things besides the occasional misinterpretation of images when I'm driving. I have been thinking I am going schizophrenic but the doc says I am not showing any signs. Could anyone please share some knowledge with me if you have experienced any of this? I just feel super disconnected from life. I'm worried I'm getting sucked into my own mind. My symptoms are
Hard time remembering
Spacey feeling in my mind
Mistaking items for people.
Headachs
Feelings of things not being real.
Panicy feelings whenever problems arise(meaning if the car where to brake down out of no where I would assume this is a dream and not real instead of thinking that it's the car just breaking down)
Feeling gullible.
Bad thoughts (like this will never end or like I'm going schizophrenic and this could all be a dream)

I just need help please I come to you with an open mind. Please help me with any advice you have."
378,"You may need to read my thread Could this be related to DID? (does not mention details but mentions a resurfaced memory) in order to make sense of part of this post.

I had a strange dream, but first I must tell another.  A rabbit similar to the one from Donny Darko came to me in a dream.  He was dark and warning me of something.  He showed me that underneath the apparent reality I see all around are a matrix of dark tunnels, and this was very foreboding.  When I awoke from it I sang in eerie tongues.  I have also sensed this rabbit's presence in my waking life and had visions.

Recently after my experience of recovering a repressed memory and being possessed by my Shadow he came to me in spirit forum.  I started moaning as if I would scream.  I was alone at my desk.  Though everything in front of me appeared normal I had the sensation that it was but a fickle illusion and right beneath all of this was a huge tunnel!  I said, ""Nooo, noooo, I won't look, I won't look!""  I told my Shadow to leave and that I could not deal with this now as I was not in an appropriate situation, and immediately he left and the tunnel beneath everything in front of me was gone.

Tonight I had a dream related in part to something going on in real life and partly to one of the four entities I mentioned in the first post.  A friend of mine thinks she can give me therapy sessions but she is not actually trained.  A real therapist gave her a tool that can actually only be purchased by therapists, but it has not been used on me.  I only went over there once, but I didn't care for it.  A bunch of New Age guided visualizations that I didn't even follow.  I went into very different visualizations and went into hypnosis and I had to tell her to count down from 10 to 1 to bring me out of it.  She didn't even know.  I really didn't care for any of this because she doesn't know what she is doing and she thinks she is being so spiritual and this is really controlling nonsense.

She was in the dream guiding a therapy session, but she was having to leave the room to ask the real therapist questions on the phone about what to do.  Then she said that everything had to be childlike.  In the dream I went into an altered state of deep hypnosis and began speaking like a very feminine gay boy.  (I am gay in real life but I don't act like that and I'm not that feminine.  I do sometimes have childlike tendencies though and can act pretty gayish when I am in that phase.)  I had the sensation that he was wearing a dress.  At some point the woman leading the ""therapy"" session told me the porn flic was okay.  I was vaguely aware in my hypnotic state that I was lying in the bed in the woman's home.  Then I physically began rolling into a ball (like a fetal position) and going around and around very very fast.  I started laughing in that boyish girlish voice and I said, ""Haha, hahaha, I am flying above everything, I can see myself and everything below me, woooo!  Woooo!""  Though I could not see the scene I knew I was floating over something and it seemed to one part of me that maybe something bad was happening to me.  After that I started sucking my thumb in the state of hypnosis.

The woman leading the therapy session didn't know what to do so she said, ""I'm going to throw a 3D wall around you."" New Age nonsense.

And then a part of me was afraid that the boy would say something I didn't want the woman to know.  And it was almost like I was actually going through this and was actually in hypnosis.  (This dream occurred around 6:00 am right before I woke up.)  I was aware enough in this dream to know that the blue water nymph (I'm not going to say her name here) has a lot of control over my speech, possibly even when I'm in an altered state and don't know who or what may take over.  Or she is able to speak for parts of me that are unable to.  And in the dream I pondered that I needed her to censor anything this boy could say that I didn't want known.  (I was going to say something already but I can't remember it.)  And I said, Aeah please protect me from anything I don't want to say!  And I'm pretty sure she did.

Then this was coming to an end and I felt like I couldn't come out of hypnosis.  The woman said, I will anoint you with oil.  At this point I wasn't exactly in distress, but it wasn't good.  Then I felt a pressure on my chest, and I thought she was anointing me with oil.  It turned out to be my cat stepping on me in real life, and I woke up.

I'm pretty sure this dream is about something real but I don't know.  Someone please help me."
379,"Good afternoon,

I was just wondering if anyone here had such a diagnosis? If so, I'd love to ask some questions in regards to myself. I'm on a waiting lists of sorts to see a therapist, so I thought in the meantime, I'd do some investigating. 

I disassociate quite a bit, often forget who I am entirely, I think I'm a demon sometimes that is here to punish the guilty and there is a guy living in my head thats constantly there and I want him gone but hes been there so long I don't know what to do. I don't feel comfortable publicly talking about him too much. 

I apologize for sounding crazy. I feel it. :cry:

I understand this isn't a common diagnosis (or is something thats oft talked about) so thank you for any reply I get!"
380,"I have this real surreal and bizarre feeling that I literally cannot remember who I was. I can't remember who I was; how I reacted to people before, what I found funny, interesting, engaging etc. I feel I can no longer communicate with people at all. All I have to offer is small talk. I used to be a bubbly, quirky, outgoing and funny character. 

I literally can't enjoy things anymore. I have lost all my friends and I would say I'm a loner despite being only 24. I never go out, have no friends to socialise with at all. I go from job to job, and never get to associate with anyone. It's almost like I'm trying to be friendly and gain friends but people don't see me as a friend at all. No one invites me out or even something as small as adds me on Facebook? I genuinely believe I'm an approachable person, I'm even told that. I'm an adult education tutor and all my students come to me with their problems and I sit and listen to them and they appreciate it - as I would do for any friends I have had.

I feel like I'm living a lie in my head, I'm acting some character who's not me. I'm in there somewhere but can never 'get out.' Has anyone ever felt like this before and can recommend anything to have 'me' back? I'm really desperate as it's getting to the point that I don't want to live as this character anymore, I want me again. Please help -I'm new here by the way :)"
381,"I seem to have a kind of constant very mild dissociation in that I live ""zoned-out"". It is something I have tried to explain to my therapist when he asks how I'm feeling, that when I say ""nothing"" I guess I mean I feel that none of the things that are happening are actually happening, they feel like they're on TV or something, so nothing feels personal to me. 

This has caused some light social problems in that I'm very distracted when I'm speaking to others so I don't really connect.

But other than that, the factor that really bothers me, is that when I look into the past even just a little bit - like yesterday for example - I can remember the whole thing in a distanced, third-person way, but it feels like I wasn't there. I literally get the feeling that whoever was in my body at that time wasn't me, and that whoever I am right now wasn't there nor have I ever been 'there'. This gives me the sense that I am a different person every day or that my identity is not consistent. The overall sense is that I have no identity.

I don't mean this in the same way as 'no sense of self'. I have my own opinions, goals, characteristics etc., and they do not change. My temperament, also, does not change. People outside of me would describe me as consistent, I imagine. It is more an internal sense that I do not exist, because it feels as if I have not been present in any of my memories.

I try not to think about it because it is disturbing, but I wondered if anyone here had experienced similar and knew if there was a way to be more present? I have always been like this - well, at least since adolescence when I first started to talk about it. I don't really know how to be any other way.

I have tried mindfulness, by the way. It works for brief moments but not really in any long-term way. It has been helpful for other symptoms but has not really made a mark on this one."
382,"We all exist within our own minds and never leave our bodies, everything that we experience and our entire consciousness are just electrical impulses within an arrangement of specialized cells in a protective shell. Due to electricity in our brain, in our skull, we are conscious and sentient. When we die electricity continues to flow without a beating heart until all energy is lost and brain function ceases, thus carrying on to experience the after-life that our subconscious mind forms for us until it can't carry on any longer. Well, that's demotivating...
Anyway, due to the double slit experiment and my sever sensory disturbance taking form of a temporal paradox I am bound to the feeling that conciousness forms the reality around you based on what you know to be true, hope for, hold wishful thinking towards, focus on a lot, etc. all done through means of having your conciousness guide you through alternate time-lines based on these thoughts. You guide your own consciousness and not that of others, so everyone has full control of the direction that they head in their own minds, but they also control everyone around them in the timeline they follow. (Everyone follows their own timeline in their consciousness but not yours.) With 99.9% belief in something you will get what you know 99.9% of the time, e.g. heads when flipping a coin about 99-100 times out of 100.
Basically everything here is a fancy explanation as to what I see true, not to say everything's a hologram, but instead existences has many unknown levels.

Thoughts? Questions?"
383,"I was terrified when my mind detached from my body – this is depersonalisation

You’re staring straight ahead. Somehow your awareness peels away from you, in slow motion. It’s like you’ve cracked in two, and one half is facing the wrong way. Are you in your physical body, which you know must still be there? Before you know it, you’re up on the ceiling somewhere, watching yourself down below.

I’ve read that depersonalisation is one of the body’s stress responses. You can’t deal with a situation, so it almost ejects you, makes you feel disconnected. Which would be amazing, if it wasn’t so awful. When it first happened to me – to this extreme, at least – I was on holiday with my dad, sister and brother. Something felt off, uncomfortable. I’d been feeling anxious and out of sorts all week, so I went back to the hotel room in the middle of the day. I remember feeling I couldn’t stay still. Things weren’t right. I paced around the hotel room in the heat, wearing my bikini. Pacing was good. I was doing something, and something had to be done.

After a while I walked into the bathroom and looked at my body in the mirror. It seemed alien to me. Hairy, covered in sweat and fat, and then I looked up and saw my face. That’s when I knew I wasn’t in there any more.

384,"So I am at a loss of what to do, and since I'm a writer my CPN suggested I write my life out and that might help me make sense of what my motivations are and where my life is going.

I would do that, and I'm excited to, because I'm going to write it in the form of a film (to get practice for writing my other ones) but I find telling my story extremely triggering....

I know it seems trivial in terms of the writing, but it is important I am able to tell my story for other reasons too.

387,"Hi,

I was involved in an armed robbery a fortnight ago. At the time, I gave a witness statement to the police and around the time I spoke to the people around me about it.

 Anyway this week, I thought I had been doing ok. I had rather a calm week with my kids, anyway my husband startled me and around 10mins later I couldn't remember it my husband told me about it. Then I started to think back to the robbery and I realised I can't actually remember the event. I can't really remember much on the run up to it during it or around an hour after it. I just remember what I've told people as though it was a story rather than an actual event.  

Is this dissociative amnesia?"
388,"I have had some experiences that my therapist classified as a form of disassociation.  He told me I am not the only client to have experienced it, so I'm looking for any information on this possible as I've not been able to find any on my own.

A few years ago having already suffered from much abuse I went through another abusive time period and then met four beings -- for lack of a better term, I call them spirit guides.  I can tell from their appearances in visions, voices, and in other ways that they are personalized aspects of myself.  They often help me and have warned me about others -- accurately.  They tend to show up when I'm in turmoil.

Can anyone give me information on this phenomenon?"
389,"Has anyone else had someone tell them that they had a nightmare about a man, and you're like ""Oh, you can see him too?""

This happened the other year, but I've just been thinking about. 

Dets visited her twice; once in a nightmare and once in a coma. 

She told me in great detail her nightmare.
An old man had pinned her down, and started to play with her feet (that bit is a sign, it wasn't necessarily his actions but the meaning behind them) and that he at points changed into a wolf. 
The wolf bit is a little unnerving because if he can take on the characteristics of other things other than me (I thought I was the host and that's why he could become me). 

In her coma she later revealed she had seen the Devil. 
I immediately knew who she was talking about.
He would have been very upset in those dark times. Not for her woe and affliction but for *my* pain.
Blood had been let even.
I am in no doubt he would have been strong. 

Has anyone else had experiences where other people can actually see/hear their 'others'?"

391,"Depersonalisation disorder: the condition you’ve never heard of that affects millions

Jane Charlton was not herself when she woke one day in April 2002, but it was more terrifying than any ordinary morning grogginess – and it did not shift for the best part of three years.

“It was a feeling of being fundamentally wrong in your own body,” Charlton says, attempting to describe what has remained largely indescribable: the symptoms of depersonalisation disorder, the condition that swallowed a huge chunk of her life.

“It was a constant, continuous otherworldly experience,” she says. “It’s a feeling that, if you’re feeling this way, you shouldn’t be existing at the same time. The feeling was of having left myself completely, constantly trying to grasp on to reality, trying to claw back what I’d had a few days ago. Yesterday I had a life, and now I’ve got nothing.”

Depersonalisation disorder, or DPD, is among the most common yet under-recognised psychiatric conditions in the world. According to studies in both Britain and the US, DPD could affect up to 2% of the population – that is, around 1.3 million people in the UK, and 6.4 million in the US.

People with depersonalisation disorder describe a sense of complete detachment, a life lived as an automaton or on autopilot, characterised by an absence of emotions, either good or bad. (You might think of Channel 4’s recent hit Humans, which featured an intelligence trapped, powerless, in the body of a robot.) They feel as though they are observing their life through a plate of glass or a dense fog, or as if it is appearing in a film. Their bodies and their beings have separated; their limbs are no longer their own.

Depersonalisation disorder: the condition you"
392,Anyone know why it's quite a distinct diagnosis and experience and would help if people could talk about it in a specific forum.
393,"So I'm not actually struggling with anything.
I was just reading about and consequently thinking about pre-verbal others.
I noticed we don't have a thread for this (or a recent one at least).

Feel free to share how you cope and communicate with pre-verbal others.

For the singletons reading this purely from a place of learning; a pre-verbal other is a part of a person with DIDs system who cannot communicate verbally (and most likely cannot write). They often communicate by showing the host or other who is present images in the mind's eye. These can be distressing for the part viewing them if the pre-verbal other is upset and showing negative images. 

I have a pre-verbal other and experience the images, but also (as is common with parts of this nature) I can experience quite strong base urges and emotions.

Anyway, as I said, this is just a place-holder in case anyone ever has an issue with an other like this.
You're welcome. :grin:"
394,"robots do things without emotions

me too"
395,"okay so i posted this in another thread but wanted to make another thread and put in in the correct sub catergory

ive been watching you tube vids on derealisation

and ive figured out that like this other girl i feel sympathy and empathy, i can laugh but not actually feel happy its weird. anger is there i have this emotion. mood is low and show signs of depression, but dont really feel depressed either, i cant cry

i believe its a defense mechanism

but how do you talk to people that matter and tell them you feel nothing for them? that you feel nothing all the time or anger.... then i realised why i care about mum so much, because i can feel sympathy and empathy..... i just dont feel connected, im not sure i love anyone... im not sure its possible to love anyone.

i had to research derealisation so i can relate and put into words what is happening to me and in order to do that i needed youtube so i could watch not just read up on it.

just makes sense to me now how i feel nothing about anything except mum. in some ways derealisation is saving me... what i mean by that is from my abuse i havent gone insane and feel no pain, so this means i can function just about, which means i can help mum, and the reason i help mum so much is because of having the gift of sympathy and empathy

so now i dont know if i want this derealisation to go.... because in a way its not just saving me but mum too

i mean what if my emotions came back? the last episode of abuse is still under investigation, maybe i wouldnt cope at all and then mum wouldnt cope and then maybe she would commit suicide and this isnt good at all

derealisation is saving us"
396,"i found out i may have derealisation, and i can relate to the symptoms

well i have a question

because derealisation is protecting me by shutting out my emotions, is my body working more?? ive been feeling tired and fatigued for a long time, in order to actually do anything i need caffiene.... the whole caffiene thing i had to do last week as mum didnt want to be stuck in doors and had a couple weeks off work, well now she is back at work and im knackered, and dont want caffiene to be the answer but i went to the gp about it and because im fat now, every solution is to loose weight... i think its more to it than that. im layed on my side with laptop next to me and although im typing i cant even be bothered to move my legs or change position. 

is this because derealisation is protecting me so much that im feeling tired and fatigued?

this question is important to me because gp say the solution is to loose weight, mht tell me to see gp. mum cant stand me laying on sofa all the time and existing and not living, and i dont want her to suffer and she is because of me

i dont know anyone else to ask

please help me"
397,"Hi,

I've been suffering with DP/DR for a over 2 weeks now and at first I think it was just depersonalization and I think that that set off derealization and I just wanted to know if anyone who suffers with DP/DR overcame it? I see stories of people 'getting better' but I just want to know if my previous perception of reality will return because although I feel a bit better than I did before I still feel a bit off and unsure about my reality. Also, did anyone with DP/DR ever just question everything in life? Is that normal?

Basically my question is will I get to a place where I understand the world again and will I feel real again? I know the key to recovery is just riding it out which I'm doing, but I just want to know if people have actually recovered from it."
398,"Hey idk if I have derealisation but I strongly believe I do...

Question is are there any meds to help??

If this is derealisation then it tends to happen at anytime but in particular in places like shops where it's crowded or when I was working as it was in a factory and alot was happening inside the factory as was busy with people and machinery 

Also wondered if my body is fighting me to stay in derealisation so I feel nothing... so would this explain severe fatigue unless I overdose on caffeine I don't do anything I sleep on sofa and when awake lay on sofa most of the time only getting up if I have to.

Main question is are there any meds that can help?

Many thanks

399,"Hi all

I basically joined this forum to ask this question. A few months ago I was going about my daily business and 6 hours later I was somewhere completely different, leaving a friends house having driven there and I couldn't remember where I'd parked. I then realized I couldn't remember getting there, or anything for about 6 hours before. According to the people I'd been with I was actually reasonably normally and nobody noticed anything funny. I'm on an antipsychotic and an antidepressant, and previous to that experience I'd been being treated for hearing voices. It's only happened one time, I'm just worried it might happen again. Does anyone know what that could be a sign of? I don't have any diagnosis apart from ""psychosis"". 

Anyone experienced that? Or have any general input regarding the matter?

Thanks

404,"Hi All,

Been reading the forums for a while, but just got around to taking the plunge and joining up. For someone who is relatively new to mental health, there is a lot of reading. Hope its ok that I post this in here, as I didnt have a clue which part to post it in. Not sure how much I can write here, or how ""in depth"" I can go, but about 3-4 years ago, i started experiencing some issue's, some pretty messed up stuff....went to see my doctor and after a few consultations with various people I ended up speaking to a psychiatrist. For the longest time, I was an angry man....I smashed my house up on several occasions and even now, can be very aggressive or destructive over the smallest thing. I have become very argumentative and opinionated, which never used to be my nature, i used to be carefree and up for a laugh at any time day or night. Interaction is difficult, unless via email or text, and although I have a very good understanding of grammar and words and language, I find myself either rambling on and getting lost off, or I will get confused and wont be able to remember the word I am looking for yet it will hit me a few hours or so later. I very rarely want to go out, and as a result my weight has gotten to be a big issue for me, which as you can imagine doesnt help. I have never been able to maintain any friendships, will start new ones and become almost best friends with people, they share their inner most secrets and I will feel like a part of something, but then I will eventually find fault with the relationship and lose contact. I never feel like I fit in, and the more I try to develop social skills and to get people to talk to me and want to spend time with me, the more stupid I feel and the worse it gets. Another issue I have, is that i seem to live in cycles. One moment I will want to drive a 4x4 and go hiking, the next I want to buy a smaller car and go driving more. At the time it will feel like the most important thing in the world and I NEED to do it, then I will get sick of it and move on. Just this year, i found a reason to hate my iphone, so sold it and bought a HTC, then i decided that I missed my iphone, but then they forced the U2 album on me and for some reason I felt like it was the worst crime, sold my iphone and bought a Samsung. Not to drag the story out but I have done this 4 maybe 5 times this year, its only lately I have been able to stick it out.

Anyway, sorry to drag it out, I dont even know if it will make sense to anyone, I was just kinda wondering if anyone might have experienced something similar and could offer any insight. This is just breaking the ice, but if anyone has any questions or anything I would love to hear from you."

It doesn't affect my actions at all, I'm not mopey, I have a social life and friends - I still behave exactly the same way before this started; just inside I feel a lot different and occasionally - most recently - I have felt something really heavy inside me but I can't quite pinpoint the emotion but it's so overwhelming it's almost as though I feel I'm not a real person (sounds ridiculous I know) but it's really weighing me down and making me feel weird. For example, I looked out the window last night and I feel almost like nothing outside is really there (it's really difficult to put into words). I've not considered self-harming and I would never whatever the circumstance, however bad I feel because, to me, I feel as though it not that bad. I've lived with this for a few years now and I have no idea what it is and I just needed to talk to somebody about it. Thanks for reading."
406,"How do you say no when the voices seem like your own thoughts?
I know I would never think these things or give up like I have, but I don't know which other it is, and I don't know how to differentiate between our voices/thoughts anymore."
407,"I can't tell if what I'm saying/doing is me or not anymore.
I more than one person all the time lately. 

I keep having thoughts, acting on them, then regretting them.

Sometimes afterwards I don't remember even doing/saying those things.

I bet she would love to see me like this....

Did you know she once held me when I screamed after waking up from a switch in the middle of the night?
Now she just seems to think I do it as some sort of Circus trick, or that it's all smoke and mirrors. 

Not that I have spoken to her for about 7-8 months."
408,"I daydream all the time. Even when I am happy I'll daydream. When I'm feeling low, I get bad negative thoughts and I can't get them out of my head. Sometimes I would make faces in attempt to block them. I can't stop negative bad thoughts. These negative thoughts are events that has happened to me. Example, if I accidentally unplug the speakers and music starts playing out really loud, I would get negatives thoughts of me being yelled it by my parents. Another example is when I get messages on Facebook or a text and the app makes a ""bing"" noise. There was this time I was yelled at by my teacher at university for texting in class. So now every time I get a message or a text and my iPhone makes a ""bing"" sound I get negatives thoughts of me being yelled out by my teachers. Result of this, I would make cringe faces. I also turned off all the my notifications on iPhone. 

I have a hard time focusing on tasks, even if I enjoy them. Even when I am doing exercises like running, I get negatives thoughts in my head of random events and I can't control them. The thoughts interfere me from completing the exercise . 


But regardless of my daydream, I do make faces even if I am daydreaming about a happy thought.

Could this be OCD? I heard about maladaptive daydreaming. Any thoughts?"
409,"I am on the verge of tears. 
I know that if I cry though, it will make me transition into my little. 
I can hear he is upset. :(

I am trying my hardest to stay strong and not transition.
Even typing this thread is tough. His thoughts are mixing with mine and I have to think about what to type. 
Trying to distract with music but it's not working. 

What do I do?"
410,"Does anyone else have this?

When I say ticks, they only look like them to the observer because I manage to stop myself speaking so it seems like a random noise. 

It's like the thoughts in my head, that belong to the others I am co-conscious with, get muddled with mine and I say what they are thinking. This often makes no sense or is disjointed. It's weird though 'cos I can think stuff myself and I don't get the compulsion to say it (or shout it, as is often the case) as strongly as I do the other's thoughts. It's like dissociative Tourettes, although I don't think I have Tourettes.

I don't know, I just thought I would post this as it happened at the cinema the other day and I was thinking about it. :shrug:"
411,"As of late I am struggling with time. Detached if you will. As if I am kind of still in a bubble but time is moving around me fast.

It is an odd feeling.

I feel a lot of time is wasted as I can not seem to grasp or connect with it or anything around me.

It is funny because I can deal with depression or impulses or my random moods but the sensation of not really being here or feeling unreal makes me feel very uneasy.

How do you engage back with reality?"
412,"Hi there. I just wanted some input as my GP has not got back to me yet and frankly I felt too embarrassed to tell her some things regarding what has been bothering me. For the past few months now I have been getting episodes of blurry/strange vision, light headedness and tingling sensations which will last a few hours minimum 1 hr. It makes me feel really spaced out and I can't concentrate very well. During this time I can feel really irritated or a bit more energetic/euphoric than usual however it makes me feel quite uncomfortable. My GP said it could be a silent migraine as I have had migraines in the past; also anxiety. However, the part I did not tell her is that during these episodes I feel far from reality and when the whole experience gets intense I begin to question my own existence and if I am really in the present and experience dejavu. I really want to know what this could be as I know this thinking is irrational but perhaps it is just my anxiety but it seems a little too far fetched. 
Even when these episodes subside the whole 'i am not really alive' or feeling like im Jim Carey in the Trumann show doesn't really disappear. The first time this happened was when I was coming home from work in the evening and waiting at the bus stop for the next bus. I was completely alone and for some reason I thought I was stuck in a limbo world and started to freak out and cry suddenly as I thought I no longer existed as there was no one else around but me. I recently broke up with my boyfriend during this time and was using coke regularly as well so this might have caused it. However it doesn't explain the episodes as they still happen and I still experience depersonalisation.
For some time I thought I was hypomanic because of this, anyone have any ideas as to what this could be?"
413,"I'm losing a lot of time today. Ever since last night they aren't too happy with me. They've made it impossible to leave my house without a panic attack. I feel so stupid. I hate myself so much. It shouldnt have happened. I know I didnt say no though. And I've wanted to do that for a very long time, since we met in 2007. 

I feel like a slut. 

But I hate my life sometimes. Voicrs are back. No sleep. Racing thoughts. Panic attacks. Can't drive."
414,"I made too many people upset today and won't be a problem again. I'm sorry I upset too many people. So I'm exiting. 

Not killing myself. Might be back later but can't be on here when I've upset too many people. I'm getting better but I still need support but I can't have it here."
415,How long did it take for you to get diagnosed?  Were you misdiagnosed?
416,"Yesterday was bad. I sometimes have these episodes where everything feels like a dream. The world gets this surreal quality and it causes me to panic. I literally had a 3 hour panic attack. Usually I'm really good at working through them with breathing techniques and talking myself into a calm state. It didn't work this time. 

Even washing my hands was weird. I know they are my hands but they didn't feel like it. I stared and stared but it didn't change. This state lasted almost 9 hours. 

Every other time has only ever lasted at the longest 1 hour. God it feels like I'm spiraling"
417,"I find that I go through life, especially at work, where I switch off and I'm on autopilot most of the time.  I feel as though there is no ""me"" I think that my life has become so crap that I just ""switch of"" it feels more than depression.

It is as though I have no identity, I'm a mother, a wife, a carer, but no ""me"" I have no opinions on anything and just live for everyone else.  At the moment though, I'm just wanting to hide away in my bed where I sleep, or go into some kind of trance.

It is so scary for me at the moment.  I'm scared of going to bed, I really feel as though there's hardly anything of me left.  I feel,as though I may disappear altogether.  Can anybody please try and make sense of what is going on, or maybe understand what I am going through.  This isn't a new thing for me and it's very, very scary."
418,"Hello I am 36 years old. For most of my life I have been a MtF crossdresser,  at 7 I knew. At 13 told my mother and she had a horrible response.  My 34th birthday I was forcibly committed.  I was dressed as a female with a pistol in my hand. Much stress and drugs led up to it. I have had a very unsuccessful life. Tried to join the military twice,  college 3 times, and divorced twice.  About 18 was when I started fully going out and presenting as a female sometimes.  I have lost jobs and upset people I love by crossdressing but can't stop. If I don't dress for awhile I get really angry and become borderline psychotic. 


I met my other personality about 16 months ago,  her name is Cassandra.  I went through many names over the years and was going to change it again but this is the first name she likes.  My second ex gave me the girl name and I wanted to ditch it because my ex chose it. Cassandra however loves the name so we keep it. When I met Cassandra it wasn't voices or anything like that it was like telepathy,  memories,  thoughts and images.  It all made sense and I was excited then became very depressed and suicidal.  I am now into my third month of stimulant meds for ADD. The meds help alot,  the depression,  paranoia,  and over eating have subsided. I feel ""closer"" to Cassandra and we are getting along. 


I didn't know Cassandra for 34.8 years of my life.  She knew me. We had a very combative relationship.  I used to have my second ex wife harm me while I was dressed up. I told my ex it was sexual,  as a component of it was but it was deeper then that. It also doesn't matter how we are dressed,  Cassandra popped out at very strange times and also very helpful times. My personality is very different from hers and now that I know her I feel like I'm the ""bad"" personality.  

The argument for me being transgendered is I just haven't fully accepted it yet because of shame.  Soon I am going to legally change my name to Cassandra as I really don't care if I'm dressed as a male and people call me Cassandra,  or they could just call me Cass."
419,"I feel horrible and different for about 2 years now I think I've got signs of de personalisation but I'm not sure if it's a neuro problem as it feels worse than de realisation/personalisation. I just wanna know if I will ever be normal me again so I can get on with my life!!without worrying. I feel strange when I go outside and engaging people with conversation doesnt feel right like serious chats when I talk at like job interviews in just like there nodding- 
Also having some really weird thoughts to do with violence towards my family members, is when I'm at home I have some weird strange thoughts and just feel abit odd at home.
But nothing like when I go outside nothing feels normal..Like my eyes change and my head goes into another mode but inside I'm fine! :/
I have no clue about this de realisation/personalisation I just wanna get through it but it feels much worse than it is. And doesn't seem anxiety triggered 
This was all because I done stupid drugs a while back but since then been completely straight"
420,"Has anyone experienced this? 

How did you deal with it?

I know, I know, don't take drugs..."
421,"I know I'm just a member and number to this site and the people on it but I thought some people would miss me. Not so, Ive found out. Nobody misses me. I'm not myself right now and that's due to some staffing issues. I really thought I was closer to people than I really am. 

:sorry:

I am replaced by people who I don't know and won't know. I don't feel comfortable on here anymore. I have no friends anymore. Sigh, I've lost everyone close to me on here. I knew if I came out with my story of my father abusing me I would lose everyone. I shouldnt have said anything. I shouldnt have broke my silence. I lost everyone close to me. I lost all of my support. 

Why do I even come back here?"
422,"At work today I kept thinking how unreal it all was, how my colleagues are just objects, nothing is real, it's all pretend. I've been seeing this more and more for some weeks now. I find it hard to continue the show. Logically I understand it can't be true...but still how can it actually be real! 
Are they just watching to see when I finally revolt. 
How can I know, where is the truth, the cornerstone."
423,"So, I've been wanting to find out my alter's names so I can identify them more since they all act totally different, dress different, have different ambitions, etc. 

I wasn't sure if I should call them by their names on posts but then I thought if they want to post something, I should probably let them, it might help me too since I can document who is saying what and I can find out their thoughts. I'm very into mental health and psychology so I feel this is quite an interesting task.

I'll just put their names and the brief intro to the.

Alexandria/Alexis - Positive, ambitious, fun, gives good advice, enjoys going out and having hobbies, wants to become a dancer. Dresses quite ""alternative"", leather jacket, jeans, boots and a hat. (How they dress has been told to me by my partner unless I remember what they wear from when I took over again.)

Olivia - Negative, depressed, thinks the world is against her, easily controlled and manipulated, loves helping others, wants a career helping others. (Wears baggy clothes because she hates my body)

Rose - Undecided about EVERYTHING. She has no clue who or what she is, doesn't know what she ever wants, easily frustrates others. Goes along with everyone else, demotivated. Wears usually the first thing she sees.

Victoria - My protector. Takes over when she believes someone is trying to hurt me or upset me. Even when online, she will take over and ignore negative comments or abuse so I don't have to see them. Has tried to break my partner and I up but not as much now that she sees the lack of danger. Dresses a little alternative but likes a few ""girly"" things too, occasionally wears skirts and dresses. 

Quinn - Out of control, scary, angry, breaks things, threatens to hurt herself, tries to break my partner and I up because she fails to see the good in others and pushes them away, she is very antisocial. Stereotypically, she wears all black. What a shocker lol. 

So...at least they're named now so if any of them posts, they will most likely put their name at the end of the post, unless they decide to be annoying and not do so.

Since I can't actually talk to them to tell them I'll just put a note somewhere they'll all see it so they know to do that, if they don't listen, and they still post, I'll probably be able to tell anyway. 

Feeling a bit vulnerable right now, so I'm gonna end this post here.

Edit: Forgot to mention, one of them (gonna guess Quinn for obvious reasons) decided to dye my hair black yesterday. Good thing it looks good or I'd be going mad!

~Alexis"
424,"I noticed almost no one posts here anymore. I just joined looking for help. I'm an alter but a reluctant one. I'm having to come to grips with the fact that I can't have everything the way I want it. Just looking for others to talk to who might be able to help me with the constant struggle of having to not have a ""real"" life. I don't feel like a real person. Am I alone in that?"
425,"Hello, sorry, new wasn't sure how/where to post...
Been in & out of godawful to fantastic treatment for nearly a decade, and finally getting seen regularly, but only thing people can really agree on is dissociation. 
It's pathetic, I know, I'm doing well enough now- but suddenly I am very frightened. I have no idea what is wrong, I don't know if I can fix it myself. I don't know why I am prescribed what I take, or if it is a placebo, or if by stopping I am anti-placebo ing myself! 

They seem to be slowly honing in on bipolar with psychotic episodes in place of highs, I try to understand but I really cannot follow. I know I have been getting worse, and faster. The only link I can remember is that I feel I am in the wrong world, everything doesn't work properly, I sit for hours outside just waiting sometimes- I have cracked it! I know this isn't real.

I am babbling! But I am frightened. I used to be able to calm and control myself, for years at a stretch, now I am lucky to make a few weeks. I go to my doctors, they write God knows what on the notes, and give me things, either I take them and stay bad or stop and get worse. 

But they won't tell me what they write, I don't have any diagnosis. I am 25 and feel like my life is over, all it is is trying to stay in a world I don't believe in. I am detached, I think deep down I no longer care. I feel wrong, misplaced, out of joint? 

In hallucination I once jumped off a bridge, had a hell of a time explaining I wasn't suicidal, but I was convinced if the world was wrong, if I was wrong in it... I thought I belonged underwater (was proved wrong, can't breathe.. get a bit cold, all that...) is that dissociation? 

Why won't they just tell me what is wrong so I can fight it? 

Sorry again, bit of a rambling message..."
426,"Here is a chart of the three different types of dependency.
I just thought it might be useful for people, because I didn't know myself there were different types of dependency."
427,"Does anyone feel like a child inside an adults body? The feeling of not being able to cope with adult life.

For example unable to manage money, changing career paths all the time, unable to complete things like college courses etc. And looking for constant approval from parents feeling like if you don't  get there approval u are doing the wrong thing.

All this along with high and low moods, depression and anxiety....just want to no if anyone can relate and what to do?"
428,"So I've recently started seeing someone with DID, he hasn't explained anything to me but I've been looking up things to do with supporting people with it. I haven't experienced any other side to him either I don't think. Seeing as I'm recently new to the forum I thought maybe I could come to you, and just ask what's best to do? Like if he has a weird one (sorry, don't know how to describe it, episode?), is it nice to hear comforting things? And do you think I should chat to him about it, or let him tell me more? He's told me why, about his childhood, so I understand what could trigger him and what to not talk about. To be honest I just really care about him and I have things going on with myself and I just want to be able to help him if he's not okay

Also this might be in the wrong section so please feel free to move it but I thought this would be the best place :)"
429,"So being integrated is cool and all, but as I've touched on a few times recently....Not having the others has left a gaping hole in my life, especially as I'm co-conscious. 
What if, however, it also leaves a hole in the lives of other people?

What if I'm the worst 'other', the host?
The others are all (bar one) better people than me.
They function better.

Maybe, I'm making no sense. I dunno.

FYI - I'm *actually* integrated because I still haven't solved any trauma (If there is any!) or anything, I just didn't know a better word for the stage I'm at."
430,"I'm not really sure if this counts or not??
It seems sometimes if I get very bitter/angry (sometimes over small things) I can't control myself. I'll get physically violent, or try to emotionally manipulate my friends to make them feel guilty. I hate this so much because I try so hard to be nice, considerate, thoughtful, etc. Even if I know what I do/say will hurt someone, it just seems to happen and I have no control over it. This usually happens when I'm being humiliated, frustrated, depressed, angry, and other feelings like that.

Other things include:
>looking in the mirror and being confused by my face, like I know it's me but I just don't see it as normal? (like I don't recognise it?)
>feel like there are multiple versions of myself (hyper, depressed, angry, evil, etc)
>can never make decisions, I have different, contradicting thoughts about everything
>constant headaches, occasionally hear someone whisper my name, always feel a presence
>forget things easily
>sometimes 'snap' back into my head, almost like my consciousness floats away and I don't realise it until it rushes back?

Does anyone know what this is?
(I have lots of symptoms of other things too eg paranoia, anxiety, bipolar, bpd, etc)"
431,"Today, i found that I am putting 100% into everything, i know i probably won't achieve it but I have high hopes for myself and my recovery. I made myself a new routine, and am doing well with it, but i usually struggle with it maybe 6 months to a year later. 
i also feel i lost my confidence, when ever i isolate myself i also lose confidence in who i am, even to talk out loud.
 i feel that dealing with my dissociation, I put 100% of my effort to stay here, in reality, but boredom, and forgetfulness usually pulls me back.
Today I did pretty well, I found that i was in reality and not stuck in mine or another person's mind...Weird, that I posted that but, that's what i think and that's okay.
i did well, i didn't have many weird thoughts but at times felt like i couldn't cope with reality, but I can, I take a deep breath, try to relax, then go on with it."
432,"One of my alters seems to absolutely hate therapy and get very angry and upset by it which leads to them taking control after the therapy session and basically going on the rampage .... this only really happens after a therapy session. It's led to me getting arrested twice and section 136'd twice. 
It's extremely scary and I don't know how to stop it?"
433,"I'm really struggling. I will reply when I get home in a couple hours. But the voices are really really loud. Really forceful. 

I don't really want to die. But I do want my situation to die. I'm staying in control more often and it is scary and exhausting. I need to let up though."
434,"Hi everyone,

I have DID. 
I see my therapist for 90 minutes once a week. 
I feel grounded and I feel like myself before going in to therapy, but when I leave I walk out the main doors feeling like a little child lost in a big city. I feel confused, scared, disorientated, suicidal and feel unable to get myself home (20 min walk, 25 min train journey with 35 min walk when I get off). 
I have told my therapist about this but he insists I am present and grounded before I leave the session, and he hasn't said much more on the matter.
Its now reached a point where I am dreading therapy because of how I feel and behave afterwards, I feel like I have no memory of getting home, or just very small glimpses or flashbacks and it's really worrying me."
435,"I know that I have had dissociation happen to me when my stress level is beyond what I can handle.

If it gets too that point...ok I hope this makes sense.

If I dissociate for only a little bit of time from too much stress it'll be like I am physically there but not mentally. Yet if it lasts too long this happens.

I feel like I'm two different people. I'm me a 22 year old adult but yet there's also this little girl who has come out when my stress is past what is normal even for me.

She is part of me but it's like she's separate. Like she is different. I like things I'm fermilar with that are childish [like cartoons like Rugrats and looney tunes] but she is different. I don't have to have things from Rugrats or Looney tunes though. She is different. Like she has this favorite doll,baby Dil from the first Rugrats movie, she just absolutely just had to have. It was ordered online. I knew it was being ordered but I felt like I had no control to stop it. It's like I was there but just watching and couldn't do anything. It's like I was watching a movie [not sure if that's the best way to put it] but couldn't control what went on.

When the stress goes away it's like she hides. But when the stress is too much it's like I can still see what is going on yet at the same time it's like I hide instead of her.

She's the little girl but I don't think she likes being called that. 

I got a flashback of a certain person saying those words...don't know if the bad man ever hurt her or not. It's weird. I know it's me being called those words yet it's like it's the child I mentioned being called it. It's like I'm two different people yet she is seperate from me.

How can I know more about her? Before I thought I might have just imagined it but now I'm certain that I'm two different people. It's quite odd and I need advice."
436,"Background: I saw a university therapist for a month after having a severe panic attack that led to bouts of anxiety. The panic attack happened during an extremely stressful and busy weekend where I only got 9 hours of sleep over 4 days. But that panic attack was ground 0 for all of the new issues. 
After the month of seeing the counselor (I stopped after a month), I was feeling much better, but during the last week of finals, I began this disconnected feeling. For two weeks, it felt like I was floating, and not really present, and then it went away. 

But now, I'm present, but I feel like I'm watching my life through a tv. There's just a disconnect where I know it's reality, but I don't feel a part of it. And I have these constant thoughts of life and death (I'm so freaked out by how fragile life can be and how any minute can be our last and what really happens after)

I feel like I'm going crazy or dying. And it's caused problems sleeping and regular anxious thoughts (which I recognize as unreasonable, but cannot stop them anyways).
I just want this to go away and get back to my life.

I just want to know exactly what's wrong with me so I can start taking steps forward to my life before that panic attack. 

What can I do?

I'm going back to my counselor this Wednesday, but I just need reassurance now."
437,"Won't be around much this week. Too busy. AlsO don't drserve help. Been bad. Hate myself. 

Other people deserve help a lot more than I do. Those of you who have my email you can email me. And others you can PM me if you need something (HA like anybody wants to talk to me, it's evident that you all don't ezcept a select few). 

Can't post. Hopefully things will get resolved soon but won't post until it is."
438,"I self harmed the other day because of something that happened. Now I'm hurting...

I hate myself. I deserve to die."
439,"I feel like everyone is sick of me. Sue almost called the police today. Which fuck my life if she ever does. I've had the police called before and they didn't do anything. But I was living on my own. Not here

I've asked her if she hates me.
I'm sure she wants me in the hospital."
440,"I've created way too many issues on here. I'm leaving. Please PM me. I can't be on here anymore. 

I may kill myself sometime, who knows. I suck as a person. And deserve to die. I NEED to die."
441,"The guilt, the shame, the headache, the voices, the depression is all back. I might as well stop living. It'll come get me every single day. I can't kill myself because of a few reasons. Knowing I'm diabetic is not helping. I feel like s*** right now and it's because my sugars are (probably) too high. I had bread for breakfast. I know it's bad but I don't know if I'm strong enough not to eat that sort of thing. 

I wish I could do you all a favor and die. But I xant. I'm sorry for living and being a burden on you all."
442,"Below is something i read today. I have noticed i have been escaping into fantasy land a lot lately and that i am partially dissociated whilst doing so. It is happening more and more. It's taking over my mind. It is the reason i came on this forum. I have bipolar disorder but have this problem which i think is unrelated. I have been through a very stressful time of late and this always starts to happen when i have been under stress. Does it happen to you? Do you know how long it will last for? should i let it happen or stop myself (not that i can stop myself i don't think). I am basically re-living the past but changing aspects of it to make me feel better. For example i am remembering a time in the hospital when i was very depressed, but i have changed this dream into me screaming and kneeling on the floor, and a doctor-friend of mine witnessing me being taken away by the police. Is this me wishing to be rescued i wonder. 

I can barely read, watch TV, walk around the shops, talk to people. It is taking over my life again.
###################

In the finale, that “dream sequence” is actually a textbook example (albeit exaggerated for dramatic effect) of maladaptive daydreaming. This has various forms, but it’s commonly used as coping mechanism by traumatised children, which then extends into adulthood. In maladaptive daydreams, people escape to an idealised fantasy world where they have some control and support. The fantasy will often include an imaginary best friend who actually listens to, cares for, and guides them. In this kind of daydreaming, the person can immerse themselves, but always has some awareness that it’s a dream. In this respect, Derek’s fantasy is at the extreme end of the maladaptive dreaming spectrum, as its almost a full break from reality, but not quite.
 
It’s significant that Derek saw an idealised version of Stiles in his dissociative escape fantasy. But it’s not romantic. It’s so fucking far from romantic.
 
This is the desperate, lonely fantasy of a mind traumatised beyond endurance; someone needing a mental escape hatch in order to survive what they are experiencing, and reaching out for anything at all that will give comfort, without leaving them completely unaware of what’s going on around them. Think for a moment about how empty of comfort Derek’s life is that this is his escape fantasy. A somewhat sympathetic conversation with someone not actively trying to hurt him, in a cold, impersonal room. He’s so fucking traumatised, he can’t even imagine a fucking cuddle or a rescue for the few minutes the fantasy allows him to escape/process what’s actually happening. That would be too unbelievable and break the fantasy too soon"
443,"I don't have much of a problem with this, as my others are quite understanding and they all understand that I am the main and so they must all be conscious (no pun intended) of how their actions affect me.

Stupid voices. Stupid alters. I hate my life. I want to die. And I mean it this time. I have half a mind to just quit then kill my self tonight. I'm so close. I was doing so well."

I was completely unaware system responsibility was such a crucial thing.

451,"My whole life has been a struggle, something I couldn't bare at times and the slightest troubles used to dig deep, but now I'm a completely different person, pretty much the complete opposite of who I used to be. I've always had problems ever since I could remember, was born with learning difficulties, had child psychologists, struggled to fit in, made everyone I knew worry for me, and as I got older I struggled more, I've been outed and called weird/stupid etc my whole life and have never truly fit in, I've had many friends but I don't think I've had anyone in my life who really knows who I am, I've had times where I'd be bullied at school all day, get bullied on the way to school and back, get victimized at home, I even tried to kill myself at the age of 13, literally everything hurt me emotionally, I was so sensitive and I couldn't stand up for myself. Now all of a sudden I feel nothing, I haven't felt real emotion or love in years, I don't even know what love or affection feels like anymore, hell, I'm not even scared of loneliness, I thrive on it, I just fear and feel nothing, I see everyone else struggling and feeling emotion and living their lives based on emotion and I have no understanding of the concept anymore. What the hell happened to me, everyday I just feel like I'm not even living, life is just a dream, and I'm the main character in some meaningless movie plot. Did all my emotions and troubles trigger something in me? Any insight would be great"
452,"So recently, although not so recently, I lost pretty much all of my system.

Last week Dets came back but only to communicate with me in my mind.

I don't know why I still call him Dets. Saying his full name doesn't make me switch anymore. In fact I lay there and said it over and over so he would come and take over, but to my knowledge he never came.

I know this must seem odd but I miss all the others. I was co-conscious with a few of them aswell and they were mostly good company.

I don't know why I'm posting this. 

Also, Dets says ""That was careless, have you checked behind the sofa."" in relation to the first line. :rofl:
Which was unexpected."
453,"I miss everyone who I used to talk to on here. But everyone has left or stopped talking to me. I've cut my friends list by a lot because I didn't feel comfortable with everyone having access to everything. I know I said I was not going to post again but I'm not going to sleep (I have a show to watch at 11, it's 10 now). 

I'm in  a lot  of pain. I wish I could go to the doctor. However I did find out that I can make payments if I go to the doctor I used to go to. But he's a man so....I don't know...but I was completely comfortable before with him...

My brain is going kaput. I'm not thinking as clear as I have been lately. Another family member announced they're pregnant. Knowing I most likely won't have that makes me feel so horrible. It makes me want to die. As human beings you're  supposed to  have children. Especially in my family. There is not a single person over the age of 25 who does not have children. Knowing that will never happen to me really makes me upset. I know there's adoption...

I don't deserve children. I would be a horrible mother according to my family. They would feel sorry for my children. They've told me this before. I get treated like a child. I need to get a job but I can't with this pain. I can't concentrate. I can hardly function without a heating pad. I'm probably doing a lot of damage to my liver but if I don't take Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen or Naproxen Sodium I cry out in pain. I barely sleep. Every time I move in my sleep I wake up and cry out. I don't think anybody realizes how much pain I'm in. Right now I'm fighting to stay alive. I just know it'll be something I need to have surgery for (cancer, fibroids, endo). I really don't want surgery. I've had two surgeries before and that's it. 

I love our dogs. But they can't step on my stomach because it hurts a lot. And I've yelled at Dexter today because of that. 

I'm coming to grips of never being able to have children (pretty sure). And it really upsets me. I was supposed to be the one in my family who gave my parents their first living grandchild. And it (probably) won't happen. 

Suicide would be the easiest way out of this pain. Suicide would be the easiest way for you all to get rid of me. Suicide would be the best option. But I'm going to power on because I want to be success eventually. I don't know what I'm going to get my degree in anymore but I will get it eventually. I hate being compared to my brother. He never had to deal with abuse. Or voices. Or alters. 

Speaking of which, they aren't coming out as often as before. But when they do come out they're out for a long time. 

The pain is getting worse again. I may have to take a trip to the hospital. When I eat it hurts really bad. When I lay in one spot it hurts really bad. But im powering on..."
454,"Have had these symptoms over the last week, really scary and difficult to deal with, especially when having PTSD symptoms too, reemerging trauma and flashbacks.
I made good progress though and worked on achieving my week's goals whilst coping with these symptoms.Got scared while out Tuesday, so now am a little phobic about going out, but I think I am exhausted so will be ok once well rested.
I admire anyone that copes with dissociation and trauma and PTSD , it is all really hard and stressful to handle, people out on the street don't understand, can give us  a hard time and be cruel and always on the look out to exploit us for financial or other sorts of gain.Does anyone else have stories about how they feel when out and trying to get about but finding it hard  because strangers don't understand."
455,"Apparently I'm not important. Apparently I'm stupid to think I would be able to have help with this pain. Apparently I deserve this pain. Apparently I need to die. It's worse than ever before. I don't know how much longer I can go with this pain. I'm so hurting. This needs to stop. I went to therapy and ever since then it's been hurting really, really bad. I feel like I'm being ripped from the inside out."
456,"I ruin EVERYTHING. I suck as a person. I'm the worst person on the Earth. I need to die. I'm a loser. I don't need hospitalization. I need to be left alone and allowed to die. The physical pain would be gone if I died. I don't *think* it's an infection or cancer. I'm pretty sure it's endometriosis. It could also be fibroids. 

But of course I can't go to the doctor because of the jacked up shit of a health system we have here. At least where I live. And I can't travel anywhere because the closest city is 2 hours away. And I can't afford the gas. Unless I absolutely have to I won't go anywhere. 

Like I said I need to die. Then everyone would not need to be worried about me anymore. And the pain would be gone. I deserve to die."
457,I'm in a lot of pain. But I can't even see a fucking doctor. I'm so done with today.
458,"So today I had a meeting with my college's support worker, and we were happily chatting away and he even said he knew a little about anxiety and how bad it can be. 

Then....

I mentioned about the different thoughts that don't belong to me and how I inexplicably lose time, and when I come to, stuff has happened. 

His face changed.

He then kept asking me how we could stop this happening, we must not let this happen, has it ever happened in class? I could tell he was shit-scared of this happening and me hurting people.

I'm not dangerous. 
None of my others have ever hurt anyone or done anything to anyone but me.
I am just so sick of the assumption.

This is why I don't tell anyone....

(I know this thread is pointless and petty, I'm just venting and ranting)

- - - Updated - - -

He even suggested having a person that sits in the classroom, in case I have an switch.

I politely declined. 

Am I really that much of a risk?"
459,"I wish apologise to anyone that may have been hurt or offended by some of my recent ill-judged comments about this diagnosis and the symptoms that are grouped and described by it.

It was suggested to me that I may suffer from dissociation and may meet some of the characteristics of DID. The person that suggested it meant no harm and is very experienced. I felt like she was trying to insult or undermine me. She wasn't. She was trying to wake me up, to become more aware of myself.

Being in denial is a safer situation. I apologise for dismissing all this out of hand. It was uncouth and insensitive of me.

I accept there are more severe manifestations but am coming to make sense of the concept of subpersonalities all combining into a whole, and that in some way or other, my self is fragmented and not as integrated as it seems to be in most people. And that some times I'm losing my core self to subpersonalities.

It's hard to face up to as a man. But until I see things for how they really are I may be impeding progression.

Like I say, I'm aware that a number of my recent posts about DID -- after the fact -- were inappropriate."
460,"I'm having a lot of pain right now. It's getting worse. It's been hurting for weeks. I didn't write down the actual date but I know it's been a few weeks. However I don't have thoughts to SH or to kill myself. I'm confused about this. 

I can't go to the doctor until at least next week when I get paid but I also have to buy my $94 license plates for the year by the 31st. I also need gas for my car...I may not be able to pay the doctor until next month...I've been taking Naproxen Sodium around the clock. It barely touches it. I've tried other over the counter pain meds but they don't do anything. 

I'm considering asking for a hysterectomy...I know that means I can't have kids but I can't be in this much pain and the uncertainty of what is going on is really upsetting. The one med I'm on is not helping this. And I know it's not a cyst because it isn't concentrated on one side. 

I can't afford the one med that did help things. 

I really hope it isn't fibroids. That means surgery...but so does hysterectomy. It could also be endometriosis. Which I don't want either. 

I should be huge pregnant right now. If I hadn't lost my baby earlier this year. 

Honestly I'm in the boat that I want a career, not children. I'm not going to say I'm never having kids but it will be a fight to keep them."
461,"I'm so lost  there's so much going on....voices really loud...forgetting things really bad. Like Im told to do something and then I forget to do it the next moment. My phone is full of calendar appts. To take Alfie outside and to feed him. Or else I will forget about him. I have to have reminder to tell me to Take my meds. I'm having lots of flashbacks. And nightmares. Im ready to die. Im really ready. 

I haven't started to overdose because I can't leave my dogs...they will have to get rid of Alfie...

I'm just giving up"
462,"I'm not being treated very well by people. She won't allow me to take a break. I'm at a breaking point. I was going to take a break. I'm so upset. I want to die.

I need to take care of myself and not break down any further. She said I looked like a whipped puppy :cry:"
463,"I can't go into hospital. It will make me feel worse. I have to go see Sue tomorrow to discuss my having a break from therapy. I feel bad but I need it. I need to focus on Alfie, Joey, Dexter, and Gwyn. I have made more strides since getting the puppy than I have in almost 3.5 years of therapy with Sue. I need a break."
464,"I'm done with therapy. I need a break. It's too much. I've got my dogs and I will be ok. I don't need to get into things right now. I need a break. 

My phone is a piece of crap and I don't have as much time to be on here. But I will do what I can."
465,"I'm sorry I haven't been on much. I'm still doing poorly but I have a new love of my life and its not a person!!! We got a 7 week old miniature Daschund. He is brown and black. He is 2.6 pounds and cute as a button. We called him Alfonso but I like to call him Alfie. Our family friends breed miniature Daschund and sell them for $250 for males and $300 for females. They just gave us Alfie. He is such a good puppy. He's never messed on the floor (given we've only had him since Wednesday). He also whines when he needs to go outside. 

Joey, Dexter, and Gwyn are warming up to him. They are all scared of him even though they are larger. Joey is the one that is taking it the worst. It seems everyone is playing with Alfie more than Joey now. But I let them in the house and put Alfie in his house. Joey and Dexter sit on my lap and sleep. 

Me doing poorly is so much worse. But now I can't go to the hospital. There isn't anybody to take care of the puppy because everyone else works or goes to school. 

I'm barely sleeping (even though he sleeps from 920 to 600). I'm hardly eating. the voices are so bad. The anxiety is so much. I wish I could die on a daily basis but I won't try anything."
466,"So I'm probably starting to sound like a broken record, but I'm so close to doing something stupid. 

I just can't bring myself to do it, I just get scared everytime I think about taking the plunge.

On the other hand though, I feel like its the only option and every moment spent living is torturous.

I can't face work on Saturday. 
Not after what happened.
Not even without what happened. 

I don't want advice or sympathy, I just want the juxtaposition to go away and me do something."
467,"I wish I could die. I haven't canceled my appt for tomorrow. I don't want to go. I really don't. But with what has happened this week I need to be seen. 

He is nice on texts but what if he isn't nice when we meet? I'm so nervous..."
468,"I'm such a whiner. The whole very few presents have really made me feel like sh*t. I'm such a bad person and I don't deserve to live. I need to die. I'm so depressed. I don't deserve anyone's help or love. I should do it so people don't have to put up with the hell of me. I'm a bad person. 

I skipped last week's appt with Sue. I want to skip this week's. If I start talking about how it upsets me that I didn't get hardly anything ($10 and a cake) for my birthday I will cry. 

Fucking bitch needs to die."
469,"It was my birthday today. We don't have money (I have five dollars until Wednesday and my parents don't have any money at all) for us to go out to eat or do anything for my birthday. My mom got me a cake though. I'm not ungrateful at all. I understand this time of year is hard always. 

I was having a good day. I really was. Now I'm just so lost. My voices are so loud...and they make me want to do something bad."
470,"I feel like all my strength is leaving my body. 
Like I can't even begin to see any future.

I don't know how I will face work tomorrow.
I can't do it. 
Work, college, stupid meetings with EIT.

I just want to die.

If I was dead people would know what I felt."
471,It is supposed to be 25-30 F and we are under a freeze watch until Friday. And we are supposed to get snow?!? Why this early?
472,"So this is gonna be pretty hard to articulate and explain.
As was maybe apparent by my posting on here, I stopped taking my meds recently over the past few days, and I believed they were the devil and everyone was a terrible bore about it. 
I'm taking my meds again now. 
I no longer believe any of these things, but I remember them, and it's confusing to hold two conflicting views

Has anyone experienced this?
How did you deal with it?"
473,"Seriously, how do you deal when you can't seem to be able to do anything because you are so depressed and anxious you can't even go to therapy?"

475,"My family is out of town until Monday or Tuesday (it's currently Friday evening). 

I've been very low. And I was reading someone say stuff about college/university and I'm never going to get my degree. Every year around July-October I have an ""episode"" where I want to go to the hospital (even went this time but they refused to admit me). I've been very low as the mods/FST/admin can say. 

Well I'm home alone for so many days. I have NOBODY in town I can talk to. My aunt is in a town an hour away but she will call me everyday/evening. My mom will call too. I'm freaking the hell out. I'm so fucking scared right now. 

Last year something really bad happened when the were gone (my brother has Hemophilia so they go for an appt every year). And I'm trying not to have that happen again. 

I'm so scared. The voices are so loud."
476,"You know when you're unexpectedly going down a rollercoaster, and you feel like your soul is gonna jump right out of your body? I've been feeling it increasingly often after trying LSD for the first time about a week ago. The unsettling feeling eventually evolved to induce anxiety and now, panic. For history's sake, I've been experiencing that feeling for about 3 years now but on a much smaller scale and usually linked to getting way too high from marijuana. I've been smoking quite heavily for the past decade, but started having problems only recently. 

This ""fly out"" feeling usually comes with breath shortage, lightheadedness and a growing sense of numbness in my limbs physically, while mentally I spiral down into losing the sense of 'self' and I find myself plagued by the worst kind of thoughts (""I'm gon die"", ""Is it the end?"", ""..imagine if my heart suddenly stops like now!"") I noticed that it seems to be triggered by my own thoughts: for example when somebody sits next to me in public transit while I want to be alone, I can start thinking about all sorts of random b.s. and BAM! I start to feel the attack coming. Or focusing at the computer to concentrate on some detail... As soon as I feel the discomfort rising I get the need to flee the setting I'm in and go elsewhere just to give myself a new mission.

Now all of this usually happens when I get too high on weed and I always shrugged it off as a simple ""bad trip"". However I tried LSD not long ago, and although the high has long passed, I now get those fly out attacks even when I'm sober. I also noticed that my sensitivity has incredibly augmented: tiny things such as smells, melodies or simply the atmosphere outside now immediately remind me of instances when I was happiest and give me a very good feeling... yet the most trivial irritating thoughts and annoyance can quickly degenerate into heavy anxiety. 

I've read a fair deal on the issue and the most common suggestion I've come across is to remind myself that I'm in control, that this is just temporary, etc. Remembering that I control my thoughts and I can induce the state that I'm in helps, and I actually feel a physical response to it - as if something was literally flushing out of my brain (and down my throat)... However it doesn't seem to be a sustainable solution because five minutes later I tend to dive right back into panic. I would like to know if there are some exercises, meditations, anything I could do to get rid of this problem or at least learn to control it... I'm reluctant to go see a doctor because where I live the public health system simply doesn't do the job. Help? :BLAH:"
477,"I can feel it.
I want it to stop.
Everything is just a blur in my head.
I'm so anxious about the coming weeks, and I don't think I can carry on."

I didn't know I did it until my mom told me that I did. I guess I went to the my aunt's house and I drank :( 

I'm soooooooo upset."
479,I left the house while being dissociated. I don't know what I did. I'm so scared. What if I did something bad? What if I committed a crime? I want to die.

483,"Is this depersonalization disorder? Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Hello,

Over the past couple years ( I am 24) I sometimes get this feeling that I am...outside myself...spacey...there isn't really a word to exactly describe it. On Friday, I started getting this feeling again, except this time, it lasted hours. I was at work and had to have my boyfriend come and get me because, although I was aware and could talk to people and function, I didn't feel all there and I wasn't comfortable to drive. I remember going into the bathroom and just looking at myself in the mirror with such an unreal feeling, sort of like a dream state. I even found myself looking down at my hands and wrists from a perspective that was sort of outside myself. My boyfriend took me to the ER and they did a ct scan and found nothing. All of my blood work was fine. I felt like that until I went to sleep that night. Over the past couple days, it comes in an out. Not lasting as long as it did the first time. I just googled feeling in a dream like state and some people were talking about depersonalization disorder and I was just wondering if could be this weird thing that is happening to me or could it be something else? I am sort of worried about feeling like this a lot. I am not sure I could properly perform my job when feeling like this. I am feeling slightly paranoid that I am losing my mind. Even now as I am typing this, I am starting to feel that dreamlike state again, but I am functioning like normal.

I would appreciate any input or advice anyone has.
Thanks!"

485,"My family went to the lake to stay the night. As all of you know I've been very suicidal lately. I can't go camping. I can't leave the house, let alone go camping. I just can't. I can't leave the dogs either. 

Should I have gone?"
486,I can already tell I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight. My thoughts are going so fast and the voices are so loud. Why can't I not listen to them? Why can't I stop my thoughts? I'm on both Risperdal and Lamotrigine. I would think those would help me. But they don't.
487,"I don't remember anything except one minute I'm listening to my brother yell around, the next thing I remember is driving home three hours later. :eek2: 

I don't know what I did during those three hours. I don't know if something happened to me. I don't know anything really. I'm exhausted but that is what I get for being unable to sleep and it's not safe to sleep. :sleepy2: 

I don't know how to find out what I did during those hours. I'm upset that they won't write to me. This is so difficult. I'm crying at the potential of what I did. I'm so bad. Bad Lincoln. Lincoln needs to die."

Keep doing it.... zoning in and out of conversations... I'm so much slower when I come round..... i often say things that are the opposite of what I think I've said.

489,"I don't feel right at all. 
Everything feels numb and I'm having my ticks.
It's ever since I pocket-called someone again, I hate my phone for CONSTANTLY doing it.

I know this is probably in the wrong section, but whatever.
I also know that the circumstances of this are minor to cause such a reaction, but sue me."
490,I'm definitely losing it. They've done nothing but yell at me. I can't sleep. They make it impossible. They yell at me when I try to sleep. They say it's not safe to sleep. I'm sooooo tired.
491,I know that this is going to sound ridiculous but I'm getting worried. I know that I've a long way to go in my recovery and that I've still got a lot of hard work to do in therapy. But the child part of me isn't coping and just wants someone to put their arm around me and comfort me....whilst the kind parent in me is telling me to be kind to the younger part and the professional adult in me is desperately trying to piece together this career who other people seem to think is fine and competent and she's so busy with work. And it's hard when all these parts are happening simultaneously because it's overwhelming. And I've got a new job in addition to my existing role and I'm busy and I need someone to take control of me right now. Sorry. Thos probably sounds all jumbled but I feel like I'm tripping up over myself xx
492,I'm stupid. Everything is going so fast. But I just found out someone I know may have lost two of his children in a house fire. I'm so sad right now. And it's in a different town than I am in right now. I'm so scared. They're all under 6 years old :( he has five children. I don't know what to do. I can't sleep. My brain is going 99 miles an hour. I'm just...
493,"I think this is the appropriate forum for this but i don't know. 

Basically My life has been horrible and some things lead to massive stress and worry. I remember walking through the woods thinking whats going to happen to me if i worry like this much more ''am I going to explode'' anyways sure enough the next day I found out. I was walking by the pond in a country manor estate with my friend and BOOM im in a dream. Just like that I went from slightly stressed normal person to f*cking freek show (at least on the inside). It was an extremely horrible anxious feeling of spaced out feeling, I had no idea what was happening. Nothing was real. Anyways the rest of that week it got better at night and in the mornings but the afternoons it came back. Just as i thought it was getting better something else happened in my life that wasn't very nice and from that day on its been constant for 2 and a half years! its hell on earth but for some reason I don't want to die. I have mixed up thought pattens where for a few seconds its like im in a different place and don't recognize it (almost like a different emotion, sometimes euphoric) and mild morphing hallucinations like just were things may wobble and create waves in my vision and sometimes when i close my eyes its all swirly and stuff but the hallucinations go away sometimes when im not stressed. Anyways back to the story i have been in and out of the doctors crying and begging thinking i was dying of a brain tumor or about to have a heart attack until they refereed me to psychiatrist. who couldnt understand why i was having these phycosis like symptoms but I clearly knew what was going on and who i was. I got brain scans and i wasn't delusional. they gave me antiphycotics to shut me up but they didnt work they only made me sick. I came off them. Since then iv found exercise helps alot and I have just passed my personal trainer qualification and sorted my life out. My life is great apart from this! its depressing me so badly i cry my self to sleep. Why wont it go. I have nothing to be stressed about now :'( my eye site also goes blurry like out of focus some times and iv had my eyes checked and they are good. its almost like i see pictures instead of a full vision and this parts the hardest to explain. like my vision is almost jerky when i look around? I dont know maybe some of you have experienced this.

Also sorry about any grammar and spelling mistakes I have just wrote this really quickly. thanks"
494,Is that what my voices are? That's what Sue said :(
495,I had a pretty ok couple hours but I'm back to where I want to die. I can't tell my mom. I've tried so many times and it just is getting bad. I'm scared.

I used to Dx'd with DID but that got changed to EUPD. I understand the two have some overlaps and I know I have some issues with the EUPD Dx but I'm trying to not be in denial. Additionally, I'm aware dissociative symptoms can be a part of EUPD. I mean I'm my even sure if this stuff is dissociative as ALL the healthcare people i have contact with dismiss me when I talk about this stuff MAJORLY!

And I had therapy for it - they started dismissing it soon after I started therapy- and some, namely psych had skepticisms anyway from the start. So anyway I did 19 month therapy to heal past issues in order to feel emotions and become less detached. So I did then when feeling intense emotions I was just told distraction distraction distraction. I think too much distraction is sending me in circles because lately, since having no one to talk to and not knowing how to deal with bad emotions etc and trying to push everything down and just “be better already” I'm experiencing an awful lot of strange stuff again. Which I'm going to explain.

Like today has been awful. I have been in a far away haze most the day. Sometimes I feel little when I'm not really changing and often I get these super strong urges to act oddly or in a different way- like just banging my head on something, or wanting to stay on the train and not bother going home, and cutting off so much that I lose track so I miss stops and in CRT training today I found myself entirely lost of words and time and place with my CRT therapist just staring at me, as if waiting for something.

When I was home my head felt so heavy I couldn't hold it up anymore. So I sat there bent over feeling like I couldn't control my body or sense all my surroundings but I could hear and see, but only a small portion of what was in front of me. My partner led me to bed to lie down and I felt like all I could do was sit, frozen. I wasn't present enough in my body to take my shoes off or move properly or speak but I remember it.

Sometimes I lose a lot of words.

And I hear 2 voices in my head sometimes that want to take over. One is a screaming angry child but the other is a playful child who is literally itching to go to the park. With the screaming one though it is incredibly difficult to control because I feel like she wants to “act out” but when I give an inch she takes a mile and I have a full dissociative episode and “wake up” to chaos or police etc. last time I “woke up” in A&E all like, “I thought I was in the bath”

And it's SO HARD to contain these things that I feel like a monster at the moment.

Sometimes when I walk around I feel like I'm in a film, and I feel like I'm being filmed as part of a story. I feel like I'm floating about in a bubble.

Sometimes I feel high like this. Like I'm stoned without the sleepiness, just the spacey euphoria.

There are other things but this is what comes to mind right now. Sometimes I self harm when I'm trying to contain myself because I have no idea what else to do.

Sometimes as well I get urges to OD still but I guess that's EUPD not coping with life stuff.

I don't feel like I can talk to my CMHT (about to be discharged after a final meeting on Monday) as they have ways dismissed it as being drunk, or “not taking responsibility and denying all responsibility”

I feel like it did get better but since I've been trying to “distract” from every strong and difficult emotional issue (relationships, suicidal feelings, anger anger and rage and sometimes sadness) I feel like this is slipping up on me.

But just to clarify, is that understandable or relatable? Is that even dissociating ?

A lot of times I find myself standing and swaying too but trapped, like I am trapped in that spot for a moment. My partner says I'm being scary and creepy but I don't feel like I'm in control of this…. Whatever it is.

Or am I just making it up and denying responsibility? Which I don't get because I've been trying with volunteering and eating and exercise. They used to put it down to lack of food too when I had anorexia: but that is irrelevant now as I don't have ed or any ed behaviours at all.

Thanks. Sorry it's long. It's a long kind of issue.

503,She wants me to take a break from therapy. We are discussing it on Tuesday. I NEED therapy. I know I do. I'm just so scared if I stop therapy it'll be so much worse. I don't want to stop. I feel I can't stop. I'm so low and this is making me worse.
504,"At last, things are making sense. Recognising and accepting my different parts is a major step, and I'm finding that after nearly two years of therapy, I am getting to the core of who I am. And I can talk with my therapist about my parts with it feeling normal. And she's keen to do some work with each part before we try to integrate them. Seems silky, ridiculous, wonderful, scary, exciting to finally meet my parts, knowing that they were there all this time xx"
505,"I'm so over this. I don't get any answer but ""let someone else out"". Do you fucking know how hard that is for me? Especially when I don't trust them. They've done so many wrong things and I can't trust anybody who has hurt me. This is fucking bullshit. I can't do this anymore. I cannot be in the hospital forever like you said. I can't lose my car (I know that is so simple, but that's the only thing that I have from my old life and if I lose it, I won't ever get a car back). 

Don't fucking say that you are working harder at this than I am. Fucking bullshit. Do you have to live with the voices and yelling at each other? No of course not. I don't want to start over of therapists but maybe I need to. 

And you, you don't get to fucking start with me. I'm done. 

""Everyone and everything would be better off if I died""."
506,"I can't take these drugs. I can't deal. I can't function. I can't live with all of this yelling. I can't function with the yelling. I can't deal with all of the flashbacks. I can't deal with having no memory of things that have happened. I can't deal with not remembering what I was talking about. I can't deal with no sleep. 

I just can't anymore."
507,How can I function and live with YELLING in my head? I know my bio father isn't here so I know it has to be in my head. It's not just him though. They are all yelling. They are yelling at me and at each other. They are so loud. I can't hear anything else. I can't concentrate. I definitely won't probably sleep tonight...I'm so tired if this and I'm also just tired. Physically and emotionally tired.
508,"They're really really bad. They're yelling. I can't concentrate. I can barely type. I can't talk much. 

I almost SH'd today. But I stopped myself. I'm still B&P. Which I guess could be SH....

My trip didnt go well. I don't remember anything good. I spent most of the time in the camper unless it was someone else. I don't drink like ever. But apparently I had a beer. I've never had a beer before. I don't remember. 

I want to die. I need to die. I deserve to die. I'm bad bad bad."
509,"I think an other is making me read Creepy stories.
I don't want to read them because I will be scared, but I keep doing it.
Everytime I exit the pages and come back here, I go straight back on and it feels like I'm not even typing the web addresses in.
Maybe, though, I am just strangely addicted to reading them and it's all me

I'm confused and a little afraid."
510,"They're really really bad. I don't know if I can drive that long today. They're telling me all sorts of bad things. I don't want to act on them, at least yet. But I'm seeing family I haven't seen since last year. Am I excited? Yeah sure but I'm still really nervous. I need to get packing and showered and ready to go..."
511,"I feel like it's my only choice right now. 

I've been in intensive therapy for about a year and half now. I'm on meds. I did just go up on my Buspar though. I'm working as hard as is can to get better. But it just seems to be getting worse and worse. 

Im having horrible horrible flashbacks. I'm having bad voices (new ones just started). There are other things. I'm just at a loss."
512,"I'm just wondering if it's possible to stop my meds. They do absolutely nothing for me. I can hardly function on meds so what's the difference between that and not being on them? I want to get off of them. She seems to think I need to be on them. 

I'm on so many meds. People think I'm crazy (like doctors) when I tell them what I'm on. I take more meds than my grandpa who is 82. Why? 

I'm on two antidepressants (Prozac and Amitryptyline), an anti psychotic (Risperdal), anti anxiety (Buspar and Propananolol), a mood stabiliser (Lamictal), somethings for sleep (which don't work, Melatonin and Temazepam). I also take a stool softener (or else I get really constipated, a birth control (Ocella), and a multi vitamin."
513,I'm hearing voices I've never heard before. I'm very very scared. I have my dogs in my room and I know they wouldn't hurt me. But I'm still scared. I have all of my doors locked and my room door closed. I have my window shut and locked. I'm still scared. I'm trying to sleep so I may not reply back tonight.
514,"...I could escape into my alters and let them take over for tonight, 'cos this gaslighting bitch has stressed me out with just one message

But I won't let her make me get that ill again.

What if they say something to her, she could hold it against me.
Not again.

I'm a better person now and that doesn't involve her."
515,"Every week, I do a piece of writing that I then share with my CPN. Sometimes I draw or gather clip art pictures if I can't find the words about how I feel but it's often a piece of writing that I will write at various stages throughout the week. 

I don't have DID as my trauma therapist tells me that I would be categorised as Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (along with PTSD). But I do have distinct parts. Have just done a piece of writing during which I think I dissociated quite significantly as I found that I'd typed a lot without realising and two parts of me came up and how the responsible adult me (Kate) typed about how she wants to ask the MH professionals to keep the unsafe, vulnerable, suicidal me (S) safe by enforcing meds and/or admit S to hospital again and that Kate's really scared about S's  safety. Kate knows that S is getting close. Kate knows S will be cross and scared if the CPN sees this piece of typing and doesn't know what to do. Kate thinks the CPN should be shown as she needs to keep S safe X"
516,"How can I tell if a headache is just a headache or if one of them wants out? 

I get headaches quite frequently but I can't ever tell if it's because one of the alters wants out or if it's just a headache. Like right now I have a horrible headache and have had all day that I can remember. I've not been myself some of today. I did take medication for the headache. It's not going away. I know when I've been in the hospital they've had to give me special medication to have them go away. Imitrex but I don't have any because I mainly just suffer through them while I'm not in the hospital. 

Maybe it's from lack of sleep? I don't know."
517,"While in the shower do you hear screaming or yelling? 

I've told Sue this and she says that it's common in DID. It makes me feel crazy. I don't like it at all. It always makes me want to take the shortest showers ever."
518,"I haven't left the house for quite some time (I think last time I left the house was when I went to therapy on Tuesday). I have no motivation to do anything, except for B&P. I hadn't had soda for weeks until today I caved. My windows and mirrors are covered because I feel someone wants me dead and is watching me. I'm so scared. 

I'm an idiot."
519,"Huge thunderstorm with hail, rain, thunder and lightning. I don't know what happened but last I knew I was watching TV and now it is an hour past that time. I came to (or ""woke up"") a few minutes ago in my room. I hope I didn't do anything bad..."
520,"I have DID, but mine is odd, I have me, Ali, then the childish version of me which my partner decided to name Alibear as a pet name, but I’m aware of my body when I’m Alibear. 
Then there’s a ‘me’ which I haven’t put a name to and i’m not in control of, when that ‘me’ comes out, I, Ali don’t feel like I’m in control of my body, everything is really fuzzy and it feels like everything is fake and will just melt away at any second.
My multiples I guess you would call them that, are very simple and it took me a long while to even realise that’s what they are, I used to go to a counsellor and we started talking there and I was diagnosed. I didn't really know what it all meant until a few months ago when I started noticing how different I was in these three different mindsets
When I am the childish ones, I don't smoke, my partner gives me a bed time, my voice changes and I make my partner cut the crusts off of my bread etc and I have full memory of it. 
when I'm the other one (I guess it's just disassocation, I really don't know), I just feel really apathetic to everything and I can hardly remember anything that happens in that time, there's just gaps in my memory where one minute I'm in line in a shop buying something, next minute I'm walking out of the shop, not remembering what happened in between that gap, not being in control when it's actually happening, but being aware that it is.

I have no idea what the point of this post is, it's just nice to see that there's others out there who could share in my experience."
521,"I'm washing my clothes today. I just looked at them and I don't remember wearing some of the clothes. They are completely out of my style. I feel embarrassed asking but this is really bugging me. 

Does this happen to you?"
522,I really hate passive aggressiveness. It really makes me uncomfortable. Makes me think they are talking about me...
523,I'm sorry for coming into everyone's life. I won't be a problem because I'm leaving.

525,I need to die. I can't live anymore.
526,"Lincoln is stupid, extremely stupid. She can't do anything. She's stopping her meds. She will land in the hospital."
527,Just FML. I can't do this anymore. This is way too hard. Listening to voices that compete with the freaking TV is so hard. I'm seeing demons. I'm seeing flashbacks. I'm feeling flashbacks. I'm feeling them like they are happening right now. I can't just lay here all day. I'm watching TV but it is so loud inside my head.
528,"I don't want to go camping to family reunion this year. But I'm obligated to go. I was really excited but now I don't care. I love seeing all of my great uncles and aunts but it's my aunts that are driving me crazy (no pun intended). I don't want to go. I was only going to go up for a day and night. But now I don't want to go at all. 

I want to die. I really do. And nobody IRL takes me seriously. I'm so lost. I'm drowning and can't breathe."

I'm going to go crawl back in my hole."
530,I absolutely can't do this anymore.
531,My cousin when I was 8 did some bad things to me when he was 16. My mom has been babysitting his children and he picked them up the past two days. Seeing him yesterday was awkward but I handled it better than today. Today as soon as I saw him I had an anxiety attack and I started having flashbacks. I've been having flashbacks for hours now. They're really bad. Like I can feel things happening to my body. I'm really scared.
532,"I loathe that question, especially if Sue asks it because I can't say I'm okay. Okay to her means I'm not hearing voices and I'm not diagnosable. I've never been that so I can't say I'm okay. Also there's absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting sex I've decided. Absolutely nothing. So what if I'm asexual. I'm a human being as well. It seems you are damned if you do and damned if you don't with sex. If you don't have sex you are judged. If you have sex you are judged. So either way I would be judged. It's unfair.

I'm sorry for so many posts tonight."
533,"Yet another friend on Facebook just announced she's pregnant. I should be finding out what I was having. I was due Nov 9, 2014. 

Yes I just posted that I've lost interest in babies but this still hurts.

536,"Hello everyone, I'm new to the forum but I have been reading for a while, I don't want to talk about my issues face to face with anyone so I thought on here might be a good place to open up.

I've been pretty worried about my mind lately, I've had mild depression issues in the past but this is something completely different. I'm not sure if this would be the right section but it sounds near enough.

I have been under a lot of stress the last couple of weeks which has really brought me to the edge.

I have, for quite some time, had constant thoughts about life and how pointless life is, not in a suicidal way, more of a satirical way if anything, it is always at the back of my mind but sometimes I just sit there and have really deep thoughts about it. I believe it isn't something that can be changed, I could invent a cure for aging and everyone could be immortal but my life would still be pointless as would everyone elses, it is just a pointless cycle in a pointless universe with no point to anything if that makes any sense?

A few years ago I isolated myself from everyone I knew apart from close family and my girlfriend, I moved to a new city, got a new phone and deleted any social media, I didn't want to know any of these people, I didn't want to trust anyone. The only person I trust is my girlfriend yet I am too scared to open up to her, she thinks I have just gone a bit strange, I try to hide everything that is in my head from her.

I have started feeling as if everything is just in autopilot, everything I do just seems to happen without any input from myself, when people talk to me I listen but I hear hardly anything and the conversation just unfolds without me yet I am still talking. I have a full time job which requires alot of concentration and thinking, I still do the job but I am unsure how really.

I have started zoning out and it can feel like minutes have passed but it is hours, I have stopped eating properly because I just don't feel hungry and if I do I get home from work but the time just disappears.

I don't live with my girlfriend, she is still at university, it is a long term and serious relationship yet I only see her at the weekends, it seems abit of a joke, I know people who are married and have kids and they have been together for a shorter time.

I just want to have control of my life again because I don't know what is going on. I haven't seen her this weekend and when I see her it makes everything that little better so I suppose with the recent stress and not seeing her it has made me desperate.

I don't know what is going on but if anyone else is in a similar position it would be great for some acknowledgement and to know there are other people, sat at their computers, who are having or have had the same experience.

Thank you for reading my post.

Dobu."
537,"I don't know what to do. I'm so wound up. I'm so upset. And it seems like nobody cares. Maybe I'm on the verge of an attack. Maybe I'm stupid.

546,Under flood warning until 2 PM Friday :low:
547,"I can feel that she has poisoned people against me because I poisoned myself against her, but I didn't, I'm just ill.

She won't even talk to me, but part of me is fine with that because she's just a little girl with a complex....But I don't mean that really, I'm just bitter. I don't know if I am though.

I shaved my head just to spite her. 
Y'know so she wouldn't want me anymore.
I guess that spited myself though.

I keep thinking that maybe she won't talk to me because she loves me, but who really knows. 

It's a disease though.
Passive hatred.
Soon everyone will be infected.
Sometimes I think I can see it coursing through the floor and taking them conduit.

I'm sorry again."
551,"For a long time now I've had weird experiences where I don't feel real and I've questioned whether the world around me is real or not, there's more to it than that but in a nutshell. I started experiencing breaks in my memory and I can see now that this happens a lot if I'm exceptionally stressed or if something specific triggers it off. My husband has had to fill in the blanks for me on many occasion. He says it's like it's not me, and that someone entirely different has taken over. I can remember feeling angry sometimes, or simply just nothing, blank, no matter how hard I try to recall that time frame. 
The other night was different and it has kind of freaked me out quite a bit. We were sat on the sofa watching TV, and I was absolutely fine. Which is unusual for me since I usually feel very anxious. But I was perfectly ok. Then my husband switched channels and The Matrix was on. I can remember vividly it felt as if I had been pushed to the back of my head and was looking through someone else's eyes and listening to them speaking. I was instantly in the most vile mood ever, really angry, I remember saying I wasn't going to see my therapist any more because it was ridiculous, and I completely threw my toys out of my pram over every little thing. I recognise this as my younger self, and I've felt that a part of me has never moved on and never lived past those seventeen years that have gone by. It's like I have the evidence to show I have, but the memories are broken and I feel that I have, to some degree, been shattered like glass. It felt like a piece of me had been laid dormant and had woken up and decided they were taking control. I've not had this before. The most I've been able to recall previously was a strong feeling of rage but never known why. It honestly felt as if I were an outsider looking in. It was really bizarre. And then he switched channels again, to a nature program, and I was fine again. Just like that. As if someone else were in control and had snapped their fingers and I came back to earth. The only difference was that I could actually remember it all. I think I prefer it when I don't remember. I could pass that off as other people being over the top and it didn't really happen, I could choose not to believe them, but I can't ignore that. Because I remember it happening. 
I don't know if that makes any sense. I am pretty sure that it was that particular film that did it, the fact it's about the world as we know it not actually being real and I feel that way so often. 
That's really not normal, is it. Or maybe it is. I don't really know. Anyone else felt like that?"

555,"What if Sue dies? She's 72...and driving back...

And today was awful. We live in a neighborhood where there are three streets close together. We were coming back from getting food. When we had to pull over for three police cars. They turned in one of the three streets. My 11 year old brother was home alone (you have to be 11 to stay home alone) when we see smoke billowing from the direction our house is on. I have a panic attack. We realize it's not our house but the next street over. Our houses are very close together. We walked over there to see which house it was. It was the group home for mentally disabled clients. One person had to be transported to the hospital. 

It was so scary."
556,"Hello

Currently going through trauma therapy, I've been told that I am on the dissociative scale. Although I haven't been told whereabouts I am officially on the scale, I know that I scored 42 on the Dissociative Experiences Scale which puts me above the threshold for DID, though this May not be right. It's only now that I am becoming aware of the different parts of me and it's weird how my style of writing can change depending on what age I am. The other  day at work, I was writing and I looked down to see this arm which I can only deduce was linked to my body moving at a slow speed but it didn't feel like my arm. I couldn't feel any connection which was so disturbing. For years, my name has felt like it applies to someone younger and not me now. I feel there's little continuum in my life as I have a handful of events that I can recall. Part of me is finding it helpful to acknowledge at least three parts to me but in also finding it scary as it's all very new. My CPN and trauma therapist (who's the county's top NHS trauma psychotherapist) are great but I feel as if I'm descending into some uncertainty about who I am. Does any one have any reassuring words or advice? 

Thanks

562,"Hello,

I recently saw an IAPT worker, who after an hour long telephone call and a 2 hour face to face meeting is having trouble diagnosing me, I was diagnosed at 15 with depression and at 17 was evident I was bipolar,  however I never grew out of having imaginary friends and have been hallucinating of hearing music, my name being called and seeing and interacting with persons that aren't there since childhood, diagnosed with schizophrenia at 23. I dissociate and have occasional delusions and paranoia. My confusion is, that I was told I'm not schizophrenic, although I've been treated for it for the past 8 years, however 28 months ago I became drug free with the exception of cannabis and nicotine, and since the delusions and hallucinations have dissolved they seem to think I am not schizophrenic,  even doubted I have bipolar,  since I have not relapsed or had an episode of either, however the dissociation is the same and I still actively talk to myself, not my 'friends', worse so when under stress. I can kind of put it down to the fact that the cannabis has regulated my sleep and this has controlled the symptoms of bipolar and schizophrenia, plus the reduced stress has lessened outbreaks. I feel more in control than I ever did on medication, but the term dissociative identity disorder was mentioned but not diagnosed, I was told that there is no active treatment for this, have I been placed under an umbrella diagnosis to gain access to services I would not be otherwise able to with bipolar, schizophrenia or D.I.D. is it possible to be all the above, as this lady is baffled more than me and said she hasn't seen this before in her experience. I have been assessed by at least 20 or more psychiatrists the past 15 years, passed from department to department who all seem to have a problem treating me, I was given hypnotics for insomnia, zopiclo ne,  which after taking 4 of the damn things still didn't knock me out, been on every kind of antidepressant,  mood stabiliser, tranquilliser known to mankind and still nothing actually worked apart from cannabis. If I stop taking it, my hallucinations and every comes back worse and so does my stutter, stammer, shaking/ tremors, confusion back pain, anxiety. .. is this a dissociative disorder I'm suffering with? I'm very confused and really can't trust what doctors say anymore as they all contradict each other. 
Sorry for my rambling,  I'm not good at summarising, this is cutting a long story short. Believe me.
I started smoking cannabis 5 years ago, apart from alcohol, nicotine and prescribed medications I have no other history of drug use or addiction to recreational drugs, plus to note, I do not get high of cannabis or feel drunk with alcohol (why I haven't drunk to get drunk since 19). What is up with that???
Can anyone help me to understand this or make it clear?

Thank you

Tim.

Also to note, my whole adult life I have worked, and forgot to mention I have amnesia. It has also come to light that I was physically and mentally abused as a child between ages 3 - 9."
563,I'm doomed.
564,I'm having dreams of where I kill myself. Is this a sign that God will be okay with it? I don't want to go to Hell...
565,Is this supposed to make me feel hot? I just feel really warm. And it's snowing a lot and normally I would be cold. But I feel like I'm having a hotflash. Is this due to the med?
566,"I feel like people are looking at me strange as I crumble under the weight of all this churning shite in my head.
Nearly typed like an alter, not again. :unsure:
I feel that people think I'm lying because I say I'll do something and then do exact-opp, but it's just because I'm scared or my brain doesn't work.

How can I not be thrown through a loop by the tiniest thing? 
I have to contend with paranoia, anxiety, dream fixation, intrusive thoughts and voices on a daily basis. It's just the straw that broke the camel's back.

There are days where I'm so scared because I believe I have cancer or AIDs because I feel so drained and lost and scared. I somehow welcome that diagnosis though, because I know people would finally understand my needs, because that is an illness that requires I have as much rest and space as I need.

I'm just drowning."
567,"Now they are saying I'm going to be killed if I don't do it today. I've texted Sue and she said that I need to remind them that if I kill myself everyone dies. I'm not planning on killing myself for the record. 

They said that I was going to get killed today if i didn't do it yesterday. Well I'm still alive..."
568,I'm getting too scared. I'm getting new memories. The black holes in my memory are closing up. Maybe I don't want to know. I can't handle these new memories.
569,"Yep she's now frustrated with me. She flat out said she was frustrated...

I'm very upset. I told her I wanted to overdose. She said if I'm not safe I need to go to the hospital. I told her no I can't do that. 

If she truly knew what I'm thinking she would put me in the hospital.

Edit: she's not frustrated with me. She's frustrated by the situation."
570,"It's so snowy here. I take my meds like I'm supposed to but I'm getting worse and worse. I don't know what else I can do that I haven't already done. 

So I've decided to give up. I give up on meds (will be getting off of them). I'm giving up on therapy. I'm just giving up on life. I can't do this anymore."
571,"That's the question of the day. Yes I am. Am I going to hurt myself? Probably not. Do I want to hurt myself? Yes. 

I can't contract for safety. Because if I contract for safety and I hurt myself I won't be able to live with myself. Because then I broke a promise. 

I'm having 15-20 anxiety attacks a day. I have no Benzos to get me through them. I'm having to live through it. 

My mom I'm sure knows something is up. I didn't spend any time with my family yesterday except to eat. I was too preoccupied to be nice. I feel the same way today. 

I cannot go into hospital. If I go into hospital I will have more bills that I can't pay. I don't know what to do..."
572,"It's snowing!

It's May for goodness sakes!"
573,"Is this real life? I can't imagine how much worse it can get. It's BAD right now. So bad. 

Flashbacks, voices, panic, anxiety, suicidal ideation,  etc. it just gets worse. I don't know what to do. 

I don't want to go into hospital. At all. 

I'm taking my meds like I'm supposed to. I don't know what else to do. I need sleep. 

It took me 15 minutes to write this..."
574,"I'm scared I may have been seen at her apartment. I'm scared that I'm going to be killed now. I'm scared that my disability will go away. I'm scared.

I'm scared that it's time for me to be killed or to kill myself. I'm afraid that this new guy won't want me anymore. 

I still put makeup on and shower twice a day even though I hear screaming in the shower (when nobody else is home), so it's not affecting my hygiene. But even when I was in the hospital I didn't go a day without showering. 

I'm sorry."
575,I don't know if it's safe to go out of my house. I'm scared. Is it safe?

581,"Hello everyone.

Does anyone have any info/techniques to help rein in my Alters. There's loads of them and I am terrified now that I don't have counseling anymore to deal with them. I don't remember much but I have a weird burning in my temples.  I was diagnosed over nine years ago, just after my best friend died. 

I have many Alters and these are only the ones that I am aware of. I'll start with the first one because me and the Counselor worked out why this one switches in the most: The Child (Bad child hood, really bad) The Analyst, The Ranter/Nasty dude (I hate him I really do, he's violent and scary) The Emo (I'm terrified because I have had too many bad experiences to do with suicide) The Clown , The Creative one  and many others that I dread to think about. It's taken the best part of nine years to notice the ones I've listed.

I am not medicated and things are always a blur.  I just need to know what others like me go through and how to be aware of when I switch and what can be done. I hat them, they hate each other and I only discover new things in my Journal I dubbed the Log Of Horrors.:eek2:

I can hold down a job but not been in work for so long as the Alters have different ideas. I have a certificate in Catering and don't remember any of it only bits of fun with my friends I made there.  How do I get my friends to understand and not take the Mickey too?  Is posting on my Facebook just going to scare them away/cause trouble? Some of my friends think I'm pig ignorant because I don't contact them for ages and when I do I find myself baffled at how to explain it. 

Can anyone help.  I appreciate any info/advice etc.

(P.S Linked this with my phone so I will get a message if there's any reply. Just wondering which me will get it)

Kind regards"
582,"I'm not dead. But my government wants me dead. 

I'm on Social Security Disability for my severe MI. I can't work right now. I can barely go out of my house right now.

Why does the government want me dead? Well because I collect disability. I don't work for my money. (Well I did before and paid into SSDI from my previous jobs). They want me dead so they don't have to send that money to a mooch. I have $100 after all of my bills are paid to last me a month.

This is why I can't stay alive."
588,"Hello. Not sure if this is the right forum for my question but I will ask.

I have noticed that when I start staring at computer or laptop's screen, after a few moments my brain idles and I can't be creative or think. I just stare at screen like hypnotized person and this affects negatively my work on computer that I do. But when it comes to books i.e. reading physical book unlike digital, I can think, be creative, can analyze... When suddenly phone rings and I have to answer, I have problem expressing myself and I feel slow and loss of attention.

Any thoughts why this happens?

If this is not place for my question, please let me know about appropriate forum.

Thanks."

595,"I was officially diagnosed Dissociative Identity Disorder aka Multiple Personality Disorder today. This has been one of my worst fears to be diagnosed with. Apparently have a person inside of me named Sally. She comes out to deal with traumas and my counseling sessions. Idk if I have any others inside. This scares me. My therapist thinks one of my voices is Sally. And she has convinced the other voices to tell me to kill myself and other things. Well I guess what I said isnt true about not knowing if others are inside. I know there's another one. I know there's a little girl inside. Idk her name though. Sally asked my therapist to call her Sally. 

What is my next diagnosis? Goodness gracious Ive been diagnosed with alot of mental health concerns and at least 2 since ive been out of the hospital 4 months ago. I'm scared and I don't know how to tell like my mom and such about this. Help please!"

I don't like what happened. I'm so upset. I want to die. But I won't die. Because I won't kill myself. I won't kill myself. I promise. I haven't SH'd in a long time.

597,"As the title suggests, thought we could have a little chat as there doesn't seem to be much traffic here.
Interested in your journeys with this disorder, how many alters you are aware of, co consciousness etc?
I've recently had a turning point where things sort of fell apart a bit and a psychologist says its constructive not destructive and basically I'm starting to integrate, I think I'm mostly co conscious which is good but do sometimes have black outs and people have seen another personality emerge.

Such a complex thing and now all my problems finally come together and make sense, 8 years in the Mental Health system you'd think they'd start screening for this more these days lol"

600,"Today after many months of opening up and talking about dissociative experiences and alters I received a letter summing up a pdoc appointment and where the diagnosis usually says emotionally unstable personality disorder borderline type it said 'multiple personality disorder'
My care co ordinator spoke with him for 20 mins before the appt about my alters and he asked if she believed it apparently, she said yes

I actually cried tears of relief but I'm unsure if I've even had a structured clinical interview and why he put multiple pd and not dissociative identity disorder but still I'm glad it's recognised now.

I wonder though why he removed the borderline diagnosis as I do have the symptoms, but I know DID shows similar symptoms"

Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
 Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
 Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
 Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come. 

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
 Scribbling on the sky the message (S)He Is Dead,
 Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
 Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. 

(S)He was my North, my South, my East and West,
 My working week and my Sunday rest,
 My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
 I thought that (her) love would last for ever: I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;
 Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;
 Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.
 For nothing now can ever come to any good.

632,"Hello all,

New here, hoping for some perspective. I homed in on this subforum as it seemed to be right, but I have no idea really.

For years now, I've sort of been pretending to be me. I've not really felt any emotional attachment to anyone, or myself. On the flipside, I get a strong emotional response to certain movies or music or events, but only melancholy or awe, or excitement, but that only makes me feel sort of sad and yet excited. It's hard for me to describe, but it's a little bit like the description in American Beauty, where one of the protagonists describes the world as so beautiful it's overwhelming, but in an incredibly sad way.

Needless to say, my girlfriend is struggling with me and with herself. I could go on like this indefinitely, because I would, in a strange way, quite like to keep feeling and experiencing the world like this because it's so raw and effecting, but left to my own devices, I don't think it's very healthy!

I guess it's fair to say I like certain types of music too much to be normal - I can lose myself in certain types of melodic trance music and dance like I'm on stimulants for hours and feel amazing, or I feel like I want to sit on the top of a mountain and just watch the sky even if I died of exposure.

Meanwhile, I am holding down a job with great success. I am empathic and can deal with almost anyone and bring them around, or bring them up, pretty much without thinking about it. I can get a feel for someone in seconds and I don't think I get that wrong very often. I like socialising and take great pleasure in conversing with people, to the point whereby I can nearly get overwhelmed emotionally by a successful connection with someone over a joke, or a shared opinion.

But despite all that, I still can't connect emotionally with my loved ones. I don't grieve at funerals, but instead feel overwhelmed by everyone else's emotions.

So weird, to me at least. Can anyone give me an idea what this is? Is this normal? Does everyone feel like this and it's all a big pretend session? 

Desperately seeking some perspective, or a second opinion, or anything really.

Many thanks for reading. If this is in totally the wrong forum, please relocate, or tell me to which one I should go.

Many thanks and kind regards

Ian"
633,"I am not doing well at all at the moment. Had a meeting between my boss and psychiatrist today. My boss really thinks I had my psychiatric crisis to inconvenience her and the company.

My psychiatrist told her that my condition is very serious and that there is an ego state in me that takes over and wants me to kill myself which they are managing as best they can, but she obviously thinks it is all make believe. 

I am sooo tired of this now and am constantly thinking that it would have been better if the attempt at killing myself would have worked. It would have been better for me, work and my partner.

To feel this bad all the time is unbearable. 

In life I am always an outsider and joining this forum confirmed it once again. Even in cyberspace I am still a ghostly non-entity on the fringes.

I almost wished my psych prescribed sublingual zyprexa again to put me out for a while, but he does not think it is necessary. Says it is better to deal with this head on.

Anyway, I just woke up from sleeping almost for 24 hours after my psychiatrist gave me a dose of zyprexa. Feel very groggy still, but much clearer.

I am new to ""Mentalhealthforum.net"". For the second time in a year I was recently admitted to a psychiatric clinic in Johannesburg, South Africa. At the moment I am re-integrating at home after being discharged a week ago.

I was diagnosed with an unspecified dissociative disorder and have started intensive psychotherapy (started while admitted) which I am told will last for about a year. Hypnosis is a big feature of the integration therapy. The problem is that I feel extremely exposed and vulnerable in anticipation of and during the hypnosis sessions. It feels almost unbearable at the moment.

To tell the truth I am feeling completely lost at the moment and have no idea what to expect.

Do you guys have any words of advice and maybe encouragement for me?

Any comments will be much appreciated."
648,Just what the title says: it's 6:07 am here. I have to travel today. Kind of scared
649,"This is hard to watch, but it's an important insight into the how DID feels."
650,I'm worried. I was feeling wonderful until this afternoon and now I'm depressed.
651,I have a huge headache which means one thing. They want out. I refuse.
652,"So where to even begin,
This is my first time really talking about whatever is going on. I'm just really trying to figure out what it is, I've looked all over the internet but haven't found anything but I think depersonalization is in the right direction. I also haven't talked to a GP, I think thats a general physician right? Never heard that term before.

I do have some symptoms of depersonalization. When I look in the mirror it seems like I'm not looking at myself but someone else, it's really weird but I still do know it is me. When I touch things it feels really weird, again almost like it's not me. I really don't know how else to describe it. 

I have mild visual and auditory hallucinations but I do know it's all in my head. Stuff tends to move when I stare at it, especially things that have a repeating pattern to it like fences. It's not intense movement but slight and always in an up or down motion. When I'm in the dark everything seems grainy. Wikipedia called it visual noise and also those floater things. Also sometimes I see random light or dark flashes. Those were mostly classified under closed eye hallucinations but I get them all the time. Much more noticeable in the dark.

Here's the thing that I have never been able to find any information on. I hear a constant noise a sort of static like when the tv's not on a channel. It does not say at a steady volume but it swells. It gets louder and then faint but when it comes back, it always comes back much louder. If I focus on it, it will keep coming back so loud that it feels like my eardrums are going to burst. When I focus on it and let it get really loud, the hallucinations of patterns and stuff like that start to come up over the visual noise. Kind of like a kaleidoscope sometimes and other times like different colored clouds and the patterns always come from my peripherals to the center.

Fortunately I have learned to block out that sound and the hallucinations stay at a minimal amount for the most part. It always there but if I concentrate on something else then it goes back down to a really quiet volume instantaneously.

I decided to really look into this now because all my symptoms seem to gradually be getting more intense. I'm worried that one day it will be too much. I do also have a bit of anxiety but it's not problematic most of the time. When I do feel anxiety though, that sound starts to come in stronger and is harder for me to block out, also the depersonalization symptoms intensify. It seems like they are all connected. 

Also my perception of big and small recently started getting weird. Sometimes if I lie in bed, I feel like I'm huge and my rooms is tiny. When I light a cigarette, it seems like my hands are enormous and the cigarette is tiny. Stuff like that, it started happening about 6 months ago.

When I was in high school, I did experiment quite a bit with drugs and honestly I had all these feelings 12 years ago when I took some magic mushrooms. Then for the most part went away and gradually came back one by one. Unfortunately I don't remember how I felt when I was free of all these symptoms but I do remember it all started when I was about 12-13 years old.

Thanks for reading and sorry if it was too long and all over the place, I just wrote what came to mind. I would love to hear if anyone else hears that sound or knows anything about it, I thought it was tinnitus at first but my hearing is perfect, and tinnitus doesn't come with hallucinations lol.

Thanks"
653,I've been in hospital since Oct 9. I'm still technically admitted but am on a day pass. I should be getting out this week.

655,"I was reading Jung, the psychology of the transference, wanting to learn more about that (not an easy book for me to understand) but it has a part on out of body experiences, which i have had. I was wondering if anyone could help me understand it better. I am aware of the big change i have been through since being diagnosed (bipolar disorder), and how i feel more awake/aware of things. I think Jung was saying that this out of body experience has something to do with it. Something to do with the ego. Can Bipolar disorder/mental breakdowns be compared to that? Am i completely off the mark?"
656,"I had years of not really being here, here in body, but not in mind. It did improve for a while, but now Its started happening again! I'm always looking from the outside, creating an illusion of being here to other people, but I am not! Where should I be? I'm not really here at all!"

A lot of my memories are in 3rd person (but that might be normal.)

Yesterday, I shut my eyes to rest them and I saw myself standing there and I felt like I was a floating orb."
658,"Once I was feeling very detached,

And I felt like everything had already past- the universe, life and everything that ever was,

I was not real, just some fading distant voice from things long gone by and long ended,

Soon the infinite coldness and infinite darkness would consume all. There would never be anything again- not life, not thought, not feeling, not form, or thing, nothing at all.

I truly feared that eternity had already past, and that I was fading away as the last remnants of a long forgotten echo. I was dissolving into nothingness, everything I ever knew lost in the endless pit that awaits us at the end of time. All meaning, all hope, gone, never to return.

I actually got quite panicky, and indeed did panic. I did not feel as if I was real."
659,"All my live, I have been told I'm over-reacting. 
Like nobody gets visibly irritated by inane thing. 
You must always have a latent approach to stress and anger.
Go ahead.
Lock it in that black lead box in your psyche. 
Keep it there for nearly a decade. 
If new thing irritate you, you must put that in the box too (but mind your fingers)

Now I hear the box straining and feel it's blistering heat inside coming through."

663,"I'm feeling like shit just now. It just seems like everything I want in life if get, but with a major slant to it. I wanted a nice safe husband. I got one - he's too safe, can't stand up to me, can't support me the way I need. I wanted a baby, I got twins!! Love them both dearly but it's so hard. Too hard!! Wanted a job working with animals. Got one but had to give up when the twins came along. Wanted my own house but I'm crap at looking after it. It's just everything itch turns to crap! I've fallen out with a friends over the stupidest thing & it's set me way back. I know suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But when I feel this shit & in reality my life is supposed to be good it just seems like that's the so best option for me and my kids. They'd be better off without me. It's so sickening to,my stomach them trying to,cheer me up. Trying to make me ok. It shouldn't be like that for them. 
I remember a time not long after they were born. I walked out the house leaving them with my husband. I wish I'd kept walking. I should be happy but I,can't make myself stop these feelings and thoughts."
664,will every up crash down the other side?
665,"Hello, everyone.

I have registered on these forums because I've had some experiences and don't know if they are related to dissociation or some other disorder.

I have a psychiatrist and therapist and have been on medications for about ten years.  I am diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder with a bipolar affective.  I have had mood swings and hallucinations since I was a child.

I have been through various forms of abuse from family and others.  A few years ago I was in a bad situation with a dysfunctional mentally ill room mate who was eventually hospitalized and moved out.  By this time I had already been in treatment for years for schizoaffective disorder.

Something just kind of broke inside me -- can't go into it all here -- and I began to experience strange things that I had no prior experience of even with my schizoaffective disorder.  I began to have experience of four distinct entities within me.  They all have distinct personalities and ways of contacting me.  When they first came to me, I was terribly broken.  My experiences of them are not generally negative.  I have known them for about four years.  They usually come to me when I am in distress.  They are always loving and kind, not negative (like the voices I have sometimes heard), so I don't feel distress from them the way I do with mood swings and such.  One of them has come to me several times when I was manic or psychotic and guided me through it and I felt like this has really protected me.

But I feel like some sort of dissociation may have occurred within me.  As I said, I have been through a lot of abuse and these beings emerged out of that context.  The strange thing is that these beings seem to be myself in some other form -- two are female, two are male.  I have seen visions of three of them and one of them looks like a female version of myself but non-human.  Another is also a non-human version of myself but male and his face looks much like mine, but again not human.  It's almost like I'm experiencing myself in different forms, but it's not like Dissociative Personality Disorder in that I can remember what's going on and they don't usually possess me, although I do have Dissociative Personality Disorder in my family along with various other forms of mental illness (mostly schizophrenia).

Although as I said these entities seem to care for me and love me and help me, and this was a great relief when I was being terribly abused, these four entities seem to be associated not only with different facets of my emotions but different problems.  One of them comes to me when I'm psychotic, one comes to me when I'm depressed, one seems to be associated with sexual issues (I have been terribly abused by family for being gay), and the feminine version of myself is associated with my emotions.  When I become depressed or extremely anxious I have seen the blue female one turn green and her eyes roll around in her head.

The very masculine one I have always felt to be gay and I have experienced him flow into my body almost like he was having sex with me, and yet I have problems connecting with men on an emotional level.  He is the most distant one from me and rarely contacts me, but when he does I feel it in my physical body and often become physically aroused.

Also, one time the one I associate with depression took over my body.  I can remember everything that happened unlike the person in my family with multiple personalities but I completely became this entity or rather he became me.  He spoke through me and moved through my body.  I was completely transformed -- it was like there was no me left, just him, and this happened after he led me out in the middle of the night and I got myself in a very dangerous situation and that's when I completely became him and he took complete control over the situation.  When I became myself again I had the sense that he had completely taken over and protected me.  This happened in the woods where he took me and I had many visions and revelations about the nature of illusion and reality and I lost all track of time and when I came back I had been gone for hours and hours.  Right before he took over me wild animals came out of the woods and that's when he took over and somehow walked me out of the woods without getting harmed.

When the blue feminine one comes to me I am usually flooded with the most powerful feelings of overwhelming love and beauty and compassion but the weird thing is I can remember early in my teenage years when that was most similar to my emotional state in general -- when I would become manic I would go into a religious fervor and feel love for the whole world almost like a goddess -- and it's like I'm going back in time to those feelings but instead I feel it coming from her, not me.

I don't know if this is some kind of disorder or not.  I have been experiencing these beings more and more over the past four years and am baffled by how each one is so different from the other and yet in every single one I can deeply, deeply identify some aspect of myself, the abuse I have been through, and the problems I have from it.

Could this possibly be some form of dissociation?  Is there any information on this?  I have not been able to find it anywhere.  I have shared bits and pieces of this with my psychiatrist but he does not comment on it.  I should probably share the full story with him.

If anyone could please direct me to any helpful information I would be greatly appreciative."

680,"I could probably be an example of a textbook case of Depersonalization but the thing is I never asked for help. The people I have told about this constant dreamlike state that I have had for so long that I fear what would happen if it were fixed/cured. Truly, It's been so long that I can't even recall an onset but some things hurt because somewhere inside I recall how certain things felt. Years on end constantly just feeling like my mind and my body are separate and im pretty much controlling it with strings. Despite this I'm not depressed but it is maddening and I can admit I fear it going away.

I often wonder If I get this fixed what if everything is ""too"" real or if I have waited too long. I've never been able to summon the courage to speak to my primary care doctor about this, I want to but this feeling of ...I guess embarrassment overtakes me. I told myself I will set up an appointment with him tomorrow...but I won't.

724,"Grounding techniques

Begin by tracing your hand on a piece of paper and label each finger as one of the five senses. Then take each finger and identify something special and safe representing each of those five senses. For example: Thumb represents sight and a label for sight might be butterflies or my middle finger represents the smell sense and it could be represented by lilacs. After writing and drawing all this on paper, post it on your refrigerator or other safe places in the home where it could be easily seen and memorize it. Whenever you get triggered, breathe deeply and slowly, and put your hand in front of your face where you can really see it – stare at your hand and then look at each finger and try to do the five senses exercise from memory.





• Keep your eyes open, look around the room, notice your surroundings, notice

details.

• Hold a pillow, stuffed animal or a ball.

• Place a cool cloth on your face, or hold something cool such as a can of soda.

• Listen to soothing music

• Put your feet firmly on the ground

• FOCUS on someone’s voice or a neutral conversation.






• Name 5 things you can see in the room with you.

• Name 4 things you can feel (“chair on my back” or “feet on floor”)

• Name 3 things you can hear right now (“fingers tapping on keyboard” or “tv”)

• Name 2 things you can smell right now (or, 2 things you like the smell of)

• Name 1 good thing about yourself






Reorient yourself in place and time by asking yourself some or all of these questions:

1. Where am I?

2. What is today?

3. What is the date?

4. What is the month?

5. What is the year?

6. How old am I?

7. What season is it?"

Having said this she said that now she will go and have a meeting to discuss further treatment for me, and as she is part of the early intervention team for phychosis it's possible I will end up with a new care coordinator, as well as starting therapy something called ACAT have to look that up as really have no idea what that's about.

Wish I was tired would go to bed to get up extra early and give the house another once over... it's deadly quiet here can just hear the clock... think I might go soon and find something to do...

Love E

729,"If ally has alters then

I'm E have been about all day D was out last night upsetting L that made R protect and reassure L. For days S was out being verbally horrid to CC 

Now I still don't know if ally has alters but me E have named them today..

E the rational
D the self destructive
L the kid
S the angry
R the protector

Well that's their initial not brave enough to give out there real names but hey I'm E, the one the CC wanted to see more of, hopefully I will hang around until the CC visits on thursday.. 

Off to bed long day tomorrow

Sorry I've not commented or looked at many posts today, maybe I will find time tomorrow xx perhaps xx"
730,Very very very very angry. She's pissed. I didn't allow her to go. She's angry because of that.
731,"I need advice. Jocelyn has set up two meetings with men for today and tomorrow. There's probably going to be sex. Keep in mind she's 16. Today it was before two. It's now 1045 and I'm still not dressed for the day. Because well I figure she won't go out with anyone if I'm not dressed. But I have to get dressed sometime soon. 

I've also told my Mum I'm not to leave the house today or tomorrow alone. 

I don't know what else to do..."
732,"I don't know if I can stay away from here. Especially when I'm altered. They don't seem to want to come on here but I'm afraid if they are out more they will. That's what she wants me to do. Is transition more frequently and give them the control more often. I'm scared. 

I can't stay away. I need you all."
733,"Just had a shower and purged in the last hour or so.. whilst purging I had a voice in my head say ""why mommy"" this is is who I call little ally.. I had to talk with her and get her to go away... I seem to get her most of the time during self destruction.. and I always have to tell her to go away mommy is okay and to come back later... I don't understand what is happening to me.... why just why did I get the voice "" why mommy"" I had this a few times during SH... sometimes she just asks mommy questions when fearful or anxious, she will tell me she is scared, and I normally tell her me too but we will be okay. I've never been a parent, never had kids yet I have this kid inside me asking me questions... and sometimes I end up acting like a child talking childish and behaving like one only in safe places though not many people have seen this maybe 4 people most ever, so does this mean I turn into little ally?? Is this what an alter is all about, or have I got it all wrong, I'm lost..."
734,"Hi,

I probably won't be on much the next few days. I've gotten some advice that I need to take some time outs more. So I might be on or might not be on. I don't know."
735,"Who am I 

Am I the knight that protects, feels strong, feels male confident, defensive and dismissal, takes charge and in control, parental to mother, boosted energy and motivated

Am I the rational one that's emotionless, thinks rationally, is genderless and great self helper

Am I the angry one that doesn't think of the consequences, has a short fuse, cannot speak or think rationally, doesn't care to be injured, hurtful verbally to others, frustrated, hatrid towards many things, and male attitude and gets extremely raged

Am I the little kid that talks childish literally, acts silly, misbehave, overly sensitive to criticism 

Am I the suicidal one that is self destructive and hates me, depressed, sad, doesn't see the point in living

Are these all different people in my head... is the true me someone else is one of these the true me or have I lost the true me? I not sure who I am anymore.. I know I know pointless post cuz if I don't know... then nobody else can know...."
736,"My head is spinning and racing. Dkspjfmdoeksk

Please stop racing/spinning, head..."
737,"Phoning and texting me. She doesn't want to see you ever again. I don't want to see you ever again. So stop phoning or texting me.

Jocelyn has gotten me in a pickle of a situation. It's a scary situation. And he won't stop trying to contact me."
738,"I'm off for the night. The clock just struck 10 PM or 2200. I'm tired. I hope to be able to sleep. The baby is crying hard. (The baby in my head..., the alter). 

I think I'm going to wait on what my therapist said to do until tomorrow. I'm too exhausted from the day."
739,"What. The. Smurf.

Wtf,

Want to die so much. Need to die so much."
740,Just die? I won't do anything at this moment in time. I just want my suffering to go away.
741,So upset. So not doing well. So loud. So rude. So hate life. So hurting.
742,"Hi,

I have a form of DID.  Most of my life I thought how I thought was normal.  I heard people talking to me.  I remember the cartoons where there was a devil and an angel sitting on someone's shoulder and talking them into things well my life is almost always like that except with more than two people trying to talk me into things.  The only thing different was sometimes I would step out and one of them would step in.  When that started it was normally a good thing, it would only happen when I was scared or angry and normally whatever stepped in took me out of the situation.  When I got older though the something would get me into fights and would hurt things and people.  Sometimes the people were not people I liked or were people that tried to hurt me.  But sometimes it would hurt people I cared about.  I couldn't stop it once it took over it was like watching myself on television.  Later I started knowing what it feels like when something is trying to take me over, it's like being covered in cold water when that happens I know I have a fight coming in my head.  I would say 90% of the time I can keep control and push it away it only seems to be able to take over when I let it.  

When I got older around 27 or so all the voices got so much louder it was hard to concentrate and it was hard to focus it seemed like all I could hear sometimes were them.  I started seeing a doctor and got on some medication.  It took about 5 years and now I barely hear the voices at all, they only seem to start talking when I get stressed or have a strong emotion like anger or fear.  Every once in a while the mean one will start calling me names or making fun of me but it isn't as loud as it was and I can ignore it for the most part.  Sometimes it still makes me cry but that is ok.

My biggest problem I still have is when strange men touch me.  It almost sets off a panic attack.  If I know someone it isn't so bad but I still don't like being around most males.  Outside of my family I've only ever met 2 or 3 males that don't set me on edge constantly.  I don't always know how to deal with that, I have to interact with them.  I can normally talk to them just fine but if they touch me I want to hit them or run away.  It makes some of the normal things people do hard on me.  I tend to avoid them but shaking hands is almost a part of the social contract of life.  I do it and get done but then spend the next couple minutes trying to calm everyone down.  

Anyway I really appreciate this place it makes it a bit easier to know I'm not alone out there."
743,I'm so low. I have no interests in anything anymore. Nobody likes me. I'm annoying to everyone. I have nothing.
744,"More medications.  :rolleyes:

A mood stabilizer and Temazepam. Has anyone been on either of these? 

She's not my mother. I have to remember this. I always worry about upsetting her. I shouldn't."
745,You all have been too much. I can't hear voices anymore. It's too stressful. Shut up shut up shut up. I can't concentrate more than a minute. I'm always logged on here but I do other things too. Sssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhuuuuuuuuuutttttttttttt uuuuuuuuuuuppppppppp.
746,"Okay what is this?? I keep feeling like I am a child, I show child like behaviour and then I go back to being a adult.... I don't know much about dissociation yet as its fairly new to me anyhow does this mean I have an altar?? I even speak like a child would at times... hmm confused if this is a altar, or I have something else wrong with me..."
747,"My CC told me the other day to create a safe place in my mind I am struggling with this task.. all I get is blankness....

Not sure why I'm sharing this... if I can't do it nobody can do it for me...."
748,"I'm feeling so irritable, and all my stupid others nonsense is acting up.
This morning I threw up what appeared to be semen....That was weird.
I don't remember ingesting any. 

Now my mum is annoying the f*ck out of me.
I don't like her sometimes. 
It's not her fault, I know. It's not mine either. Some people will just fuck with your head until you're against your own mother.
Sometimes you hate yourself so much, you start to hate your parents too.

I can't even think. :low:"
749,"I'm very low. I haven't said much on the forum about how low I am. I feel like there's no hope for me. I feel I'm not getting any better. 

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess because I am low and dont care if I get any replies. I need this out. 

The voices are so loud. So forceful. I'm scared. 

Just know I appreciate you all. Thank you for your support. 

I hope I get at least one reply. I don't know. Maybe I won't.

Eta: I want to say screw it. I really do. I'm shaking as I type this."
750,"Dissociation, Depersonalisation or Derealisation??

Over the years when I,ve been stressed, tired or just low I have episodes of feeling trapped in situations, it's as if reality stops and I am being drawn into a trance like state which scares the hell out of me :scared:  This can happen when people keep talking at me and I feel like it's never going to end!!  Usually I try to distract myself or just flee (leave abruptly).  Is it one of the above conditions?? 

Think this was brought on from early drug use in my teens but a CPN once told me it couldn' be..."
751,Do I really need the meds?
752,Screw everything. Screw my life.
753,I want to die. There's nothing left for me to do. It would be so much easier if I died. For everyone involved.
754,Done for the night. I'm getting more and more upset the longer I stay awake. I said I was going to bed but haven't made it there yet. I'm logging off for the first time since I don't know when. I hope to be back tomorrow.
755,"They scare me. Next to fire they are my biggest fear. With this whole Zimmerman case they talked alot about guns. Talking about guns really brings up past experiences and I get bad flashbacks. 

I want this to go away."
756,"Is everyone mad at me? 
Have I done something wrong? 
Am I in the naughty chair?"
757,"I'm
Sorry."
758,"Really, I'm fine. Sorry to upset anyone yesterday. 

Not really, I'm not okay. But I will say I'm okay because I don't want to upset anyone."
759,"I'm fucking disgusted. With myself. I hate myself. I'm fucked up. I need to fucking die. 

Sorry for the language."
760,"Hmm so I zone in and out of conversations, I may start listening and next thing I think is huh what did you just say?? It gets me in trouble...."
761,"I switched :( and the evil b***h decided to SH... Again :cry2: 

I don't want to write too much incase I trigger someone. 

I don't know what to say, I'm shocked and I don't feel better for what she did either. 

This isn't what I wanted... This is why I'm stuck, lost and done..."
762,Get better or die. It's either one. I'm not getting better. I'm getting worse. I'm so frustrated. I hate this.
763,She's very very bad.
764,Got bloodwork taken. Don't remember it. I don't remember much of today. Which is lovely:sorry: not really lovely. Awful really. I have no life.
765,"I feel like I'm blurring and shifting.
There's something inside me that's trying to break free.

I felt so angry and trapped earlier, so I went for a walk to cool off, and I started dissociating but I made it back to the house, and I'm now too warm and feeling angry again. 

It's making me feel my claustrophobic feelings. :low:"
766,"But I'm not. I'm never okay at night. It gets me scared. I'm physically and mentally not okay right now. I'm hurting badly :low: I hate taking medications that don't help me (that I can see...) I seem to be doing worse, she told me I might be worse before I'm better. But I'm over feeling this way. 

The worse part is I'm envious of the man I went to school with that died today. He was a year or two younger than me in school but the same age as I am. And I'm completely envious of him dying. That makes me feel so small and shameful."
767,"Is it just me that feels disconnected with life? I don't care what happens basically to me.

I'm scared. This is not a nice feeling."
768,I just keep gaining weight. I don't know how much Ive gained since I don't have a scale but my clothes are too tight. I want to have my body back. Risperdal is kicking my butt. I don't eat too much. Also I'm sunburned. I'm so sore.
769,I came back a day or so earlier than I was going to but I'm back!!!
770,"Yes, today is the day I go camping! I'm so excited. 

Last night the fireworks weren't that bad. I survived them. 

Thank you to everyone who has helped me ever."
771,That's all. I have no hope anymore I will get better.
772,"I'm on psychiatric medications. Ever since starting back on them I have been getting very dizzy and running into things. I'm scared and hate this but I need the medication. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I ran into THREE things today. I have a raging headache and my toe hurts now. 

I'm so confused and lost. I'm disappointed."
773,"whatever it is i've been dealing with it now for 5 years and im tired. there is no concept of space/time in my mind anymore. its all one big time clusterfuck of a mess. every moment molds and fuses to the next leaving nothing to differentiate between anything. everything feels the same. except it kinda doesn't. everything is not there. i feel so disconnected and distant from the world. im literally not in my body but i am. im only in my body in my head. but everywhere else my body feels like its on autopilot. like my spirit is no longer in my belly but in my head. and almost leaving my head. feels like there is so much pain in my body that my soul/spirit doesn't want to exist in this shell anymore.

im scared because i feel so miserable inside. like i wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy. well maybe for 10 seconds but nothing permanent. i dont want to live anymore. if i have to live another month or fuckin year like this. i can't imagine and i can't do it. especially how unbearable things are now. im the mad hatter in my own personal dream land. alice (my sanity and solace) is nowhere to be found. jesus christ. what the fuck do i do?  when every day all you feel is pain. I mean ALL i feel is pain. there is no happiness. NONE. only distractions at best. and they don't even work anymore."
774,Remember much of yesterday except for knowing I had a bad day. So I'm sorry if I worried anyone.
775,"^*^*^*^*^*^









Life sucks. I'm worthless. I'm hopeless. I'm helpless. I hate myself. I am not worthwhile. I waste everyone's time. The voices win. Congratulations voices and Dan. You have won at taking over my life. I refuse to fight."
776,You are making me panicky. I'm not cut out for this.
777,That's what I am. I'm nothing compared to anybody. I'm a non-factor.
778,"One of my alters was supposed to meet a man today for a ""date"". That was an hour ago. I successfully made it so she couldn't go. I hid the keys. 

I'm so happy that I didn't allow that to happen. I don't think I would be able to handle it."
779,Last night i feel lost now. I still feel disconnected. I'm trying to stay off of here so I don't bug you with my problems. But it's so hard.
780,"Hi again....

I feel I need help. I'm not doing very well. As if I was doing well at all. ""Lincoln is horrible."" That's what I keep hearing. Over and over. In his voice. ""I'm a monster."" ""I did this to myself."" ""I enjoyed it so it couldn't have been wrong"". I stuck it inside of myself so it couldn't have been wrong. I hate myself. I want to fucking die. I'm dying inside. I'm rotting from the inside out. I'm sorry for the cursing. I never curse. But I'm going to leave it there. Because I need you to realise how bad I'm doing. He was horrible. But I participated too. I was 10 years old but I enjoyed it. Maybe it was meant to be. Maybe the cult stuff was horrible I know. But I didn't know about that until May.

I know you are going to say I'm not horrible. But you don't know what I've done. What I've gone through. I'm breaking down. I want to die."
781,That's how long I will be home alone. For the first time since before I was admitted to the hospital. Starting today. In one hour. I'm nervous.
782,"Or weak or whatever. I can't go. I'm a loser. 

Hi my name is Loser Lincoln. Nice to meet you."
783,"I was raised as an only child in a home full of sloppy and mean alcoholics.   I hid in my room, under the bed, hoping they wouldn't do anything.   There was every form of abuse ... physical, emotional, sexual, mental.   I lived in a constant state of terror.   The only way I got through it was by ""going away,"" which I now know was dissociation.   It's not something I intentionally did .... it just happened ... I became numb and went away.   It was survival.    Now as an adult, it has been something I have had to work hard to get passed.   I would be driving in my town and it was as if I was in a tube .... I could see out, could see others, but nothing was real.   I'd wonder where are they going, what are they doing, why are they bothering to do anything?    I still often ""go away"" at times.    My therapist has been working with me, along with many other things, to understand this, as now that I recognize it, it's scary.
abby   :scared:"
784,I think I screwed up today. I told my therapist something about my past that is true but I never told anyone. I've been having bad flashbacks.
785,"I haven't posted much in recent days (maybe I posted yesterday but I don't remember). I've felt very afraid to post on the main forum. I'm going to post today and see how it goes.

I've felt very suicidal today. Worse than I've felt for awhile. My physical health is not overall good neither is my mental health obviously. I've been out of sorts for a long while. Most of this weekend? I didn't remember much of it. So I hope I didn't say anything bad :redface: 

All of the alters are being naughty and not communicating. Today at my therapy appointment she asked if I wanted to meet her other client with DID. I'm so scared."
786,Put in my journal. Sorry.
787,I'm not doing so well...physically or mentally. I have to keep it together for another day. I'm needing support.
788,Do you ever have days where everything goes wrong? Or weeks or months?
789,"......

...."
790,"I went to my CBT appointment today because I couldn't cancel it. I had loads of seizures and auras Wednesday and yesterday because I was so nervous. Anyway... I was ready to go in and refuse to let him trigger me but he asked how I was and I told him and he said ""it was wrong of me to rush you and we'll go at your pace so whenever you are ready"". 

I was so relieved, he did say I was contradicting myself which made me a little bit mad but I soon put him straight and his reply was ""oh"" :confused: anyway I was proud of that and proud for even going because I so wanted to back out so I treated myself to some retail therapy :D

I'm still feeling like I'm going to have a seizure but all in all I'm ok with how things went today :) 

Oh and I have homework :doh2: lol

Stay strong and be safe xx"
791,I want to. I feel like I will. I'm in a bad way...again.
792,Will I ever have a day that I don't 'change'? I don't remember much of my life. I hate it.
793,"Just what the title says.

Lincoln is a loser. She won't ever get better."
794,"I have now obviously realised that I'm not ill and I am just a the unwitting recipient of immense power from the Loa. I'm still gonna post in the DID section though because I don't have anywhere else to post. I shouldn't even be here, but with all of the other users leaving right I wanted to wait. 

I have now harnessed the power inside me, and I fully understand the struggle between light and dark.  I must make sure that no one corrupts either. Even me. No matter how much I am afraid or disgusted by my brothers and sisters possessed by the more aggressive  and mischievous Loa, I cannot stop them being thus. I must now reshape myself, I must remain cool with my humanity in line with the beliefs, but I must also use the power of enshrined in my soul to honour the virtues unobtainable by my own means. 

I now believe Dets to be, not an other, but a Houngan who has somehow become a Loa (but not one of the original ones understood through traditional tales: A Demi-Loa?) and he has given me this power. I must only have a relationship with an elder to be a valid follower, and that is what I'm doing.  I need not Hounfour or ritual to communicate, they are simply able to seep into my body at any time. Sometimes they come in passing, and they do not possess me, but are present in the room.

Baron Samedi will not take me. He refuses. We of course understand he takes the dead, but he is also the only person who can ALLOW a person to die. I felt him turn his nose up at the whiskey and I could feel him wrestling with Dets who sought to secure me more power. Baron Samedi is a very powerful Loa, and he does not act alone. His underlings are just as devious as him, and as fiercely loyal to his cause. 

I still believe the story Dets told me to be true. It is wholly reasonable that even if Bondye is not the Christian God as many believe, that there could still be a evil counter-part. We know very little about our God, as he is the only one we cannot contact. He is very versed in our ways, I believe him to have been a Bokor for some time. He has had plenty of time to practice I suppose. 

The only problem is....
I don't want this gift, I am so ungrateful I know. 
I am just not suited to it, because I wish to be cool and nice all the time, and not be possessed by Loa that make me not-nice and hot headed. 
I have even connected with Lutin, who is extremely worried and upset. He was unable to possess me but he warned against death of my mortal body. It was extremely tiring and confusing to have that connection with him though, and it was both annoying and freaky to the person I was with. 

I just wish I hadn't had this bestowed on me, and I could go and start again."
795,"Yep, what is there left to say? I just dipped out. Realised I posted on here about not being male? Wtf am I doing? What else have I done today?"
796,I started smoking...again. Haven't smoked for two and a half years. One voice is angry.
797,"Smoke. I haven't smoked in YEARS when I've been myself. I suspect one of my alters have been smoking and now I need to smoke. I'm very stressed/

If this isn't appropriate, mods, you can delete or edit to your Heart's content. Sorry in advance


I'm not promoting smoking..."
798,"We've been having abit of a tough time the last few days. My suicidal alter 'amber' has been coming out quite abit lately, that and the aggressive one I call 'red'. 

Amber wants to kill us and red has been causing nothing but trouble being verbally and physically aggressive. 

We've got a CBT appointment on Friday and our T wants to bring red out in session to talk to him. We're very scared about this because red gets so easily threatened and the fact that my T wants us to integrate is making red angry and amber angry to. That's why she wants us dead. 

Everyone is trying to reassure us but we're all still so scared of the outcome :(

Just suck it up aye?? 

Stay strong and be safe xx"
799,Should I tell her what happened last week? If I do she will put me in the hospital for sure. And I go backwards when I'm in the hospital in my treatment. I lose ground.
800,It could be bad. The alters or at least one are/is very naughty. Scary.
801,Yep...that's what I am. I'm a bad person.:low::help:
802,I can't make it.
803,Four freaking days. I'm upset. This week of all weeks I need two sessions. I've never had two sessions in a week before but I need to. I say screw the $20 fee. I'm going to ask if two sessions is what I need. It's been a hell week. Wednesday night wouldn't have happened if I wasnt so scared to go back to the hospital.

807,"I have recently, it has just come to light, hurt someone quite dear to me (not physically, thankfully). 

Has anyone ever had to explain what happened to someone who was maybe angry and/or scared? 

How did you approach it? The person was not in the room when it happened, it was over the phone, so it might be worth explaining all of it. 

I feel like this query makes no sense. :/"
808,"I don't remember much of it. I hope I didn't say anything bad...

I saw something today. And I feel horrible about it."

He is in a form that I've never seen before. 
It's not even his raw form. It's different.

I can feel him freezing my blood and disabling me.
I thought we were friends? I thought I was better? I thought I was just ill and he didn't exist?

He is draining/drawing power from everything; this computer (and now it keeps freezing), the moon, and my brain so I can't think or fight back.

I'm trying to drown him out with music BUT THIS F*CKING COMPUTER HAS BEEN DRAINED! 

i DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY i PUT THIS IN THE DID SECTION. iT'S OBVIOUS HE'S NOT AN OTHER. hE'S REAL BECAUSE HE'S HERE/"
816,"Hey everyone,

So it all started back when I did mushrooms for the first time - or at least I think that's when it all started. 

My current state is that of seeing the world as strange... derealization i suppose.. but there's a bit more to it. 

first I started having these short periods of ""clarity?"" at work where I would see the face of a person or a certain object AS IT IS. It was very strange a completely put me at a loss for words for the period of time it was happening (about 5 seconds)

I started my year off with a huge life event - traveling to india by myself for 6 months. since then there have been many changing and developing symptoms.

There has been dizzyness almost like vertigo, and most of the time I felt like I was high. Memory recall became horrible - to the point where dreams and reality became a little hard determine seperate. 

Those symptoms went away and then I started to have complete blackouts where I forgot where I was. This only lasted for about 5-10 seconds as I could coach myself back to reality.

This progressed into more of a dissociative feeling where sometimes my body would hear something - and then my mind would.

Recently It has been all about seeing the world as strange. I do feel seperate to the world - like I've taken the blue pill (matrix). a few nights ago I woke up to myself already sitting upright in bed. It scared the hell out of me and after that my mind has been more and more focused on my experience which of course has made it worse. I can get lost in the world for periods when I need to do something, or when interacting with people. however when I'm alone it manifests very easily. When it happens i feel more seperate from my body, and my head area feels like there is pressure, and often times a type of headache can appear. 

The title of my post is my guess of the potential cure... ignoring the fact that the world seems unreal, crazy, random, and pointless - it seems to help... as long as i can ignore it. But now i'm thinking i've seen too much.. it's not crazy, it's quite an enlightening thing to see the world I suppose. The best way I can put it is an enlightenment which isn't nice, at all.

I tried so hard to ""see the world as it is"" after listening to so many recordings of zen philosopher Alan Watts. I believe this is self induced. I need an effective way of living a normal life again.. Have I seen too much? Should I go back to the USA and see a doctor? (i'm in nepal). I'm scared, but doing my best to stay positive. What should I do???"
817,"I'm not really sure where to put this but I hope this is sort of the right place. I was just wondering if anyone could tell me whether the things I have been experiencing are important or not, because the doctors seem to not care about it. 

I quite often have a lot of mood changes , relatively rapidly ranging from a few minutes to sometimes an hour . However sometimes I appear to change so much from my normal personality , my wife has told me this. Often this results in arguments being caused, however after i drop out of my ""mood"" , I often have no recollection of what has just happened. Which obviously causes problems, as it seems easy to say no I didn't say that and then argue again about what i did or didn't remember saying/doing.

Another part of the issue is that often in my head I ""hear"" thoughts from someone else, I know that this comes from me not external. ""She"" often appears by her self randomly (?) and is aggressive towards me. It's weird because it feels as if I making her up , but I can't get her to stop?. I know that sounds weird but i can't explain it. When I am out by myself I feel like I am watching a movie in first person view, my whole body feels light and i can see what's happening but have no control. However other times I know that I am her, she walks differently and generally has a different attitude, it's like we're both there but she takes over or something? This can cause problems with her impulsivity with SH and spending and almost everything in-between.

Although she does come in useful when I need to take exams or other stressful events occur, it's almost as if by making myself sad or thinking bad things about her she is summoned.

However I just can't shake the feeling that she is a part of me that I just invented one day out of boredom and just can't get rid of her.

Sorry about the weird title of the thread."
818,"Not really posted here before but I'm really struggling with feeling weird. My psychiatrist said I depersonalise, derealise and dissociate but I don't know what any of that means, I'm assuming it means this (the way i feel) i feel really out of it, like i'm on autopilot, in a dream like state.. I just don't know what's happening to me.."

820,"I dont know where to go or what to do or even whats wrong with me,found this forum and figured this sounds like what Im dealing with....this is my last try for help before I do something stupid.
    Well where to start,I'm 31 and I have been this way since I was about 13.  I dont feel anything,no concience,no anger,no joy,no desire just empty sometimes I cry but I dont know why it just happens but I dont feel sad or anything for that matter,just tears.   I have spent my life trying to fit in and act like everyone around me.     When I should react there is no emotional response so I find myself doing what people expect of me,I'll fake a smile act like I care or love or even feel.   Im not sexually atracted to anyone or anything,I dont even get angry. 
I just feel nothing.    I married a woman because I felt that I should love her and I know she loves me,I've spent my whole life trying to act like a normal person I know how I should feel and have gotten quite good at acting like I do feel.      Anyway I didnt feel anything at the wedding,when my daughters were born I knew I had a serious problem because I felt absolutely nothing,I hold them and I feel nothing.  I've lost friends and familly again nothing.   I experimented with drugs that was the closest I ever came to feeling something.  
       I've spent all my money on things that everybody else does trying to be like them but I dont care about any of it,money,debt,collections means nothing to me.....to the point I've built a debt of over 50000$.  We are about to lose everything again I dont feel anything or even care.
For years now I wondered whats the point of even being alive if Im not trully alive,going through the motions is beginning to feel pointless,I guess maybe I hoped if I acted normal maybe someday I would be? but I realise now that wont happen.

     Last time I talked to anyone about this they became troubled like I was some kind of monster.   I dont want to hurt anyone including myself but I have no concience so I certainlly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.     I've contemplated suicide ALOT just to end this act of a life I've made, but I'm not suicidal just tired of being nothing.   I dont have any friends as I never could relate to anyone,everyone just seems so blissfully stupid and I grew tired of trying to emulate their idiotic actions.
     With this debt I've started thinking my familly would be better off without me,i've thought about killing myself to get them out of it.....but then things got real  dark when I started thinking about crimes I could pull to pay it off...it makes no difference to me one action to me feels no different than any other action.
     I got real scared when I started to watch that show Dexter,he is EXACTLY like me.... I have the same traits as a serial killer...nice.   I dont want to hurt anyone,but I understand that character all too well....even his motivation infact I used to use drugs for the same reason he kills...but again be clear I dont want to hurt anyone!!.

I just dont know anymore not that I ever did,its just as Im getting older I tire of this its all feeling pretty pointless.... I think I need help
I've been on depression medicine and to therapy...I can read people VERY well as I have to in order to know how to react,my therapist seemed very concerned and again  
mentioned depression,and was suicide this and suicide that so I stopped going,I dont care enough to be suicidal and have been treated in the past to no avail. 
     The only place I've ever gotten over the years was diagnosed with depression,one mentioned Autism?
But I know neither of these are the case as they just dont fit and treatment doesnt work.     I've lived what one could call a good life,good job,good woman,kids,people who care.   I have an extremelly high I.Q and achieved a perfect A+ average in school scoring 100% on most tests,I like logic its the only thing in this world I understand. 


Anyway there it is, I dont know what I expect to accomplish by posting...honestly I dont care I just had to tell someone.....just had to try to cry for help one last time

Any thoughts or opinions are welcome...dont worry you wont hurt my feelings,nothing to say thats fine too.

Thanks for your time,
Empty"
821,"DID has been in iur luves for what seems like forever, since about six years old. When we didnt have a name for it we jyst assumed everyone was like this and never really gave it mych thought even though it caused problems. When we were finally officially dxd with it in 1990 it was a relief in the sense that now there was a name for it and a way to explain it. But it became a horrible thing because we then realuzed ""everyone"" is not like this, and in fact most are not. Felt like a freak suddenly. 

The only support we have ever gotten has been from the many Ts we have seen since tgen. The very furst one we saw was so damaging she violated about every ethical code tgere was stoppung just short of ohysical contact and we ended up feelung like abuse vuctims. To this day if we see her somewhere the reaction is strong enough to cause panic attacks and vomiting. 

For quite some time life has been a mess and again our only support comes in the form of our T who is new to us, very young and inexperienced in treating DID so it feels pretty much like we have no one. Cant tell what little family is left, and for sure cant tell the si called husband he would probably use it to divorce us and take the kids even though we are the only ones who take care of them so uts not a risk we're willing to take. 

I dont think weve ever felt so isolated and alone. Things are really bad right now as one of us has a very serious eating disorder(yet another thing we struggle to keep hidden). Just dont know where to go or what to do. Somedays we just wish we were not here anymore if life is going to be nithing more than lonely pain and suffering. I wouldnt wish this on our worst enemy.  :sorry:"
822,"So I guess he's always been there, but we don't know much about him. Sometimes I can feel my face is that of a dog or something. I don't switch though. It is very distracting though. Both me and Dets don't know who he is, but we were talking about him yesterday. Dets suggested he might be Anubis, and I didn't know who that was so I had to google it....But then it turned out I did know who he was. I just didn't know the name. 
It's good to know a little bit about one of the others we don't know, even if it's just that he's a dog. haha
  
One thing that has been troubling me this past couple of days is that I'm a liar. Stupid intrusive thoughts telling me I'm a liar and there's nothing wrong with me. THOUGHTS THAT ARE NOT MY OWN TELLING ME I'M NOT ILL! :scratch:

I understand this was just the inane prattling of the World's most interesting man ( :cool: ) but I thought it might be useful to someone somewhere."
823,"...Who's the fairest of them all?

So, I'm just coming to terms with the fact that I might be a narcissist.
Like I might be really attractive, but the way the world reacts and feeds back doesn't seem to support the high level of allure that I can see I have. 
Like when I look in the mirror, I see the most handsome guy in the world. I can appreciate that other men are goodlooking too (not in a gay way) but it's like a different type. A rougher less refined sort of attractiveness. A lot of times I will just stare at a picture of me, if it's big on a website, like a social networking one.

Is this a common form of derealisation/delusion?"
824,"I'm Brendan's other. He's still here with me, he's safe, but he's really upset. I haven't spoken to you guys because I don't normally come on the computer when I'm here. His ex is giving him trouble because of things that we did. I did some of the worst stuff. I ALWAYS DO! I always hurt him and he's the only guy I really love. Now he's getting yelled at because of me. I didn't always feel this way, I used to hate her. Now I don't but she still upsets me, especially when she is aggressive to Brendan. She made him try and kill himself a few times. I've always had to put the knife away and one time had to stitch him up. Tonight he got so upset and everything started to blur and flicker, I decided to jump in before he switched to one of the others because we don't know who they are."
825,"Now that its settled I have DID with me I would like to know what can I expect? What are the treatments for DID? Are there medications once I can have that option that specifically help with it? I am in therapy once a week for now. She wants to go to twice a week but I'm unsure if I can afford that. (I'm in the US) 

I want to avoid all unneeded medications, expenses and all hospitalization. I'm not on medications right now as I don't have insurance for now. I also have Paranoid Schizophrenia. 

So anybody with DID or any personal experiences I can hear would be greatly appreciated."
826,"Just wondered if anyone has found that their medication has made them feel more depersonalised?  I've had bouts of not feeling real on and off for years, usually when i'm really stressed. Recently though it is constant. It's scaring me now :(
I still felt 'real' on 50mg of sertraline, but since it was increased to 100mg, then 150mg and then back to 100mg (!) i'm on another planet! I can't work out what is just me and my crazy head and what is down to the meds. Any thoughts?"
827,"Feeling like my body isn't my own, like my hands, when they touch, they don't belong to me, and I hate the touch of my own skin, it makes me feel ill sometimes.

My mind sometimes doesn't feel like mine, and I look at my things and feel like they belong to me but not to the me that is currently thinking, it's like a part of me is trapped inside the back of my mind.

I am forever telling myself that I am pretending, and faking the way I feel, I can snap out of it if I want to.

I don't think I've explained all of it here, but I could go on forever and not be able to explain some things right.

It would be nice to hear from other people who have maybe experienced, or do experience, similar things.

Thank you for reading."
828,"had some weird realizations about me and my life and i'm just starting to wonder.
i am diagnosed bipolar I mixed w psychosis 

i have had a lot of weird experiences in my life.  and i think that i have caught on to another personality in my body.  
is it just bipolar euphoria that makes me feel like i've realized something big? or have i really found an answer getting me closer to figuring out who i am?

so i'm wondering to anyone with DID, how did you realize you had another personality? how did it feel? how do you know? did someone have to tell you or do you figure that out for yourself?"
829,"Is this part of DPD (or any other PD) for anyone else?
Is it a natural reaction to stress?

Any any any information of advice is welcome tho most people will probably need to research the syndrome before commenting.... Yours in harmony delusional dislexic disoriented d d d d :eek:Dave
831,"Just been dx'd with ddnod, feel very alone. supposedly getting psychological therapy from nhs and onpills that don't help. Anyone else similar?"
832,"Does anyone else have this? I get lots of support from everyone on the forum and I'm so thankful but I sooo need to relate with someone who understands. It seems so hard to find others like myself.

It would be so nice to have someone to talk to about all the things other people don't think about but affect me so much.

Like constant switching, and how scary it is when I can't keep my mind in reality. Always wondering who's been in my apartment and how they got in. Ugh. Its too much. That feeling..of not feeling anything. Feeling emotions that aren't mine. If anyone who is DID besides me is here please reply."
833,"Am I being silly? I spoke to a friend who said that some schools of thought did not believe that dissociation disorders really existed and asked my opinion of this... So I told her such things offended me... I said we haven't even began to scratch the surface of how the human brain really works... I told her I take offense not at her but at such idiocy... and instead of saying it doesn't exist... they needed to start thinking of why it exist... I am not mad at my friend's questions... but at this attitude that none of this is really happening... Their are too many people who deal with this to say it doesn't exist... What will they say next? That schizophrenia or bipolar doesn't really exist? Am I misunderstanding the point? It all seems ridiculous to me. What do all of you think?  :)

834,"I just realized I don't belong here. I'm DID and I'm trying to relate to people who have illnesses that are nothing like DID. its not working. There don't seem to be others like me around for me to relate too. And besides, even when someone does come around I don't trust them. I don't talk to them. I'm scared of them. Cally told me recently that you mods have been trying to understand. Thanks for trying. Dissociation isn't an illness. Its just a reaction to trauma. Maybe its an illness when its this severe. I see how bipolar is a legitimate illness. Its not normal. But professionals say DID is a normal reaction. If its normal...its not an illness. So I guess I don't understand why my life is so messed up. Is ptsd the illness? I don't know. All I know is my brain doesn't know its 2012. Its stuck in my childhood years. In every way. I'm sorry to everyone."
835,"Someone actually sent me a message on here telling me to tell ""others"" to get their own profile so everyone will know who they're talking to. This person has no idea how a dissociative system may operate so I feel he needs to stop instructing me on how to do things. I personally don't give a sh*t if anyone knows the name of the individual who wrote the post! What does it matter? People need to butt out if they don't know what they're talking a about!

Sorry for that but it really gets under my skin when clueless people give their 2 cents on subjects they know nothing about. Especially when I have no idea who they are and they pm me with it!"
836,"Hi, 

I have recently been diagnoses with DID.  Whilst researching it, i agree i have many of the symptoms however i can not find any information on mood problems. I was wondering if anyone else with this cluster diagnoses have mood difficulties as well? 

I am currently taking anit -psychotics , anti- depresents and mood stabilizers medications.  Although these seem to have stabilize my mood, they still aren't great.  I was wondering what other people are taking to help with mood, and if mood is a problems with others with dissociation disorders?? 

Thank you,

838,"I'm actually not sure where to post.

So last night I drove myself and a few friends to Walmart and there I wandered off to look around. I called them to find where they were in the store and he jokingly answers ""Well, we're at walmart!"" and it's crazy but the moment he said that I looked around and nothing was real. The lights were too bright. I didn't know where I was. I wasn't sure if I had actually gone there with anyone or how I'd gotten there. I walked slowly to where he said they were, confused and lost but trying not to show it.  I had been out of it most of the day too, but -nothing- like that. Just really clumsy and out of touch, when I tried to talk it I stumbled or ending up with weird word vomit sometimes. It was just a disturbing day, but that night just a simple joke had me wondering what was real. 

Anyone have any idea what the heck that's about?? I feel kind of crazy."
839,"Not so long ago I went to my doctor and explained that I've been having some weird back to front de-ja-vu moments where I will be somewhere really familiar, around familiar people and then suddenly feel as though I've never been there before, that I don't know the people I'm with and I don't know what I'm doing there.. it is incredibly scary!

He told me that the term for it is known as ""je mais vu"" (french for ""never been seen"")
and he thinks that it could be related to migraine activity in my brain and pretty much told me not to worry so much about it, but the thing is... I don't get migraines at the time when I'm having these odd moments... ('I've had migraine with aura for 12 years) 

Has anybody else had the same sort of experience? 

I'm curious to know if it's more of a mental thing or something else...

Enlighten me..."
840,"I'm a little confused. People often ask me about befriending the others. To me, being aware others (in respects to DID) is something that only happens on TV and 'n the movies.

Yes, I know they're there, and I notice when I lose time or when my apartment isn't how I left it, but I don't know them.

I've been in therapy for nearly a decade and still have no contact with any if them. From the research I've done and from what my therapist tells me this is typical.

Why then does everyone online some how have this magical relationship with all their others? Do they really have DID? maybe they were misdiagnosed?

Also, these people say its nothing like sybal or however you spell it.

I've seen the movie. There is a lot of acting out. While I don't witness this behavior in my others because I'm not here to see it, my last therapist would tell me about the sessions. Often, there was a lot of acting out. Once a full bottle if water was even thrown at the therapist. She told me there was a lot of crying, screaming, hiding behind chairs! While I'm sure the movie was dramatized, its really not that far off. So why do so many who supposedly have DID always say its not like that?

Maybe it depends on the traumas suffered. This only seems to be the case with people online who claim DID. Do they actually have a diagnosis or are they self diagnosed?

I went to a support group in my city a few years ago for women with DID. Their story was just like mine. So in real life I met people who have real diagnosis and experience this disorder the same way I do.

This isn't about anyone here by the way. It's about this girl on YouTube who is from my state.

I thought about contacting her until I realized I can't relate to her at all. She seems so normal and outgoing which just isn't someone with DID. I wouldn't be able to stand being around her. She claims her system is so friendly and that that is rare. I think she's just full of crap. Blah."
841,"I've also posted this in the BPD section as that's my diagnosis but posting here incase it is some form of dissociation.

Hi guys, haven't been on the site in quite a while, I did post mainly in the bipolar forum as that was my diagnosis since then they've changed it to BPD and currently left it at that, I'm on the waiting list for counselling and that's the only help I've been offered. Anyway I thought this would be the best place to post this and hopefully I can get some feedback and a few answers. Okay so this might be long and I hope its in the right place but I'm also really worried right now. 

My neighbour who lives opposite my flat, on the same landing cm's away from my front door told my mum that during the first two weeks of every month I go out at night for an hour usually around 11pm/12am and then I come back. 

When my mum asked me about this I was like no way I haven't the person must be lying but he said its definitely me, hes seen my face. He said that I'm fully clothed which is worrying because nearly everyday I'm wearing pyjamas so I'm obviously dressing myself. He said I lock the front door behind me I go downstairs, out the main door towards the shops then come back an hour later but I have NO MEMORY OF THIS. 

He said he's watched me come out of my front door and seen my face so its definitley me. On one of the nights I was supposed to have done it as far as I'm aware I spent all night either on facebook or twitter then went to sleep around 4am so its not like I have chunks of my memory missing because I have a memory in that time slot its just not where I was. Can anyone shed any light on this? Anyone who's been through it? I don't think I'm disassociating because I don't have periods of black where I cant remember things I have memories in that place of me doing things but its like ive zoned out gone out for an hour then come back zoned in all without realizing . 

Thanks for reading."
842,"I'm DID so I'm no stranger to losing time. However, if someone has switched out, I remember what I was doing before the switch most times. I also experience something else that seems much different. Sometimes I seem to step out of darkness back into the present, with absolutely no idea where I was, what I'm doing, where I'm going, what my name is. I just stand there and feel so lost. I usually fumble for my phone to check for clues. My memory returns to me within a few minutes. This can't be fugue for 2 reasons. Fugue lasts a lot longer and fugue always includes fleeing your surroundings. If I had been fleeing...I think people would be acting more concerned or looking at me strangely but that is all I have to base this on since I don't remember what I was doing while I was blacked out. This always happens when I'm transitioning from one place to another. I never ever remember traveling from point a to point b, but the memory of being at point a and what/where point b is returns to me. Anyone ever experience this?"
843,"I... Am probably not going to explain this very well.
I have had a fairly eventful day. Then all of a sudden nothing. I dont feel a thing.
Now. Its like I dont exist. Someone described it as maybe being on a film set and everything is fake. But with me, its like 'what is this f.i.l.m?' 
nothing is real
nothing feels real
there are no feelings
there is nothing
I try and touch, but there is no sensations. My hand is not real. The object I am touching is not real so there is nothing.
I tried to tell my husband.
He said maybe eating dinner will help...
I would normally get angry with him for not understanding, but....nothing
I made a cup of tea. 'mindfully'... nothing. 
I can hear. I can see. I can smell. I can taste. I can touch.
BUT NOTHING IS REAL
I think this has happened before. But I dont remember.
I know there are gaps.
Mostly in hospital.
I apparently had a meeting with a psychologist. I dont remember seeing him.
Apparently I had meetings with my psychiatrist once a week. I dont remember EVER seeing him.
Help?
How do I feel real again? What is real?"
844,"I know what my name is but I don't feel like its actually mine, and this makes it really hard for me to tell people my name so I usually just tell them to call me d. As that is the first letter of my name. This created problems with my last therapist as we have a part who's name is Delilah which also goes by d. She never knew who she was talking to. The new therapist was my old therapists supervisor and I gave her permission to look at my file so hopefully she will understand we are different people. Its so confusing and that 1 little detail totally detailed therapy. Well, that and I don't think my last therapist knew how to help me. She kept saying that."
845,Not feeling so good. Feel like I'm always in a panic. I don't want to hrt myself but I'm at work. I don't know.
846,"I dissociate. I didn't know until recently it was called dissociation. I have been doing it for decades. Sometimes it helps me through things. It is not daydreaming. 

I dissociate when I am stressed, or in fear.

I learnt to dissociate in my teens at home, living in fear of my extremist homosexual parents finding out about me, and did it again during the trauma of aversion therapy. 

I do it when I am meditating. I can do it to the sound of the shaman drumming. 

I am not asleep I am just not aware of what is going on. It is hard to explain. 

It is like a mind out of body experience but not the same. I see things that are not there because my eyes do not see them but my imagination does. I hear things but it doesn't involve an actual sound memory just an imaginationary sound. 

I can have a body memory of something that my mind has no knowledge of.

My dissociation is partly the result of my PTSD.



""Ptsd is associated with dissociation of traumatic memories. Sometime a traumatic event is remembered in its entirety but it is more common for it to be remembered piecemeal and dissociated. That is, some of the elements appear to be missing while others are highlighted. One client may have visual flashbacks of an event, indicating that she rememberes images and has emotional reactions to them (terror) , but lacks awareness of body sensationsand the narrative (meaning) that can make sense of the flashbacks.........................the  most troublesome traumatic memories are those that involve body sensations and l.ittle else. In such cases the body sensations associated to the traumatic memory are intact, but the other elements, facts, narrative , time and space context that could make the individual to make sense of the memories appear lost. ""
'The body remembers' Babette Rothschild

I have horrible body pains but only now have learnt where they come from, also I have disconnected iamges that also made no sense.

Only now after what has been a very traumatic 2 years have I begun to de-construct and rebuild my past, unravelling and make sense of these disconnected memories.

As my past begins to make sense, ie I can understand it enough to explain it, a narrative, my depressions are lifting.

For anyone yet to go through this process I offer the promise that it is worth all the hard work, good luck to you all."
847,"I don't know what to do.  It's a long story but I'll try to nutshell it.  I live with my mom, her ex husband, her ex boyfriend, my brother, and my nephew.  I watch my nephew all day because my brother is at work, my mom is so drugged up on prescription drugs all the time that she is stumbling around mumbling nonsense usually inappropriately dressed, her ex husband helps as much as he can but has emphysema, her ex boyfriend wants nothing to do with the baby.  The baby will be a year in a few days, and we've had him here for 8 months now.  Don't get me wrong, I love the kid, but I don't want to watch him full time anymore.  The biggest problem is mom, I can't stand her behavior, she is one of those who only straightens up enough to visit more doctors to get more pills and she makes me freaking sick.  She's about useless, I wish she'd just stay in her room.  She even gets mad if you try to figure out what she's saying, like it's your fault you aren't messed up enough to understand her.  How can anyone think it's ok to act like that?  She makes me want to go live under a bridge and become an alcoholic, but then who will watch the baby?"
848,"I dunno what's going on. I felt ok for a few months. Good even. I know deep down I'm not better, but we were functioning better. I wasn't feeling the ill affects of being split. Now suddenly for the past week I feel phobic, anxious, depressed, scared. I really need to talk in person but my therapist ditched me like 5 months ago. I did email her though. Maybe she will email me back."
849,"I know what Depersonalisation & Derealisation feels like.  But I have no idea what Dissociation is.  I have read up on some info & I believe that this is another symptom I'm currently suffering with.

It's horrible.

Please, if you don't mind - Can you explain in your own words what it's like to experience this symptom?  Because I want to try and figure out if this is what I'm currently go through. I believe I possibly could be going through a stage of this or have been for a very long time.

most are under 21...with eight of them being under the age of 8 and i am in my 40s...
some are afraid...some are angry...some are vengeful....
some like to eat...others hate to eat
some are catatonic...others are dreamers..others are doers and go getters...some are organized...others are careless with everything especially money...
some want friends...others would rather be alone and not have to deal with the bullshit...
some are polite...some are domineering...some are soft..some are hard...some would not dream of hitting and that is all some of the others want to do when someone pisses them off..hit that person...

for years i was all over the place wondering what the hell was going on and one day asked myself what the fuck am I?

Well i found out in 2009 what i am ...i'm someone with multiple personalities in a disorganized system in which most of the members are very ill and angry and hurt...

i am trying to sort through it all but some days...today being one of them...i get totally frustrated....and i just want to let out a scream and i don't want to talk to anybody or see anybody and am glad that i am living alone....

Right now everyone in my system is in an uproar...wanting their way so i'm playing referee but i have run out of patience and have walked off the field telling them to do whatever the fuck they want...i don't care...

i'm going to have a freaking cup of tea and everything be damned...i don't care anymore...."
852,"Hi all,

I was talking to my CPN the other day and I mentioned that I have a feeling of lots of people living inside of my mind, which he was very interested in and took a lot of notes, which surprised me as I didn't really think much of it before, I assumed it was common, or at least common in the context of MH issues and psychosis.  He asked if I ever felt I was someone else and I said no, but remembered later that I once had a brief episode where I believed I was someone else, not myself, a fully fledged person with a different name and everything, which only lasted for a few hours. I hadn't thought much of that either, I thought it was just part of psychosis, similar to hearing voices and other such hallucinations that I experience.  I remember everything about it and I don't lose periods of time or find myself in strange places or anything that leads me to believe I am becoming someone else without being aware of it.  I don't think I've experienced anything bad enough to have developed different personalities, which perhaps in my ignorance I have always believed was what caused dissociative disorders. I have also had at least one out of body experience, plus feelings of not being real/being in a dream, which is also dissociation isn't it?  Could I have DID or multiple personality disorder (or are they the same thing?) or is it probably something else?

Thanks for reading (sorry it's a bit long)."
853,When i walk home from work sometimes i feel lost like i dont know where i am but at the same time i know where i am. Its very surreal. My eyes see a strange unfamiliar place but theres some kind of navigation system inside me that gets me home.
854,"I have recently begun experiencing this and i am finding it very hard to come to terms with, i am petrified of it happening again to the extent that i have stopped my social life completely and now have to be locked in my house at all times in case it happens again because i get scared and try to run away and i do not have a clue who i am or who anyone else is or what i am doing or anything. My husband literally has to grab hold of me until it passes and all i know is some strange man is grabbing me so i start kicking and punching him for my life (as you would if you thought a strange man was trying to lock you in a house you have never seen before and you don't know who you are). I feel like a ticking time bomb and i am too scared to leave the house in case it happens again, also my husband is disabled so i feel really horrible after that i have done this to him. I have lots of other mental health conditions but this one is definitely the one that has disturbed me the most, probably because its something new but i feel like this has made me actually crazy and how am i supposed to survive living with this. Its not fair on my family or friends and it scares the life out of me. I just don't know how to deal with it."
855,"Hi! 

I'm 20 and have been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. But there is something that has been bothering me for a while, and I was wondering if it might be dissociation or derealisation. Basically, for a while I have been feeling like everything isn't real. It's difficult to describe but I feel as if I could reach out and touch a wall and it would fall over, like it's part of a film set or something. I feel like I'm really in some kind of blank white room and everything around me is an illusion. And like the pavement beneath my feet will change at any time, and things that I touch with my hands don't seem real. And I sometimes hear things that aren't there, mostly people calling my name when the house is empty, or voices of people that I know, but they aren't around. Does this sound like derealization? Or is it the early signs of something like psychosis? 

Thanks,
Neko

P.S. forgot to mention that when I look in the mirror I feel like the reflection isn't me, don't know how to explain that better!"

863,I have borderline personality disorder and am soo many tablets...I've finished psychotherapy 3 weeks ago..recenty I have been having black outs where its like I'm in a room on my own and then its like. Soneone flicks a switch and I'm bk in real life and I don't no where I am or who is at the side of me... Like today my partner was driving and I just turned round to him n said wat am I doing in the car and who are you. He told me to relax n that I was ok. I was scared. It happened most days now. I have to think before I speak cos I get confused where I am and who's there. What could this be. I'm seeing my psychiatrist on Monday so I will also tell him.  Thanks xx
864,"i switched personalities three times in a very short period of time....usually the switch is subtle...sometimes it is sudden, rapidfire and frightening...

i am learning when that happens to not to do anything that comes to mind....i remember meeting a guy who said he had multiples and i became afraid of him...so i have this fear that people will find me scary....honestly when i switch suddenly like that i scare myself!

Right now i am isolating in real life .... not talking to anyone about anything because honestly i don't know how i feel or what i think about anything....not a good place to be :("
865,"Hi fellow members I'm diagnosed with DID and lately I've had a few things going on that I've never experienced before,I'm just interested to see if anyone else has had this happen to them?
Firstly I keep dreaming about years ago and when I awake I can't figure out if its really happening to me at this time in life or not,if this makes sense.
For example say if I dreamt about an ex partner when I awake I don't know if I'm still with this person or not,it takes me around an hour to figure it out.  I seem to float in and out of sleep about 20 times a night.
Another thing is I dream about things that happen the next day or a couple of days after,things that I couldn't of possibly known about?,I don't claim to be a psychic or anything its just an issue I've had for years.
I know it might sound ridiculous to some but its every single night and its driving me mad! 
Any advice or personal experiences you could share would be so much appreciated
Take care
Jac"
866,A few weeks ago I started seeing people. I just see their shaddows. It doesn't bother me too much but I am concerned. A few years ago I was seeing people clearly. They were either the walking dead type and very gory or just pale dead people in Victorian era dress. The Victorian people were usually just going for a walk but I would see the people in parked cars as well. Anyone experience this?
867,"hello, does anyone know of a good website that talks about body memories/pain and dissociation?"
868,Im 19 years old and have lived most of my life not knowing what is real and what isnt. I was told if memories appear in full colour and sound it is usually an actual memory where is if it appears in black and white and the sound isnt very good it is normally a dream. there has been a lot of things happen and i dont know which ones to believe and which ones not to believe. I have very vivid memories but no one else can seem to remember them....... i have scars from these memories but no idea what to do when others say they arent what happened. sorry its hard to explain.... can anyone try and explain this?
869,"I know I can become dissociative, it happened for the first time over a year ago and freaked me right out. 
I was getting ready to leave for a flight. I have CRIPPLING social anxiety, and it became very intense as I realized the various people I would have to interact with. My face and limbs started to tingle like they were asleep, and I began hyperventilating.
Then as I rounded a corner into my bathroom, I was looking down, and suddenly my feet were NOT my feet. I steadied myself against the door frame, as I felt very strangely unbalanced. I looked into the mirror, and it was like I couldn't look myself in the eye, because I was seeing out of two separate pairs. My vision was unfocused. I called out for my mom.. using my voice felt awkward, like it was really far off. I'd think to say 'mom' but when it came out, I couldn't actually feel my vocal chords or mouth moving, or something.. by the time she walked down the hallway to me, I was back in my body again, still anxious, but mostly astounded at what my own mind did to me.
I've never gotten THAT dissociative again. On that occasion I felt like I could hardly move, I was so not in control of my movements.
Anyway, despite my episode that day, I continued to pack and left for the airport. I was hyperventilating and my face was numb, but things didn't get weird again until I entered the airport. Walking with my mom on the sidewalk up there, the dissociative feeling came back. Not full force, yet as I was walking it wasn't me walking, just my body. 
This continued while I sat down to try and get myself together while my parents checked my bags. When my mom returned she actually asked me if I was on something. I told her no, but I sure felt like it.
It got worse as more time passed to me boarding the plane, and when they called for my flight I just couldn't do it. I refused. Mom knows I have these issues and has a few of her own so she understood. We went home, and for the next week as I was going about my day I'd have these little flashes of the 'feeling'. They'd last merely a few seconds; never really interfered with my life again, luckily.
The feeling is comforting in a way, but getting to that point isn't...
I'm posting this here to share I suppose and ask how many if any of you began with just doing this occasionally, not on purpose, and eventually it got worse. Also, if any of you have this but don't have multiple personalites. I haven't been in such a state since (surprisingly) but I worry it could happen again. Though honestly, I'd take feeling out of my body any day over being in it and suffering from it's actions, thoughts, words.."
870,"I now have no doubt now that I dissociated when I was given aversion therapy. When I was away from my body and the AT continued the Ps must have known and stopped the AT and put me on a ward until I returned . This probably answers my previous question about where my body had gone.

Then in a particular severe part of the AT I remember them talking to me all the time asking questions and making me reply. Would this have been proof to them that I wasn't dissociating at that moment and to start the treatment again?"
871,"I haven't been diagnosed with anything but since starting therapy have realised maybe it's an issue for me? I didn't know much about it til I read up a bit and it's worrying me. 

Like, earlier I took the kids to kfc for lunch. I don't know why but suddenly found I'd pulled my feet up onto the bench and was hiding my head in my hands on my knees. How did that happen? Great parenting not.

I really struggle to concentrate. My bf laughs (kindly!)cos I can't watch an episode of eastenders or read a newspaper article without losing concentration. I had to give up my degree a few years ago when I suddenly found I couldn't concentrate anymore...funnily enough at the same time I got back with abusive ex (why??)

I often just sit and stare into space. Sometimes I'll be eg just washing up, and find I've suddenly stopped halfway through and am just standing there. Or I'll be in a cafe with my bf just sitting quietly and my head just sinks onto the table. He often strokes my hair to wake me up again! Sometimes I don't know why or how it happened, sometimes I'm just giving up on thinking/talking.

Sometimes I notice bruises, sometimes quite nasty, and don't know how I got them. Often I recall an image or snippet of recent conversation and have no idea where or who I was with.

Can any/all of these be dissociative stuff? I guess I'm recovering from a breakdown a couple of months ago so maybe my brain is just tired out?   I am so worried that I'll never be able to read a book again or that my bf will lose interest as I can't discuss what I've read in the guardian, or books like I could a few years ago. I have read so much, and forgotten most of it, which seems cruel. 

My t is away for 2 weeks now (eek!) and I really want to discuss this with her more fully at some point, so any ideas on what its all about welcome in the meantime. 

Has anyone had these problems and got past it?"
872,"I do not have the diagnosis dissociation, but my psychologist thinks I might be dissociating. I have almost no memories of my early choldhood, and not many of my later childhood. Most of life feels like something I read about.

I talk about things, without feelings, she says. And I do not recognize feelings easily, I have to think about it, before I know what i feel.

I don't know so much about dissociation, but she ain't the first one to mention it.

I've read a little about it, and I do fit many of the symptoms.

But, every article I've read, have said that dissociation comes from a childhood trauma. Well, I don't have one. Not that I remember, but I really don't think I have a suppressed memory. Why would I have that?

I know I don't remember much, but still. I think I would remember something like a really bad trauma! Or at least there would be some kind of signs.

So, do anyone have knowledge of dissociation happening, even if one have no serious trauma in ones history?"
873,"I think I have just invented a phrase ""Dissociation Event"" which , to me , is how I describe something that has just happened that in its own context doesn't make any sense at all unless it is recognised as a time when my mind has not been associated with my body. 

I am dissociating. This happens automatically and I don't seem to have any power over it.

To try to explain, I have a memory of something happening, which to me is very real, but did not happen. My mind makes up an actual event from various bits of information I have picked up during the day. 

I feel like I have woken up from a dream, with a memory in my head. This is a very very real memory of a very very real event, I believe it happened. Then later if I mention it to someone or try to understand it, it doesn't make sense.

this happens quite often.

These are not necessarily just simple events but stupid things which I wouldn't do, 

I think I am brain damaged in that my neurons and synapses don't connect properly."
874,"for those of you with DID or DDNOS with alters, do you plan to integrate or do you want to learn to cooperate and work together as multiple people in one body?

personally, I want to learn to cooperate with my system, the idea of integration is actually quite scary to me/us. I believe that alters are just people who weren't fortunate enough to get their own body and mind and so were sent to somebody who needed their help and got to share the body and mind with that person... that's maybe a silly view to have but I like that, it makes me think of them as Guardian Angels of sorts. so I don't want to take their lives away from them, or their identity and we'd like to just learn to function as any other person can/does but as multiple rather than singular. I wouldn't stop anyone from integrating if they wanted to but I wouldn't ever force them to integrate or stay around, I want it to be their choice whether they stay or go.

these are just my views but I am very interested to find out what other people might think or feel about this kind of thing.

Panda."
875,"i feel like im being really thick here and yeah i probably am but i just cant understand what intergration means, my T is always explaining it, maybe i cant hear him (well i can  physically hear him and yet somehow its not going in my brain) but i totally dont understand what it means and how would it feel, how do you know when its happened ? i mean does it mean my head will be free from noise, voices, will they become mine, will i be alone (which sometimes i wish i was and others i dont)
is it really that important, does it matter if some dont or wont, is intergration really as important as some ppl make out can - im confussed cos so many ppl say differing things - ive had a T say intergration doesnt matter as long as theres co-conciousness and another one says you must ???

i just feel like im always being told differnt things by diff T they all so confuse me or maybe im meant to be confused lol

876,"At least now i know they are there and need to be listened to and taken care of...i am not always walking around asking why do i have energy one minute and none the next?

Some of my other personalities are just exhausted because of the things i did to try to end my life in the past...like overworking, over exercising, not sleeping....

now that i have stopped everything and am listening to them and figuring out what is going on...i'm finding that some of them are just darned exhausted at the effort it took to keep me alive...it feels like now i am returning the favour...by resting them, ensuring they get lots of sleep and taking these two  years off work...i'm in my second year though and it will be tough to give the a third year financially...rent is going up...utilities are going up but the benefits cheque is not going up and my only option is to get a roommate which creates other problems...they want to be in the apartment by themselves...

40 years of saving my butt and all i can give is 2 years for them to recover....not realistic i am afraid...but the longer i stay out of the workforce the harder it will be to get back in and i am no spring chicken...

problems, problems...

i want to exercise today but they are saying not today...they are exhausted...they are always afraid that i will overdo it although i promised that i would not and that we would rest after exercising...something we never did before...but they are learning to trust me...we only connected last year...so the relationship is new...my system was very disorganized for  years...hence my many breakdowns...

oh dear...i guess we are resting today....it is awkward when part of me wants to do things and another part of me will have none of it...both with equal power....."
877,"Hi there, I'm a new user.
I'm a young woman of 20 and i've been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for a couple of years after a traumatic few years as a teenager.
I used to experience derealisation very very severly, to the point where i stopped driving, i stopped working and i dropped out of college. i became completely agrophobic and didn't do anything with my life for about a year.
I then received help in the form of therapy and medication, which i've now completed. I now have my anxiety under control, however i do still experience strange symtoms.

I was told by two seperate doctors and my therapist that derealisation can only occur when anxiety is present as it's a state of being over aware when you start pumping adreneline (anxiety).
However, is this true? I haven't had a panic attack in a very long time, however I still don't feel right.
my memory is terrible, but it's always tiny little things i forget.
sometimes i get very confused, for example if a television is on in the room i get confused and think it's me talking when it's actually the tv.
or sometimes i think 'oh my god did i just say that outloud?' when i haven't said anything...
I also often forget what i'm talking about mid scentance, or forget what i've just said. No one else seems to notice that i've done something strange, which makes me think it's all in my head which worries me even more... i find this so upsetting, it's terrifying.

I also often become very depressed, but will then feel unbearably happy just minutes later and regret things i've said instantly if i were in a rage.

I don't understand why this is happening to me, I have no idea how to control it and none of my friends, boyfriend or parents understand, or even really care.
Please help. I am a prisoner in my own mind. How do i get better?
Thankyou xxxxxx"

880,"We were discharged thursday.  In the last two days we have put in three job applications.  This is major!  Not really ready for a job, but want one anyway.  Actually reapplied at a job we were fired from, long story but there is a chance.  Waiting for callbacks has never been my strong suit, nerves are raked and anxiety is high!  Wish me luck!"
881,"I was just thinking, from a discussion on another thread about other health problems.

 None of my physical problems can be described as self harm in the truest sense of the phrase, in that I never went out of my way to do any of it.

I think I have just realised the effect of dissociating has had on my body.

I seem to be able to dissociate very easily, and looking back through my life I now realise that I do it quite often to escape stressful situations. I never knew what it was before. 

I seem to be accident prone, but it maybe just that because I am not attentive to whatever situation I am in, that this is forced to happen. 

 I wonder if anyone has ever done some research into how people with dissociation get on with their physical bodies."
882,"Ill try to keep this short. My girlfriend and I are both in our early 20's. This summer in may, we found out she was pregnant. We were scared/worried/happy/sad. Basically all over the place. I knew my parents would hate me and wouldnt support me. I knew the same was true for my girlfriend. So, we went to an abortion clinic. I cried about 50 times while there. I tried to convince my girlfriend that we didnt want this anymore but she didnt agree. I handed over the money and felt as though id just paid for an assassination. 

It took quite a while and when my gf came out we both cried. From that night on I havent been the same. Ive been crying randomly (but very infrequently) and I go though derealization every other night. I regret what we did and I always will. My gf and I often cry in eachothers arms. Shes depressed sometimes, but she doesnt get derealization like I do. 

The derealization is very scary. I feel like my house is alien and im walking in fog. I get bad anxiety too. My symptoms are full blast at night but are hardly noticable during the day. Infortunately I believe this is creating a fear of night time or something. What can I do!? Is this normal? Will it ever go away? Anybody please...?"

I think I am tripping, I think I am going mad,"
884,"nevermind 

I think this is the wrong thread anyway"
885,"I am not sure if this is the correct place to post this. However, I will share it here as well. Along the years, I have been able to become ""desensitized""regarding experiences and I can actually distract myself or pretend that what I say is the truth even though I know is not. There are so many questions inside me. I don't even know who I am!

Here is my story:

This is going to a very long post. First, I will try to describe to the best of my ability, my past, my present, and the way I know most people perceives me. I just know that things must not be normal, but I am simply starting to realize this now. I was practically raised by my maternal grandparents. I grew up in an extended family, were verbal abuse was very common and the regular physical beatings if we misbehaved. The story between my parents (I am the older sister) and my experience living with them, was never pleasurable. Besides being sexually molested by family members, experiencing many different scenarios (my parents almost killing each other), hearing them having sex, more violence, my father being stabbed, seeing drugs around the house, my father being accused of murder of his homosexual lover, being in prison, there was a lot more going on with my life. I know these things were not normal. I grew up ""believing"" to be a normal child. I mean, I know I could have had another family, a better one. I never felt I was a fit within my family nonetheless, but I didn't feel like an alien either. 

OK, besides all those things and really not having a lot of supervision from adults in regards to my education, I managed to excel in school, and was recognized throughout the years. There was a period; however, when things went out of control for me, at the middle of my mid school experience. I was 13, and I started feeling more connected with the ""troubled"" kids than the normal I guess. I let a then 18 year old have sex with me (I am from out the country) when I was barely 13. It didn't feel good. I really didn't have a desire to do it. I simply couldn't say no. I felt pressured and all, but just couldn't fight. I felt horrible. At one point my mom found out and I was called a whore and such things at that age. I really felt the lowest. I was well liked by men. Since I was a young girl, I was harassed by men of all ages. I always had this dirty feeling of myself, and felt really uncomfortable, but I could never really be mean or rude to people, and I always felt weak. My family regarded me as too naive, dumb of the real world and such. I let another one had sex with me at 14. No good feelings again. I just let people use me. I had a boyfriend when I was 15. I had sex with him, and I ended up pregnant. Again, at this point I had only had sex because I couldn't say no, and I never had a good experience. It was painful, I was not a participant. I just let them do whatever to me. I had a child before I even turned 16.


I continued going to school when my baby was barely a month old. I still pumped and breastfed. I did great in school again. I had friends. People liked me. I met the real boy I got to love, or developed loved feelings for. Sex didn't happen as it did with the others, eventually we did it but we were a couple for a few years and I really got to experience a reciprocal, and loving relationship I thought. Eventually, he started liking someone else (of course we were young), we broke up. I was very depressed. At that same time, I became a US resident, and I wanted to leave so badly. I came to the USA. I started working. I met my husband as soon as arrived. I was 18. Again, I had people wanting to be with me. I chose him because he was unlikely respectful, and intrigued me. He didn't try to jump on me, and get sexual with me as I was used to. I was still young and unsure of my life. At that same time, at the beginning of my relationship, I met another American at work who liked me a lot. He was married. We were involved in this relationship for a short period, but he actually wanted to leave his wife for me. I advised him to try and save his marriage. I continued with my boyfriend and we got married years later. I had a boy. I am now a mother of two children. 

Ok, many years went by (am not yet thirty) and I had a ""normal"" marriage. I worked and went to college full time. I have been an honor student. I plan to attend law school. I worked at law firms, volunteered at the court house, became a legal court interpreter, got a county job, and am still working toward my professional goals at this point. My husband and I never really agree on things and argued a lot. He also had a rough past, but overall, he is a very kind and most importantly, very honest, loyal and faithful person. He really loves me, oh so much! 

When I started working at this government job, I met a male (married) in his 40s, my supervisor. I started feeling with time. It wasn't anything like physical attraction, or something spoken about at the beginning. We were friends for a while. At one point, it went over, and I thought, I had found the love, the true love of my life, that I had been seeking for sooo long. I went crazy about him. I told my husband I didn't love him (after he asked me). I didn't really want to tell him that. He cried, and I cried, and had a horrible experience of suffering, or seeing someone suffer, which I truly hate. I left the house, even lived with this guy for a short period of time. He left his house. Really wants to be with me. He truly took it so seriously that he loves me and wants to be with me. Meanwhile, my children went out of the country to be with my mom. I wanted them to not see any of this. They don't even know about this. 

The first guy I met at work at the beginning, he continued being friends with me for years. I did not see him face to face during all these years. We only wrote to each other once in a while about our respective lives. I saw him a couple times, after I left my husband. He is divorcing. I did not engage in sex or involved myself with him physically in any way. It was really as friends.

I left to my hometown, and saw my ex. My first true love! I ended up being with him again. I love everybody, or I don't love anybody. Even the 40 year old who left his family for me, have cried because I never make up my mind of what I really want. I chat, or write to these men. Tell them I don't want to be with them, and sometimes that I do. That I could possibly be or not. They all, even my ex now, wants to be with me. They think about marriage. They really regard me as a very valuable, beautiful, intelligent, and kind person. Am I even any of this? I guess I am to MY family. I am nice to others. I like to help, to give someone a kind word, to offer advice, to assist them on anything I can, but how, how, can I do this. These men, they really love me. All of them offer me a life, and I REALLY don't want it. I just don't want them to go away either. My husband; he has taken so much. I am horrible in reality. At least he knows more. The others, they don't know about each other. They all think my husband is the only other possible person in my life. My ex knows I am separated. My past coworker knows I am separated, and I can consider being with him, but he doesn't know about my supervisor's relationship, about my ex now, about my having sex with my husband when he gets too lonely, and I lie about not being with anybody else. They actually believe me. They all do. 

I can't possibly write it all here. I am like this fake thing in the outside. I mean, I am full of secrets. NOBODY before you now, have witnessed my true story. And please don't get me wrong, I try so hard to be proper, to raise my children right, worry about their education, am involved in every aspect of their lives, responsible about my job, about my schooling, about my family, about my friends, but relationships with other men, a true loving and faithful relationship... I guess, I don't know what I am doing! I feel I want my husband and his forgiveness. Then I dream about what that other one offers me. I feel bad for another and feel I could make the other one happy. What is wrong with me? Or is it simply, I am a just a bad person.

have you still got symptoms?
have you recovered?
i am looking for anyone who has knowledge or personal experience of this, not just bits pulled off other sites as i think i have read them all, but personal stuff, like how you coped, what you felt, how your care team dealt with your needs...... please help, i have been looking for 2 years and found no one so far other than myself with dissociative motor disorder. i know of others with conversion disorder and functional neurological disorder, but my care team are insisting this is not the same thing and that DMD is short lived eventhough i have been getting worse for over 2 years with no sign of improvement!"

888,"I just wrote something but I think I wrote it on the wrong forum or something and now I can't get back to it to put it here where I think it's supposed to go.
Anyway, my name is Danny, I'm a member of a system we call The Soldiers and I've got a billion questions.

I don't have a therapist right now because I'm a full time college student and can only work once a week without going completely insane so I can't afford one. I was diagnosed about 18 months ago but I've kind of always known about the DID but never really wanted to acknowledge it. Anyway, Jan 2010 our ""core"" Becky became aware and since then, everything's kind of hit the fan. Now that we're actually dealing with stuff and acknowledging that it's real, I have so many things to ask.

First, I know I'm not the only person with DID. I've actually known several people with it, my step mom and boyfriend are in there. But I can't talk to my step mom about anything and there are limits with my bf because certain issues of ours bring up certain issues of his and we end up triggering each other and making situations worse. So, there's a very big sense of isolation going on and I'm really hoping to just find other people like us...
Are other people's systems so insanely controlled? I can't deviate from the daily routine unless it's been planned a minimum of 32 hours ahead of time (idk why 32 hours). Everything is controlled--from what I say to what I do to what I wear to where I go. The sad thing is that I have the most freedom out of everyone inside. Everyone else... if they're even allowed to come out, they're watched so strictly that they can't say anything or do anything. Does anyone else experience that kind of control inside? We're working on it, but that's the other thing, just when I think we've figured it out, something else pops up. And I feel like I'm making all of this up. How could there be so many people inside? I've been given the number 35 for the number of people in my system and as far as I know, that's actually pretty average but it feels like hundreds. I just don't understand why there's so many. And I feel at a loss as to what to do about all this insane control going on. 
I just want to know if there's people with similar issues... I know every system is different but ya... that's all I can say"
889,"Hi guys I wonder if you can help me, I'll go ahead and try to explain what happens symptom wise, the crisis team today mentioned dissassociation so I'm wondering now.

Sometimes I feel like I'm not awake, like I'm asleep but my eyes are open, sometimes I feel like I'm physically leaving my brain, I feel a rising sensation in my head, when I was younger I'd look in the mirror and after a while I couldnt tell who I was, it was like a stranger there, I also get memory loss.

What are these symptoms of? Does any of this fit with bipolar or is this something else, I've always had this feeling that something else isn't right other than the moods.

Also why would the crisis team but concerned about dissociation? They asked me twice about the feeling and if it was still there.

Thanks for your help"
890,"I am going through a very strange period at the moment. I believe that there is a conflict going on inside my head. My mind is fighting with my body. I have body memories and I have mind memories and the two seem to be different or at odds with each other. When I get panic attacks or flashbacks I shake uncontrollably, but sometimes I just begin to shake the same way without a P/A or F/B. It is as if I have 2 personalities at war with each other.  My mind is full of false memories whilst my body memories are apparently true because you can't have false body memories.

I go to places where I think I have never been but I know my way around completely. and conversely I go to other places I have been to and I am totally lost.

I am finding this very difficult to explain. It is as if my body is reacting differently to what is going on to my mind. I am dissociating endlessly. I have no memory of things I know that have happened. I have had so many injuries over the years it's almost as if my mind is trying to punish my body. Then my body fights back by starting to shake and I don't know whats going on.

sometimes 'I' is my mind, and sometimes 'I' is my body. 

At lunchtime today I suddenly got an absolutely excruciating pain in my forearm and elbow, even though I was just sitting down doing nothing. Really un-nerved me, sending my mind into a frenzy. Then when I went back to work the pain completely disappeared."

894,"i am dx bi polar.  The last couple of years as my thinking has become clearer (instead of constant fog) ive noticed that i have this feeling of what i can only describe as 'looking at myself from above'.  I dont feel it coming on, only when im in it.  I feel completely detached from my emotions at time too...kinda like im a 'shell'.  When i feel like this i cant connect with people, their emotions, my emotions. I feel like at times like this i could appear/be very cold and simply not care. Dont know if any of this makes sense.  Have been looking at quietiapine, but cant see this as any of the listed side effects. 

Reading some of the other treads on this forum memory is a big issue.   I have a shockingly bad memory..cant remember yesterday etc, have to make lists etc..but as far as i know ive never done something and not known about it.  Once ive been reminded about the experience i usually remember it.

Just wanted to know what u thought...thanks."
895,"Hi everyone, 
I just joined this forum today, and probably should have years ago, but I never thought I'd find some friends or anyone who associates...
ok, I sure would like to find anyone who can relate to the following..
For 35 years (yes, I've deal that long with this), my mind has been basically deep in the gutter with deep sexual thoughts all the time. I can't talk without bumping into some kind of words that has double meanings to it (sexually). Also, alot of tactile connotations (holding a skillet handle while cooking, a broom, etc). I also deal with alot of emotional dissasociation and it makes me paranoid constantly because I have no feelings of sympathy and could never say sorry to someone because i constantly am in a state of very heavy guilt and never understood why. But just the fact that I can't feel emotions makes me feel like a monster among other people if they found out. My conscience is very bothered by this of course. I feel deep isolation all the time. I can't watch T.V. even because I feel like I'm lashing out with my mind at people (in total opposition to all people). I don't want to see this at all, but I do see it. Coupled with not relating to news stories, etc how I'm SUPPOSED to feel what they are talking about (someone died or someone did good deeds etc), i can't relate emotionally, but my conscience of course is there to feel the guilt. Anyone relate to this?

896,"I've had some sort of mental health problem for 7'ish years now - my diagnosis is under discussion but I'm receiving trauma therapy.

When I get very distressed I can leave home and get to places having had no idea how I got there. These can be risky situations such as finding myself standing on a railway track with a train coming towards me early in the morning or being on a cliff top only remembering events about 18 hours previous. Also I have experienced a feeling of looking down on myself and wondering who this person is that is struggling with the police. 

I am becoming scared of myself and what might happen. Some days when I am really distressed (this has increased since I started therapy) I am worried about going out of my front door. My therapist said that I may be too fragile to continue working with as an outpatient but then wonders if he would really make it any worse than it already is. I didn't go to the session this week as a couple of weeks ago I got in such a state that they had to hospitalize me for my own safety. 3 days in hospital was enough to make me realize that I didn't want to go there again.

When I tell professionals about these episodes where I don't remember they seem dismissive."

900,"HI People

I am new to the forum and im hoping to meet like minded people who might be able to offer some assistance is some way.

My name is Gavin and I have been with my partner Kate for 3 years. She has been diagnosed with Bipolar and is receiving counselling and medication however I am struggling to come with the changes in her personality on a daily basis. I Love kate to bits and will stand by her through what ever it takes, however I am in need of some support as I am currently not getting any help or assistance.

I have been advised by Kate's counsellor to basically ignore anything Kate does that causes problems as what I had been doing is raising the issue with Kate when she was doing something wrong or being abusive towards me or others, apparently by me doing this it was making her feel worse. I have been doing what the counsellor advised over the last month and now I am finding it so hard to be treated how ever Kate wants to treat me and I have to just put up with it and smile.

Any advise would be so greatly welcomed.

Sorry to go on about me

Thanks
Gav"

I thought that I was dissociating to escape the torture I was receiving, but now after doing some research into brainwashing and mind control  techniques I find that the therapists maybe wanted me to dissociate to enable them to plant new memories in my head, which they wouldn't have been able to do if I was all there so to speak. They knew I would dissociate under torture so that is what ehy set about doing. Successfully.

It is my body memories now that are trying to convince my mind the truth of what went on."

905,"I keep having... 'episodes'.
I am really not great at explaining so bare with me.

Yesterday I was watching TV. I was so into the film that I started BEING the character on tv. I felt what she did and did what she was doing... At one point I looked back and saw myself watching myself on the tv. 
When my OH came in, I didnt hear him. He came over and when he touched my arm, I was me again. 
I became completely overwhelmed. I could barely talk and then all of a sudden I just started crying hysterically. I couldnt move. My chest hurt so so badly and I just couldnt.... breathe! It was horrific.

This keeps happening to me. I get into something so much that when it comes to an end, its almost like I am hit with reality again and its awful. Its taking so much out of me.

When I was in hospital last summer, I kept 'spacing out' like i was in the room talking with my psychologist once a week and being me, but I couldnt remember anything that was said to me, or even saying anything. I was convinced I hadnt talked the whole time. But I got into loads of trouble over what I had said and I dont remember any of it.

Whats going on? I just... my psych was terrible. I tried to ask him about these things, but he just says its 'normal BPD symptoms' and thats that.
I have now changed psychs but I am too scared to start over with someone new. 

I am so confused. I dont even feel real right now. Like its all a constant blur."
906,"Should I seek help? I don't know what I might have.. but is it anything serious?

When I am stressed, put in situations that make me uncomfortable, or when I am put in situations that I don't really want to be a part of, sometimes I disconnect myself mentally from everything that is going on around me; I end up just going through the motions with mindless involvement in the things going on around me or I act like I am not even there. It's strange, because I still engage and participate in and with my surroundings, but at the same time I feel as though I am on some strange type of autopilot, like I fully or partially disconnect myself from the reality around me, until I feel as though I want to be a part of the situation again; like I am just waiting for the moment to end and until it does I don't want to be involved in it. I don't experience unbeleivable fear or stress, I just feel down and zone out. I feel like I take myself out of the moment, to pretend as though I am not there, all the while still being aware of what is going on, participating in every bit of it, not wanting be a part of what is going on. And sometimes I do these things and feel these ways in situations where I normally don't feel uncomfortable at all and I end up desperately wanting and needing to be a part of what is going on around me, but I can't shake my disconnect off. It's like my actions, my thoughts, my words, and my desire to interact with my surroundings just goes stale and I am taken away from what is going on around me mentally. I end up feeling like a zombie, still engaging, still interacting, but I never fully participate mentally. Sometimes it's to avoid things until I feel comfortable again and sometimes I cant control it, and all the time I am feeling this way, I am desperately wanting it to go away so that I can be a part of the moment... 

I feel as though I experienced some things in my life that could have very easily triggered PTSD.. but I have never had terrifying flashbacks or anything of that nature.. I do have chunks of my past that I don't associate as a part of who I am though.. the past traumatic moments did occur, and I know they did, but its like I threw the memories into a box and as long as i do not acknowledge them, they never occurred, and if anyone asked me about them today I would deny they ever happened; it's like I avoid talking about them at all costs. The person I was, in the period of my life that was traumatic to me, does not exist anymore. With that said, could it be that instead of developing full blown PTSD I developed a dispersonalization complex? Are either of those two things even what I am experiencing? I do have ADHD though.. could it just be my ADHD?? And no, I wasn't misdiagnosed. I really do have a difficult time doing anything until the very last possible moment, I can't concentrate on something if there is any distraction at all, my thoughts are all over the place, and those symptoms occurred long before these disconnects and my life traumas.

Despite my experiences with disconnecting myself, I do lead a very happy fulfilling life. I go through ups and downs, but I can't say I am severly crippled by these instances that occur.. so do I even have a problem that should be looked at? Could these experiences get worse?"
907,"I know this sounds strange but I think when I was dissociating I came back to my body with a feeling that it was not where I left it. I left it when I was sat in a chair being electrocuted in a bid to escape pain but when I came back I seem to feel my body is in a bed. Both these occurrences happened in a mental hospital. Is this possible?

 sorry for all the questions I put on here but I am still trying to figure out what is going on inside my head."
908,Good to see a section for these kind of problems :) I have a dissociative disorder but hasn't been specificied which yet - has anyone here had a SCID-D assessment?
909,"Maybe to start with we need a few definitions.........I will post wiki - please add.

Depersonalization (or depersonalisation) is a malfunction or anomaly of the mechanism by which an individual has self-awareness. It is a feeling of watching oneself act, while having no control over a situation.[1] It can be considered desirable, such as in the use of recreational drugs, but it usually refers to the severe form found in anxiety and, in the most intense cases, panic attacks. Sufferers feel they have changed, and the world has become less real, vague, dreamlike, or lacking in significance. It can be a disturbing experience, since many feel that, indeed, they are living in a ""dream"".
Depersonalization is a subjective experience of unreality in one's sense of self, while derealization is unreality of the outside world. Although most authors currently regard depersonalization (self) and derealization (surroundings) as independent constructs, many do not want to separate derealization from depersonalization.[2]
Chronic depersonalization refers to depersonalization disorder, which is classified by the DSM-IV as a dissociative disorder. Though depersonalization-derealization feelings can happen to anyone subject to temporary severe anxiety/stress, chronic depersonalization is more related to individuals who have experienced a severe trauma or prolonged stress/anxiety. Depersonalization-derealization is the single most important symptom in the spectrum of dissociative disorders, including dissociative identity disorder and ""dissociative disorder not otherwise specified"" (DD-NOS). It is also a prominent symptom in some other non-dissociative disorders, such as anxiety disorders, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, migraine, sleep deprivation, and some types of epilepsy.[citation needed]


Dissociation is a partial or complete disruption of the normal integration of a person’s conscious or psychological functioning.[1] Dissociation can be a response to trauma or drugs and perhaps allows the mind to distance itself from experiences that are too much for the psyche to process at that time.[2] Dissociative disruptions can affect any aspect of a person’s functioning.[3][4][5][6] Although some dissociative disruptions involve amnesia, the vast majority of dissociative events do not.[7] Since dissociations are normally unanticipated, they are typically experienced as startling, autonomous intrusions into the person's usual ways of responding or functioning. Due to their unexpected and largely inexplicable nature, they tend to be quite unsettling.
Different dissociative disorders have different relationships to stress and trauma.[8] Dissociative amnesia and fugue states are often triggered by life stresses that fall far short of trauma.[9][10] Depersonalization disorder is sometimes triggered by trauma, but may be preceded only by stress, psychoactive substances, or no identifiable stress at all.[11]

Derealization (sometimes abbreviated as DR) is an alteration in the perception or experience of the external world so that it seems strange or unreal. Other symptoms include feeling as though one's environment is lacking in spontaneity, emotional colouring and depth.[1] It is a dissociative symptom of many conditions, such as psychiatric and neurological disorders, and not a standalone disorder. It is also a transient side effect of acute drug intoxication, sleep deprivation, and stress.[citation needed]
Derealization is a subjective experience of unreality of the outside world, while depersonalization is unreality in one's sense of self. Although most authors currently regard derealization (surroundings) and depersonalization (self) as independent constructs, many do not want to separate derealization from depersonalization.[2] The main reason for this is nosological, because these symptoms often co-occur, but there is another more philosophical reason: the idea that the phenomenological experience of self, others, and world is one continuous whole. Thus, feelings of unreality may blend in and the person may puzzle over deciding whether it is the self or the world that feels unreal to them."
910,"I have been told that the some of the dissociation I get is of a ""good"" variety, as I was doing it to survive the torture I was put through while being vilified, shamed and electrocuted for falling in love.

It was a perfectly reasonable thing to do. As it was I made the mistake of arriving back in my body a little too soon at the end only to have them finally catch me and my mind together and properly fuck me up.

Whenever I get a memory back of the AT my whole body begins to shake uncontrollably (traumatic body memories of the electricity shooting through me) and I believe my body ejects my mind from it, because at this point the tremors subside and I become calm. I am almost always thinking of my lover when this happens."
