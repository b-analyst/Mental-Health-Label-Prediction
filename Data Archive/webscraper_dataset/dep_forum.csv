0,"I feel this way most days and I'm getting sick of it. Sometimes it happens because I feel overwhelmed with all the stress university puts on me. Other times it's because I feel like I don't matter to anyone and I feel guilty for being here when my life doesn't even seem to have a real purpose. But even when nothing bad is going on in my life, it just feels like everything is pointless and there's nothing that can help. I try to do fun things when I feel this way but everything feels boring. 
There are times when I feel better and motivated to do things but the bad feelings come much more often than the positive ones. I cannot stand feeling empty, I wish I could feel good about myself and life all the time. Is that where I go wrong? Am I just looking for a quick fix that won't happen because depression isn't something that I can cure? I have the feeling that maybe I should just take a break from everything when I feel like this and sleep it off until I feel better. That always makes me feel guilty, as I feel bad when I'm not doing something productive and I realize that I've wasted time doing nothing and I still have so much left to do at the end of the day.."
1,Saw this today and wanted to share it. 💕 💕
2,"I can understand if my situation was a permanent one. Sure. Make the best with what you have. But if I can change my life for the better, why shouldn't I aim for that? I feel like people are telling me to just settle and never try. Does that apply for others as well or is it just me? I never hear anyone tell anyone else not to find a job, or a hobby, or not to go back to school when the person is willing and able. So why do I have to be stuck where I am?"
3,"So suicidal thoughts are really common to me but something that has been happening more and more is they are appearing no matter what mood I am in. 
Is this normal?
I was walking back from once from doing work and I had done a good amount of work and felt good about it. But as I walked back, I saw a fence that led to an open area with a huge drop and wanted to hang myself from it with my bag. I wasn't ""feeling"" suicidal, I just... wanted to kill myself.

The slightest bit of stress still trips me up and sends me into a downward spiral but I'm not sure what these suicidal thoughts are all about when I'm like, fine. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist that I think might help but...sometimes suicide really seems the better option. Even when I'm thinking ""rationally"" I'm just like ""But then I don't have to deal with it all. The expense of living, the trouble of having emotions, not being able to apply for a job without getting depressed halfway through the application and just not doing it, and just the day-to-day struggle of failing in so many different aspects of my such simple things.

It just seems easier that way. I very much doubt I'll ever do it."
4,"If any wants to share their experience.

I read lot of topics, but most times people dont tell their age, and sometimes its hard to condence why are depressed."

6,"Hello,

This is me Sarah I have 23 years old, born in small village at Ayat, Giza, Egypt. I knew a person from the work, he is an italian- Argentine, muslim. We fell in love and we decided to get married. As I wanted to do the right thing even though, my relationship with my family are so bad, with such a arrogant and traditional father who sees himself a God, no one could ask or talk about something that could be different than what he says. I did the right thing and told him that there's a person in my job that he wanted to ask for marrying me. He got so angry, cursed me and told me that I'm bich and he threaten my brothers if I go back to work again he will kill me because he thinks that I have ruined his honor, then he's now locking me out from 3 months and didn't want me to go back to work again. Now I'm living in the same house where they live but in a different apartment, i live with my brothers now, because they're afraid of him that he could do something bad to me. I'm very afraid and tired of being here, everyday is like a nightmare for me. I don't want to lose my life, myself nor the person that I fell in love with and I don't know what to do, please help me to find a solution to this situation.
My boyfriend and me we're already planning, so I could escape from here and get married, but I'm very afraid that they could found or for calling the police. Especially here in Egypt, the whole issue of honor so they can kill me, I'm horrified. Can you tell me please what to do"
7,"My dear friend had to admit her suicidal teen this week. He is really struggling with the experience and wants to come home, and she feels like he needs to stay in longer to get new medication sorted and some treatment under his belt before he should come home (he was actively suicidal and self-harming before being admitted, and spent two days on suicide watch in the ER while waiting for a bed to open up).

She is torn between his desire to come home and her desire to see him safe and getting his severe depression treated. She would like to speak to adults whose parents made them go through hospitalization(s) as teens to
hear about their experiences and the long-lasting effects of that. Is anyone willing to chat with her over email
about their feelings on the subject?"
8,"I had a vision of myself living on my own (with my dog) in an apartment close to work by the end of this year or early next year. I am 32, work fulltime in a government job, but I still live in my parent's house because of two reasons: I am still waiting to be promoted to afford a monthly rent (plus I want to have an emergency savings fund before I live on my own), and my mother is very, VERY clingy to me. 

I have been living with schizoaffective disorder for the past 10 years. Are my goals/dreams to move out a sign of delusions of grandeur? 

Can anybody relate? Any advice? Thanks."

10,Hi my DR wants to sign me off for two weeks should I go ahead with this?
11,Should I go off work or not ? My Dr has given me sick note for depression for two weeks and I'm not sure whether to just go in on Monday and speak to boss or if to give my sick note in . basically I've got mentally ill because I was working at one other site and they've moved me sites to suit an apprentice who could no longer travel.the site in particular made me really ill years ago
12,"Hello Friends.

A quick note about me.  I suffered for quite some time with depression. Most days I felt as if I could sleep for days, everything felt very surreal and confusing, and each and every day, from beginning to end, felt like a struggle. 

It all came to head when I had a massive anxiety attack while at work.  It was so bad that my mind couldn't shake counting it as a ""near death experience"" because of how convinced I was that I was going to die that day.

I can't promise what I'm about to say will help you, but I can tell you it helped me tremendously. 

I decided to learn a creative hobby, and I chose to paint.  I've now decided to live stream these paintings to help others paint beautiful pictures in a simplistic format.  Again, it may not be a ""cure all"" for you, but maybe it'll take you away for at least an hour.

I wish you nothing but the best.  Its a long journey, but stay brave."
13,"I needed to take an exam today. I studied really hard. Took the exam in about an hour, and now I'm just wiped. Does anyone else get completed wiped out by mental exertion? After one exam a few months ago, I was physically sick for two days after. If feels like it hurts to think. Too bad I picked a profession that requires me to use my brain....

Do you have methods of recharging that work for you? I've had some success with yoga."
14,"The dude said, we'd be redundant.

Why do I now, not care.

I guess this is the best place to say, I wish I would just roll over and die.

15,"I’m going to a lot of suffering, and depression. If I could talk to anyone that would be nice and helpful. I prefer discord but if you wanna talk here that’s fine. MSG me"
16,"I just don’t have anything left to give and I can’t take anymore. I feel both incredibly empty but also overwhelmed. The last 5 weeks have been the worst of my life and I can’t see a way out. 
In the last 5 weeks: I lost my job, was ghosted by a person that I had been seeing for months,  my Grandmother died, and I got sick (on my birthday- which was a milestone one). It’s just been hit after hit and I can’t see anything improving. I have lost every ounce of faith and hope. I’m scared to keep going. I’ve had depression for the last 20 years and I just feel like I’ve hit the darkest place that I have ever been. I’m really scared."
17,the bs of life. just dont know how i could be positive. my psyche issues are the part of myself i hate the most. just wake up to this suffering everyday. tired of it.
18,"I used to be able to work on large and epic projects. I was once able to self publish childrens picture books and create animated short cartoons. I used to enjoy these hobbies, but now my motivation is gone. Its been more than ten years of rejections from literary agents and film festivals. Why should I continue? Its just a waste of my time and effort. If I continue my creative endeavors, it just feeds into my delusions of grandeur that someday I'll become famous.

Can anybody relate?"
19,"So my name is Natasha, I live in the UK. I'm not sure why I'm writing this or why I think this will help. Ive attempted suicide too many times to count... obviously and unfortunatly to no avail. My last attempt was two week ago, has well has the occasionaal self-harm. I'm currently and finally under the crisis team after much begging for help with my thoughts and voices. But it's not enough they visit me at my home every week but it's not enough it doesn't stop the thoughts, it doesnt stop the constant voices battling in my mind. I have been in hospital once before after I was raped that was my first true attempt and I was taken by the police and sectioned and to my surprise it did help me get back on track with the sole focus on immediate therapy access and routines it really did help. I'm not saying thats what I need now, I don't really know what I need I just know I need help soon, now, before its too late.
The lonliness i'm living in is all consuming, don't get me wrong my partner is very supportive but he is also very busy has a key worker which I understand but he also volunteers and will do a friday shift at work 9-7pm then straight to notthingham to volunteer and sometimes won't get back till 6.30am saturday morning, I'm unemployed due to debilatating seizures. So, It’s a long time to battle the feeling, the need to end the so called life, a long time to try to ignore the amplified voices telling me to finally just do it, end everyone’s misery. I know and I understand he needs his works has his outlet for stress and let’s be honest he gets a lot of stress from me so why would he want to come home. It hurts because I can see that my depression and my suicidal thoughts are affecting him, I can see what they are doing to him, but at the same time I feel I can’t control it. I see him motionless, his misery, because of me. That’s what I have done, that is what I’m doing to him, I’m making him a shell of the person he used to be. So if all I’m doing is destroying the people closest to me why won’t they just let me go once and for all and end everyone’s misery, even mine, in a selfish way most of all mine. Last night especially was a difficult one, I felt I was skating on thin ice, I had the means in my hand and I was so close to self harming but I didn’t. I managed to use self-distraction techniques by keeping myself busy. I made the bed and got a shower even if it was 12am at least I stopped that self harm, causing yet another scar on my skin like the lines joining a dot-to-dot puzzle. I’m tired and defeated of having to decipher what is me and what is the voice because I just can’t seem to distinguish between them anymore and they are getting louder and louder. Therefore, I’m scared that eventually evil will reign free over me one day, sooner rather than later too.
I’m just so tired but not the sort of tired that sleep can cure, I’m tired, I’m tired of trying, I’m tired of letting people down and I’m, tired of having to fake happiness for the sake of others, to make others feel better while I’m still tired of being sad. Sleep to me is a wonderous concept, always just out of grasp. And if and when I do manage to grab a hold of it , it’s fleeting. Maybe I get 3 hours in one go if I’m lucky which lately seem to full of voices and vivid paranormal nightmare. Which feels scarily real till I wake up to a different kind of nightmare... reality. If I do manage to get peaceful dreamy 3 hours which is ever so rare, I feel like I don’t want to want to wake up because I was having a much better time asleep, which is sad and depressing in itself. It’s almost like a reverse nightmare like you wake up relieved but instead I wake up into a nightmare, I hate that feeling because I know deep down, if I really think about it I have so much good in my life. Kenny is my saviour and the reason I have lasted this long but if I cannot appreciate or see what I have then I clearly don’t deserve it. So, may be if I died, my organs could go to someone who would appreciate them, who would appreciate life and all it has to offer. Maybe if I did die, they could use my organs and save lives worth living then, then I would have a purpose and a brilliant purpose at that. Maybe I’m not strong enough which is funny when you think about it considering everyone say people who commit suicide are weak. I disagree, I think they are strong, stronger than those if us living for the sake of it in unhappiness... like me. Why can’t I be that STRONG? Why can’t I DIE?
Tomorrow will be Friday, those are the hardest days and the days when the voices are the at their most loudest and when I'm likely to act. Kenny thinks he has all my medication but what he doesn't realise is, he hasn't got them all and I can't stop. I need help, but no one will help so what am I suppoused to do?"
20,Hi I'm thinking of resigning from.job so devestated after how I been treated so badly any advice please ? I'm feeling deeply hurt cant stop crying so sad and upset
21,"It's been a beautiful day here with sunshine and warmth. Too nice to be spent alone, walking around seeing everyone else hanging out, playing sports, having picnics, hiking etc (more or less socially distanced of course).
This is just a ramble of my thoughts on having a very lonely day. 
I live alone. Most of my acquaintances are co-workers. I don't have a strong core of friends anymore and I'm wondering who the hell I can spend these sunny days with when we're aloud to socialise properly again. 
But I survived the day and kept myself busy with chores and walks and music. 
So if you're alone out there, I share my feelings with you and I think of you, even without a face or a name I know there are others in a similar situation and I want to tell you (and myself) that this won't last. 
We'll all spend sunny days with loved ones soon enough."
22,Looking for a ketamine treatment which allows people with a history of psychosis
23,"I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I have no confidence in myself. I hide in my room all day. I’ve never lived on my own. I fear losing my mom. I just think how my parents are getting older. I fear losing them. I fear losing my mom because she’s the only one I trust in the world. I feel like I want to die now because I am hopeless. I’m starting to get anger issues too. I am jealous of everyone. I erased all social media because I don’t even talk to the people on there. Some old school classmates added me probably just to have a higher number of friends. I was starting to get addicted to posting things and wanting Likes and attention. I did online dating and I give up. Guys like provocative women. I am jealous of these women who are confident and sexy. I hate myself and have a negative attitude. I want to stop therapy and all support groups. I’m gonna get dementia because all I do is lay in bed and look at my phone or sleep. I have no hobbies or goals. Nothing to offer in life. Feel helpless and hopeless. People tell me to get out of my shell because I have social phobia. My therapist makes me mad. She tells me to say positive things about myself and throw my hands up in the air and is forcing me to pretend I’m happy and positive. I didn’t want to throw my hands up and say I am amazing. Instead I looked down and got so mad and said I’m really uncomfortable and don’t want to talk. I have this immature attitude. That’s what my therapist always tells me. I am easily offended,nervous,shy,self conscious. I was in group therapy and I opened up about my low self esteem and regret it. They act as if it’s easy to get over. It is not just low self esteem but self hate which makes me hate everyone. I feel miserable. I’m also trying to cut out sugar,carbs,dairy. Because It causes acne and boils. Which causes low self esteem. It’s so hard to do. I have hidradenitis suppuritivA. I don’t want to be so negative."

I tried to contact my therapist, can't reach her.

Please someone help me..."
26,"After a horrible 2020 where I lost a sister to cancer, another sister to politics and 2 very dear people to betrayal, I have been performing a review of my life. I've always struggled, sometimes financially, sometimes socially, some people say I might have aspergers, I have struggled with school, I have a terrible memory and a weird way of comprehending things. My romantic life has been a long string of jerks and some abusive people. I am divorced but more like a single mother since the father is a very absent figure.

In my country I can't complain much about my struggles because I'm white and they automatically assume I am just a spoiled brat that knows nothing of life. But I've walked many walks, some of them hard choices, others apparently good opportunities that always come with many obstacles I've had to sort out.

I am finally in a stable job with stable pay and I am finally living in decent conditions. I rent a house, my car is really the company's car, all I have is a little money that I am about to use for a medical procedure, worn out furniture I wouldn't even give away to charity and many books, my most prized treasure. I am ok with all of this.

What I'm not ok with is people. I've had gender dysphoria for 30 years now, it took me a long time to figure out it was never about wanting to be a man, I just didn't want to be a woman because it sucks. The social expectations, the abuse and constant harrassment, vulnerability, etc. And it was always hard for me to relate to women. It was easier to make friends with men, so a vicious cycle started since I was 13, girls hated me so I hanged out with guys, that gave me a slut reputation that was completely uncalled for (I lost my virginity at 22), so I was alienated by girls, which made me hang out even more with guys which would in turn sluttify me even more. But I was always proud of how easy it was for me to get male friends.

Recently I noticed a pattern, after my (lost the count) failed attempt at finding love, I decided I give up. It's just not worth it. That was when I noticed the pattern, those guys that I thought were easy to hang out with, about 85% of them eventually made a move on me. Some declared their undying devotion, others took ""no"" very badly and stopped talking to me, and a couple did manage to get me into bed and then ghosted me, one after 5 years of what I thought was a very good friendship. My conclusion to all of this is no, it hasn't been easy to relate to men. It is easy to get their attention, phone number, start a conversation. But for this to turn into a friendship, I must first prove I am more than just a vagina, more than just an ""I'd hit that"" girl. More than just a f*ckable person. I am tired of people not seeing the other things I have to offer. I am tired of being dissapointed. At this very moment, I feel like I don't understand this world and I don't feel like trying anymore. I don't understand how friendships work, and let's not even go to the love theme, that is just starting to gross me out. I am tired of the importance of sex that apparently justifies hurting people to get it. I am tired of being judged by women for things I don't do and tired of men just wanting an easy time.

I think a lot about not being here anymore. I don't want to die and I don't intend to do anything to speed that process, but I just don't want to be here anymore. I feel like I belong in another planet. Right now I feel like isolating myself from the world. Would it be healthy to do this? Not as in taking time off, but as in devoting myself to my kids and my work and my books and just avoiding people all together?"
27,"I’m so fed up, my depression has gone on for too long now. Nothing is getting better and I feel like I’m crying out for help so much and no one is listening. Since the pandemic all my mental illnesses have got worse, I’m so sick of them! I’m trying everything my mental health team are saying but it’s not helping.

 Due to Covid, my group therapy is postponed until further notice, so it’s anyone’s guess as to when that’ll start. This lockdown is also making matters worse too and it’s also anyone’s guess as to when it’ll be eased.

There’s only one way out, and one way that this will all go away, and I’m considering it. I don’t want to die but I guess this is the only way. Idek."
28,"The two sides of the same coin, anxiety and depression. For me it's mainly the anxiety, at least lately. I can deal with depression, I have medication that addresses that. And it's been awhile since I allowed my depression to get out of control, 3-4 years.

But anxiety? What can you do about that? Sure, you can pop a Xanax, but that has it's own risks. You're limited to how much you can take of benzodiazepine medication. I drink alcoholic beverages to take the'edge' off, but the relief I get from them is short lived and you can't abuse it.

Really, anxiety for me is much more difficult to address. Part of that is my intellectual makeup. I am an engineer by profession, problem solving and thinking things through to their final outcome is what I do for a living. Turning it off after work is the problem, I carry it over into my everyday life. Catastrophizing has become an integral part of my personality.

I wish I lived with someone, that would help I think. Having someone to talk to, share your concerns with, would be great. I live alone and work long hours out of the home due to the Pandemic. The feeling of isolation and being alone isn't helping the anxiety. Anyone in the same boat?"
29,I have a history of depression and social anxiety disorder. For the last month my mood has been getting lower and I have extreme irritability around others. I have no patience at all and this is not like me. Its affecting my relationships. I have an appointment with psychiatrist in 6 weeks but wonder if I should look for an earlier appointment
30,Just looking for reassurance at the moment because I’ve not had much luck with other medications
31,I'd like to have a friend.
32,"At First.. I’m sorry for grammatical mistakes, I’m from Germany so I‘m not the best in writing in English.

I have a big problem that bothers me wow for already a very long time, and I just don’t know what i can do about it. it’s something that affects my daily life and my close relationships.

I think I suppressed my sadness for too long  and now it all turned into anger. My therapist diagnosed me with depression, but meanwhile I’m thinking that there could be something else too because the way I’m feeling is not normal.

I barely can keep friendships, I never had a healthy relationship that was without manipulation and controlling, the relationship to my family is miserable and I have very strong problems with getting along with people I have to work with, no matter if it’s in school or at work.

at first I will tell you a Little background Information so you aren’t completely clueless why I’m the way I am, or what the causes could be for my behaviour.

Since I’m young I teached myself that being sad means being weak, and I have to defend myself or have to set myself into the ‚I’m heartless mode’.

The reason why I decided to do this was my mum. She has an alcohol addiction since I’m young and she is highly manipulative. I always lived alone with her, and when it started getting worse the rest of my family always left me alone with her and made me feel like it’s my responsibility.. so I needed to find myself a way that it wouldn’t hurt myself so much.. and the defensive and cold attitude was the easiest way for me.

from kindergarden till now people always saw me as the weird one, or just the one they could bully easily.. and now, even when people don’t have something against me, I feel like they don‘t like me or feel like they wasn’t to attack me and I have to prepare myself for a ‚fight‘

I can‘t have a normal friendship/relationship, because as soon as i feel attacked (even if I don’t get attacked) I get very cold and push everyone from me away.

when someone really hurts me, I get incredibly angry defensive and I’m making sure that this person will feel the same pain as I do (extremely toxic I know) afterwards I feel bad but then I’m like ‚who cares this person wasn‘t worth my time anyway‘ and I suppress it.

i also tend to cut people to fast off because I prefer to stay away from them & the possibility doesn‘t exist that they could hurt me again and I Look/feel vulnerable.

when I’m normal I’m completely friendly and nice, but as soon as something triggers me I turn into a whole different person. I sometimes wonder If I really know who I am and I’m maybe somebody else but just try to act different?

the things that make me realize my problems the most are my past relationships / lovers.

When I was in Highschool I got bullied of the boy I love, and I really really did love him. After a while someone told me that the girl who was my best friend at this time slept the whole time behind my back with him, and I never wan‘t to feel this pain again. I cried so much at this point, and now nowadays i have such a strong anger against her that I would like to hurt her. When I’m in a good mood and somebody says her name I get so fucking angry it’s normal, my best friend says that she is sometimes scared bc I suddenly have such an anger inside me.

i also had unhealthy online friendship, that was mostly based on arguing. I met him only when I was 12, and we had contact until I was 16 (bc Then i started dating someone and left him.. but we will come back to that later) we always argued so much and hard he loved to provokedme bc he loved seeing me down and feeling like the stronger one.

So now my last relationship.
When me and my ex- boyfriend were together there was a girl (who was his best friend before) who Tried to tear us both apart and really tried to make everyone hate us. He told me that he would never go back to her. I have Generally very strong trust issues and I’m always very scared of loosing someone so I felt extremely attacked. When she didn‘t stopped annoying her I texted her if she won‘t stop doing it I will get extremely angry and she will regret it. I didn‘t say Anything more but she could feel my energy through the message bc the next day she told people that she is scared of me. Of course when we broke up he posted a new video of him with her and I got so angry that I called him and extremely screamed through the phone. My whole body shaked and I was outside with my friends at this time so everybody could hear me but I didn’t care about it. I told him that I will take every single piece of his clothes, will set them on fire and will distribute this on his area bc I know she lives there too. After the call I calmed down and became extremely sad again and felt like the person who called him wasn‘t me.. or was that Me? I don’t know"
33,"Why is it so hard to get someone to listen?!?! I can’t speak to my psychiatrist and everyone else tells me the same thing every time I talk to them. I need help urgently. I tell people I’m suicidal and no one cares, no one listens or wants to know about it. So I might just do it, this time it would work..."

36,"My parents and brothers are interred in a cemetery not far away. I can't get there as I have no car. I haven't been there in years, my sister just told me she went out there yesterday. This is too much she didn't ask if I wanted to go and take something out there. My other sister goes out there also she didn't ask me either. They both have cars and live near me. They talk to each other, 0ne sister doesn't talk or bother with me at all. I'm hurt, so disgusted and don't know why they are like this. Oh well I'm through I try to keep in touch with the one and all she does is upset me. The other makes more time for her boyfriend then her flesh and blood. I'm fed up with them if I get punished for ignoring them, I do.😭"
37,"As a young child I was always happy walking around without a care in the world. I would make friends with just about anybody that would talk to me. I remember one day at school we walked around the track 4 times, walking one mile. So I came home from school and told my dad that walking 4 laps around something was 1 mile. I believe I was about 7 or 8 at the time. So he said then walk around our table 4 times and I didn't want to but he forced me to and in a stern voice said was that a mile. It crushed me so much i cried. Jumping forward to when I was 12 as I can't remember much of my youth. This young girl about 17 years old nocked on the door and told us she was my fathers daughter. I remember she hung around for awhile and one day we were washing my dads truck and I sprayed her with the hose and she told my dad and he yelled at me for it. I believe it was a few months later my dad told us he was leaving to go be with this sister of ours. I broke down and cried for 3 days straight but on the 4th day i stopped crying and havn't cried about anything sense. That was the start of my mental breakdown. My mom was taking me to a therapist im guessing to see the effects the devorce had on me. But going forward a few more months the only friend I had at the time passed away from a heart condition. That was the final straw that broke my mental stability into pieces. Like a piece of glass my mind shattered into fragments. After that I only saw darkness in everyday life. I began to be bullied and school and getting into fights almost everyday. Around 14 years old i stared self harming as a release and when I was 15 I was arrested for having a knife on school grounds. The officer didn't care that it was an accident so he took me to juvie and i spent a week there as he waited till the last minute to file his paperwork. So as apart of my release i had to go to therapy and that lead to seeing a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and insomnia. He ended up prescribing me about 6 medications to manage my emotions and sleep. I was expelled from the school and had to go to a community day school. We had a few different teachers and there was one that i couldn't get along with and knowing the issues i had said that people with depression only have themselves to blame as its easy to be happy and its not a real condition. So the school moved me over to the credit recovery class as they wouldn't allow me to the main campus as i was expelled from a different school district. Continuing in this class one day our teacher was running late so they split us up between two teachers to wait for our own teacher to arive and they put me in the same room as the teacher i have issues with. I sat there on my phone as its not my class and I didn't have anything to do and she told me to give her my phone so i said no your not my teacher and I am in here waiting for my teacher. She said again give me your phone or go to the office so i stood up said f you flipped the desk walked out the door punching the wall on the way out. Now sitting in the office cooling off i felt mild pain in my hand looked down at it and noticed i broke my 5th metacarpal bone and told the lady I was with i think i broke my hand and she asked why so i showed her and she called my mom to pick me up and take me. Needless to say ma wasn't very happy but whatever right. So after that whole accident I was never put around that teacher again. Now 17 years old I had gotten really depressed and self harmed and took an overdose. I dont know why but decided to tell my mom i guess to say goodbye and she came in and took me to the er on the way i passed out and woke up in the hospital. From then on I have been in a constant state of ups and downs. I finished high school and went to school for automotive work and tried living my life. Around 24 i decide my meds wernt working anymore and stopped taking all of them and started to live a little happier. I got in touch with a girl I was friends with in high school and she had a 2 year old son and we eventually started dating and things were going good and we moved in together we both got a traveling job working together and traveled all over California rebuilding stores. We had a daughter together and now we are engaged trying to plan out a wedding. The biggest pain in our relationship is no matter how good she tries to make me feel i just cant share my feeling with her and it makes her pull away every now and then. I dont know if its the anxiety or the fact I grew up being told I cant have feelings or a mix of both.

Sorry for the long story and it jumping around but that is all I can remember of my life.

Thank you to anyone who read my story and gave me a moment of your day."
38,"I've had 3 bouts of depression and anxiety, 1 at 18 one at 25 and one at 36. The first 2 times I was prescribed fluoxetine, I got worse for about 2 weeks, then after around 6 weeks started to feel back to myself.
The 3rd time I was prescribed fluoxetine, this time it didnt work. 
It took about a year to find medication that worked, and a long time after that to feel any kind of normality.
During this period my brain wouldnt stop racing, my thoughts didnt feel like my own and I was terrified of every thought I had however normal. I cried daily and it's no exageration to say every second of every day was a battle. It's hard to describe but I really felt this wasnt just depression and anxiety, but that I had gone mad. I would be sectioned, lose my wife, children and job as well as sanity.
During this, every day at work I would trawl forums looking for a glimmer of hope, how long until i feel better? Are these thoughts and feelings normal for depression and anxiety sufferers. Which tablets should i take. What are the side effects. Etc etc etc.
I never was really able to find anything that would give me comfort or a light at the end of the tunnel.
Now, after a long extremely hard journey, I'm sat here typing this. I feel myself, no daily crying, no being scared of my own thoughts. I take tablets daily (venaflaxine - which finally worked for me) but now I am 100% back to 'normal'.
I hope my (very annotated) story provides some ray of hope for somebody somewhere outthere.

I've had a poster on my garage wall with a picture of Christopher reeve as superman for years with a quote that says never give up, dont lose hope and dont sell out, which I think about a lot, I even get the dont sell out part now!

You can get through this, be strong, keep going, seek help, talk to family, friends and your employer and never ever, ever give up."
39,"My psychologist is a muppet for several reasons but the worst thing he did was cut off my sertraline at the worst timing. I asked to come off my aripriprizole but they cocked it up.
Its unlucky that I am having worrying side effects. My jaw feels tight, not enough to bother me but it definitely feels tired and achey all the time.
I still have to wait for gp to ring him and sort it out but this guy has been so counter productive towards helping me i feel the next time I speak with him I will tell the pompous idiot that he is a detriment. Actually I have told him before, what I mean is I am going to cuss the guy out.

Rant over

Has anyone had side effects like this coming off meds?"
40,"I feel like I just can't continue like this anymore. To distract myself from the reality, I tend to surf through social media for hours, seeking comfort by paying attention to other peoples lives than mine. Even if the idea is temporary; It feels like such a relief (not worrying) that it's become more of a lifestyle, but whenever I keep my phone down, the thought of studying, leading and living a normal life becomes way too overwhelming that I quite often resort back to my old habits. I've been sleeping more than 8 hours during the day to escape the present and breakdown way too often. I have no direction and I'm completely lost and lonely. Lonely because I've pushed away the people I love, communicating and keeping in touch has never been harder for me. I once used to be a straight A student with high ambitions. Now in college, just attending the daily lectures has become a struggle, forget actually studying the matter. I've been battling depression since almost 6 years now, but I don't remember it ever getting as bad as this. I have a DNET brain tumor which will be operated on this may, to stop the seizures and medications I take. After the operation I'll have a partial vision loss for the rest of my life. I also have an eating disorder but I think I'll save those struggles for a later post. At the end of the day, I can't help but think, why me? It all feels so worthless, life feels so worthless, numb and painful."
41,:sorry: I don't know what to do. Really bad day today. I won't be able to return to the university of my dreams. Made a really bad application today for a second uni which I withdrawn from but now I can't make any more applications until 2022. I was all set to return to uni in my second year before I got cancer.
42,"I think a lot of my past depression has been brought about by making some bad decisions such as decisions regarding career, relationships, or financial matters among others.  There might have been good reasons why I was not in a place to make good decisions, but now that I am in my senior years I think I know a lot more to enable me to make better decisions, but have difficulty making them.

When things start to go well for me, I get nervous and uncomfortable and sometimes I think I sabotage myself so that I fail. For example, when I misplace something in my house such as  a book, a cap, or my keys.   I might spend hours looking for the lost item, but often when I eventually find it, my immediate emotion is not joy or relief, but instead I feel disappointed.  That is a very trivial example but perhaps is a taste of what I feel when things go well. It is like success is scary and not something that is good.   I have the same emotions when I get a compliment from someone.

Has anybody had the same experiences or can help me understand this?"
43,I prefer being alone more and more.  It’s gotten to the point I don’t even want to leave my bedroom. Talking on the phone - seldom happens because I just hate it. My patience with people is very short - even if I love them.  This is not living. It is hiding. Trying to keep my emotions in check.  Being with people - even my kids and grandkids is taxing. Exhausts me. 😕
44,"during when I type this message, beware that this will contain triggering content, you have been warned:
I'm extremely, deeply, severely depressed for over a decade and I'm still fucking depressed, I wasted and I'm still wasting decades and years stuck in life worst than death, I'm surrounded by the worst of criminal scumbags and the entire fucking country is surrounded in every place, the years in school was also a waste and I never could find a fucking job because this country is soo terrifying disgraceful that even the unemployment is one of the fucking worst
I'm stuck in this life worst than death for a fucking decade with nothing but criminal scumbags everywhere, they tried to fucking kill me twice already, but I also live armed 24hrs.

I have been trying to open an online business, I swear I did, but everything involving this country is absolutely the worst; not only I can't open a fucking business, but I also can't tell if I'm gonna survive for the next seconds, and it's been like this for over a decade all the time, I already broke everything that I could around here because I already have several panic attacks, I truly hate this fucking life worst than death, and I hate this fucking country as well
and I seriously don't care what might happen to me, at all, it's already been a decade, and I still can't fucking open an online business, neither escape this fucking life, I been waiting for the fucking Piece of shit of a ""government"" to give the money that is mine by right, but it won't give to me for some fucking unknown reason
I can't search for help either, I'm surrounded by criminal scumbags
as far as I can tell; I just been trying to survive, but I seriously can't tell how long I will"
45,"Do you feel that way?  Lonely?  
Are you lonely when in groups, or well occupied rooms? 
Is it all day?...or, just part/s of a day?
I get pretty long periods of it, just about every day, myself.

If you're able to come up with what to do about your own personal version of loneliness...what is it that you usually do?"
46,"My mother's love is overbearing, shows how insecure and afraid she is of losing me, makes me feel scared of leaving her for her own sake.

My father's love is scary. When I was small, if someone scared me then he would be violent towards them, he would fight people to protect me. When I showed that I was afraid, my mother insisted that he did these things because he loves me. 

I have 2 friends, one I feel barely connected to and feel no love from. My other friend is my best friend, though the love I reveive from her feels more like pity. Like she is aware of how much I rely on her, and she just feels sorry for me."
47,"I suffered depression for many years, this affected my relationship with people as it relates to performance in public speaking. The pandemic/lock down didn't help matters. Its the year 2021, I have gotten over this...I got a high paying job as the PRO and trust me I am doing really good.

I am basically here to help anyone live a higher quality of life and share with you how I got over this.."

Then when you finish and comes to your mind your reality back and feels like a big disaster haha

(Different theme)  
I have lately experienced some kind of an urge to drug myself into sleeping cause of my anxiety, is this how people get addicted to drugs?  To escape reality?"
49,"TW: death and suicide mentions
I am 22yo female diagnosed with anxiety and BPD.

I wanted to call my psych today and ask her for some sleeping meds, as lately I haven't been sleeping. Instead I spent all day sitting here, staring at the wall. I've read some post on Facebook about woman with cancer slowly dying and the incredibly vulgar and disgusting thought occured to me: ""I wish I was her. So close to peace. So close to being content.""

Last few weeks ive been feeling like I am balancing my entire lifes worth. Thinking if it's been worth it - what could I have done better, or if I should have taken different path in life.  It feels way more final thought. As if I was looking back at my life, knowing that there's no changing/improving/doing something else and just observing before leaving this earth.

My bf says everyone feels like this because of covid restrictions. I don't want to make myself into special snowflake, but I don't really think this is normal state of mind.

I am not suicidal per say. But this...feels like I am slowly dying from inside, and rotting at that.

That brings me back to wanting to call my psychiatrist today. Well, what can she even do? Prescribe me more meds so I'd feel even more distant and tired? Lock me in which I can't afford at all due to my job? Psychologists aren't taking new patients and I doubt they'd have solution for this. There's no solution. This is the only way my life was, is and ever will be and no amount of ""happy vitamins"" can change that - trust me, I tried. So is there even point in contacting my psychiatrist? How should I approach this situation? As I said, I am not actively suicidal. But it feels like I am sinking into some weird hole I've dug for myself."
50,"Hi, I'm just wondering if anybody here has tried Esketamine or Buproprion? I believe that after extensive clinical trials NICE has decided against the licencing of Esketamine as a treatment for depression, although other sources have said that it did gain a licence about a year ago, so I'm not sure. 

About four years ago I asked my psychiatrist to consider me for Buproprion which I had heard was being used by some people for an off-label treatment for depression. It was rejected. However I now read that NICE has approved the use of Buproprion as an antidepressant where a patient has not responded positively to the more conventional antidepressants. 

I am 55 years old and I have tried just about every standard SSRI and SNRI, none of which have been successful. 

Any feedback would be very gratefully received. 
Thanks, 
Robert."
51,"I find the only way to really deal with my depression other than taking care of my mental and physical hygene is escapism. im lonely a lot so im an escapist. if im not doing my hobbies or going out for walks i trive on the net by being on websites i like such as youtube or on amazon. i also escape within the video game world, the philosophical book realm and book novels. i live in partial poverty so i cant travel that often. I also live in a grandiose fantasy world where im a rapstar where i have women that love me. but i dont impersonate him. not sure if this is considered healthy as a lonely man but i do it. what do you guys think?"
52,"I have written earlier about my aggressive partner who would seem to have uncontrollable anger that would push her to the extend of grabbing knife for threatening, hiding my personal things, using foul language

The love for my kids and this pandemic compelled me to stay on with her but usually keep avoiding her through my 3 level home. The very moment she comes face 2 face with me.. she would find some or the other house chores to curse me or berate me. She hates me to the core but doesnt want to leave me. Many times I have requested her to let me start our separation.
She keeps harping that Kids life will get affected by this separation. Now.. I love my kids more than anything in this world but I cant let them live in this hostile environment where father just keeps avoiding mother and mother keeps yelling through the house. The reason I am writing here is to find if there is any treatment that I should suggest her before I initiate the separation. I have a big reason to believe she has mental issues and Here are the symptoms
1.. She has compatibility issues.. would fight with anyone she would share her house with. she never lived in a shared accomodation because of this reason. In fact she had torrid relationship with her parents before the our marriage.. She would often tell me about physical fights between her and her parents. She has conflicts with all bosses till date at work.. to the extent that she would punch them hard given a chance
2.. She yells and fights with our 8 yr old kids. She would even become physical by twisting hands or pinching them in anger
3. She would hide my or kids stuff out of anger with us. Will make us say sorry to let us get them again
4. She would yell even in the middle of the road or in crowded malls with absolutely no attention to amused soundings. 
She would even yell hard when I on my work call

I heard that medicines can cure such gust of anger. If thats true.. where to start with?"
53,"Several years ago I began seeking treatment for a rare disease called MALS (Median arcuate ligament syndrome) and was seen by a top provider as my symptoms included discomfort with eating and stomach pain. Within the clinic I had a Primary Physician that was quarterbacking my treatment. One of the steps involved going to a Psychologist which I was prescribed medication (Klonopin) to treat the symptoms of the MALS as they thought it was merely psychological (in my head). In December of 2017 I had an angiogram performed which solidified the MALS issue, however the surgeons declined to move forward as they had a different opinion that it was in my head as childhood trauma. This left me hopeless and instead of giving up, my family researched MALS through social media and was able to identify a list of top doctors/specialist that worked on MALS. I sought treatment with another clinic through a specialist (top 3rd doctor) and within months had surgery that alleviated the the symptoms. Keep in mind I was still (and currently) taking the prescribed medication (Klonopin). Given that the top provider refused to perform surgery which was done through a different provider, I changed primary doctors and moved to a different clinic.

I am seeking guidance today on how to remove myself from Klonopin as the side effects are not providing a good quality of life, and they were prescribed to treat the stomach issues which have now been resolved.
I do not know what to do next to remove this medication as it seems to have created/contributed to depression. As medical marijuana is becoming more widely accepted, I am looking for how to identify a doctor that can safely transition me from one to the other. The issue I am running into is when researching doctors, I cannot find one that seems safe from an eagle eye perspective. This means that the building/office looks shady or the reviews are not encouraging. I am not discounting that I now have depression, but the current prescribed medicine was prescribed to treat the symptoms of MALS as the prescribor did not have knowledge of MALS given it is rare and concluded it was psychological.

How do I find legitimate doctors that can help with this to transition off Klonopin and explore medical marijuana? I am not asking for names or medical advice, instead looking patient advocacy that can provide recommended online searches to identify a doctor as a conduit between the depression medication and medical marijuana."
54,"Hi, I’m new to this forum and come seeking advice please.
My partner suffers from depression and has done for around 15 years. He recognises that he is depressed and from the things he tells me (even though I’m not an expert) it does feel that is the case. I think he may also have underlying mental health issues that contribute to him feeling the way he does but he will not seek professional help. I have tried to talk to him about getting help without being pushy and some days he is receptive to the idea but it is very short lived and we are soon back to square 1. Has anyone had any experience with someone that won’t get help and how did you deal with it please? I know it is absolutely his choice so I’m not looking to make him do anything that he doesn’t want to, but is there anything I can do to help him from home? Thanks."
55,"tw // some discussion of childhood sexual assault

I'm not quite sure where to put this post because it is a thought I had but not really a debate or lighthearted enough to put in The Debating Chamber/Chill Out Lounge, so I'm just putting it here. Today I heard the Taylor Swift song ""Never Grow Up"" which is one of her older songs. I haven't heard it since I was probably 9 or 10 years old, so about 10 years ago. It's a song about how life is so much simpler when you're a child, but as a child you just want to grow up because you don't know how hard it is to be an adult. Not everyone has a happy childhood and many have their innocence stolen away from them very young but it's almost as if it might not even have its full effect on you until you grow up. For example the assault I experienced when I was a child was completely blocked out of my mind until I remembered it happened when I was in high school. The trauma was still there because I was deathly afraid of sex (still kind of am) while all the teenagers around me were going off and doing everything. I didn't know what was wrong with me until I remembered it happened and while it was nice to have an explanation then I had the memory of it in my head. I miss the years in between it happening and learning about sex because at least then I had no pressure to just be okay with sex. Things are better now because my current partner actually is asexual and doesn't want to have sex so I don't have to force myself to be okay with it for them. But it still hurts me that I've never had a positive sexual experience, even ones that I technically consented to were uncomfortable. Anyway, this song also reminded me of how when I was little I wanted to grow up so quickly because I was held back by my parents and couldn't do whatever I wanted. But then when I actually started to grow up and became a teenager I immediately wanted to go back to being a child. I was so innocent and even though I couldn't do anything I wanted everything was so simple. Every year I grow older I want to head back to when I knew less. My birthday is in less than 3 weeks and I will be 20 years old, so no longer a teenager. I'm still very young so I know years from now I will look back on these times and want to be this age again, even though I am currently suffering and always have. It makes me tear up just thinking about it. The only time in my life I wasn't suffering was age 11 and younger. The fact that I also never thought I would make it this far is something I should probably be proud of, but it just makes me confused because I don't have a plan. I think it's so odd how so many of us want to be older when we are kids but once our eyes are opened to how the world really is we spend every day trying to go back to how it was when life was simple. But we will never be able to go back. Perhaps that's a little too cynical but I think many would agree with me. You just can't return to the bliss of childhood ignorance. Hearing that song for the first time in 10 years made me realize that I didn't understand its full meaning as a child and now I do. A weird experience."
56,"like they have nothing to offer

the kind of person where if someone asks you what are you doing and tells you all the exciting stuff they are up to, your reply is well, I'm just sitting here.

I do feel like that"
57,"My friend finished helping me with a project and I was so elated. The end result is so good. For once I finally felt like I could accomplish things, I can get my life back together, I want to keep working on so much more. I noticed I got really chatty with him all of a sudden. I thought it must be one of my high moods again, which made me upset because that means the happiness isn't real. It became really hard to focus on anything and I ended up at Youtube instead of doing whatever it is I meant to do. I don't even remember what I was so excited to start doing.

So then I watch a video review of a movie I haven't seen and another random video, and both the movie and the random video's comments have casual sexism in them and...I'm just so tired of living. If everyone hates women so much then why do I even exist. Then I started seeing bad movies in my head again and I'll probably get banned if I tell you how they end, so to be brief I die in the end every time. It just gets more and more tempting every time they come to me. 

I am tired of everything. I'm tired of the highs and lows. I'm tired of the bad movies that come to my head. I'm tired of feeling like the only solution is to stop existing since people hate women so much anyway. Who even enjoys being a woman in the first place? Not a single piece about womanhood is fun or enjoyable and women who speak up about it are villified or told to stop being silly. I told everyone I was a trans man and they told me to stop being silly about that too. I'm tired of sex and gender being hot political topics that people who aren't affected by them engage in for fun or to make sure everyone knows their important opinions. I'm tired of having nowhere to turn to for help. I thought ranting here might help. I'm tired of not knowing what's wrong with me and waiting for professionals to tell me. I'm tired of continuing to see people and coming up empty because they tell me nothing is wrong with me. I have vertigo again and I'm tired of always feeling nauseous and dizzy on top of everything else, and not knowing why I have that either.

I was so overly happy and felt like I could take on the world, and I hoped it was real, and 30 minutes later I'm deciding I should definitely be dead. I'm so tired of this. I wish we had mental health teams in the US. I wish I had professional resources like all of you have, like a mental health plan or something. All my therapist told me to do is go to the hospital. They don't do anything. I've been there twice with heart palpitations or chest pain and they put me in a room for two hours, tell me my vitals are great and nothing is wrong with me, and send me home cheerfully.

Ok, I think this helped. Not sure if I should thank you for reading or apologize if you read it."
58,"Hello, I'm writing in this thread because I believe I may have depression. I've suspected it for 5 years now but I'm not sure. Allow me to explain how I feel:

It usually starts randomly when I wake up, I get this overwhelming feeling of hopelessness and usually by the end of the day become emotionally numb. My hygiene starts to decline (i.e. not showering for long periods of time, not brushing my teeth) because I start believing that there is no point in taking care of myself if everyone (including me) is going to eventually die. For about a week or a week and a half, I feel like I have a heavyweight on my shoulders, then it turns into stiffness in my entire body. Two to three weeks in, I begin to drop all the activities I  was doing, nothing is entertaining anymore, nothing makes me happy anymore. The emotions then start to kick in, the insecurities, the helplessness, everything kicks in at once and I usually have a big mental breakdown. Then for the weeks after that, I don't feel anything, I just stop caring about everything and everyone. 

I'm now a month into my depressive episode, apparently, insomnia is becoming a part of my life, I haven't showered in two weeks, my hair is matted, my skin is breaking out and flaking, my room is messy, everything feels so out of control. 

So I guess what I'm asking is, does anyone go through this? If so, how do you get out of it? what are the first steps? do you have a support system or are you alone?"
59,"I get like this a lot these days. Just now, I was watching an Animal Crossing stream on Twitch. I was feeling okay and chatting. All of a sudden, I start to cry. It might only last a few seconds. Maybe it's a few minutes. Then I'm fine again. This sort of thing happens most days. I'm not even really thinking of anything to trigger it. I guess it's just the sadness that's always there? Who knows..."
60,"It's been about a week or so, since my last episode hit me hard, and I have been thinking about it and trying to analyze the triggers that got me into it. 
I belive, it had a lot to do with feeling unappreciated in general. 
To give a bit more background, I have no friends, and live with a sister and a brother. I work and sleep basically, and lately after a few years of isolation I met someone I risk to meet cause she seem pretty good person, she's still haven't proven otherwise.  
So, in those 3 aspects, I had pretty bad experiences at the same time. 
.Work, have been bad for a while, i do more job that I have too cause either is done wrong or not done at all and I can't stand it, gives me more anxiety to see it unfinished or causing problems to car owners. And we had a bit of a meeting and I ended up being completely opposite of appreciated. 
.At home with my family, my sisters car got hit by a neighbor and he didn't pay us the bill in full, and I spend my money helping them out fixing the car and again instead of being appreciated, I got only complains on a repair that was actually pretty good and that I shouldn't have to had payed anything for. 
.With the girl that I met and have been the most attending as possible I have been rejected or cancelled, and mostly she's way to busy to spend time with me, either a message, or and hour in person. (I do know for a fact she's busy, she's not lying about it, but she's still pushing me out and denying doing so) 

So. I belive that was the 3 main triggers that got me into a close to suicide episode. 
Many other reasons affect me on a daily basis, but I control myself a bit better at them, and work the out."

63,"Have you ever had the need to talk with someone and dont have any, and ""loose your mind"" because dont have any ?

This of ""loose your mind"" feels like a ""break"" for me, something on my mind ""cracks"". Theres a point when you feel so lonely, the brain cracks, is too hard to handle, you ""loose it"". Really destroys me. 

The need to talk. Its quite an unique sensation. To speak out. To make sentences. To form an idea, using your voice. Imagine to feel desperate to use your voice, dream and feel like ""talk with someone is just a fantasy"", too good to be true. 

Just imagining how talk with someone would be feels so good.

I live inside my mind. I ""talk with myself"". I try to enjoy as if Im with someone next to me. I watch TV and I imagine tje comments I would say if I have someone next to me.

12. Me trying to be happy again in my old childhood house. Nope.
13. Me determined to go back to it signed back up on the waiting list.
14. This week we bought a dog to start his medical training. It's the exact dog I want. I got my vaccine. They said start looking for another place for her to live. It wasn't expected to happen this early.
15. I can't say no because if I do I will be still stuck here. I know we are going to be looking at places like group homes with people and staff around but I don't want that. People trigger me. I have no friends and my counselor only works two days. My family will never get me so I can't talk to them either.
16. My mom wants to turn my childhood house into a group home for me. My response to that? Ew. 
17. I am going to escape from wherever I am when it's available no matter what.
18. I am tired of letting other people choose what they think is best for me. If I can't make a choice for my own life I would rather honestly die.
19. And that's why since Thursday I have been extremely depressed, no appetite, not even my favorite things helping me at all. I am currently awake in the morning typing this for like the millionth time because my phone keeps pressing done when I'm not done. I don't know what to do. My apartment building is my dream home. I don't want to live at all if I can't live there."
66,The other day it was my birthday turned 27. I didn't get a single birthday card from any of my family. My mum has memory issues and suffers severe back pain. I was really angry with her and it took her a while for her to wish me a happy birthday. I feel proper angry and hateful with the world and the rest of my family now. I feel like shunning the lot of them and I feel like I want to go mental. I fed up with my life I suppose it's something I will have to get use to now.
67,"Just feel so bored of life i just wish it would end. i wish i would not wake up one mourning. same stuff everyday. just nothing new. all my family has a life and go places on the weekend while i stay home (what garbage they are). People are out there in life partying, having sex, traveling places, having a good time with mates. i have thought about ways to harm myself. i just feel like earth is a shit hole full of suffering. even though im a believer and i believe God is good i still have those questions in the back of my head: why is this world such a fucked up place? why is there such unnesscessary suffering here? i sure hope i dont live to old age i sure dont want to. this is what ill wake up to everyday. misery and my mental issues and this fucked up cancerous world thats getting worse (like the gap between the rich and poor widening."

70,Hi I am a young adult with panhypopituitarism and type 1 diabetes I also have GAD and anxiety disorder. I also have a slight learning disability. I have a lot of doctors I go to. Throughout my many schools the schools created something called a team that is supposed to support me. I lived in one neighborhood most of my life. We've moved out more than once due to my parents divorce but we have always kept it in our family. I love it so much. After a while a apartment building was built a few blocks down from where I grew up. I lived there for a while. It was the calmest and happiest I ever was. Of course someone always has
71,I'm tired of life. I literally feel empty all day every day and don't see the point anymore?
72,"Hi There!

    My daughter (22) has been struggling with depression and anxiety all of her life. Lately she has been complaining of some symptoms that have me and my wife baffled. We do not know of it is an effect of the two medications she takes (
Zoloft, Bupropion) or if it is a more serious neurological problem. I would like to know if anyone has ever had to deal with this symptoms, what have their experience been and if what type of specialist should we been approaching to help her.
I asked her to write her symptoms and this is what she wrote:

Sometimes I forget who and where I am
A lot of the time I feel like I'm asleep
I feel constantly tired and like I need more sleep
I can be in the middle of a sentence and my mind just goes blank
When I look in the mirror or see my reflection, I don't recognize the face looking back at me
Sometimes I feel dysphoric, like I don't belong in my body
I feel paralyzed, I feel depressed

Any help would be very appreciated.

A Dad"
73,"So, I've lost a lot in the last 5 years. I was in a stressful job, although not many people would see it as stressful - much misunderstanding about that work. Adding onto that was the restructuring at my institution, the worst in its history, according to my senior colleagues. 

Since then I found a way to go through the disruption, confusion, loss, knowing that I was put in a much worse situation than when I started. I didn't quit before the job was done, though, because I told myself I wasn't a quitter. 

I struggle to do my job with much less support than promised, while trying my best to contribute, to put myself out there, to push for positive changes. But most of my effort resulted in nothing, because the institution was still recovering, the timing wasn't right, or was it just me? I don't know. 
But I could see how the toll on mental health has had on some colleagues, and I can't deny it has affected me too. I tried to suppress those feelings to keep myself going. 

The worst consequence of this process is I have lost all faith in pursuing this line of work. After I finished what I was hired to do, I quit, feeling like I couldn't keep much of it. The struggle seems to have no value. I feel worthless. 

So I feel like my life needs a complete redo, and after a few months of stumbling about, I realise I want to write for a career. The only thing that I totally enjoyed in the last job was the writing, and it was intensive advanced writing. But to become a working writer takes some time, right? So I'm working on that. 

Meanwhile I've moved back home, feeling like an alien in my hometown. I don't earn enough, depending on family. I feel so much guilt, shame, and despair that the thoughts of suicide have come up quite often. I know this is the first warning. Hence I joined this forum. 

The thought of having to do any kind of work other than writing fills me with dread and despair. I have a deep fear of seeing my hard work resulting in nothing, because that happened with the previous job. I'm so scared that I can't bring myself to try for any new job other than writing, even when family and friends are pushing me to do that. 

And with writing, I can only write fiction right now. I've tried working on other types of writings that may earn me more money short term, but I just can't. Any time I tried to push myself to do that, the thoughts of ending it all comes up again and again. The feelings of despair, guilt, shame, hopelessness, indignance, and grief can be so paralyzing, I end up not doing any work. 

So yesterday a thought dawned on me: I don't just write to build a career, I write to save myself from sinking. Writing seems to be a kind of therapy for me, not just a way to earn a living. 

In short, I just want to write my stories, even though I'm not earning (yet), otherwise, I feel like ending it all is easier than going on.
I don't know sharing it here will help anyone, but I feel the need to write about it. I hope it may resonate with someone in the same situation. I may be looking for validation, too, the understanding that what I've been through is difficult so please don't judge. Maybe I also need that forgiveness from myself."

my partner has really bad depression after losing both parents, job issues from covid and has cut off all friends. We live together but he won’t even talk to me or look in my direction. I get worried I’m either doing something wrong or by trying to help makes it worse but then if I stay in the bedroom as requested am I then not there enough?
I honestly feel like I can’t win and occasionally have a cry to make me feel a little better. I have really bad health and unable to work so I didn’t know who I could talk to about it all"

i simply dont have the time or money to go to therapy. is there anything i can do to get out of this on my own? i just dont have any help from anywhere else. i need to sort it out myself. what do you usually do that helps??"

Sometimes I want to say/yell all these things but I never yell. I keep everything in me so instead of exploding, I want to implode (and [Trigger warning] sh sometimes but not now).

I had my first session with a therapist today. And I tried to talk, and everything was so confused in my head.
Past old/recent/present events all seems actual, and mixed into my mind.

80,"When I was young, I can't remember alot of why I felt these feelings then. I was about 9 when I first really started hating myself. I had 4 siblings. And i just felt embarrassed about every action I took. Every thought I had I felt embarrassed. By the time I was between 10 and 11 I would injure myself. I wasn't necessarily trying to kill myself, but I remember that after countless injuries the pain would make me feel calm, and I could be at peace. I'm not sure why I'm sharing this tonight. I'm just having flashbacks of my life around that time."

Im alone most of the time both phisically and mentally, i mostly talk to myself in my mind and that sometimes breaks me.
I have really tried these past six months to overcome my habits and dedicate time to myself, and even when i see progress the episodes have become stronger.
I've reached rock bottom many times but i have to admit i do not have the courage to harm myself. These past few days i been wondering why am i still alive when i see to have no purpose; all i can do is wait but i dont think i will resist much more if i remain the same."
84,"Ever since I started feeling depressed as a young teen I have been wondering about the following scenario: if a major disgrace ever happened near me (i.e. a fire, a terrorisk attack, a building on the verge of collapsing) would I really run for cover like most people with the slightest level of love for life would or would I just stay and stare? Would it be a quick way to put an end to my suffering without taking anything from me other than standing still?

Confused candidate focus, I was barley able to write some of my last posts!!! That's how stressed and freeking out with anxiety I was. I haven't found treatment obviously and I know zopicpone is not meant for anxiety but I can honestly say wow I'm somewhat function atleast now. It really takes the edge off and depression for me. I wanted to share this to get some input from people. Would this means mood stabalizer would work best for me ? Because SSRIs I've failed a bunch of them. See in this state of mind I'm in I see hope.

But I do have a good job, but I pay a lot in credit card bills and the rental prices for apartments in my region is equal to my monthly paycheck.

I used to have two close friends, but my psychotic and depressive behaviors led to one friend shutting me out, and the other friend moved on with her life and is now far away.

I was watching the film HAPPIEST SEASON on Hulu and it shook me emotionally because the story is so relatable. It sparked my interest in seeking friends, but it also made me feel confused about my sexuality. I have been having crying spells since I watched that film. I even felt like calling the suicide hotline.

Where can I meet friends (preferably female friends)? I feel comfortable hanging out with the opposite sex only.

Also, I feel sad that I'm already in my 30's and I haven't lived my life like a normal 30 year old should (live on their own, have a relationship, marriage, buy a house, etc.). Is every life different?"

94,"I just feel as though no one genuinely cares about me like I do them, and I confirm that later by how easy it seems to walk away from me. Im young, 23 years old, and feel as though I can't keep a friendship or a personal relationship for more than long. I guess Im the common denominator, but why? my self esteem is so low from it that it just makes it harder and harder when I want to open up to someone. I also feel that I'm constantly taking things extremely personally when the ill intentions weren't there. All of this triggers my abandonment issues that I have from my mom moving across country when I was a child. I feel as though I cling onto relationships that aren't healthy for the sake of not being alone, because Im not at peace with myself. My mental state constantly depends on whether someone is upset with me or not, and I'm constantly looking for approval. I fail to defend myself for so long that it gets bottled up and when I explode I feel guilty. Someone please help, I feel lost, helpless, and unloved. Ive tried therapy, and talking to people, but later I feel violated for opening up to someone.. And almost angry."

My anxiety is so bad I'm littery scared to go out 
 And the side effects of the tablets are making me shake my leg and punch out
 I'm normally a bubbly outgoing girl.  But life hits you... so much I feel I dont wanna be here anymore . I won't do anything stupid cos I have kids and grandkids but I feel worthless and I'm just existing  ."
97,"Why are some so in tune to mental health, yet others ignore it? I’ve tried to seek out help from my doctors past and pre. I’ve had pretty much all of them just brush it away like it’s schumtz on my face or something. The most ignorant encounter, was probably when a doctor told me I wasn’t depressed whatsoever. 
I‘m not a fan of the medical field for so many reasons. The biggest being-I was born with a skin condition that’s mainly genetic but, some cases just happen for craps and giggles as I like to say. It made me uglier than sin and unfortunately, made people have this judgement that I’m weird.

The condition has made me depressed. I don’t have a social life, I talk to people at work, but, no one goes out of their way to be my friend. I’m bullied at work as well. I live alone with my cats, just moved and lost my stepfather to whom I was quite close.  This pandemic has made everything 10x worse. I’m not one to freak out over wearing a mask-but, it’s fine if others wear them. Life is too short to not want to move on and have things open up again. Why when I have reservations made am I not jumping for joy and excitement for a vacation in June? I’m happy, but, not like I should be. Losing my stepfather was extremely hard-he served in Vietnam boots on the ground. We went on the Stars and Stripes Honor Flight in 2018. He and my mom were on  married a year, but together for sev years before that. My dad is in my life, but it’s so complicated. I want to be happy, I try to be happy, but I’m just not. I cry probably more than what’s considered healthy and sometimes over stuff that I deem totally and utterly stupid.

How do I get my doctor to prescribe something to help with my mood?"
98,"I’m really sick of idiots who don’t get how I feel. But I should keep telling ppl here how I feel right? Idk, seems pointless. I just do it cuz if I’m not here rn saying how I feel I will be planning to end my life. But I think ending my life is actually a good thing. People never talk about how the person who ends their life never has to suffer a second more. It’s just over with. They only talk about what they lose. But losing life is always a good thing, when your life is full of bad. I have my major issues still, with no help. I’ve tried to get therapy when I was younger so don’t bother me with that, and tell me that therapy is the answer. Great well I can’t get it. I ask for a simple thing with ppl. Just listen to my issues and hear me out, then give solutions. But people still cannot do that. They are so fucking stupid that they can’t do that. And guess what no matter what’s good in life I still have to live with these stupid problems. In a place I hate living in, with people I hate. My life has never been my choice but suicide would be a choice and something that stops the pain. But yet people say not to do it for no reason. People are stupid. I want to just kill myself I need to desensitize myself to people saying not to do it, then I would be happier."

I hate the fact that I’m still alive suffering. I don’t mean anything to anyone. I constantly drive people away, no matter how hard I try I’ll never belong and I’m just a pathetic excuse of a human being. I don’t think I’m gonna make it past this year."
101,Does anyone else have intrusive thoughts and then convince themselves that the situation has actually happened when it in reality it hasn’t. For example I will think that I have done something in the past looking up someone on social media when in reality I haven’t done that. Is this normal that this happens?
102,My agony has started when I came off antidepressant several years ago.  Brain recovery is very slow.  I'm a lot better now but I'm still not myself yet.  I feel impatient. The hardest thing was I was unable to find anyone with whom I can share my experience.  It's not same as depression or anxiety.
103,"Two weeks I've been taking Sertraline. Mood is improved a bit. February was rough, so I'm thinking March and April will be better. Winter will fade away, it is still winter here, but we've had a few good days. A bit of sunshine is good. Gonna get my walk soon."
104,"Hi,
I honestly don't know what is wrong with me so I am just going to be honest here and see what you think.
I used to (maybe still am?) suffer from depression and anxiety. After my first counselling, I found out the cause which was an unhappy marriage so I left my husband 2 years ago and am happy but then I was struggling with guilt because I have children and my husband was not being very nice and I think I had lost my confidence after 15 years of marriage so I started CBT therapy for a while which helped a lot so generally speaking I am ok I think.
However, after I split up, very randomly I started watching a Korean drama on Netflix and I became obsessed with Korea! Seriously obsessed! To the point that it is really bothering me! I planned to go to Korea last year thinking I could get rid of the obsession then but it was cancelled because of COVID.
Now, I am a woman in her 40s, have a masters degree and am a professional! All my life I loved romance books and romantic movies\series but I was normal! I thought actors were handsome but I was not obsessed!
With Korea, it's different! I am forcing myself to learn Korean! If a Korean celebrity gets married or dates someone else I get extremely upset and very depressed! I have tried to reason with myself! I have tried to stop watching these programmes or read about these people that I don't know about but nothing helps!
I am so disappointed with myself because logically I know how crazy this sounds and all of that. I dislike myself for being this way! but emotionally I can't help myself! This is making very depressed and I am constantly fighting with myself.
I know I can never move to Korea! I know that even if I do, the chances of me having any relationship with a Korean is 0 to none! I know that Korean people are just like other people and not all their men are extremely good looking or extremely romantic! I am extremely embarrassed about this post but I really need help!
Please tell me how to help myself! This is not something I can talk to anyone about!"
105,"Hi, am I the only one who doesn't like my own birthday? 

In the past, negative things such as big exams, my period, lots of stress always accumulated on my birthday. Therefore, I have big anxiety before my birthday even now as a stay-at-home mom that I'm supposed to clean out the house, get something done, earn an advanced degree before I hit a certain age. Every birthday experience in the past few years was basically a crisis. My birthday just reminds me I'm always in a losing race against time. 

How do you deal with dates such as birthdays that bring you down every year? How do you deal with moments that make you feel like you've failed everything?"

107,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety dec 2019 however had been suffering for some time before I finally did anything about it. 
I am just absolutely sick of it all. I feel like killing myself but because I have 2 kids I just couldn’t do it, I couldn’t hurt them like that. I feel like a failure, I always had such high hopes for how my life would be and I am so disappointed in myself for the way it has turned out. I had dreams and aspirations and none of them ever came true. I thought I’d be successful, living an independent, financially secure, happy life and it’s the literal opposite. 
My partner is a lovely guy but he’s just QUIT his job. Our financial situation wasn’t particularly good even when he was working and now he’s quit we are literally fucked. I don’t know what we are going to do - especially in the current climate. I was signed off work sick in January as it was getting too much and I was barely leaving the house and I’m clearly still not feeling better so in no position to go back myself.
I am just sick of my life being this way. We have tried so many things to make it better and to improve our situation but every which way we seem to turn NEVER works out. Always seem to making the wrong decisions. Sick of the constant struggle. Sick of being skint. Sick of feeling alone. 
My family and support network is minimal - I only speak to my dad (he’s no help) and the rest of my family are not in this country or do not talk to me. My partners family are useless and give us no help. No friends I can rely on. 
I just so wish my life was different. I wish I could go back and start again. Why is everything so difficult. Why couldn’t I have been one of the lucky ones? With loving families and good jobs and lots of money? It sounds shallow and materialistic but when you don’t have enough money for food it’s hard not to be this way. 
Sorry this post was so long I just needed to vent and get it off my chest before my head exploded!!!!!!"
108,"I’ve been depressed since I was 16. I was recently diagnosed with major depressive disorder in September of 2020 and it was not because of “covid” I’m on medication, I do take it everyday, but lately I’m feeling I’m just a burden. I don’t know anybody where I live except my roommates and the people I work with. Roommates have depression too so they know, and the people I work with are all men so talking to them is absolutely useless. Other than that I have 3 friends in 3 different states, and although they’re just a car ride or plane ticket away, I just need them by me. My mom and dad support me but they’re on the East coast. I have told my mom twice that I just don’t want to live anymore and I should’ve taken my life when I had the chance. I still feel that way. She told me if I do take my life, then at least she knows I put up a long fight and tried to get help however I could. I don’t have suicidal plans but if something happens to me, I hope I die. I’m sick of constantly struggling. Waking up with no one to talk to. Having to act like I’m just fine. I hate everything."
109,"Here, I don't remember exactly the last time and last topic I talked here. 
But quick, I'm on clinical depression, already tried many meds. No medication currently. 
I do a lot for fighting this, and after years isolated I have been trying to get some friendships and even a relationship. 
Point is, it's complicated to explain this depressive situation, and not sound or make it look like self-pity, you know? Or making it a barrier or a secret cause mistrust, and nothing good comes after it. 
So saying it bad, not saying it bad. 
I feel the problem is how to say it, isn't it?  
I have tried many ways, non have worked completely good, some terribly.  
But, we depressive people tend to be a little bit needy, and can easily feel forgot or unappreciated  you know, so, how would you guys express that a week left in completely darkness isn't like a reaction of nothing to us? If someone relates of course."
110,"Through some unfortunate circumstances and a product of my mind most likely, I've realized deep down I dont have the ability like a majority of people to maintain any close relationship with either family nor friend, romantic nor otherwise. I dont know if I'm simply just a maladapted human being with bad blood or genes in him but I can only ascertain from the insults of others. There is a depth of coldness and emptiness inside me that scares even me. I cant show my vulnerabilities I realize if you want to survive in this shitty world. Wheres the warmth of humanity? I dont fuckin see it. I only encounter coldness from others and yet they are so intimate amongst themselves in front of me as if to laugh at my pain. Life being unfair is a fuckin understatement. I dont even know if I want to survive anymore due to the harsh nature of this heartbreaking madness. I wish I knew what the hell is wrong with me. Am I destined to be alone and drown in the river while others bask in my hell? Maybe I'm just fucked up. Either way I cant say I feel any better. Excuse my rabid complaints. I've literally got no contact with people anymore and I cant fuckin take it anymore. I'm as low as you can get. Sorry about that."
111,"This world is not for me. Intimacy is barred from me. I'd rather take my own life than see another doctor or counselor. Theres absolutely nothing anyone can do and even if they'd try, they'll just give up like all the rest. I see this will never be enough.

113,"hi im new here. i came here because i don’t really have anyone to talk to and i just needed someone to reach out to. recently, living has began to feel like a chore. everyday i just go through the motions and it’s really hard for me. i also feel like im a burden to everyone around me. somehow i always manage to mess up things for people, especially my mother. i know that me being gone would make things easier for her, but i also know that “suicide is not the answer”. anyways i was wondering if anyone had any advice or something? i just feel so awful and im tired of feeling this way but i don’t know how to fix it. i just want to be happy but that feels so unattainable right now."
114,"Hello. I am a Christian in her 20's who desperately needs your help and spiritual guidance because from my family, only I am the believer and I absolutely have no other friends or close people who are believers, which makes it impossible for me to seek any similar help (and I started therapy because I couldn't bare the pain any longer).

Since I remember myself, I had a dream to live in the States and it wasn't the typical stupid American dream. I just always felt that I would be completely happy there - I loved almost everything there, especially the fact that I can share my faith properly. In my country, believers are not so many and they aren't Protestant - we go to church alone and etc. I had the chance to go there for Work and Travel and I loved it even more. However, lately, my only one dream to live there was completely shattered. No matter how much I tried all these years, there are so many reasons and personal obstacles in my life, making it completely impossible to realize. And I wanted to be legal, which is even more impossible since I can't achieve none of the things to be legal there.

I can't describe how difficult, devastating, and exhausting this is for me to the point that I stopped having meaning in life... Since I am a believer, it makes it even more harder as I keep asking God why did he let this happen when so many even non-believers successfully live my dream without even dreaming, working hard, and praying for it? It feels so unfair and painful since I've never made anything so bad or horrific in my life that would make God punish me or something like this. What is more - every time, when there was an opportunity for me and people around me to cheat or lie for something, I have ALWAYS chosen the right and truthful path, no matter what... and it makes me feel even more angrier, alone, and devastated..

I keep reading and listening that that God knows your true desires and when you work hard and pray for them, He will let them happen. And no matter how much I tried, my dream was shattered and made impossible. While I know many people that didn't even care about that and they successfully live my dream.... Why? It just doesn't make any sense to me... Also, I thought that maybe God has a better plan for me here in my country. However, nothing in my life is good here, not to mention to get better with all my endless problems.. My parents don't care about me, my friends are not there for me when I've always been there for them, despite all my hard work, I am treated badly in my work and it's an emotional abuse. And on the top of that - I am experiencing this hell all alone...

For me, every day is an emotional torture, trying to understand why did God allow my only dream to be shattered and as a result, to be extremely unhappy and devastated? Please, I really need your piece of wisdom and advice since it hurts so bad..."
115,"I desperately want and need to get sober but I can't make it more than a few days before my depression gets too much, so I go back to the bottle for some short term 'relief' but it always ends in disaster. The thing is, I just can't handle the constant depression. It's so severe. I've lost all interest in anything. I have no motivation and I can't get out of bed, which depresses me even more. I'm supposed to be starting a new job soon but don't know how I'm going to manage.
How do you learn to accept it?"
116,therapy hasn’t helped me not want to do bad things to myself and i’m loosing control but i don’t want to go in if i’m not going to get help because it’s so so much money
117,"Have you gotten to the point where you're emotionally checked out in life? I think I've reached that point in mine. I've gotten therapy, recognized the things that I feel and don't feel, allowed myself to express emotions I've repressed, and gained control over the way I think. But there are so many things missing in my life and that absence destroys me on a daily basis. I cry almost every day with that pain in my heart. So in order to help me function, I've shut off that emotional part of myself in my brain -- like a vacation from emotions.

It's made me afraid I won't feel love anymore, but I am very disconnected from my life and what I do feel, tears me apart. I can still feel things to some extent, but there's a lot I don't right now. I just can't keep hurting like this every day.

I've realized that ever since I was little, I didn't feel a lot of love for people. Maybe it's because I was rejected at school or maybe it's because my family stop talking to one another, but I really didn't feel much. It took a lot for me to cry. Now I cry all the time.

I'm not going to ask anybody to love me anymore. Doesn't mean that I've learned to love myself (I have not); I'm just not going to ask. I won't feel it anyways. That's why it feels like a part of me has always been checked out; I'm just choosing to be that way now. We'll see where it goes."
118,"Good morning all. I hope you are having a good day so far. I just woke up from a vivid and intense dream where I couldn't stop crying.

In it, I felt like no one would listen to me (my family) and no matter how much I cried and screamed, they wouldn't understand - they were the reason I feel like that. 

I just woke up and spent ten minutes crying very hard, because the dream felt so real. It also caused me extra sadness because it was obviously reflective of my real life and the extreme frustration I feel inside. 

I grew up with an emotionally unavailable mom who I still live with. She abuses methadone and it makes her extremely hyper and she runs around like crazy, mostly pounding her feet - all day long. Right now as we speak. It wakes me up and I end up with a bad headache all day. I have so many headaches that I thought maybe it was a bigger issue - but my doctor checked and I'm ok. However my consistent use of ibuprofen (I don't take more than directed) has caused some issues with my sensitive stomach. 

She is why I can't work at home, so I don't work right now because I am scared of going someplace and getting sick. Weird how I usually don't mind if I die any other time, but I'm scared of this. I guess I don't want to suffer if there's a chance.

I've tried talking to her about it but she ignores me. She scoffs and says that I'm the one with the problem and ""Isn't there a second in the day when you're not miserable?"" I feel like I'm fighting with a brick wall - she will not hear me, not even for 1 lousy second. This is why I have these dreams.

I woke up, fixed my coffee, had this interaction with my mom, and sat at my computer crying/sobbing because of that and the dream. I was crying at myself crying - like, I made myself sad.

It's so hard to live like this. I love my mom but sometimes I want peace to be able to work at home soon and just relax. I spent some of my savings on an extra monitor for my computer and keep applying for WFH jobs, but I know it's ridiculous when I don't live in an even semi-peaceful environment (our apartment is tiny).

Mainly I'd like to see if anyone else has had vivid crying dreams like this before? Ones linked to real life frustrations and constant battle with depression? Thank u xo"
119,"Hi, my name is Max (not my real name and it doesn’t really matter) I am new here, and just want to hear from people who also have depression and Anhedonia (emotional numbness, lack of pleasure) with suicidal thoughts.
I just can’t seem to find any pleasure in life regardless of what I do or what meds I take. I just hate every thing about life, work, the repetition, dealing with people, no matter what I do it feels absolutely pointless and I gain no pleasure, whether it’s exercising, reading, watching funny videos, gardening, even sex. I can’t gain any satisfaction and I’m constantly thinking about ending my life. I have been this way for about 10 years since taking antidepressants and I have tried so many medications, supplements, therapy, TMS and I’m honestly at my wits end. I don’t care about money, relationships, goals it’s just all meaningless. I don’t hate my parents but I despise the fact they brought me into this world. I don’t know what to do anymore besides ask God to end my life or live very dangerously as to quicken my death. Thank you for taking the time to read. Any advice is appreciated."
120,"I thought having a crush on someone was awesome, until I started feeling actual pain in my chest. I realised I have a longing to be with them. The cuter they are the more it hurts. That fucking sucks."
121,"I have a question, which I think only this forum can help me out with. When (if you did) you told your parents or friends about your depression, how did you start the conversation? I was thinking of talking to some friends or my dad about it, but I have no idea how to discuss it. I'm quite good at hiding my feelings, and I feel like I'm normally listening to my dad's or friends' problems,  and not necessarily talking about my own."
122,"So, about a year ago i finally worked my courage up and started back driving 18 wheelers.i started job making about $15 an hour.  I was pulling in about 1400 a week, and was finally paying off my debt. everything was going good. I conquered my depression, had my first child. Due to what I think is Panic attacks I lost my job, credit is now ruined. Iv started the process of bankruptcy and given up on my credit score.  Hard to talk to anybody about any of this. Every time I  look at my kid I just get the filled such a deep sorrow knowing that I can't take care of the them the way i should. now my fiance works 12 hour shifts to try to help keep ends meat and I'm barely able to watch the kid without panicking and needing help..everything just feels kinda hopeless. Im still trying though. the only reason I haven't completely given up is because that I love them, and I can't let my kid grow up without a dad. I already know how that turns out. Sorry for posting all this."
123,"Hi. I'm new to the group. I find it hard talking to doctors about how I feel so thought I'd try this.
I go to bed each night hoping that I dont wake up. Why do I feel this way? I'm married with great kids and grand kids. Got a well paid job. 
I dont know how to be happy again. 
Most of the time I hate interacting with people."
124,"Often when help or advice is given that sounds rationally logical, the learned way of thinking resists this and tries to debunk the story of the aider with undermining thoughts.

It has to do with self-preservation, the rational solution is often experienced as removing the last mainstay, the own belief that supports the last self-confidence.

This is often not accepted because it requires change in the thought process and makes the person even more insecure and thus gives even more stress and also does not guarantee success, also another way of thinking is a rather complex change that is difficult to apply.

A person with depressive symptoms, together with all the resulting complaints, often has an overload of emotions and thoughts, that a solution is often seen as as complex as the thoughts and emotions that the person experiences.

The thinking in depression is extremely negative and is also rarely able to accept a positive thought or belief.

The understanding that an outsider partially understands you better than you do is often particularly difficult to comprehend during depression.
 
A depressed mind often only produces thoughts and beliefs that are helpful in maintaining the negative experience.

It has the function of warning you that you do not give yourself what is required.

It is a long-term internal conflict between the feeling and the thought that his or her sense of satisfaction or peace cannot find in itself and looks for it in other things until they disintegrate and the process repeats itself."
125,"Hi, 
I’m new here. I’m literally at the end here and not really sure what I’m hoping for. My story is long and boring, I’m scared though, for my children. How am I supposed to look after them when all I want to do is die?!! I feel like my brain is torturing me, how can I end this pain without actually ending my life? I’m starting to loose sight of the tunnel let alone the light"
126,"So... I'm not really sure where to begin with this. Big wall of text incoming, I'll just say that. lol

Last year, my father was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, also referred to as ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In short, it's a neurodegenerative disease that has no cure, and it's progressing at a rate that even the doctors didn't seem to anticipate. He will be dead by the end of the year, is my guess. Now, I could sit here and reason out that everyone dies eventually and that, perhaps, I could be grateful that I had a chance to rectify an otherwise non-existent relationship with him. I just... Can't. Or won't, I don't know.

The stress is impacting me physically and emotionally, but that's not the part I'm even concerned about. I'm no stranger to physical and emotional trauma, but my little brother is. At least, not to this extent. He is 19 now and, of course, has had his fair share of troubles, but for the most part the worst thing he ever went through was being bullied in his childhood by me. I just wanna make it clear that, for the past 5 or so years I've been doing everything I can to make up for that. I digress though. Point is, I want to protect him as much as I can, but I can't protect him from this. Our dad is dying, and nothing's gonna change that.

I won't even go in depth as to how this is affecting my mother. She is a... Complicated person. But I will say that her stress in particular is being felt by the rest of us.

Even so, I know that once my father passes away, I will be left to take care of the emotional needs of my brother, and perhaps even my mother. I am aware that I'm putting their needs above my own, which is likely very unhealthy for me. Nonetheless, I want my brother to have every chance he can possibly have to achieve his dreams and be happy in life. Maybe I'm just compensating for the fact that I, in part, robbed him of a happy childhood.

Anyways, I grow weary of typing. Thanks for reading, whoever you are. lol"
127,"Hi all, I got prescribed fluvoxamine for my anxiety disorder (also some symptoms of depression). I started with 0.5mg as my psychiatrist advised. I’m on 5th day and I have horrible depression feeling. Like I’ve never had before. And I want to ask, is this normal? My doc told me that it might make me anxious so she told me to get 0.25 xanax when it happens, not that horrible thing. I wanna cry all day and be on bed. I can’t laugh, sometimes I cannot even talk. I was not like that before that. 

I spoke with my doc and said that she hasn’t seen anything like that before (fluvoxamine make you depressed). What’s your opinion about that?"
128,"this consciousness is SO difficult. things that are as easy as 1,2,3 are e=mc2. i feel like how smart i am with books is how stupid i am with people. i just feel so hurt by God, if there is one. I'm all alone, nobody understands what I'm going through. i CANT believe im only 30. i cant imagine another 40 years of my consciousness"
129,"I’m feeling pretty low, betrayed and confused. Ive battled depression for many years and finally last year I got treated and have been doing so well, I have been positive, goal oriented, I’ve kept up all house chores, college studies, bills, cooking and shopping for my family, hygiene routines, exercise, and significantly improved my mental health. 

Fast forward to today, I just found out I have hsv2, herpes for those who didn’t know. Ive been in a monogamous relationship for 4 years and we have a son who is 1. This more than likely came from my bf having hsv1. Ive never seen him have a cold sore and he didn’t disclose that he had previously have them until today before my appt... He doesn’t have symptoms right now. I don’t know how to feel if he was lying or not or it was truly an accident transferring hsv1 via oral sex without prior knowledge. I’ve said some pretty hurtful things today I’m sure.

Yet I feel as though I am so alone. He really hasn’t shown much compassion or understanding to how I’m feeling. Which confuses me so much more. Ive cried in bed while he did the cares for our son tonight and got him to bed. 

I have been reading on how to cope and accept this reality and it says “find loved ones you trust and can count on for support” and then I had to realize as I have realized many times before that that list is NOBODY. Not my parents not my sisters, definitely not friends and not even my boyfriend it feels. Not just for this instance, but for most things in life in general.. the good or the bad.  Now this, another great reminder that nobody cares truly.

I can feel that familiar downward spiral. My insides shrivel, I want to be alone in bed, only to get out for baths or a beverage. Poof my appetite will be on full drive yet I will starve in order to control the controllables. Ill try hold my head high for my son, my silver lining. 

Depression is such a funny dance between trying to survive it yet letting yourself go.

Wish me luck."
130,"I would have to say anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure."
131,"Hi everyone. I have some advice if you are depressed that I have found works and doesn't involve the use of drugs. Every human being has a talent or gift. And we humans are purpose driven creatures. If you can find a novel challenge that is right at the sweet spot of your interest you are likely to get into a state of consciousness that releases these chemicals: Norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, anandamide, and endorphins. It's commonly known as the flow state. All these 5 chemicals are pleasure chemicals the brain naturally releases. The flow state is the only time when all 5 are released.

In this state it’s possible that depression, anxiety and rumination stops. It's a concious experience where you become fully present. I highly recommend you research the flow state."
132,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this.

So, I have not been diagnosed with anything yet, and over the past years my mental health has gotten bad, and it really just took a turn for the worse about 6 months back.
I feel like I'm pretending to be miserable if that makes any sense. It's like I want to be diagnosed with depression, and I feel really guilty about it. I am aware that depression is such a debilitating mental illness. I feel like I'm just being miserable on purpose, even if I'm alone. I remember asking for help from my parents about a couple years ago, and at first my mom really tried to support me, but then after sometimes she started using that against me. Any time I'd forget something, or If I seem ""off"" she'll say something along the lines of, ""What's wrong with you, you're going crazy???!!, I think i should send you to the mental hospital, etc.""(In a mocking way).

It's making me think maybe back then i was just lying for attention, maybe i wanted to be diagnosed just so that i could not do chores or for sympathy or something like that. and the guilt of it all has been sitting with me for the past three years, but it just really got bad last 6 months. Like i could live with it back then, but now that there's literally no distraction I feel like I'm drowning in guilt. I feel like I'm just pretending now, like I'm just doing this to myself on purpose. I genuinely deserve to be miserable for what i did. like all this while, i've been so desperate to get diagnosed and now that I'm actually miserable, it feels like i deserve to be in this hole. I am a terrible person, I actually deserve to be miserable. I've cried for help numerous times before, but this is the most miserable i've been.

I keep thinking back to when I actually thought about taking something noxious in the bathroom, and now i kinda wish i had actually done it, I wish i wasn't such a coward back then and i actually did it. It would've saved so many people the trouble of hearing me whine, when in reality nothing was wrong me. Atleast back then I could laugh and smile and distract myself.

I really just want to go back and hit the delete button."
133,"My life feels like a big disaster and I don’t know why I was born. My whole existence feels awful. I don’t like to really say things like that, but it’s the truth of how I feel. Everyday feels like the same or even worse. It’s a 24/7 thing. My depression isn’t a thing on itself, but it’s caused by something else. And what that exactly is is pretty unknown for me. I mean, I have no clear diagnose. I’m afraid I’m a bit dissociating at the moment, which is one of my main fears. I have nightmares very often. Mostly everyday. I feel like that is making me lose a bit of grip on reality as well. Dissociating is something I try to fight against for very long. Mostly via avoiding. Not only that, but I think there is just something seriously wrong with me and that I need to hide myself from society. And I actually already did that for 4 long years. I’m 21 now and all of this started in 2017. Before that time I already felt like crap, but I was taking place in society. And I developed many things in those 4 years. Feeling like crap whole my life is mainly caused by my low confidence. Which is caused by trauma. And drugs gave me lots of bad experiences as well till I felt down in the pit. Mentally I already gave up in some way. Yep, I’m still breathing and suicide is something I want to avoid at all cost, but my motivation and hope is gone. I still do a sort of therapy thing though. I’m on meds as well (citalopram) which took a big effort to take, but no positive effects yet.. But the worst problem I deal with is that I don’t feel part of society. That I don’t feel a connection towards anyone. Including myself.

Anyway, I could go on for hours, but I don’t think ya’ll are waiting for that. I do appreciate talking to someone. Being so open as I’m over here in real life is very hard. Any advice is appreciated."
134,"Are you with no meds and no therapy ?

Meds, even if I have depression, I feel ok to ""keep going"", my kind of depression is not that depression that makes dont know what to do, be in bed. I never took meds.

Therapy, its not something can helps me. I know my problems, and I know what I need to solve them. Talk about my problems with a therapist wouldnt help me at all.

136,"Is it possible to manage and ease depression with medication only, eg just antidepressants and not any form of therapy?"
137,"I have had a few occasions where I have nearly phoned them but then decided against it. I don't know what to expect and that anxiety makes it harder. Do you talk about what is getting to you? I'm not a huge talker and need help getting things out. Will they ask questions to help you to open up if you give them a bit of context? For example if you say something like ""I have split up with my boyfriend"" will they ask what has happened? Or will they just give you time to talk? Thanks in advance"
138,"As the title says, I didn't want to post here.
I came on here last week in hopes of being able to just say something, but got emotional and couldn't.
I came on here and saw posts by people from different perspectives and positions, but it had got me feeling worse.
It's probably a common thing, to think that 'my' depression isn't the same as others' too.

I'm in my mid-20s now. I've had clinically diagnosed depression for roughly 6 years now, and was only diagnosed because my partner pushed me to see a doctor. My depression has been around a lot longer than that when I think about it. Maybe early-teens. But I kept that in and held myself together until I just couldn't.

I have an amazing support system. Partner, dog, family (only my partner's). I cut out the toxicity of my own family and have had relief and no regret since. It was the first step I took and maybe that's when I realised how depressed I really was.

I've managed to complete two degrees (in psychology too). My partner has financially supported me through the time we've been together (6 years). I have a home, a family, a dog and my (otherwise) health. But I'm not okay. I've had the long adventure of finding the best medication, and tried both counselling and therapy. The medication started to help the most it ever had, but then COVID hit and crushed all my motivation and progress.

I'm at the point where I'm surrounded by love but just can't help but feel like a black hole. I want to work, to help, to contribute, to be something, but I can't. I don't need to do anything, but I want to. I want to be able to. I want that feeling that I can be normal. Searching for jobs brings me deeper into those feelings of hopelessness and being useless, and when I try to move towards things I can enjoy, I can't. I can't find things I enjoy. I feel happy sometimes, but its not being happy, it's being okay. Okay is good, but I can't maintain it.

It feels like drowning, it feels like I don't want to exist. But I can't. I have a life that's worth living, but sometimes I wonder if the only thing keeping me here is knowing how much it would hurt others if I wasn't.

I've lost all the friends I've had, except one, and they're very supportive, but also very far away. I had only one friend at university and then that just disappeared afterwards. I have no connections outside of my partner and the people we see on dog walks. I guess my only 'friends' are middle-aged (mostly) women. I'm not exactly a 'friend' to them I guess, just another person they see often. 

I'm writing all this and feeling like I'm breaking down by doing so. Its like facing the feelings. But the hardest part is the feeling that it's all in my head, and that it isn't real, that somehow I'm just lazy and ungrateful. Imposter syndrome really hits hard.

I don't know what I hope to get from posting this. I don't even want replies telling me its all okay. I know so much about depression, but that almost makes it so much worse. I want to believe posting this means progress, but I also feel it pushing me deeper into things."
139,"Ive been suffering from suicidal thoughts for about 10 years now. Come close to acting on it more than a hundred times at least. Being someone that everyone see's as a rock, you cant do what you preach against.. Ever since the girl i fell in love with passed away, i cant get close to anyone. Ive been single for most of my time other than the occasional female that pokes their head into my life for sex. And i give in, being a lonely male but i never intentionally go for it. Its always instinct. The relationship fails, cause i want something real, and i fall deeper into my own pit od sorrow. Im that guy that always keeps a smile on his face, always looks to help a no win situation. I try so hard to be the strong one an make sure everyone else other than myself is okay but i never bring my own problems into other individuals lives. I joke about my hardships. I laugh at my own pity. Of course i do this so no one else ever thinks twice about my life an my problems cause i would rather address their problems than my own. Ive kept at least 16+ people alive because of my initiative to protect others vs myself but my life will always weigh heavy... I am a rock. Im always cold. I want to care for a female that cares for me but no one ever gives me the time of day.. I feel like a lost cause.. I become more a more alone by the day. I have spent a grand total of 7 years alone. Nothing but my thoughts. I play the happy guy, the smart guy, the independent guy. All to keep everyone elses lives on the top game that they can be on while i just wither away once im left to fend for myself. In all honesty, i wish someone would come and end my life. Id end it my self but my family, my friends, and everyone who has ever met me seems to have such an attachment to me that they would fall to pieces if i left this world an there for i feel compelled to stay. To me it just isnt fair. The overdoses, suicides, beatings, and breakups that ive walked people through have made me this saint among all an i really cant bear it. I drink myself stupid every night just so i can go to sleep. It goes all the way up to a 18 pack of beer a night. I hate and dread my life so much so that i pray every night that someone, anyone, will decide my life meaningless and end it when i go into work the next day. I am so very pathetic... I wish i had never existed at all. And i deeply hope and pray that when i finally do die, i get to be nonexistant. To sit in a dark void, never to have existed at all for the rest of eternity. So pathetic.. I want a companion so bad but i cant bring myself to even try. I push all away from me. I could look at a 10/10 and be like, "" well, your check engine light has these codes, but you'll have to research them yourself."" And even as i walk away from you thinking how incredibly beautiful you are and how lucky any man on the face of the planet is to have you, i think just that. That i am unworthy to be in your presence. Im just so worthless, pathetic, and deserving of the end... I hope that someone can learn from my infantile brain and insecurities. If i can be used as a lesson for those that feel similar to me, break away from this self hatred, and self loathing. You dont want to spend this kind of time hating yourself like i have... When every regret you have crosses your brain. You need to get help. Dont end up like me.. For me, its only a matter of time. Ive lived with this for 10 yrs now. I have control over my sick thoughts. But dont ever let yourself get to my level. In my opinion, its like creating your own personal hell. While youre alive an when you die."
140,"Hi I’m new here and not sure which category I fall within, as I’ve never been officially diagnosed with a mental health illness. However, I have suffered with issues for a while and although, I wouldn’t say any of one them are extreme it is effecting my quality of life.  I suppose the obvious ones are depression and anxiety and I have previously seen someone for anxiety and been on a small dose of medication for it, though that was many years ago now.

One of the main issues I have is a sense of wanting/expecting there to be something more from life and never feeling content or happy. It’ always been I will be happy once I have the job that I want, or I have my own place, or I have a girlfriend but these things have all happened and I still don’t feel any better.  There have of course been moments in my life where I have felt happy, but I can honestly say that I have spent more of my life (I’m 34 now) unhappy.
The issue actually gets worse when I’m in a longer term relationship and I think it’s because, as I achieve more milestones (buy house, get engaged, get pets etc) I’m conscious that I’m running of ‘once I haves’ so I become more irritant about what else is there left in life. I’m on my third serious relationship now and I have experienced the same feelings in the past and ultimately the relationships have ended as a result.  I get jealous of those that seem so easily contented and satisfied, feeling like everyone is able to enjoy their life more than I am. My life should be great as I have a good job, nice house, loving fiancé, pets, family, friends and compared to others I’m so lucky. I think that just makes it worse though as then I feel guilty for not being happy. I just can’t seem to enjoy things, instead of looking forward to a holiday, day/evening out etc, I just worry about what could go wrong and when I’m there in the moment I’m not really there most of the time, but just going through the motions.  Although I have been in several relationships, if I’m honest I still don’t think I have ever been properly in love, but I don’t think I am capable of it.  Moments that should be special just don’t resonate with me and I feel empty with no emotion.

I do also suffer with anxiety, mostly social anxiety.  I’ve tried to meet it head on by making myself do daunting things like festivals, stag dos and extreme activities (sky dive, bungee jump etc) but I still get just as anxious about going for a pint with mates at the local pub.  I think this has creeped back in now more so, due to the lockdowns and not being able to socialise.

I don’t ever feel suicidal, as in I want to commit suicide, but I do think about getting a terminal illness and feeling relieved about it, in terms of just feeling the pressures of life being taken away and actually then maybe I would finally appreciate what I have. I know this is a horrible thing to think/say, for all those that do suffer through this, but sometimes I feel like I would trade with them so that they can have my life, enjoy it and make the most of it. I don’t so they really deserve it more than I do."
141,"I'm having physical health problems and there's a lot of activities I can't do.  I had to stop working because of my health. I'm coping as best I can with this. 

Today, a friend said some hurtful things, this shocked me.  I didn't expect this at all. She brought up some things from the past just to upset me. I feel like this might be the end of our friendship and I'm feeling sad about it.  With everything else that's going on I'm really going to miss her friendship."
142,"Friday I have a therapy appointment. It will be my first in over 15 years. Things have been complicated lately. My mind and soul have been a cluttered mess. I have the best son in the world and the most amazing husband. My mom is ill and I have been caring for her. There is a history of love and abuse there. It's hard watching her slowly fade away and in the process I am crushed. I miss my dad. He was the calm stable guide. Such a love. I have suicidal thoughts but I have always just thought of them as thoughts. After all I am a mom, a wife, a teacher... My cousin and one of my best most admirable friends left us in December 2017. She and I would have heart to heart talks. She was going through a lot, but she had a sparkle and was such a role mode, only 5 years older than me. She was a mom. I felt torn but I felt angry at family who said things like the one who took her own life. That silenced me in anger, those comments of judgement. In some perhaps insane moments I felt peace or bravery for her. Still I want her here. I miss her. But, I understand and that is scary. I wish I could have been there more. I wish I were there. I was helping her help her son, and I didn't realize her danger. We think thoughts but we wont do them. That was my thinking. It stopped me in my tracks of the danger of my own thoughts. How could someone so beautiful, so amazing, so strong do this. I don't have answers but I miss her and more importantly I understand. I also understand that I need to be careful. This has felt like a crushing year. I want to be here for my life, for my son, for me. I don't have any bad plans. Today as I write this I feel like a fraud. I am feeling nothing. I feel distant from me. I love my husband and my son. I love my family. I love life. I don't even know how to explain me to a therapist but I do know that I want help and I want to be able to feel well. Yes, there are lots of things that are happening now that can crush my spirit, but even when things are ok sometimes I don't feel ok. There is a line in a song that I understand fully, "" You look really good down here, but you're not really good"". It's simple but it says it. I want to be good."
143,"There's nothing to look forward to, but another agonizing day."
144,"I've put off calling my local GP for as long as I can remember. Whether that is due to anxiety or just simply complacency with being depressed and not wanting to get better I am not sure.

I've just been wasting away my days not talking to anyone or doing anything. I'm not engaging in my university work at all. I don't talk to my family. My friends hardly contact me and if they do I'm usually too depressed to be bothered in replying. I hate myself for this because back when I was at school we would always get on well and have a good time.

Now that I'm at uni, with no friends and going to fail my first year, I feel like I'm  a failure and I can't do anything about it. The loneliness is the worst part. But having no one to talk to all day being stuck in my room not doing anything meaningful is the most depressing thing ever.

If you wonder why I don't talk to my family, I don't know exactly. I've been this way with them for years ever since I moved into the foster system. It's not been easy. I've always been awkward around them and always try and avoid them around the house. You can imagine how anxiety-inducing this is. I don't know why I'm like this, I guess it's just something I've grown up with and I have to live with. I want to move out but I don't feel like I am mentally ready with the severe anxiety, depression and thoughts about death that I face on a daily basis.

I miss being able to talk to my friends in school. That was my only escape from my family. Even though I had bad anxiety in school and I lost some friends because of it I could still talk to a lot of people and still had a close group of friends.

Now I just have no motivation to ask for help, contact old friends, etc. When you think about taking your life everyday you know you need help but I still just ""can't be bothered"" getting it. That's the only way I can think of describing it."
145,"Hello just wonderin if anyone has tried Ketamine as a treatment and what your experience was. 

Thank you"
146,"Today was a strange, if somewhat revelatory day. I came to the conclusion that I hate my mother. Honestly, it upsets me to say it to all of you, but I do. I've spent most of my life hating my mother, but I disregarded my feelings because I thought they were illogical. My mom's a good woman with a good heart. She's not neglectful or abusive, yet our relationship is toxic. Her parenting style stunted my growth. She's made me question my judgment, my feelings, my decisions; she's encouraged me to think positive rather than feel my feelings; she's made me distrust my abilities; she's filled me with uncertainty and insecurities springing from a lack of independence.

It's hard to explain my entire home life in a single post and I can imagine there will be people that think my feelings are unfounded. But I'm getting past that now. I forgive her mistakes, but not her lack of self-awareness. I've even wished I had a different mother because we are such opposites.

But what I wanted to ask here is how do you live with someone you hate? I can't drive, I can't afford to live on my own, I have no close connections. I spend most of my time with my mother because I have no other options. But I kind of hate it. We get along, we share interests, it goes well enough most days. It's just getting harder these days when I want so much more."
147,"The other day, me and my boyfriend, who I love very much, were having a silly argument. He said something which I didn’t like and it upset me a little, but instead of saying I didn’t like what he said, I said “I hate you”. I didn’t mean it at all and I definitely do not hate him. We have a very good relationship and now I feel really bad. Is it normal to say things you don’t mean in the heat of the moment when you are low? Has this every happened to anyone else?"
148,"I'm stuck on how negative I am. I feel like all I ever do is sigh. My sighs mean I hate myself or I hate my life. I'm so unhappy with the way my life turned out, the way I process information and just everything. I'm tired of being crazy. I'm tired of being unhappy. It's my lunch break and I'm just here wishing I could die somehow. I feel like nothing changes and I don't have any positivity in my life"
149,Humanity is an evil cancer. I want away from it.
150,"On paper, I have a very successful life. I drive, I own my own home at age 21, I've been in committed 5 year healthy relationship, I am training to become an accountant, I go on multiple holidays per year and have a circle of friends. Everything sounds great, but I'm miserable. I'm miserable by my job and money.

Since my first week at work 3 years ago I have been miserable. I dread every week and only live for the weekend. I can't live like this! I'm in my 20s, they're meant to be the most exciting times of my life. Everyone my age around me seems to not really do much with their lives. They all still live at home, don't pay towards any bills, work part time and just chill. So it makes it upsetting to see myself working 8.30 - 5.30 Monday to Friday plus having to spend hours in the evening studying. I don't even earn very well currently and my salary is only set to increase by £2k when I finish my exams in a few months! 

All my life I have been so indecisive at what I want to do. I have thought and looked into many options, from teaching, to beauty, to law, to police officer, to midwifery, literally everything! I get excited about these different jobs, and then a week later the excitement wears off and I'm back to square 1 with not knowing what to do. I have been trying to look for other jobs recently, but nothing is particularly eye catching and it would mean starting from the bottom again, plus most of them I have to commute for. A few months ago I finally settled on becoming a flight attendant, and I would still love to do that now. I spoke to a flight attendant in depth about the role so I know everything about it and it all just aligns with who I am and what I want to do, but covid!! Also the fact that I would be taking pay cut if I became a flight attendant which makes me anxious about being able to afford my bills.

Added to that, I currently work from home due to covid but with the covid situation gradually improving I am probably going to be back to working in the office within the next few months and that gives me huge anxiety. The fact that I have never really clicked with my colleagues coupled with how I fallen out of touch with my social side since lockdown began almost a year ago gives me so much anxiety.

I have felt immense pressure from my dad career-wise, but since he has seen me miserable he has seemed to change his views and now says I should do what I want and what will make me happy. But it's hard to do that now because I have fallen into the trap of being in a secure, reputable job which makes it even harder for me to leave to try new things in case the new thing doesn't work out. 

I just feel miserable, hopeless and don't know what to do. I'm at the point where I feel I will never be happy."
151,"I was watching this show with Dr Phil and he was talking about his philosophy on depression. He said something like many people who are depressed actually have real reasons for being depressed as opposed to having a mental illness (job loss, alienated from their kids, divorce etc).

He talked about writing those reasons down on a to do list then coming up with an action plan for each one and then crossing it off and that if you do that generally mood lifts.

He talked about how pain is a motivator for change and is not necessarily a bad thing.

Any thoughts on this?"
152,"Dealing with this now during some depression, suddenly or like past few weeks really, not much interest in the usual things. Just feel kinda dull and blank. But that's this morning, afternoon could be different with this weird moody business. How to re-engage some interests? It's getting boring here."
153,"I want to hear everyone's opinion about Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy and if you think it is effective and safe or not when compared to traditional antidepressants. 
1. The administration process
2. Side effects and safety
3. Long term results
Do you agree that this form of treatment is safer and more effective than taking antidepressant pills?"
154,Can you withdraw from mirtazipine after just 8 days
155,"I have been fighting with myself, I'm still kinda young, so maybe some mature advice would be good. 

Sometimes I feel as if there's only one thing keeping me alive, my want to be a mother. 

Everything else seems pointless, nothing else matters to me.

I ""fall in love"" quickly, but not really for the man, just in hopes I can be a mother soon.

I just don't know what to do, my friend is pregnant and i'm sooooo happy for her, but I have barely been able to function, 

After she sent me the scans I have been sitting here, just crying for hours, but honestly I am so happy for her. 

I am not sure what this means, why I feel so obsessed, I am not sure where to turn. 

Sometimes I think if I don't get pregnant soon, I just cant go on. My life feels like a meaningless ball of grey. 

Sorry I probably just sound plain crazy."
156,"At the moment I am feeling pretty low. I am not currently on antidepressants, though I have been in the past. If I can avoid it I don't want to take them again, I feel like they are a sticking plaster. I need to fix what is wrong.

I am very lonely. My family is very small and I only have one cousin with whom I'm in contact. My sister decided to cut me out of her life a few years ago and I respect her decision, though I don't know what I did. I was mum's carer, but her illness got too much for me to deal with alone and mum had to go into care. My sister would not help and there was no social care support. Maybe my sister blames me for that.

Putting mum in care wasn't even a decision I made. Professionals called the shots. Mum's illness made her violent towards me and others. I don't mean a punch or a kick, though these things are bad  I mean she tried to strangle or to find weapons to wound. She wasn't safe out in the community.

I know I could try to mend fences with my sister, but I do not try to contact her for fear of even more rejection. She dumped me as soon as mum went into hospital. That was a Christmas Eve. We were meant to have Christmas Dinner with her and her family, but she instantly pulled the plug on it. There was no asking would I be ok? Maybe I'm being selfish thinking she should have wondered if I would be ok. She had the perfect right to cancel if I look at it the right way.

I have a small circle of friends, but in my head I cannot look to them for support. They are all married or have partners and their own lives. If I tried to offload to them they might turn their backs on me too. There's only so much rejection I can take.

Rejection is a huge thing for me. On the back of that I don't completely trust anyone. As a child I felt rejected by my mum. I felt second best, like I was the test material and then she had the daughter she could love,  my younger sister. It could be said that I imagined it, read too much into small things, but at the age of around 7 my aunt informed me that my parents didn't love me, but that it was ok as she loved me. It reinforced my feelings of being second best.

I know I should tell myself that she was wrong, but she wasn't. Mum's favourite person on the planet was my cousin. He is around 18 years older than me. As an adult mum informed me that she was grateful when my cousin went on holiday with us because he could look after me. I was a nuisance as I was so clingy. My cousin married when he was around 19 so I must have been under 2 when he went on holiday with us and I was such a nuisance. That's not much more than a baby. What sort of mum feels that way about her child.

The other thing mum threw at me was that she never wanted me as a child and that she didn't want me now (at the time she was saying it).

Mum died from covid in her care home last year. I didn't cry much. I did what was needed and got on with it. It was and is hard to mourn mum. I've just recovered from covid. After a few days in hospital with covid a few new health issues were brought up which terrify me. I am in the process of having tests so do not know the extent of the problems as yet, all I know is that I am scared beyond belief. As scared as I am I cannot talk to my cousin or my friends. I am on my own with this. Alone with my imagination and fears.

Writing here helps a little, but how do I heal my feelings over mum and all the things she wasn't to me? I want to move forward, but it just does happen. I'm just stuck."
157,"This has become one of my very few outlets, where I could be real about what I'm thinking. I really dispise and hate people. Nothing pisses me off more than that happy go lucky guy going around the party mingling trying to fuck every girl he sees. I also hate the girl that constantly needs attention and affirmation, I can't stand it. I'm sorry if this offends anyone, it's just how I feel and have to get it out. Maybe someone will understand, I'm just angry at myself and don't know why. Only thing I can think of is that I'm not the man I should be and didn't live the best life which I had opportunities. 

I hate being around people, men just went to get into pissing competitions on who has the best story, who slept with the most women, and who is the strongest. That's what it's all about with men when you boil it down. Everyone wants to be the big dog. Women I'm not going to get into, but I've had issues there with relationships and now don't even desire to be in one. (Its been almost 7 years). Nothing brings me joy anymore, video games, movies, even you know, pleasuring myself. It's just one big nothing, an existence. I used to rely on those external things to juice me up and get the dopamine flowing, but that doesn't seem to be cutting it anymore. Hopefully I'll bounce back."
158,"just done with politics, the radical left has taken over, the NWO is close to world domination. i just hope a bus cracks my head open or i die in my sleep one night. i hate this world."
159,"(If this is against the rules of the forum Im sorry, wasnt my intention)

Im not saying like now or soon, but to know maybe some time we could talk.

Text to me feels kinda plain.

And I understand voice with a stranger can be strange. Mostly to me because english isnt my first language, and my pronunciation is bad, and also I have some troubles understanding.

The times Ive have voice calls with a stranger is like that, strange, rare, and doesnt feels great. Mostly its because I dont have much to say, and yes, its akward. I know Im overthinking about this.

But sometimes I wish I could talk with someone."
160,"I have many reasons I'm depressed - having emotionally absent parents and no friends to talk to is a major one. But also, I'm almost 30 years old (female), unemployed, and live at home. We don't have money and live in a tiny, dumpy apartment. 

It's almost always noisy, it always stinks from the neighbors cooking (which makes all my clothes stink), and my room is too small. My things are stuffed to the max in the closet and in plastic bins all over my room. I'm not a hoarder and I don't have that much stuff, but the room is so tiny that I can't help it's packed. I'm too old (and take pride in keeping a clean and orderly living space) to be living like this, but I have no money and there are no decent paying jobs where I live (but I keep trying).

I tried to do all the right things in life -- I was a great student, graduated university with a Bachelor's degree in Business, and I had internships and worked a few full time jobs (but all low pay). When the pandemic happened, I had to quit my job -- my company moved my work location to a place further away that I couldn't commute to because I don't have a car and there was no public transport, and they wouldn't allow me to work at home although it was a simple office job that was capable to. I was denied unemployment benefits, which I fought for 9 months. Life has been very sad. I know many people around the world are struggling, but I still feel so alone. 

My family never gives me credit for anything -- I'm never allowed to be right -- they always tell me I'm wrong and need to follow what everyone else says. I realize this means they do not trust me, although I've never given them a reason not to (never was a bad kid, never hung out with bad people, never did drugs, never got in trouble, etc.) 

We just had an argument over the new cable box. My dad is explaining how to bring up Netflix with it, but I told him it doesn't matter because I can do it the same as before (it's built into the tv). Then both my parents get mad and say I need to do it like the cable man told them. But that's not true -- I can do it the way I did before, it's not a big deal. Bringing it up through the cable box is slower and complicated -- my way is faster and easier. Now they're mad and yelling at me over it, saying I should listen to cable man. It's such a stupid argument from two people who never watch Netflix anyway and watch the same few channels on cable. But I'm not allowed to be right - I'm always being told I'm wrong. They don't know the first thing about technology, yet are telling me how to work it? I can't deal with this petty crap. It's why I hide away in my room all day.

The small city I live in is ugly (no scenery), old, infrastructure is falling apart, everyone is in bad health, weather is mostly gloomy -- it's a rust belt town in the Appalachian part of the US. There's nothing new here and everyone has an extremely negative/miserable attitude. Anyone I've tried talking to doesn't know much about the world outside of this place. They don't know about technology, travelling, any modern thing, etc. People here are racist, homophobic, and generally close minded. It's like being stuck in the 50s. If you express any slight dislike for this place, everyone immediately shuns you. This is why I have no one -- I hate it here and I can't help but express it. Maybe I was hoping to find a friend who hates it just as much as I do.

I had a relationship with someone who lived in a big city and a nice house... but when they came here, it pretty much scared them off. I told them I don't like it either, but it didn't matter. I don't blame them for leaving me and running, I want to run away from myself sometimes.

I was never an outwardly negative person, even as I've dealt with depression for so long. I feel like living here for the past 10 years has been the biggest influence. I'm as negative as the miserable people here - probably worse. This place is notorious for ruining people because if you're educated and capable of working a good job, you cannot get that here. You end up working a low pay, frustrating sales job in a call center.

My dream is to write, and I do a little freelancing online (I used to make a couple hundred dollar a month before the pandemic.. now it's no more than $50). I keep doing that as much as I can, and typically spend most days writing anything and everything (online articles and novels, mostly). I'd love to do it for full time, good pay.

My family laughed at me when I told them I was taking a trip to get away (couple years ago) and said I could never do it. I ended up spending a week out in Colorado in the mountains, and it was heaven. It was quiet, clean, the people were laid back, everything was new. I cried the entire flight home - 4 hours straight, because I felt intense dread returning to this dump. I spent a couple weeks in Canada too (Toronto), and it was the same thing. I loved the vast diversity of people from around the world and how modern everything was. My rental apartment was so modern and fresh. I came back here, was waiting for the bus to go to work, and a rat ran by feet. I wanted to end it all right then and there. I hate having to come back here --- I want to move away so bad.

I will get out of here one day -- I hope. But the constant lack of money is keeping me stuck here. Now I've been unemployed for almost a year and can't find anything decent. Even with a job, I was lucky to afford a couple cheap trips, though they took a year to save for. I can't imagine saving at least $10K to make a major move. I've never had that much.

Does anyone else feel like a negative environment impacts them? Has anyone escaped it? People tell me a different environment won't help, but I think that's entirely false -- it does help. A nicer area to live in, with more laid back people, and modern infrastructure makes a mountain of difference."
161,I don’t know what to do. I’ve been really low and it’s not getting any better. I can’t keep going.I tried things that normally help but nothing has touched this feeling. I feel like I’m drowning.
162,"Hi, I'm a new member and today I was driven to the edge and didn't know what to do. I texted a suicide line but they replied with very generic words and it wasn't very helpful. 

I've suffered with depression since I was 11 years old (28 now) due to a mentally abusive father. I tried therapies and medicine but nothing seemed to really work for me. So I've dealt with it myself, had better and worse days. After moving to UK 5 years ago it all seemed to get better, I started some self development, managed to find a path of career i want to follow and met a wonderful man. 

Right. I've met him though a girl at work. We were very good friends, he is her twin brother. It all seemed well, I got accepted to the family, we recently bought a house together and all. But thing between me and his sister started to go bad. She is constancy accusing me of having better life than her and not having a right to feel bad, our paths just went different directions since all she cares about it another man to shag and I want to focus on my relationship and study. I admitted this to my boyfriend, especially that she recently started to claim she has mental issues too and all she does is drain me by dumping all her problems on me. At first he was supportive and understanding but recently, and especially today he started telling me I do have a better life than her and I indeed don't have a right to be sad, that he just wants to shake me sometimes, that I tell him about being mentally ill but it's all lies after which he tells me I need a psychiatric help. If I hide my bad moods he gets upset that I'm not honest with him, if I'm honest and I admit I'm feeling suicidal (not actually planning it, more just really not wanting to be alive) or that I self harm, he says I'm threatening him. I asked if he ever did any research or if he ever thinks that what he says is hurting me and basically is an unsolicited advicw. He said he didn't and I give unsolicited advices about myself because I am living in 'our lovely house' and I don't have to work because I'm furloughed due to covid or worry about anything. I said that it doesn't matter and that I do appreciate him and our house but it doesn't change that I can't look in the mirror without feeling repulsed. I also said that we both need to change and if it's not going to happen, it's probably better if we go separate ways because I can't deal with this situation repeating itself all over again.
He repeated that I'm threatening him and that sometimes he feels like I don't love him at all.

I feel hopeless, I shouldn't be carrying myself and him at the same time. I refuse to feel guilty and he refuses to learn about my state or how to help. Normally he's extremely loving and supportive, I don't know why he reacts to my lows like this..."

164,"Hi everyone, i just want some general advice if possible about my mental health.

Im 35 and have always been a strong minded person and never really suffered with any sort of ""clinical"" mental health issues.

Recently my company has been struggling so im having to take on a lot of responsability, ive recently not been sleeping and have been finding my head to be cloudy all the time, i find im losing my temper more and more, the every day things in work are stressing me out.

My family has a history of servere mental illness, before my mum passed away her physiatrist told me she was one of the most severe cases of schizophrenia he had ever seen, my uncles also suffers with schizophrenia to a lesser degree.

My issues in my business are un solvable at this point, as the other 2 directors are either unwilling or un knowledgable to do my task, i want to walk away from my company as im worried my mental health is slipping, i spoke to my gp and he thinks im fine, i just need to tackle the sleep issue.

Now if im honest, im not fine, ive not taken a day off in 2 years, and when i took 1 day off through illness i was called in within 4 hours to do a task no one else could do.

My worry is if i walk away the company will fail, but my other worry is if i don't walk away i will mentally fail.

i want to avoid meds as much as possible as i can see the harm it did to my mum, but on the other hand how necessary it can be.

ive asked my friends for help, but they dont seem to want to or know how to.

even coping technics would help me, im so sorry for being so narcissistic like this, i just dont know what to do."

166,"Hey everyone. I need help.

It's been a few months since I started my job as a Sales Executive. I've been talking to a lot of clients without having problems. All of the sudden, I've lost my interest in everything. Including my job and my hobbies. My boyfriend also asked for ""cool-off"" or temporary break-up which might also added to the cause of my depression. I have talked to my friends and asked for their advice but it didn't help me. I do have a family but I don't wanna bother them with my own problems. I've been hiding my issues for a month now. I feel empty, like something is missing. I feel exhausted without doing anything. I don't know what to do. I can't even distract myself."
167,"I’ve been prone to depression and anxiety over the years. I seem to take on a lot of stress and occasionally I just have bubbled over.

The stress of the last year has really taken its toll on me and unfortunately my marriage ended up being a casualty. In January my partner moved out from the family home because I felt like I was being suffocated to be a certain way around him. I didn’t really see it at the time but now he’s gone; I can see that the depression made me withdraw thus making him go on the defence for why I was being like that. We decided to separate despite both loving eachother. Decided it would give me head space and clarity and it has helped me see what was going on but now I have severe anxiety and depression creeping in because I know that this wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t poorly. My partner is being very “arms length” and it’s making me so anxious and depressed that I feel like we won’t sort it out and get back together. I can feel myself slipping into a black hole because it’s all my fault and I’ve put us all through this because of my depression. I don’t want to speak to anyone I know, I don’t want to reach out to anyone because I just want to hide away. I didn’t have many friends anyway as I find people generally quite disappointing and fake but the ones I did have; have seemingly blanked me after initially trying to reach out and say I’m struggling. I just feel very alone and I have 2 special needs children too so I feel like I’m drowning and lost the one person that was my best friend and soul mate :("
168,"Hello everyone, I had my first online therapy session, today. I was going all over the place in it. I started with my Personality Issues then suddenly jumped up at OCD, then my Emotional State, etc. My therapist told me that there are quite a number of issues which would require time to be addressed.

For a year, I was so much into this pit of sadness and negativity that I just let go control of myself. I let whatever that was/is happening to me. However, I did try to get my shit together at first but didn't able to, even after trying a lot and lot. So I stopped trying to take back control of my life. But today after the first session, I somewhere felt that it is me who has made the mistake of deciding to give up and lose control in the first place, thereby losing clarity in life. So I have decided to take the straps of my life in my hands again assuming that this will fix everything up. But...

Why did I start therapy then if it was as simple as being responsible for my own life? I have no idea. It has been happening to me every morning for a year. I wake up all clear headed and I'm like: ""Okay! Everything is Fine. I don't need therapy."" Then on the same day after a while, I fall into this sadness pit again where I'm seeking help. Then, the cycle continues the next day.

Now, my confusion (question) is:


Do I really need therapy or just taking back the control over my life by myself would do it? Because I don't know if my emotions should be validated by someone or not. Maybe I should stop being weak and stop entertaining certain thoughts and it will fix things up. But I am also scared what if it's like putting these things under the carpet but not a permanent solution. But I also do not want to be weak and needy tbh.
Even a year ago, when I was doing good in my life, I felt that I was not doing much. Like all of my time is getting wasted somewhere. I was too hard on myself and felt worthless at end of the day. I was putting limits on myself on what I can and cannot do. Even being aware of me putting limits, I couldn't break through it. That was a year ago, though.
Discussing my family with a therapist felt kind of weird to me. It's like I am putting my family in front of someone so that person can judge them. Not a good feeling, really.

Right now, what I am going through is confusion, anxiety, difficulty in understanding, some OCD, slowness in daily chores, feeling guilty (due to family relationships), loss in interest, negative mindset, etc.

If you have made this far, please give your opinion to the above stated facts in numbers.

Thank you!"
169,"So confused i split with my kids dad 4 weeks ago, im tg o concentrate on my kids and myself and move on in the meantime hes acting like hes trying to get my attention again? Any thurts tia"
170,I've been having a hard time feeling motivated lately. Chores are left undone. I used to enjoy practicing guitar and working on projects around the house. Now I feel tired a lot and just can't get motivated to do as much as I used to.  I feel bad about it. Chores and projects are piling up and it just seems daunting. Dealing with depression is tough.  What do you do when your motivation is low?
171,I am negative. I'm looking for others on the forum to connect with that are also negative. Message me
172,"i've seen lots of posts about pandemic , but for me personally pandemic havent changed a bit in my life i just keep spending days at home terrified of going out to socialize or do smth else . How for u pandemic changed things in life ?"
173,I am unable to feel compation or love . It s like anger and sadness are the only emotions i know. But it s crazy how good i am at faking it. Like no one could tell. But that mask kind of wear off at home. Like my parents can kind off tell. But everytime i manage to make them forget about it. To be honnest i only care about myself like i don t think i ll mind being alone it s like everyone in my life don t even matter .what s wrong with me ?
174,"Hello! 

Several times I tried to share my story here and I never know where to start, and always deleting the post before sharing it. So, I will start with what happened recently. Last month I attempted suicide for the first time, because, simply, I was hopeless and powerless to continue living this way. Living everyday is suffering, but now I know that to die is not the solution. I have cut all the social connections(which there were not many) and I live with my parents. 
I am refugee, civil war survivor and I left my country after my older brother was killed. Since then, the suffering has not left me. I have been to therapists and psychiatrists  and have been in several medications for years but I hardly feel that they helped me in anyway. Now I feel that I am in a limbo, and I do not know what to do.
Please do not feel sorry for me or anything, because I feel like a ghost in a nobody's land."
175,"I hate life so much.No one ever understands how bad I feel.I have so many problems and difficulties which I can never sort.I try telling gp how suicidal I feel at times but they never understand when I try to explain I'm scared incase I harm myself or kill myself.I want to be here for my daughters, but sometimes I feel I won't be able to stop my suicide
Feelings taken over.As sometimes they feel so strong that I won't be able to help myself.But they never understand.Im so scared incase I will be taken over by my negative thoughts and compulsion to end it.i don't know how to get them to understand.They say when you need help to ask.But all the gp does is give me phone numbers or websites to contact.I was wondering if anyone else out there can relate to how I feel.I don't want to  go on anymore."
176,Everything is dumb. Going to school to get a job to work the rest of your life just to have the government take back all your money through loans and taxes is stupid. Perpetual debt to satisfy everyone's stupid need for this stupid world we live in. Everything is just so stupid and I'm so pissed. Everything is a problem and stupid
177,"Ever since I started a benzodiazapine it has made my depression worse. I wish I never took it my doctor said to try it. After a few weeks I was hooked. Taking a benzo never did make me feel happier. I'm going through derealization, depression, physical anxiety. It's horrible coming off this stupid drug. I want to be happy again i don't know of I can go back to that. Day in and out is misery. I want to play an onli e video game or do somerhi g I use to enjoy. Now I can't because the depression and derealization is so bad I can't concentrate."
178,"It used to be easy to fake a smile and tell everyone I'm okay and now when I need to most I can't. It's taking so much for me to continue. I'm paranoid everyone is talking about me behind my back, im trying so hard to be this happy character but all I can think of is negative thoughts. I've tried all the techniques I've used in the past but nothing is working. I'm losing control 😔"
179,I am not sure what to say besides the past year I've been majorly depressed. I gave Zoloft and 2 SSRIs a shot and they did not help much. I'm thinking I could try buspar. Because at this point talking and therapy is not strong enough
180,"I go out very little from my house. I barely talk with people, only my family and when I have to buy something.

I know Im very detached from ""reality"", I have my periods when I live full inside my fantasies, and then I come back to reality.

And when that happens feels eye opening, like ""oh, I spent too much time inside my dream"".

I dont have schizophrenia, in case someone thinks this sounds like that. Its just I dont have anything to be attached, so much time alone, without anyone to talk, my mind its just in a spiral, alone, so the mind starts getting stressed and confused.

After long periods of be inside my house and go outside, the outside feels so... ""amazing"". Its mind blowing spend so much time at home and then see the outside again.

I didnt used to be like this. I had my problems in the past, but I didnt have this kind of ""agoraphobic"" feeling.

Just in case, Im not concern about this, its not a kind of feeling stops me to go out or any like that.

Im so tired to have to talk with people. People see me cold, and sometimes disrespectful. Even go to the bakery and talk about my order feels tiresome. Im just too tired all the time, with no mood. So I try to go to places where you just pick your stuff and pay it at the end.

Anyway, live inside fantasies became the only way to cope , because without fantasies I dont have anything left, it would be just stare at the wall in silent."
181,"Do you ever just feel as though the saying “things happen for a reason” is bull… I have been through a lot of horrible stuff and somedays I feel it made me stronger and then others I am like what the hell why did this happen to me and what did I do to deserve it. Then good stuff happens and I am back to ""things happen for a reason""... I have been feeling much better in life and in general and I think things are looking up but this still crosses my mind often just wanted to hear your thoughts…"
182,"I have never had job since leaving college 1.5 years ago. Apart from some part time fulfillment for a week last year. The thing is I don't even want a job but that's life, I need money. I don't want to work 9-5 everyday, It sounds exhausting. I get tired just getting up some days. There is no jobs that look enjoyable either, they all sound horrible. I'll hate whatever I find.

My family hate me for not having a job, they keep telling me ""get any job"". I don't want to work in retail. I'm smart, have 8 GCSEs and a university degree. I have social anxiety too though, its better now but makes things hard. I'm just tired all the time and I can't sleep if I know I have to get up early. My family keep saying ""once you have a job you will be so tired you will sleep"" but no I won't I'm tired now and I don't sleep. If I'm anxious about sleeping then I just won't sleep no matter how exhausted I am. 

I'm getting help from a local charity for people with disabilities and mental health issues. They get to know you and help you find a job that suits you. The waiting list is 5 months though and I'm still 2 months away for getting appointed someone. I go every two weeks at the moment to a club where they help me with my CV and I do online courses to add to it. It's still not good enough for my family though they say its taking too long, and I should just find a job myself. I get £80 a week in benefit so I have money to contribute but my family don't want any. Just feel like I have hit a dead end in life and I won't be capable of working."
183,I find myself lacking motivation to do anything that isn't essential. I do my job because I have to but anything that isn't essential or doesn't have consequences if I don't do it is completely out of the window. Stuff that I'm trying to learn for example... I pick up course books and then put them down a minute or so later because I just can't be bothered. I'm probably wasting 95% of each day doing nothing. Anyone else been there and how can I break out of this?
184,"truth is 'snapping out of it' does work if your serotonin is only a little bit low. going out and talking to people etc.. can raise the sertonin enough to ""snap out of it"". which is why alot of normies say that, because it works for them. but it wont work if your serotonin is too low. its not enough to break out of it. and then you look like your not trying. not trying to snap out of it. so you get blamed."
185,Im from Argentina.
186,I’m just so tired of feeling this way. Idk if I can go on. I just don’t have the energy to do anything anymore. I feel like no one understands what I’m feeling. Like there is no one I can talk to. I just feel so weak
187,"I'm not talking about common side effects such as dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dangerous drop or rise in blood pressure, weight gain or loss, sexual dysfunction, etc. I'm talking about a life-threatening side effect where you had to go to the emergency room or be hospitalized. What medicine caused this side effect? What was the dosage you took? Was it because of a dangerous interaction with another medicine you were taking at the time?"
188,"I've been battling depression for 30 years, since I was 7.
My life is nothing but the battle
Wake up and try not to think
Get that fake smile ready
So no-one ever knows how I feel
And then go and exist
Just a cog that could easily be replaced
Thinking and hoping of death
Just wouldn't put my family through it (for now anyway)
Friends? Never had any
Nothing to enjoy
Food is fuel, not something I enjoy
I follow sport, but not really that interested anymore - just passes time
Every moment of life is waiting for it to be over
And battling not to take notice of my thoughts

So what if it all went away
Who the eff am I without it?
I don't know who I am 
I've just worn the mask too long
Never known any different
The only thing I know is depression
Without it I truly am nothing
But I don't expect it
To leave me alone any time soon"
189,"Hi,
I struggle with Depression and Anxiety since I was 11. My Parents got divorced when I was 4 years Old and I live with my Mom since then. We moved to other City regularly and right before we moved the fifth time the Depression and Anxiety started and just got worse since then. I go to Therapy for 3 months now, but I don´t think it helps me at all, I´m actually just scared about having to go to the Psychiatry when I tell my Therapist about my Suicide thoughts, Self Harm and my addiction tendencies.  But I guess not telling her is Pointless anyways because she obviously cant help me when I lie about those Things. I recently started Harming myself again, after almost 2 years of not Hurting myself on purpose. I think about going to the Psych ward voluntarily, but my social Anxiety keeps telling me to not go, but i don´t think I can make it any longer."
190,"I have no one to talk to about this. I have no friends , family and I don’t see a therapist. 

I wasnt really sure where to post this either. I think I have several issues.


I’m hoping the people here will read this and understand. I wouldn’t say I’m as depressed anymore now that I’ve found the root of my problem , but I still feel a huge sense of not belonging and I’ve really grown to hate my physical life.

I’ll start with the my inability to pay attention. I think I have bad ADD and I’m pretty low iq , if not just impulsive sometimes. If something doesn’t interest me enough I can’t pay attention very well. I used to be on ADHD meds long ago but my dad took me off of them. 

I might see a psychiatrist about that soon. 


My second issue is I don’t pick up social ques very well. I dont think I’m Autistic , maybe a slight aspie but there’s some things that I’ve only now started to pickup on and become aware of and I also socially distance myself , especially now. Sometimes I’ll be very unfiltered but I still have a basic understanding of what socially acceptable and what’s not. Sometimes I guess I just don’t care and speak my mind. 

I don’t try to make friends anymore and I know I definitely come off as cold or apathetic in most social situations. I definitely don’t feel like I can connect or relate to anyone. Especially now since my mental health has been declining the last few years.

I’m 23 , I tried the army , didn’t work out very well , I got discharged after a year and some months when I was 19 due to depression and not being able to handle all the stress. Everyone at my unit hated me anyway. 


I’ve been doing construction a long time and about a year ago , I was finally able to start in electrical which is a good trade and I’m working on getting accepted with the union which is very tough , especially the area I’m in because of the lower market share. 

I moved from Virginia to San Diego to get away from my family and surprisingly I’m doing okay considering the circumstances. I don’t have any support system or anything like that. 

I’ve lived out of a pickup truck for a long time ( currently staying somewhere) and might be looking at van life again soon to save and invest my money until I can break into the real estate market here. Vanlife is pretty easy to do in San Diego Pre covid. I’ve been told I’m difficult to live with sometimes because I have to be reminded to do things and I’ve been screwed by roommates before so I’ll take my chances roughing it. 


Now that I’ve given some background , here’s what I’ve realized over my short life. 

I’m depressed and feel isolated because I genuinely feel I don’t really belong here. Like in this physical body , apart of the human race, etc. I honestly didn’t realize this until the last few years. It’s starting to all click now. I feel very dead inside and like I’m going through the motions at this point. I don’t really partake in my hobbies much anymore , my biggest one which was playing music. Guitar specifically. 

I just work , eat and sleep , sometimes go to the gym to lift but I haven’t been doing a lot either between having to constantly find new ones due to covid and most recently , getting my shoulder scuffed up in a car accident. My truck was tboned at a light. 


I have to be or Atleast it definitely feels like , I’m the most hated man in the world. I’m talking more than Donald Trump. Like people genuinely hate me or want to hurt me. Some are very up front about it and some aren’t but I can pick up on the angry and resenting vibe when they’re around me. People also seem to think I’m retarded or low iq, so I’m constantly tested in my line of work.

You work with a lot of violent ex cons , felons , and just down right power trips in the skilled trades. I can’t complain , college definitely isn’t for me and I enjoy the electrical trade itself. The lifestyle definitely isn’t for everyone , I’ll tell you that. 

I’ve been constantly told by everyone around me I’m a useless idiot , who isn’t going anywhere , I’ll never succeed in life , I’m a loser because I can’t keep a roof over my head , I should just kill myself, etc. 

It’s gotten to the point where anything negative just sounds like a broken record now. I already know what everyone thinks of me at this point and I honestly don’t know if it affects me , your subconscious can’t filter things out like your conscious can , but it’s hard to stay positive when almost your whole life that’s all you’ve gotten.

Family members , people I was in the army with , coworkers , superiors , it’s everyone. 

No one thinks I’m capable of anything. A lot of people definitely hate me and I never really understood why or what I ever did. Sometimes I come off a little apathetic but for the most part I don’t go out of my way nor am I rude to anyone. I don’t like kicking people down either , I know what it’s like to get that constantly. 

I Especially don’t understand it with my family. I have two female cousins who hate my guts , my moms bipolar and is a horrible mother , my father tried to change his ways much later in his life but I think he just wasn’t capable of being a good parent despite trying better. 

My extended family has always showed favoritism , blatantly and doesn’t bother to ask me how I am , if I need support or help with this and that , etc. God forbid my female cousins get just a flat tire or something , the whole family will show up to help. 

I’ve only been recently contacted by my great aunt because the family house back in VA burnt down and after my dad passed , I had a share in the house ( originally my grandmothers).  The lawyer can’t negotiate the payout without every share holder pretty much. 


My only family member who cares about me is my sister and I’ve only recently be in contact with her again. She definitely understands me better than anyone because she’s faced some of the same things growing up but she has a living SO and a lot of friends so i feel like she can only relate so much. 


If I’m being honest and I’m not trying to sound edgy , I’ve grown so jaded I just hate everyone now. I don’t ever show it , I’m still cordial with people and try to come as somewhat nice but deep down I hate all humans now. 

I feel like throwing up knowing I’m human and I have to live this physical existence where I’m numb and miserable until I die. 

What kept me going for a long time was telling myself I’ll prove everyone wrong but now I just want to prove enough to myself and after that I really don’t care what happens to me.

I haven’t decided if that’s after getting accepted into the electricians union as an apprentice down here ( definitely no easy feat) or if that’s not until I build enough wealth and after I complete the union programto become a journeyman and get a decent condo near the beach. 

I’ll have to live out of a van for a few years and save and invest most of my money for the latter but I think it’s definitely doable. I made decent money off of the dogecoin surge and I’m investing in some other real promising projects and have doubled my initial investment already over the last few weeks.

If I can do it , anyone can. Anyway , will I just KMS after I find my success ? Maybe , maybe not. I won’t see the point of living after it. 

Maybe I’ll get lucky and get in another accident and this time my pickup truck will roll or flip and kill me before then. Who knows. 

I’ll leave it at that. Some of you might want to persuade me to talk about some of this with a professional but I know therapy won’t fix me. No amount Of meds or therapy will fix my root problem.

I’m ostracized and hated. Also probably mildly retarded. There’s no fixing that. 

I’ll just continue to ride the wave like a surfer into the sunset until I feel I’ve accomplished enough. 

I honestly believe we’re not here for any higher purpose other than the human experience and that after we die , our souls return to their original source/plane of existence. 

Thanks to anyone who read all of that. It’s means everything to me and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted. Seriously, thank so much."
191,"So me and my husband r from different countries, married from 4 years. We met online he came to live with me. He found a job and was on that job trip in a different city when he got his first episode...
He freaked out and thought ppl want to kill him so he ran away from the job and somehow he managed to come back home leaving all his shit back in that other city... 
He said he needed to go back to his country. (During that time we have to go fix some docs for his visa but he couldn't cuz he was out of his mind. He didn't care that leaving at this time will prevent him from bein able to come back for the next 3 months.) He was tripping about ppl trying to snipe him from the three in front of the window and was walking around the house holding a knife. We decided its gonna be best if he goes to his country afterall. 
So he went to his country and he went to a doc. Doc gave him pills and he got better..?
Some 3 months later he came back. We barely managed to fix his visa stuff and he lost the 2 years out of 5 that he needed to have spent in my country to get citizenship. He started looking for a job... for the next 2 years... He had several opportunities which he sabotaged himself by just not showing up. Then he got his second episode...
He started hearing voices coming from the back yard. Ppl calling or mocking him. Then one night it got worse and we had to call ambulance to give him sth to calm down. On the next day we went to doc. Doc gave him pills, said he prolly has some schizofrenik episodes - but there was not enough info to diagnose him... He was supposed to drink the pills 1 year. Doc said ppl usually dont get 3rd episode if they drink their pills...
Well he didn't want to drink his pills but he wasn't hearing voices or tripping anymore so he continued ""looking"" for a job until like few days before my bday this month when he decided that he wants to go back to his country cuz he hasnt been there n seen his fam for so long. 
So we went at the buss station at lets-call-it Wednesday with his shit packed up to get a ticket for the buss so he can leave. However busses werent available until Saturday cuz of Covid. We bought a ticket (at my bday date...) and we went home. He started tripping again. He didn't want to stay at the room he wanted to go outside and roam the streets... at 5 am... I was trying to convince him not to go and he was agreeing with me only to change his mind exactly 1 min after... I felth so helpless. I couldn't stop him from doing whatever he wanted to do. 
So we went outside - 4 times..., he wanted to walk. He was having hard time focusing on talking or following up the conversation. I was tired af and i had to go to work the next day. I was trying to make up his mind so we can go home but he was refusing. At that time I was convinced that I don't want to face this again. I was thinking that all I wanted was for him to go back to his country. I was sure I will never see him again. I never wanted to feel so helpless again. What if 1 day we have a kid? What if he starts tripping again? What if he hurts someone or himself or even kill himself? What am I suppose to do? Raise a kid by myself? I don't want to raise a child alone... The kid deserves 2 parents in good health condition...
I was thinking all this shit and meanwhile I was talking to him that everything is okay, that we are good and all those bs. Lieing straight to his face barely holding myself from crying my ass off all the time.
After long negotiations we finally got home and i convinced him somehow to take 1 pill. He took it and some 30 mins later he managed to calm his ass down to sleep. 
On the next morning it was the same... He was tripping, he wanted to go to the station again so we can check for busses (even tho the previous day we saw there are none). He was ready to grab his bag and wander the streets the next 2 days. I barely managed to stop him. I (too long story) managed to find ppl to drive him to his country. So he was successfully transferred there, 2 days before my bday. He didn't go to doc, he didn't remember my bday. His plan is to stay there few months? To get a job in there? And to come back when he get money...?
Idk do I have the strength to deal with this, I don't think he is taking it srsly. I think it will happen again. I think it happened cuz he was here, cuz it never happened to him before he came the first time. And yet again I love him and I don't want anything bad to happen to him. I promised to be with him no matter what...Can I leave him for this? Am I bad for thinking all that? Am I supposed to stay with him? Am I a bad person if I choose to leave him?
The more days pass the harder I find it to think about what to do. I just don't want to do anything. I know my life will be better without him but I cant just let go. He has no idea about all those stuff going on in my head. He thinks everything is fine. I feel bad about not telling him but I haven't yet decided what to do. 
And if I do decide to leave him... How tf am I supposed to do it? What am I supposed to tell him? Am I gonna be a selfish bitch if I do it?

Really sorry for the long post I just had to let it all out and idk ask u some questions if there is anyone who would actually read this long bs."
192,"Hi. I'm a woman in my 30's. I've been thinking about an incident that happened when I was 12. In class, I was at a desk looking at my schoolwork. Then I felt something like a sack go over my head. I was confused, but once the 'sack' was taken off, I realized that a male student had put his gym shorts over my head. My teacher saw this happen and the student got detention.
My parents felt that detention wasn't enough of a punishment for him. My teacher and them decided that he should write a letter of apology to me and do community service. He gave me the letter and it said he was sorry. My parents asked me what made him do this. There was something I said and it wasn't smart of me. Before this incident, I was standing beside him and noticed that his lashes were long and dark. I told him it looked like he was wearing mascara. I think this insulted his masculinity and made him retaliate. 
Even after writing the apology letter, he and his friends confronted me. One of them told me that this male student had planted his pubic hair and masturbated in his shorts before putting them over my head so both would make contact with my face and head. I don't know if either action really happened.
I told my mom about the planting of the public hair, and in his words, how he 'jizzed' in his shorts. She told me that the situation had been 'dealt with' since my parents had spoken to my teacher about the first event (his shorts over my head). She didn't speak to the teacher about the comments he made afterwards. I decided that I had enough and asked my mom if I could change schools. 
She told me that I wasn't 'weak' and I wouldn't 'run away' from this school after these two incidents.
At this point, I felt pretty bad about myself. I felt that I was humiliated to a point that I just couldn't tolerate being at that school. I feel that the teacher in this situation did all he could do. When it comes to my mom, I'm not sure if it was right of her to dismiss my request of switching to a different school after what happened.

Questions:
1.) Does anyone think that it was fair of me to ask to go to a different school or was it truly 'running away' from a situation that I should have been able to tolerate (staying at the school despite having a person's shorts pulled over my head)?
2.) Was this sexual assault or physical assault?
I would appreciate any feedback. Thank you."
193,"I know this is going to sound sort of weird but throughout my life I’ve had to deal with a lot of manipulation it sort of started with my dad and then I was in a very emotionally abusive relationship when I was a teenager. I was able to end that and cut ties with that person and I thought a was a stronger person because of it but now I’m in a situation where one of my best friends has really fucked me over I know I’m partly to blame but he has turned a situation and made himself the victim and now I’m alone 
Does anyone have any tips on how to stop being manipulated?
I feel sort of like I should just bloke myself away from everyone but I know that won’t make things better"
194,"Hello all, it’s been a while since I posted on here, I hope everyone is ok. The last few months I’ve become extremely lazy. I have been showering only once a fortnight if that and even struggle to reply to texts/messages/phone calls because in all honesty, I just can’t be bothered. Everything seems a huge effort. Cleaning my home is a big effort. I am having trouble sleeping if I do not drink alcohol. I go to sleep in the day if I get chance. Even watching tv feels too much effort sometimes. I normally SH but even that’s too much effort! I have become so lazy. I don’t even feel depressed as to be honest I feel nothing, empty. It just feels like floating through each day. There’s no beginning, end or purpose. Does anyone else feel like this? Thank you and sorry x"
195,"Good evening all! 
Nice late one as I can't sleep again! 
So in a nutshell my life has never been a bed of roses.. done it all got all the t shirts, but I'm not coping too well anymore, I think I've had one final blow that's tipped my ""point"" 
So to name but a few things that have occurred in my life 
* birth father abandonment (didn't know until I was 10)
* kidnap
* mental and physical abuse from step father and 1st partner
* recurrent miscarriages 
All in the past- the list is longer but neither you or I have the time! 
Until recently - in the past 12 months discovering my husband is an addict, having an affair that lasted a year and making me feel like a paranoid fisher wife while he lied to my face about it to then 3 months later losing a close relative to covid..  im a broken mess.. can anyone relate to anything I've been through and how on earth sense was made of any of it? How to get through and how to smile again!? 
Thank you in advance... sorry for the long message.. I'm relatively new to this and really didn't know where to turn.

196,"Idk if this is the right place to post this but I’m 27(m)and I’m so dumb, I ruined my life and I don’t know how to go on. I have wasted my life playing video games and doing nothing. I graduated high school with no direction, I was average intelligence I would say(I always thought I was smarter) but I never had any direction or goals and I had friends but something happened where I became self conscious all the time so I lost my friends and I lived at home with my parents and I started drinking all the time and playing video games. I’ve had a basic delivery job but then I lost that and I kept drinking and playing video games doing nothing in life and I feel like I’ve dulled my mind to the point where I’m mentally handicapped, my memory is trash and I literally can’t remember basic skills, and I forgot how to be human and interact with people, I feel like I don’t even have a high school education anymore that’s how bad my memory is. I quit drinking so much but I’ve just been in this cycle where I start feeling bad so I zone out and play video games to ignore the pain. I hate living with this realization where I destroyed my life and I’ll always be this dummy that’s worthless I had so much potential for things but I had no confidence that I convinced my self I was good for nothing and now I actually am. How am I supposed to get a relationship when my life story is a bum who played video games his whole life. I want to go to college and become somebody but my minds not even capable. I’m add and I’m sure low iq. Sorry for this long rant but I don’t know how I’m supposed to keep living with no hope and nothing to look forward too the rest of my life"
197,What do I do when something happened to my daughter and I’ve completely lost it
198,"I just want to kill myself,. This won’t help anyways but here I am. Say your cliches and what not. I am going to pretend they help me"
199,"i keep venting to people when they say it’s ok to talk and it never is ok to actually talk they’re lying and it hurts them and i don’t want to hurt them. i feel like i deserve pain and it hurts. my mistakes are too bad and i don’t feel like i can recover. i will journal instead of telling someone who knows the situation but i feel so so alone. i guess i have here but i’m not sure, i still feel like i’m evil."
200,"Past couple weeks, ugh. Got a doc talk on phone in a few days. Think I need old Zoloft to pull me up a bit. It did a good job in the past. Cleared away a few clouds. Right now it looks cloudy and I'd like to see a little clear sky."
201,"Hi everyone,

I have had bouts of depression in my life that I tended to work through within my own mind and power through. 

I recently went through a very tough time with an ex who left me with blame and this has caused challenges beyond what I have ever experienced.

I am in therapy and that helps but only for the day I go and then maybe a few days after. But I want to find some ways to not think about the blame she left me with or atleast find ways to just I guess feel at peace with the grief of losing her and our child, with her blame she put onto me despite all the support I tried to do, and how she could cut me out of her life so quickly like what we had was nothing.

I guess I would love suggestions to help my depression daily rather then the few days my therapy help in a month. As well if you read my story, how can I find peace with her blame.

Here is that story for context to why my depression has been severe and daily: She blames and connects me to her trauma despite all efforts to support."
202,"I have suffered from depression occasionally throughout my adult life. Now I'm 61 and effectively retired I don't have the pressures and strains that used to bring on depressive feelings but I'm almost suicidal. I found CBT and exercise to be useful, but pharmaceuticals and counselling did little, if anything, for me.  Although I'm what might be called an unstable personality (despite my being one of the most sensible, pragmatic, logical and unemotional people you'll meet) I think my current depression comes from an issue that has been getting worse throughout my adult life: I don't seem to get refreshing sleep and I feel cr@p during the day.  The extra tiredness and lack of motivation through depression is killing me.

I was diagnosed with apnoea 5 years ago but CPAP worked only marginally.  A review diagnosed me with central sleep apnoea, where the apnoea is linked to my brain not a throat obstruction, but the more complicated BiPAP machine made no difference.  I have RLS and PLMS, where I twitch at night and during sleep, but 3 different drugs have made no difference.  I've had my machine settings tuned by hospital and the experts on Apnoea boards but nothing helps. There are many clinical studies on Apnoea's being linked to depression but none I can find on my situation.

Does anyone have experience of depression and sleep disorders, Apnoea in particular?"
203,"Recently I realized my only friend is ignoring me/being distant and non talkative. Honestly it's depressing and I don't know what to do. I tried asking them if they're okay, they claim they are but still keep ignoring.

Yesterday I told them that if I'll do something annoying/be annoying they should tell me and they said they don't wanna be mean. What does it mean? They think I'm annoying just don't wanna admit it? I've been quite depressed since they became distant. 

I don't really have other friends and I have difficulties with making new ones. Maybe it's only in my mind, I mean my insecurities or abandonment issues acting up. I keep checking social media hoping they would answer but nothing. I can't find place for myself or proper distraction. I just wish they tell me what's going on. 

We were getting along perfectly, and never had any bigger argument. But it's the second time they act like this. Should I be worried? Is it some kind of red flag in friendship or I'm overreacting?"
204,"I honestly don’t know why you guys think you help anyone. You guys just say the same things over and over, and I want to die but it doesn’t matter to you. I try to make it easy for me to be helped but I guess not. I’m killing myself. Waste of my time posting. Because it’s way better than little meaningless words here. I’m killing myself I’m tired of this shit and the stupidity of “keep living it gets better”. I have real issues, and these little stupid words about how the future is better is baseless, idiotic and unnecessary. I’m just gonna kill myself. I’m tired and this shit is a joke"
205,"the type of day where you wake up and just feel this huge weight on your chest of utter sadness that you actually woke up and have to suffer through yet another day.
Just been constantly fighting the urge to cry all day. If i start, it wont stop and i don't have the energy for it.
One of the hardest things is having to put a smile on your face and hide what you are truly feeling so that others are comfortable."
206,"Just joined this forum today,a male in my 50s, have had depression for the best part of 30 years consistently let down by poor mental health services and gps,IV lossed everything over the years and been on so many different meds, diagnosed as Major Depression Disorder (MDD).  Serverity of the Condition seems to increase as I get older,one failed attempt at suicide awhile ago,and very matter of fact about trying again.As well as taking my prescription medications,I think I am addicted to pain management medication, taking more and more to help with the gut renching dark moods and thoughts.The pain meds give me that false sense of well-being but as the effect dies off,leaves me aggressive . Saddening to read about all the issues on here,and so many young people, and most I can identify with.Its very easy to see how drugs and drink numb the pain and then addiction follows. Unfortunately I have no answers and feel tired and old battling this on aday to day basis,I feel a sense of relief that soon I will be low enough and strong enough to become one more suicide case ."
207,"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, just genetic apparently. 
I had what would have been a happy childhood for any other child. 
Nothing triggered my depression,
It's just always been there
I've never had a trauma, been abused or bullied.

In fact as one Mental Health worker said
'You've had and got a good life
I would be happy if I your life'
Well I do have this life &
I've still never experienced happiness
And highly unlikely I ever will

Anyway growing up I had a foster brother who had been SA
And my thoughts were if that had happened to me
At least I would have an excuse to feel like I do
And yet he seemed to cope with life better than I did
I have always hated and can't understand 
Why I feel like this for no reason.

Jealousy is the wrong word, but I can't find the right one
I would never want 
Or wish any kind of trauma on myself or anyone else
But I can't help but feel
At least they know why.

I'm sorry if this offends anyone and 
In no means no I be to trivialise trauma
But I was just wondering if anyone else knows what I mean
Because everyone seems to have had that trigger"
208,"star got off her harness this morning and her collar just now over the field ,she wouldn't come back to me to put them back on
luckily she followed me home but now im worried bout it happening again ,it has happened before once when she was near the road ,its horrible ,she gets muddy and she is boisterous so we keep her on the lead ,god knows idf there were other people over there what she would have done ,s she isnt dangerous but is over the top x"
209,"Since kid I don't have self-trust. When I was 8/9 I was scared of asking to play football with others kids in school because I feared they would make fun of me because I didn't know how to play (I always played football outside of the school but I didn't stayed much time in a team because I always started to feel hated for my lack of skill). I couldn't sleep alone till my 10/11 years, my mom would lay me down, but in minutes I would come after her crying or scared with something in my room. At 11 or 12 my teacher spoke to my parents to put me in a psychologist because I talked to myself out loud.
My parents divorced when I was 12/13 and I never felt much attention and affection from my father but my mom always did everything for me. At age of 14 I start to have problems and begin to self-harm, at 15 I tried to suicide and I just went to family's doctor 1 or 2 times but hospitals make feel so anxious I can't feel good inside so I barely talk something about me, back then I ended up saying everything was fine and that I went through everything.
Today, it's the same thing, but in a different scenario. Recently I broke up with my girlfriend because I didn't feel enough for her and thought she needed better (I regret this so much). Like her, people are always saying that I'm a good person, that I'm smart and pretty, but I don't feel it. I hate me and I hate that. I hate that I can't see the Brightside of things. My conclusion is that I have always been my greatest enemy and I'm tired of it but I never change. I can't really see the blue sky outside because I myself put a gray cloud over me. Sometimes I feel like suicide and self-harm again but I start to feel guilty for having that kind of thoughts. At this point I don't know anything of my mental health. I think I have social anxiety because I'm always afraid of seeing someone I know or to have some social interaction that happens fast. Sometimes I feel like I can do anything and I try, but at some point, I end up telling myself that I really can't and that I'm just being stupid. Then I feel unmotivated for a few days until I feel motivated again. Sometimes I feel very angry at everything, even my closed ones and that's not healthy.
I am afraid that one day I may go down and end up doing what I did in the past, I try to fight everything but the snowball only grows with each passing day.
Thanks if you read this whole text!! Say something!"
210,"There isnt a single thing in my life that i succeeded in , all chances i once had i wasted them all opportunities i wasted them all .

213,"hi everyone, 
Ive never done anything like this before but i feel the time is right to reach out. 
I have been with my wife for 8 years (married for 4). at the start things were brilliant she was best friend and we did everything together. it all changed when i moved into a new career. i spent 4 years working on public transport (buses) my personality completely changed. i was such a laid back person and happy always positive. this changed to being mood constantly always falling asleep when watching tv. i have since moved on from that job and a year down the line i still feel im the same person to a degree . my wife and i are having issues at the moment especially with lockdown i find it hard to take a interest in her and her work. she feels like i dont love her anymore and if theres something she wants to tell me shes frightened that ill have a go at her if she says it wrong. i love my wife more than anything and i want to make her happy, outside of the house im myself and can deal with anything but inside its like my personality completely changes. it seems to getting worse more than anything and if continues i know its the end of the marriage. thanks for taking the time to read and please any helpful suggestions would be really appreciated."
214,When anyone says how are you and they don’t know you are depressed how do you respond? I don’t want to lie but I don’t want to go into details either. Any tips? Thanks

216,"Hi. Theres any who wants to chat ? In private message.

Im looking someone who also wants to, I mean, Im not looking for just a listener, Im not looking to just vent.

If any joined the forum also looking to chat message me. Im 28 old."

218,"I have no purpose in life. My son just moved out of home, doesn't need/want me, I have no job because I can't work, I'm in a living situation  where I can't go anywhere alone because of my health, I have someone with me 24 7 to make sure I can't leave, all for my own good but it sucks. Live seems pointless.  I'm fat, I'm ugly, repulsive even. I can't even wear necklaces because there too nice for me. I have self harm tendencies and that's why I kinda signed up right now, I feel like I wanna soo bad but there's that tiny part that whispers this too shall pass. It's acter4am I can't sleep  everyone's asleep even people that I'd call accaintcies o line are asleep. There's someone here looking after me and the house while my friend and her husband are away taking a break from me and just for themselves but the replacement person I don't feel able to wake her up yo tell her my life's going to he'll in a handbrake. I'm not brave, I don't find it easy to talk face to face  the mental health team are a joke and honestly I'm sbit scared. Maybe everything will be better tomorrow. Maybe.  Sorry 😞"
219,"This all started with some sleeping problems I had around New Years. I soon overcame the insomnia but I really have felt strange ever since. Everything feels like a dream, I have brain fog and painful moments of deep inward reflection. I feel extremely depressed and I’m also physically exhausted. I feel like I have forgotten who I am, if that makes sence. Don’t know what to do, how should I go forward."
220,"Sometimes i see life in a dark way, i know i shouldnt because its bad for my mental health. i just think how time flys by and were here for such a short time. Being under the poverty level i never get to travel very often, so life is the same thing everyday. Good thing i have my fantasy books and my videos to keep my boredom at bay though."
221,"I have therapy at the moment. But right now its bringing emotions up that I have tried to put away for so long. I have such a low self worth and esteem. 
And now with me falling in love with so many women online I dont know where to go. I left all but this forum. I stopped playing world of warcraft. Something I did hours on end. 
All because of my romantic feelings. 
And now after days of just sitting here in my home I keep feeling I can not go own. 
Love has always been hard for me as I am afraid of women and I use everything in a twisted way to punish myself. 
I hate this and I hate myself."
222,"I am at work, working from home and our work is being measured so I have to keep working. But I feel literally so depressed I can barely keep working.

I've essentially given up on life. I don't know.

Am on anti depressants and in therapy and I do exercise.

But I've just given up on life."
223,"I often think about whether it would be better for me to know when and how I would die, or for it to just happen without my knowing it. Would it be better for me to just die in my sleep, or would I want to know that I'm going to die NOW and this is how I'm going to die? If I'm told I have terminal cancer, would I prefer knowing EXACTLY when I would die, or just let it happen to me without my knowing exactly when it would happen? I'm often torn between which scenario I would prefer (as if I had a choice). But with suicide, I would know when and how. I think I'd like to know when and how I'm going to die as long as it would be painless. If I were to be in a lot of pain, I would want it to just happen without my knowing it."
224,"i'm at my end. it's been years. i can't deal with it anymore.

i've done everything from drinking 'relaxing' drinks and watching 'relaxation' videos, to therapy and sleeping pills. nothing works. 

it is torture. literal torture. 

it gets worse, to the point i even know how i will end it."
225,"I have passive suicidal thoughts almost on a daily basis. Sometimes I get into a loop and it's very difficult to get out of it. My previous nurse practitioner thought I had OCD with suicidal ideation. My current psychiatrist never brought up this diagnosis. Here is what the difference between passive and active suicidality is:

If  you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

Passive vs. active suicidality is something some people have problems wrapping their heads around. I can say with absolute certainty I’m suicidal… I have been for almost a year now. However, it’s passive. The difference between the two is very simple (but also super complex). Being passively suicidal means you wish to die. Actively suicidal is just that — you’ve got your plan and you’re planning on going through with the plan."
226,Just wondering what are people's experiences with this. Things to look out for?  I'm in the United States btw.
227,I have an amazing 1 and a half year old girl. I'm exhausted and depressed. She is so much work. She's my first and I don't think I can handle another. My wife wants more but I'm run to the ground as a stay at home dad. I don't know how people do it. I think I have postpartum. There's alot of tears I'm overwhelmed. I'm up at 6 with her and in bed at 7pm because I'm so overwhelmed. Sleeping is my fav. part  of the day. I want to enjoy my family just tough right now.
228,"I am a male, 28 years old. I am fighting depression since September 2020 and now as my shrink told me it's severe. I have a good job but constant stress and mistakes done on the job are making things worse. I often take sick days and I can't handle smallest inconveniences now. The only reason my employer has me is because I had worked a lot in the past and they think I am a good employee. The future seems to be dark there is nothing out there for me. Need advice from any of you who has been there before. I can't talk to anybody as the society where I live in still thinks that depression can be snapped off. 

Also, I apologize for my punctuation I am not a native English speaker."
229,"My partner has suffered with depression our entire relationship. His brother committed suicide and ever since he has had depression. His mum was very unsupportive and used to tell him to “stop being stupid” or “don’t be silly”.
Since we got together over 4 years ago, I’ve always supported him, and he’s always supported me. We have suffered 3+ years of infertility and recurrent miscarriage. I was in a serious car accident in August 2018 which between that and the miscarriages led me to have PTSD and severe anxiety where i would not leave the house. Thankfully I received CBT and am controlling it much better. 
in August 2020 we welcomed our rainbow baby into the world.
The last few months my partner has become more and more depressed, it comes in waves. I always ask how he is, tell him I’m worried about him, I’m here if he wants to talk, etc...
Recently if ever I’m upset he makes it about him, he constantly makes comments about suicide and me and the baby being better off without him, he hits himself in front of me and the baby despite me telling him not to, everything I say or do is wrong. 
Im running the house, looking after a baby, a dog, trying to start my own business and he makes comments like “I go to work all day and I come home and have to cook tea” when I’ve not sat down all day myself. When I get that comment everyday and it’s starting to knock me down and make me feel rubbish, but when I confront him he just says “I was only joking” and I explain how I don’t feel like it’s a joke and he says “I’m just crap you’d be better off without me”. 
Other times when he gets in from work he will say he’s tired and just go upstairs, no help with the baby, any jobs around the house, cooking the baby’s food or ours.
Since the birth of our baby I haven’t wanted to have sex much, whenever he tries to come onto me I say no and he takes offence to that and makes out like I’m the bad guy because I say no and then goes miserable and makes me feel like it’s all my fault.
He has a go at me if I ask him to watch the baby while I go for a shower.
I’m at a loose end as to what I do. I don’t know how much more I can take myself. Remaining strong for my baby, whilst doing everything and just putting up with him making me feel crap. I’ve wondered if I’m best leaving him but I worry if I did he’d kill himself and I don’t want that. I love him. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t sleep at night worrying what the next day will bring, I don’t get a minute to myself.
Help, I need advice, anything!?"
230,"I’m a 30 year old man who has wasted his life and I see very little point in continuing. I’ve had depression and anxiety since my early teens which I attempted to self medicate with weed and alcohol from the age of 14-23 which obviously only made matters worse. When I quit using weed and alcohol I was hopeful and even expectant that my life would significantly improve. Unfortunately, it hasn’t.

I’ve never had a girlfriend, I still live with my mum, I’m physically unattractive, I don’t have much savings, I don’t have any career prospects (taxi driver until recently with the pandemic), I have poor social skills and I’m riddled with depression and anxiety. I’m what would traditionally be defined as a “fuck up”, basically.

I see no hope for the future in terms of being able to get on the housing ladder, girlfriend, children etc. Because, let’s face it, who would want anything to do with a loser like me? I wouldn’t. And the even more depressing truth of it is, I doubt those things would even make me happy now. There’s an insatiable black hole inside me that no relationship, social climbing or material possessions are going to fill.

I don’t even know why I decided to write this. I just thought maybe writing my situation down might help me clarify things in my own mind. Anyway, that’s the pathetic loser of a man that is me."
231,"Hello Everyone! Let me thank you in advance for your replies!

I'm a 42 year old Man and I'm at transitional point in my life where I've been doing a lot of thinking about the past, present and future.

The thing that is really bothering me is I can never remember having any drive, ambition or motivation in my life. Sure, I dream big about all the things I want to do with my life, goals I wanted to accomplish and things I wanted to make happen, but I never had that fire down inside to make it happen and it's really quite depressing to think about what life could have been had I had that fire and drive inside. I've just kind gone through life with a ""meh, if it happens, it happens and if not, oh well"" mentality. It's just now at 42, I don't wanna live this way any more, it sucks! Just watching others have victory in their life and I just sit here accepting the scraps life happens to throw my way.

I wanna change this about myself. I just honestly don't know how and I feel completely lost. 

Any comments or advice are greatly appreciated!!"
232,"I’ve joined as I’m not good at talking with people face to face or in general so sorry if this is a complete ramble, I just feel like I need talk.  
 
Some life events have affected the way I feel and I have suffered with PTSD, I had to see a psychiatrist after one life experience which pretty much put me off for life, this was 8 years a go now. But it feels like I have felt this way for as long as I can remember (bar childhood).
I’m feeling very low recently and seeing no future. I’ve been in this place off and on for 10/12 years and the only thing it feels is keeping me here is knowing how my mum would take it and she doesn’t deserve that.

The trouble is I know what I should do, I know all the blurb about keeping yourself active, eating well, not drinking but I just don’t have the energy for trying anymore, it feels like I’ve been trying for 10 years, trying and failing. Things I used to love barely bring any joy and if it does it’s fleeting and it all just feels like hard work, too hard.

Part of me feels like I’m striving to feel this way, like I don’t deserve any thing in life as I’ve always made bad decisions, ones I knew would be bad for me, it feels like I’ve always been trying to sabotage my life and make myself miserable, being aware of that fact why can’t I change it?! I just can’t help myself. 

I’m 32, I used to be pretty skilled at my job, my prospects aren’t bad, yet I just can’t get rid of this feeling of hopelessness and it’s getting worse and I feel guilty for feeling this way. It feels like I’m on a countdown."
233,"Hi, everyone. Honestly, I'm not certain if I have developed a clinical depression or if I'm just having a normal reaction to real hardship, but I'm not in a good place right now. I feel a sense of pain and discomfort 24 hours of the day, I stopped enjoying games and music, and I have a hard time mustering up the motivation to get out of bed. I have OCD and it's led to me becoming very neurotic and introverted, things I've been working on but don't change overnight. I ordinarily won't speak to anyone unless they talk to me first, I have to force myself to. I moved out of the city I did grades 5-12 in a few years ago and have lost contact with all my friends. My mother and my grandmother are very mentally ill and difficult to have normal relationships with, as a result I only really have my father to talk to. However, my father is very protective of me and I know that if I shared the extent of my current pain with him it would hurt him deeply, so I'm not willing to. This is why I'm here, I don't expect anyone to fix my problems but talking about them helps me come to terms with them.

I don't need to be an extroverted party boy, nor do I want to. Honestly, I would be satisfied just to find a good woman, but a year of effort has not ever gotten me close to finding one. I continue to take steps to give myself a better chance, but all the failure is weighing on me and it's gotten to the point where just seeing attractive women can muster up feelings of negativity and cause me pain. I'm 6'4"" 225 pounds, I've turned a flabby gut into an athletic physique, I'm very bright, chivalrous, and my OCD prevents me from lying. Older people always say I'm handsome, but all the women I'm attracted to have shown they completely disagree and I'm starting to believe them. I honestly can't fully explain why they're not interesred, aside from the simple fact I'm reserved and struggle to approach people I don't know. I've tried everything, wasted about $400 on dating sites and apps, and in 23 years I've been in one relationship for 3 months (she was great, but it wasn't working). Not knowing what I can do to fix it has added to a sense of helplessness, and my normally very positive upbeat attitude has began to turn into staunch cynicism and I'm concerned about developing resentment towards the generalization of people I view as having rejected me. Recently I've began smoking weed everyday and night to try to fend off depressive symptoms, but it's starting to not work anymore.

I'm not seeking medication because I know that fixing issues in my life will restore my mood, but just getting by is starting to be very difficult. As of now I'm hoping that being able to talk about the way I'm feeling might be able to get me through this period of isolation. I've put out job applications and signed up to volunteer to get more interaction, but remaining neurotic and reserved and now cynical I don't have a sense that any fundamental change is coming.

I very much appreciate anyone who takes the time out of their day to read this, I would've made it shorter but, y'know, OCD."
234,"Hi I am new on here and have been struggling a while with depression but I dont seem to be getting any better and in fact it is worse. I just don't want to be here anymore....nothing is right and just want the pain to end. On top of everything else my relationship has now ended which has pushed me lower and I just don't know how to get better. I have a teenager who sees how bad it is and I feel so sad that he sees me like this but I cant stop crying......I have spoken to close family but I dont think they understand just how bad it is....if it wasn't for my son I wouldn't be here I know that. 
Please what can I do to help myself that haven't already tried. I am on fluoxetine.....trying to eat well , exercise and get sleep. I think this is hormal depression due to my age but the doctors don't seem to know how to help me.
Thanks"
235,"I am a 31 year old man, who from the outside has everything going for him.  I own my own house, have a great job, got to travel a lot before Covid hit.

But I am unbelievably depressed, and I live in constant fear.

A lot of this started 2 years ago when I lost my father suddenly, I was able to get him to a hospital in time before his massive heart attack but he died right there in the hospital.  Something that haunts me to this day.  I was very very close with him and have never been able to recover from his death.

That day I lost my hero, my rock, and my foundation and have been trying to rebuild ever since.

Couple that with my unbelievable fear and the fact that a lot of my dreams for the future seem to be stripped away from me, and I just don't feel like going on anymore.

I am a conservative who works in tech.  And my company and many other companies I know of, have been targeting and firing many of us.  I've kept an unbelievably low profile and never said anything against the grain at my company or where I work for fear of retribution for the last 4 years I've worked here.  But the fear of someone finding out and firing me and blacklisting me at other companies haunts me everyday and I live in constant fear over that.  That at any moment my life could be ruined if someone found out about that.

I feel like even posting here I'll be judged and hated and it's one of the reasons I don't get professional help, but at least here I can be anonymous.

This drills down deeper, as it's not just losing my job. But I have been writing a book, and been working on a company from the ground up that will probably need funding. I don't think I'll be able to do either of those things anymore if anyone found out my views. I feel hopeless and like most of my dreams that I've been working on for the last several years have been pointless and my future is destroyed. Maybe this is a symptom of where I live, or who I know, or what people say to my face thinking I'm on the same team, but it's truly ruined my life.

I desperately want help.

I want to do good things for other people  and at least help some people that want to still be here.

Currently I am teaching under privileged kids how to program at my local homeless shelter/jobs center. Two of them I might actually be able to change their lives, they seem pretty dedicated.

I am also currently on the donor registration to give a kidney, 

And might be giving up some bone marrow to a child and a children's hospital to me soon, apparently finding matches is very hard, and I might be one although I'll have to travel a couple states away.

I don't really know why I'm writing this, I don't feel like I have any future or reasons to live anymore, and am completely unable to feel joy anymore."
236,"Hello everyone,

my girlfriend believes that I am suffering from a case of “self pity/feeling sorry for myself.” Tells me to man up, grow a pair and grab life by the balls. Well, losing your career, passion, desire and motivation to move forward. Suffering a financial set back, injustice that occurred at work which I’m battling in court and a union that doesn’t seem to do anything for me. Battling loneliness, hopelessness, desire to even to continue living has devastated me to the point of no return.

I spent most of my days in bed, thinking, pondering if this is how life is supposed to be? I have a therapist that I talk to, but I still feel that talking isn’t getting me anywhere. Making decisions is hard, feel indecisive, confused and also unsure. I do believe eventually my girlfriend will get tired and move on with her life, after all, she’s not responsible for my own suffering.  This is how I’m feeling.

Broken hearted
Confused
Hopeless
Lost my will to fight
Personal hygiene gone down the drain
Don’t want to get up from bed
Lost interest in just about everything
Guilt, shame overwhelms me
Often feel life is not worth living or fighting for anymore
No interest in sex or anything for that matter
Manhood is basically lost
Unmotivated to even seek help
At times I feel like taking revenge for what was done to me
Anger
Self doubt
Self pity
Depressed
Lonely
Overwhelmed

above are just a few of my symptoms and without a doubt I know that I am suffering from a case of depression. I’ve struggled with depression for most of my life. My parents were not the best role models, lost both of my parents to AIDS due to their drug abuse/alcohol etc

I have a lot of trauma, set backs, pain, that’s I’ve dealt with and I have not been successful at any relationship due to own insecurities, doubts and the believe that I don’t deserve happiness. Also, I haven’t been a Saint, I’ve burn bridges, friendships, relationships, etc.

I’m a combat veteran as well, and I often deal with ptsd and survivors guilt. I don’t do drugs nor drink. However, I’m an occasional drinker. Currently I’m unemployed too.

technically speaking I’m not destitute, I have a home, basic transportation and I survived on a pension. Which isn’t much but it’s something. There are things that I should be thankful for but the reality is that I’m not internally happy. Starting my life all over again after turning 50 is devastating!! My ex wife/now current girlfriend is 20 years younger than me. To some of you that may be a great thing but trust me, age differences, mentality etc it’s a struggle.

I am scared of meds or anti depressants, not sure why but I am. I’ve attempted suicide 2 times during my life once when I was a teenager and once again when I was in my 20’s. When I came out from combat I felt into a deep depression that I ended up hospitalized at a VA hospital.

I’ve been known to have interpersonal problems with others. Often a lot because I’m misunderstood or I tend to run people the wrong way.. anyway, I’m so, so sorry about posting a long post. Maybe I’m trying to vent or provide a basic glimpse my struggles.

people often tell me, go out get some exercise, do this, do that, just live life, etc but it’s simply not that easy. Also, I’m not religious and I gave up on this whole god thing. At times I prayed nothing has been resolved or answered, feel like I’m just praying to nothing less. My girlfriend is religious and I have a few friends who are Christians, or better said believers and they keep telling me that I need Jesus, God in my life... but? I’ve tried to volunteer and even that doesn’t help me.

As I lay here in my bed losing yet another day, I often wonder why...? What this all means, what’s the point, what’s the purpose, what’s the reason. If I decide to just take my own life would people/family even care?

People tend to only care temporary then they forget about you and move on with their lives. I’ve also come to the conclusion that people don’t want to hangout with a sad, depressed, pessimistic guy and friends tend to ignore you because of your own self suffering.

my understanding is that I have the power to change things but do I really? Again, my apologies for the long post."
237,"Here, I am posting again. I know there's so much ""belief"" in this forum that this is a good thing, but who cares anyways. I'm still suicidal, and hoping to kill myself soon. I feel exceptionally fucking bad. And I doubt any idiot on the internet is willing to help, or in real life. So fuck this. But I really want to kill myself soon, even more at this point. I am so sick and tired of being alive, and I swear I'm done with these stupid fucking posts that do nothing. Killing myself is easier, thanks for the false hope anyways."
238,"Tried asking this on a Reddit advice forum and surprise surprise, what little reply I got was mainly from assholes. So decided to come here to actually chat with some people who would understand my situation and (hopefully) be less judgmental.

So, a bit of backstory & context- I was diagnosed with depression in late-2016. I struggled with my MH throughout university as well as SH, and it took until last year for me to find a medication that worked for me for more than a few months without horrible side effects. I am also 2 years SH free as of 4 days ago, and have been getting much better in myself. Doctor has been talking about weaning off the medication, but I have declined at the moment due to COVID and lockdown uncertainties- it's something I'll be trying once lockdown ends though.

So, the actual topic:

Me: 22 M
SO: 19 F

After months of my MH improving and me getting more like my old self, I decided to re-enter the dating scene. I met this lovely girl on a dating app in August last year, and we hit it off right away. Asked her out about a month after, and we've been together since.

I've kept my mental health history a 'secret' from her but want to tell her, to ensure she knows what's going on with me when I have bad days or depressive episodes- that it's not her fault and she's not done anything wrong, stuff like that. But I'm very nervous about this, for the following reasons:

One night we were chatting on Facetime (she's away at uni at the moment) and we were chatting about disastrous dates we've had in the past for a bit of fun. She talked about an old boyfriend of hers that had MH issues, and the more I learn about the bloke it's clear he wasn't well and needed some help. But she talked about medication use and mental illness in general in a poor light, calling this guy 'mental' and 'crazy', and how stressful it could be for her. This definitely hurt me a bit as my MH is quite a bit part of who I am now and how I have changed over the past 4.5 years, and I felt as if I didn't want to 'come clean' to her at that time- and I kind of kept putting it off constantly since then.

Another reason for keeping it a secret is past experiences- when I was at uni and in some of my lowest moments I would confide in and take support from a girl I lived with, until late 2018 when she cut me off, saying that my mental illness was 'too much for her to handle as a friend' and that being around me 'brought her down'. Not only that, but in order to save face she then spread rumours saying I was the one that wronged her, and turned almost everyone I lived with in the house against me- they would exclude me from house events, speak about me behind my back, and the girl in question literally didn't speak to me or look me in the eye again until we parted ways at graduation. This event severely put me back in terms of recovery and made me relapse into SH quite badly for a few weeks until I met some new friends that I am still close with today. I stand by the sentiment that meeting those new friends saved my life.

So, primarily I'm scared to tell my SO about my past mental health problems in case she sees me in a different light & thinks of me in a similar way to her previous boyfriend, and I don't want things to get like they did with the girl at uni. I also don't know if she's going to be angry with me that I kept such a thing secret for 6 months. I know the longer I leave it the more upset she will be and I don't want it to be a case of 'she sees my medication one day and googles it', but due to past experiences and what she's said before, I'm too frightened to say anything.

What would be the best way to approach a conversation like this, and what should I say/expect her to say? Have any of you had a similar situation and can give me some advice?

Any help would be appreciated, thanks for reading."
239,"I've never had motivation.. to do anything really. I've spent most of my teenage years laying in bed all day (rarely if ever leaving my house) since I never had to move to do my homeschooling which has wreaked havoc with my joints. I'm really paying for it now but! I've actually wanted to leave my house recently. I want to go back to school. Get my leaving cert. Go to college someday. I wanna become a nurse! or a special needs assistant. I never thought I'd see myself having aspirations in life. Wanting to live life. I don't feel as hopeless as I usually do even though I still live in a bad environment... hearing fighting all the time takes the life out of me. I've prayed to g-d for peace every night and morning which y'all might roll your eyes at but I think that has helped me a lot. I truly feel like I can do something in life. (I'll probably have a meltdown tomorrow like always tho lmao we shall see)

240,"I can have what I think is a great night's sleep but wake up with brain fog, irritability, fatigue, low mood, etc. All I can do is lay in bed in the dark on these days. The next night I will get the same sleep but wake up energized, clear headed and positive. This happens often and it is so frustrating. I have sleep apnea and have been on cpap but it hasn't helped. Could this be medication related? Brain chemical related? Or sleep related like narcolepsy? Has anybody else had experience with sleep and mood? Especially such a major swing in mood from one day to the next with just one night inbetween?"

If I'm not gonna have a love of my life, at least I could vent my emotions by writing a story, but this shit ain't workin' :("
242,"I am feeling very depressed lately, and I can't get happy.  I changed jobs last year within the same company.  It was somewhat of a career change for me.  I have been in the new role for 6 months, and I do not like it.  I want to leave my position (and company) to go back and do what I used to do.  My wife does not want me to leave.  She thinks I need to suck it up.  I've been applying for jobs in my old field, and I have gotten rejection after rejection without an interview.  After the few interviews I've had, I've gotten rejection.  I'm wondering if I'm washed up.  Additionally, I have brilliant children, but they are extremely unmotivated.  They don't listen to me, and they give me grief all the time.  I lost my mom a few months ago, somewhat unexpectedly.  I DON'T want to kill myself, but I don't care if I die either.  I don't want to feel this way."

1/9/2021 My son tested positive for Covid - at this me my family quarantined
1/13/2021 My daughter tested positive for Covid 
1/22/2021 I tested positive for Covid I felt fine in terms of depression and no Covid symptoms
Aprox 1/25/2021 I started feeling extremely depressed especially in the morning
I decided to increase my Sertraline from 100mg to 150mg (without talking to my Dr) I also started taking it mid morning instead of at night hoping I'd feel better
2/2/2021 I was still feeling overly depressed so I decreased my from 150 to 100 still taking it in the morning. I have been taking 100mg Sertraline for 3 years at night and it has worked fine
2/9/2021 I had a phone call with a primary care Dr (not my normal Dr) she told me to take my sertraline 100mg at night,
and discontinue taking trazadone as she prescribed me Remeron
I did not start the Remeron (I'm afraid to start another med) but continued taking 100mg sertraline and trazadone…I feel the worst in the morning
I have been taking (1) .25 Xanax in the morning and 1 around lunch to take the edge o4, I seem to feel
better night. I'm just lost, wondering if all the changes of dose of Sertraline and times has messed me up. Has anyone experienced this? Thank you in advance"

My pain in my heart was heavy as I felt powerless as I saw my father’s mouth just frozen open wide. As I found he passed away at 10 am that morning. I felt my whole world coming down. March 2017 is when my father went to rest with his parents and my uncle up in heaven. Now as March 2021 is coming up next month. Pain and depression have come over me and I hurt because I was his little Butterfly as he would call when I just a little child and I am now 31 years old and I lose him when I was 27 years old. Due to having lost his fight with cancer after 4 years of it. I have hurt because I was told that if I had not gone down to get myself breakfast that morning in March 2017 I might have been able to say goodbye until next time and how I love you, dad. I felt like just because I needed to eat before I went to take my medication for my bipolar and other issues. I have been feeling like I blame myself for how I could have maybe skipped having breakfast that morning maybe I could have told my dad it would okay and that I love him for being the best dad he could be."
250,"Hi there

Throughout my life I found it very difficult to not think about suicide, I just enjoy the idea of letting go of everything im holding on to and just falling down into nothingness, to me it’s so therapeutic and it’s something I’ve overlooked a lot during my time on this planet.

I sometimes ponder on scenarios in which I’ll kill myself or mutilate myself just to imagine how people around me would feel, I like the idea that some of those people will cry, but hate the fact that I know that others will probably forget about me in an instant.


So my question is, why would I do something like this? It’s been with me for a long, long time and I can’t see why I would think of such nonsense.

Thank you"
251,"suicidal - not excessive, but enough for going on with"
252,"I love to exercise. I do walk aerobics, dance, Pilates, light strength workouts, etc. About maybe 5 weeks ago, I hurt my left hip. It's probably my hip flexor. I didn't think anything of it at first because I'm often getting DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) - you know, the pain that comes a day or so after you work your muscles in a way they're not used to? A couple of days before the pain started, I had done an older workout I hadn't used in a very long time. DOMS makes me stiff and sore when moving, but doesn't prevent me from my workouts, so I pushed through. The pain lessened some over the next week, but it never completely went away. Fast forward 3 weeks and it began to hurt very badly again. That's when I realized I must have pulled or torn something originally and I just re-injured it, without ever giving it a chance to heal in the first place. I took 3 days off and I couldn't stand it. So for the last couple of weeks, I've been walking fast in place for 2-3 miles (30-45 minutes) at a time. It's very boring, but it doesn't cause pain or discomfort. I'm not doing anything else besides upper body strength with dumbbells since that doesn't require movement in my hips. I'm so bored and I really want to get back to my regular routine. I'm waiting, though, because I have to heal. The problem is that moving naturally through the day is slowing down my progress. I was sitting this morning and without thinking, I twisted my body to the right to grab something. I felt my left hip pull and I've been feeling it all day. I'm afraid I just set myself back further. I don't have insurance, so I'm not going to get it checked out. I guess I just have to keep waiting and I need to TRY being more careful. Usually the only time I'm feeling pain is when I'm in bed moving around or if I happen to lie on that hip. I sleep on my stomach, but I toss and turn all night. I just needed to vent because I'm having a hard day. :cry:"
253,"I'm so tired of life. I have no one to talk to about how I feel so I found this forum to express my self....I'm so angry I can barely type. 

My mother is schizophrenic and a shell of the woman she could of been if her own family and my father didn't neglect and abuse her. Instead she suffocates me and criticises me and is constantly talking to herself. It's depressing to watch and it consistently breaks my hearts, it's my own mother ffs. 
My father has stage 4 cancer and is most likely going to die in the next year or so, he's a toxic lousy depressed man who only relies on chemotherapy, god forbid he actually changes his mindset or finds love in his heart for something greater than the TV. I know he will die soon. 
And I am stuck living with them both.

I have no money to move out, no career, never had a relationship - only a string of casual partners due to my own low self esteem and lack of self worth, my friends don't understand or are so conceited and self absorbed they fail see or hear me in a way that makes me feel safe.  I suffer with depression, anxiety and a profound sense of fear. I've been addicted to marijuana for the last 10 years, alcohol for 14 - the culture we live in accepts weed and alcohol as 'cool', 'fun' and as part of life and growing up - promoting it in films etc but that is total and utter toxic bullshit!!

I'm so angry at the world, at myself, at my friends, at my family. I'm so angry with people. People are full of shit, including myself. No body knows what they're doing, instead we're directed to look towards to God/Divine. I've tried so many therapies, read so many books, attended so many courses, it's just one big rollercoaster of emotions and then guess what. -here I am in a forum feeling really fucking let down. 

I'm losing faith. 

And it's down to ME to conjure up the strength to move forward, pick myself up, learn a new skill, put myself out there in the world, create a persona for myself on social media, FUCK SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NARCISM OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET. 

I'm tired. Life is all fun and games until you wake up at 30 and realise it's not. It's just your toxic patterns and depression that you've been masking with drugs. And you're broke. Great. Simply fucking great."
254,"I know we all do sighing when we depressed or stressed, there is uncomfortable feeling in our chest . And when we sigh long deep breath , we seen to feeling better.

Sometime I sigh very often and I don't want this make my mental health worse.

I use to self harm and I don’t anymore but I have very intrusive thoughts of hurting/ killing myself 
Don’t worry as I don’t want to do that and have no plans to do so but it’s on my mind a lot and that’s hard to cope with

261,"My partner of almost a year and a half has told me that in the last couple of weeks he's sometimes felt like he's ""drained"" of his love for me (and love/enjoyment of other things too, sometimes just for me, sometimes just for other things). He described it like the garden hose being on full blast but somebody's stood on it not letting the water (love) get through. It's still there but he can't feel it. And then it'll suddenly come back and he'll be like ""oh my god, that was horrible"". He said he's also felt like he wants to just be on his own.

He told me that this feeling has happened in every relationship he's been in. He can feel totally fine and be completely happy and in love, and then suddenly feel nothing and empty. He's broken up with girls he's really loved because of it and been so sad and hurt afterwards. He says he feels more ups than downs and it might not happen that often at all (this is the first time in a year and a half) and he doesn't want to break up because he knows he'll feel fine more often than not.

He came into the room and said ""I think all of this is depression"" and then he broke down and really cried. He was sobbing saying he doesn't want to feel this way and he loves me so much, I'm the best girlfriend he's ever had, apologising to me for hurting me.. I've seen him cry but never like this. I just held him and soothed him.

He says he's had depression since he was a kid, even before he was a teen, and he has just always felt depressed.

I've been doing lots of research and it seems like a side effect of depression, stress, and anxiety is having your feelings numbed and like you don't love anyone or anything. I sent him the articles I found on emotional numbing and depression and he was dumbstruck. He thought he was broken and was just incapable of being in relationships, he didn't realise as well that his anger is a symptom, which I think is common in men. He feels like the mental health induced numbness explains everything and he's been doing lots of research since and seems to really resonate with the symptoms of having Depersonalization disorder as well as depression.

I just want some support from people who understand this, what can I do to help him? I love him so much and our relationship is great, we're best friends and both feel as though we're practically family. Even though we don't believe in marriage he says I feel like his wife. We're incredibly close.

These last few days he's been really working on loving himself, he's been exercising again for the first time in over a year, he's wearing his nice clothes (for weeks he's just been in hoodies and joggers), but more importantly he's being gentle with himself.

The other side of the coin of this is obviously it's rattled me somewhat too; I couldn't eat properly for days because I felt like he was falling out of love with me and I was going to lose him and I felt so confused. I still feel a bit shaken up and hurt, if I'm being honest. This is really hard.

Sending lots of love to those who are depressed and partners of the depressed xx"

There was the 2009 great recession that hit me hard. I don't trust people as well anymore.

There is a pandemic now.

I’m not sure if anyone else has felt this, but I hate the thought of opening up to my friends and family about what goes on in my head. I feel like it appears to those around me that I am relatively happy/stable, and that it would shock them to find out that I’m seriously unhappy. I think about suicide a lot (I have no immediate plans, don’t worry) and the thought of telling any of my friends/family that I’m struggling terrifies me. I’m new here- I thought speaking to those who have similar issues/experiences will understand, and the whole anonymity thing make me more comfortable sharing. I’m tired of bottling everything up and looking forward to receiving/offering support!

keep slugging my guys and don’t give up!"
267,"I've recently come in terms with the fact that I will never get any help. I've seen tons of doctors who barely know what they're doing and get mad at you when the anti depressants don't work. I do not want to disclose my location but mental health care workers here are worse than shit. 
I've tried reaching out of therpay that u can't pay for because my family refuse to help me I've saved up money but it can barely pay for few sessions and after that I'll be out of money. I've tried a LOTTTTT of free resources and sessions and it's just hopeless at this point. 
It was a week ago when I was crying on my bathroom floor realising that I'll never get any help and I'll never get to improve or fix my life or do things I wish to do. So I decided ill just fake being OK. Idk why that came into my mind. I've been struggling with major depression for 5 years and depression in general since I was 12.so clearly thinking happy and pretending I was okay wasn't a solution but.... Surprise superise I had THE most amazing 5days. Don't ask me how it happened I don't know. I tried so hard to not think about me being depressed I tried so hard to not think at all. I kept myself busy 24/7.. 
I think I knew it won't last long 
But I'm so thankful for few nice days even if they were fake. And now I'm back. 
I've been crying since I've woken up today morning and I've slept most of the day.
I know I will survive. I've been doing that for years, surviving. But I don't wanna survive anymore. Just breathing and doing nothing and dying inside everyday Is not how I want to live. 
I had goals of being in medschool being a surgeon I wanted to get my old hobbies back. To actually smile. To not be scared of people around me. To leave my bed and my room and my house 
To breathe fresh air and just... Live. 
I'm so scared and lost. 
I'm on this forum after a long time. 
I was using few apps that were easily accessible to talk to people but sadly I couldn't find nice people anywhere so I'm back on here I don't even know what I expect anyone to say or do. Maybe nothing."

I am just wondering, I found out about my personality awhile ago in Chinese Astrology and it made me depressed.

Does anyone know what to do?

269,"Hello! :)
Hello! I am new to this forum, I was looking for forums in Spanish but did not find any, so I decided to search in forums in English and here I am, I was diagnosed with depression when I was little. I am not good with English, but I try to understand and write, I am a girl from Mexico I am here to help those who need it and also to get help. I get distracted by reading, cooking, playing with my pets and video games from time to time. :rolleyes:

 A greeting! and I hope everyone is okay :)"
270,"Here's a link to a website that lists the different cognitive distortions that we almost always use on a daily basis that keeps us depressed. According to the website: ""Cognitive distortions are simply ways that our mind convinces us of something that isn’t really true. These inaccurate thoughts are usually used to reinforce negative thinking or emotions — telling ourselves things that sound rational and accurate, but really only serve to keep us feeling bad about ourselves.""

271,"My reaction to antidepressants (any SSRI) deviates from the expected reaction. I feel an antidepressant effect within hours of taking the antidepressant (and not weeks). However, it comes with a feeling I don't tolerate. I would describe this feeling as a kind of emotional numbness, but it is really difficult to express in words what I am actually feeling.  Obviously I went to several doctors, but they have difficulties with my situation,as it does not match a typtical reaction to antidepressants.Has anyone ever had a similar reaction to antidepressants or does anyone (partly) recognize my description? I would love to find people in a similar situation or find more information about my condition.

Thanks"
272,"I'm tired of all the lying, stealing, and cheating sociopaths out to piss me off because of their misery, jealousy and envy. 

Envious inferior criminal men are attacking me, my health and my car etc.  I'm at the end!!!

I think the best solution is to find that right place to live where other people are happy, decent and content. A place I can guarantee my life, liberty, and happiness. 

Otherwise, things I WILL get very very ugly when I get back what is rightfully mine from these criminal backstabbing places.

Any questions, comments, advice, or concerns?"

At times I get so down because I just wish I was there for my kids so what is the best way to actually be able to cope with the sadness?

I really hope I can have some help.

278,"I don't like asking for help I feel guilty. I'm running out of options day in and out I'm beyond depressed with anxiety and depersonalization. It does not let up. Trying to figure out how to get beyond this for a while now no luck. I can't believe I was once happy and felt like a normal person growing up. It started to change at age 20 but slowly got worse. Having energy when I was younger, hanging out with friends, even playing sports... Blows my mind I did all those things without getting anxiety and no depression. I could not play a sport let alone even make it to work. After trying bunches of suppliments, a handful of antidepressants I'm still struggling I really am...one thing I talked with a doctor about was sleep apnea... I think that could be playing a huge role in this. Zero energy, depressed I have zero energy going up stairs is hard enough, heart palpitations and anxiety. But after telling her that I wake up 10 times each night only get 5 hours sleep instead of 8 now, I snore and have been told I snore so I could be stopping my breathing cutting of oxygen to the brain, wake up feeling more than I do before bed. Etc. I'll still keep trying antidepressants but I think I need a CPAP machine. The way my life is daily is not even called living. It's just ain't the feelings that you feel when depression strikes."
279,"Hi I’ve just signed up to my first ever help forum mainly because I now accept that I’m not feeling ok. I could list the amount of things that have happened this last 13 months but I doubt it would help to rake over it all. Anyway long and short of it is, I feel totally lost and overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness. I am usually a positive person but am struggling to sort myself out like I usually always do. I stopped listening to music which now makes me sad and I am starting to avoid even the most simple of conversations with anyone else. I don’t even like that I’m writing this right now but feel as if I must at least try and get my feelings out there instead of quietly suffering any longer."
280,"Hi all just looking for some advice and guidance as I’m pretty much at my wits end here.

So for the past three years I have been suffering from really bad fatigue that has affected my ability to enjoy anything in life.

this all started after I developed a panic disorder and depression in 2018. But I don’t feel depressed anymore or anxious yet the fatigue is still persistent.

my doctor is convinced it is depression causing it but I don’t feel depressed at all. Sure I’m very down but that’s because I wanna do things and my body won’t let me.

does this seem like depression to you guys? I’m not convinced at all.

please any advice you be so much appreciated thanks"

282,"I am so sick of life. If the dark cloud wasn't enough, I've  been on my own for years. Recently, and foolishly, I let someone into my life only for them to remove themselves from it. I did nothing wrong  but now she's totally  ignoring me, even blocked me (WTF) on at least one account  maybe even phone too. I was there for her when she needed me.
Why enter my life, meet up, get on really well, then cut me off?
This has hit me back again. I'm sick of being alone, sick of the depression - what is the point of living if life is devoid of joy?
No; 'going for a walk', 'getting  a dog', or God knows what ever else people say ain't gonna help.
If I had an easy way out I'd do it. Maybe I need to start thinking of a way, and no I don't want those numbers to phone, I have them and have zero intention of phoning them."
283,"This is really bothering me. Why would someone follow me? What would be someone’s intentions?

Today I went hiking in a relatively new area. I’d been going here for a few weeks. My usual route is on the south side of the same mountain. As I was heading down noticed two very large figures charging down a hill closer to the top of the mountain and they seemed to be coming right towards me. They were about 1/3 of a mile away. As soon as I glanced they stopped and we stared at each other. I didn’t think much until when I looked back they were yet coming again and stopped upon looking. I started walking fast down the hill I was on, once at the bottom I began following the trail I’d taken up towards that general area, the one that would get me home, literally sprint walking. I didn’t want to run yet. But I noticed they were following me from on a higher hill bordering my trail. I started cutting grass towards civilization af that point, away from them. I heard them getting closer. Two men with strangely high voices. When I got to the bottom of another hill I saw them pop up again, looking down at me with expressionless stares. Now it was sickeningly obvious that they were after me. I ran. Bolted towards the last hill which would take me to the edge of town, hopped a fence leading to a relatively crowded paved trail. I had to stop and pretend like nothing was up because I was also extremely embarrassed by that point. Freaking out like that in front of strangers. I noticed the two figures managed their way to the paved trail. Now for some more details:

The last drop towards the city I got pinned between some cliffs. I literally had nowhere else to run and I thought I was about to die. I took my chances and climbed down and even had to do quite a bit of bush whacking. Got cut on my wrists and hands from doing this before getting to the trail. Now all this seems like a nightmare. And what’s fucked up this is just like the recent nightmares I’ve had of me running through the wilderness getting chased. I was 2 miles north of home when I got to the edge of the city and had to have my dad give me a ride home. Should I be worried? Why would people chase me like that for no reason?? I didn’t break the law, or do anything except mind my business. I didn’t think it’d be a good fight, me vs two people with who knows what they had. Now I’m not going to be able to enjoy hiking ever again."
284,"I have so many issues that are like impossible to solve. I really want to die so bad, and I’m tired of feeling like this everyday. I think I might just end it. I really can’t take this shit. I don’t care anymore to get help, because it never works and majority of people are terrible."
285,"I was walking alone and started to talk out loud to myself. I wasn't self-conscious about doing it because I was wearing earbuds, listening to music. So if I passed by people, they would think I'm actually talking to someone. I was probably talking by myself for an hour. Three things to note: It made me less self-conscious about hearing my own voice; it made me a better talker; and it really helped my mood! I'm going to do this from now on!"
286,"I just can’t be bothered with anything anymore...

I quit my job in October and haven’t gotten anywhere. 

I realised my close friends don’t give much of a shit about me.

I really don’t enjoy eating food and just eating for the sake of it or I’m bored.

My sleeping patterns absolutely awful.

I just cant find anything that excites me, to look forward to or just happy. 

I really don’t know what to do with myself.... My family just say I’m lazy and I spoken to my ex colleague who understands part of the way I feel from working with me before I quit my job but said I really should speak to someone so here I am."
287,"i feel like my soul is floating in space while my body wonders this earth... a purposeless husk... a shell without its snail... just a decorative object with no use or purpose... taking up space, resources.

nothing appeals to me. life has lost its fun. i'm trapped in existence, waiting for something to strike me down. I don't care enough to do the job myself, but equally not enough to continue living. 

It's purgatory. A lobby. Trapped in the revolving door between life and the void. 

it's wank."
288,"What did you enjoy doing but no longer do because of your depression? I used to really like woodworking and watching home improvement shows. I also liked watching tv in general, but that really doesn't interest me anymore. It's difficult for me to think about what I could do that would interest me. I basically do the same thing every day now: do some walking for exercise (and also to clear my mind) and then stay in my room for the rest of the day. I can't think of anything that would interest me now. I was divorced a few years ago, so if I could find a significant other now, that would really lift my mood, but drain my wallet. :D:D:D"

How do I make my life more enjoyable, and increase my focus ability too.?"
290,"i feel so full of hatred and resentment. I try to live life without regret and not dwell on the past anymore but lately that's all ive been doing. Everything feels stagnant and the uncertainty about the state of the world is driving me insane and preventing me from having any sort of hope for the future because everything is a damn mess.

After some soul-searching i've come to the conclusion that I don't identify with any gender. I'm biologically female however have always been somewhat resentful of this - had penis envy since puberty started and was a very tomboyish child. I can relate to guys way more than girls and have very few female friends. I feel like i'm in some awkward little grey area as i don't have enough dysphoria to feel fully male, but have never really embraced femininity except to make myself attractive or fit in. 

 Being referred to as a ""woman"" or ""lady"" makes me recoil inside, and i get some weird kick out of being called ""dude/man/bro"" etc. and other male derivative slang. My top priority is being attractive, and i know i would be fugly if i went full guy due to my unfortunate facial structure and lack of height. I know i can pull off the female look much better, but not so much the act. I wish i was more androgynous but i have the bone structure of a five year old girl so that dream is dead. 

I have no desire to go through any surgeries, not that would i have the money for it anyway, so I'm just stuck having to accept that this was the body i was born with and there's nothing i can do about it. My stupid obsession with wanting to naturally look exactly how i want to is ruining my happiness. 

Everything feels shite and hopeless rn and i can't see my problems going away any time soon which makes me suicidal af however there's nothing i can do about it bc i'm too pussy to actually kill myself plus couldn't bare to put my family and friends through that loss. I'm trapped in this shit body on this shit planet purely out of guilt and obligation, and all i can do about it hope i get cancer so i can be done with it all and have time to say my goodbyes without anyone feeling like they could've prevented it. 

i just want a cock fucking hell"
291,Tired of this crazy world were living in right now. I hope I get hit by a car or something happens to me. I hope all these corrupt politcians get hung in the streets.

292,"Does any live like this ?

Being just depress at home, and then having an unexpected visit or crossing with someone on the street, and having to switch of mood (fake) to look normal.

None of my family knows how devastated Iam, and the amount of problems I have in my mind (I dont care either, its not that I want their support). Thats why I said its like to ""live a double life""."
293,"Everyday is a struggle, and I feel exhausted, but I owe it to my children to put one foot in front of the other. I have sought professional help, but my depression isn’t just a medical issue. I’m married to a catholic woman that has become some what of a religious extremist. The extreme fundamentalism boarders on mental abuse, and I cannot divorce because I cannot permit her to have my kids half the time. If I’m here I can protect them from her. I’m not suggesting they are in physical danger, they are not. She loves them of course, but her intense fundamentalism is out of control, and I have to be here in order to provide a safe haven and a normal relationship aswell as a block to her rediculous demands on them reguarding church.

Of course catholic extremist don’t believe in birth control and we were done having kids a long time ago, so intimacy is out of the picture, and frankly I could not feel intimate towords her anymore anyway. I have become extremely Lonely living in this situation for so long. I have no friends or people outside of her family. I pushed all of those people away years ago so they wouldn’t see.

I don’t know what to do with the situation. There is no reason I would have full custody if I left, and I can’t bear the thought of them having to deal with her alone. I’m a successful business owner, outgoing, and even semi famous in my community for my charity work. No one would ever suspect I’m terribly Lonely and nearly break into tears if I see couple hug or enjoy each other.

I’m not suicidal, but sometimes I feel like It would be better to be dead. Of course that dosn’t do my kids any good, so I’m in it for the long hall and I must hold it together until they are adults. 

I guess I just needed to tell sombody."
294,"So, I've had to reach out to this group before, but things are getting worse.

My mother (61) is a life-long alcoholic.

I'm currently in America, she lives in London.
My wife and stepson are American; for the best part of a year we've been splitting our time between the UK and the US.

We've been in the US for around a month this time. About two weeks ago, my mother went on a big binge drunk (which she usually does when we're away). Nobody is watching her, she goes off the rails. But this was the worst one ever.

She's a manic depressive bipolar individual on numerous medications.

Basically I had a week of trying to talk her down from a massive bender and a manic episode, brought on by being drunk for a week and going off her meds. There were at least 16 calls a day, mostly babbling drunk or sobbing crying. I managed to talk her down, eventually, she got back on her meds, calmed down the drinking. She was very sad and apologetic (she usually is). I can't really describe to you how bad this was, it doesn't come across in this paragraph but it was bad. Almost constant calls and sobbing and slurring for days on end. Calls starting at 7am. Went on all day. This is while I'm trying to home-school our son, staying at my mother-in-law's house. Our boy needs a lot of attention; he's extremely high energy. Anyway, this was the worst bender ever and she's been going on benders (drinking every day even if not on a bender). I can't describe the stress and worry of it. Also, my wife and son are currently applying for UK residence permits and my mother going to pieces could jeopardize that.

For the first time in her life she acknowledged she has a drinking problem. Said she needs help. Says she can't stop but she wants to. That's never happened before. I don't think it's a magic switch, and there is no cure for the illness she has, but it felt like something. Maybe a first step.

I got her a doctor's appointment to discuss it with them, she's waiting to hear back about meetings and assistance and medication to help her to stop drinking (she ""self-medicates"" due to anxiety).

 Anyway, sounds like a happy ending; I managed to talk her down, get her a doctor's appointment, order her medication for her. Got her through it. 
 
A few days later (yesterday) it was her birthday. On the same day, she got paid (disability benefits) She was ok-ish in the morning. Could tell she'd had a drink, but I had expected that because anything - celebration, tragedy, anything - is an excuse for her to drink. 

Based on recent events and conversation I hoped it would be minimal or short-term (it's often the case, any time I'm away this happens - she drinks like crazy, goes quiet for a few days (sometimes total silence), comes out the other side of it. I've learned to wait it out. This episode was different though. As the day went on I heard from her less, she stopped calling, got the occasional whatsapp message. I could tell something was up. Pretty late I got a message saying goodnight and could tell that she was probably pretty hammered. I hoped it was a one day indulgence and she would pull it back together.

Well, today, she called me at 2pm her time, and she's very VERY drunk. Extremely slurry, couldn't tell what time it was, thought it was the evening and she was going to make dinner. Just wasted.

I can't believe there's such a quick turn-around on this. I can't describe the stress of thinking we're back to where we were only a few days ago; I didn't get a week of (not even sobriety), just not a catastrophic bender.

So now she's not answering her phone or reading messages. 

I'm desperately hoping this isn't going to be a repeat of the last massive bender where she goes off her medication because she's too drunk to take it and slips back into a terrible manic episode.

I'm just exhausted. This has been a very very stressful year for me already (as it has for everybody to some degree - thanks pandemic) and I'm not getting on very well with my wife either. So it's just feeling really overwhelming. I seem to spend my life in service of others and I'm not getting anything out of it. I spend all my time trying to take care of my mother or doing things for my wife and son, and getting nothing out of it. Just a further kick in the teeth and more problems and stress and worry.

I'm feeling totally hopeless right now, like nothing is going to ever really be okay again. I'll just go from problem to problem; my mum's drinking, my relationship with my wife, everything is so hard and just not working. It's one thing after another.

I'm losing all hope over here."
295,"I’m a lonely middle aged female who’s recently lost a soulmate through suicide. He was my college. I feel very lost without him. I’ve been suffering from loneliness for a long time. I feel like a total failure in life I feel very empty and overwhelmed. I never experience a marriage or have any children. I don’t feel normal. I been mistreated most of my life, especially by my family. I’ve been abused, bullied backstabbed, ridiculed and rejected. I’m sick of people talking about their normal everyday life while drowning in my misery! And now I’m overwhelmed with grief. I feel like I don’t want to be in this world anymore because I feel like people don’t care! I always have suicidal thoughts and they are getting stronger. My recent therapist wasn’t much help, I feel she’s a crock of I don’t want to say it on the forum. I’M A NOBODY A ROBOT! A THING! I’ll keep praying that I’ll die in my sleep."
296,"I can watch a two-hour movie with about four or five main characters. After the movie has ended, if you asked me to tell you the name of a single character, I couldn't do it. In grade school, on a test where they ask you to read a passage and then answer some questions about what you just read, I couldn't do it. I'd have to read a question at a time and then re-read the passage, looking for the answer. I also can't follow listening to simple instructions after a while. My eyes glaze over and my mind goes numb. I'm not sure if the next example I give here is because of memory problems or concentration problems, but it really frustrates me. On my smartphone, if I'm deep in thought about reading something on one screen and then have a thought about looking at something else on a different screen where I have to switch screens, it literally takes just a couple of seconds for me to forget what I wanted to look at and then it takes me quite some time to remember what I wanted to look at if I remember at all. Is this because of depression or because of Alzheimers or dementia? I'm 61."
297,"Not too motivated today to even get out for a walk, but it is nice out, sunny, and I do feel better after my walks. Not sure I have anything to get at the store. Oh well, just to break up the boredom I will do a walk."
298,"My close friend has a history of mental health problems including depression/anorexia and is currently struggling again. I know she is not doing well. I also have depression and whenever I am low, she has always been there for me and helps me out loads. We have had a close friendship for a few years now. However when she gets down and low for a while, she doesn't talk to me hardly at all. She just shuts me out, but she still seems to talk to other people judging from her social media posts. I don't get why this is, it makes me feel hurt, rejected and abandoned, and I just don't understand it. It makes me feel insecure and like she doesn't really like me at all, even though I know in my mind, she is going through something.

I wonder why is it she is shutting me out but still seems to talk to others? Is it because she can be fake with these people and cover it up with them, but she knows she can't pretend with me and would have to actually open up? Is it because she doesn't want to burden me with her problems when she knows I have problems of my own? Or does she just not value me as a friend and has our whole friendship been a lie? It doesn't feel like a lie from my angle, so I just don't understand her behaviour.

Overall I would like to be there for her and help her, so it is worrying when she behaves this way. Please can someone give some wisdom"
299,"I have been wondering if I am suffering from depression or if it's actually more complicated, like quiet BPD. Here is how I can best describe my symptoms. This could very well just be depression. I am seeking therapy, but I also know that quiet BPD is not well-known. I haven't seen anyone on here talk about quiet BPD, but maybe those in the borderline spectrum can relate.

I want closeness, but I push people away whenever possible
I feel like I've been emotionally abandoned by those closest to me - friends and family
My mood can change rather quickly if I get triggered by something. One minute I am completely content, the next I feel despair and shame.
I like this person one day, but the next day I despise them or wonder why I ever liked them in the first place
I have a lot of conflicting beliefs within myself. One of them being around sexual orientation. One day I feel like, yes I am LGBT, the next I feel like I was completely wrong about myself. Then I go back to feeling like I am LGBT. The cycle repeats. The cognitive dissonance doesn't ever go away.
I feel a lot of shame and self-doubt
I feel like I'm always too much for people and that they cannot deal with me because I am me
People can betray my trust very quickly
People see me and think I have everything together because I don't ""show"" it
I was told by a therapist that I have social anxiety/phobia
I hide how I truly feel
I'm such a people pleaser and can't seem to not stop wanting people to see me as perfect
I change my outlook on things all the time. One event or comment could change my feelings about something
I am chronically indecisive
I isolate myself when I get hurt or feel any kind of negative emotion
I am confused as to who I am. I feel inner turmoil about my identity on a daily basis

Could this just be Major Depressive Disorder? I was told that I have both depression and anxiety too. I don't have suicidal ideation either. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks"
300,U know there is a problem when u are taking too much oxycodone. Pain trump's all

I'm 34 now, what do I have to show for it.

I have a brother who is legally blind and disabled at birth. He hasnt got any better.

I don't speak properly, I have a stutter since I was a kid.

I have not had a good relationship at home. My father has torn me apart mentally and emotionally ever since I came home from college. I tried to run away from home and start over but ended in the hospital and mental health center.

I have a college education that no one cares about. I have had unstable work for many years.

I was divorced a couple years ago. I got married in another country.

I have no real possessions, property or assets.

When I was 19 my girlfriend decided to have two abortions. I am concerned about having kids or will I have a family?

I had a girlfriend once at 22 years old. She had 4 kids and her boyfriend went to jail. I couldn't handle this situation.

Recently, I met a lady online through a dating app and she scammed me for money.

I used to have interests in life and being active. For example, playing sports, playing music, taking classes, an ambition to be someone.

Since I was about 25 years old, Ive been in and out of the mental health center trying medications both voluntary and involuntary and I can't figure out my life."
302,Finally got round to giving it a try.
303,"I'm on Social Security disability because of my severe depression. I cannot work at a substantial job. I have an older brother who, whenever we talk to each other on the phone, will inevitably say to me something along the lines of, ""Well, I have to go to bed soon, because some of us have to go to work tomorrow."" I feel like telling him off on how depression totally ruins your life. But I hold my tongue, because he is the only family that I have. But still, it is a very mean and insulting thing to say."
304,"I get these days where all I do is sleep and i feel depressed because of it too.I worry a  lot which doesnt help either.HOwever when I get severly depressed all I want to do is sleep all darn day long.It doesnt take me to long to fall asleep either.Then when I wake up I dont feel refreshed at all.All I want to do is sleep.It is the only thing that takes away my sadness and depression and the fear of being scared,whenever someone comes to see me I get scared when they leave.I just feel like i need to be  with someone.I hate being alone.I need to be loved and protected.IS this all part of depression?"
305,"Hi

I recently lost a friend (they didn't die), I posted about this on the SH forum, but this is a more in depth explanation, she was my life line, and we were inseparable, we have known each other for 7 years now. When Covid hit in march and everything shutdown, it was hard for both of us but we helped each other through it. We talked for hours, daily, played games and tried to cheer each other up (we are students, we didn't have anything better to do other than study).

Unfortunately my mental health was already a bit unstable, she ended up helping me a lot more than I helped her.

I started showing signs of depression and severe anxiety, but she stood by my side and helped me, even though helping me was dragging her mental health down too. Unfortunately I did not realise this... I was so absorbed by my problems I didn't think to stop and realise that talking to her about my dark thoughts was making her feel worse.

Then summer came and I felt better, I was beginning to get out of my depression and our friendship became stronger than ever before.

Then school arrived and my stress came back, and my mental health plummeted. I became suicidal and she did her best to help me, and she stopped me from committing suicide, but she couldn't take it anymore and decided to stop helping me.

I was shocked, and then the realisation of what I did to her sank in... and I felt like a monster... I felt... so evil for putting her through all that, I tried to make amends, but she didn't want to talk saying that she just doesn't like me anymore, and the day before Christmas she told me to never text her again unless she texts me first.

I feel extreme guilt for what I did... and grief... and regret... even writing this makes me cry.

She is still in the same friend group, which makes it very awkward at times.
When we are in a group call and she is laughing and joking with the others and towards me she has this cold unforgiving tone. That just makes me feel so much regret.

And now... I feel empty. I lost my best friend because of my own selfishness, she was the one that recommended this forum to me. I owe so much to her. Yet all I did is make her sad. I think about her every day, and how happy we would be if I didn't ask her to help me, with my mental health.

Feel free to judge me how you like...
I have lost faith in my self and have no self esteem.

I hope I can be better..."
306,Does anyone have experience with ECT?
307,"Hi,
     I started some cognitive behavioral therapy because I know it’s meant to help but I’m particularly frustrated with it tonight. I find I can recognize a negative train of thought just fine- I’ve been dealing with them forever- but saying something truly positive once I identify them feels near impossible. I know when I have a thought like “I’m a piece of trash rn”, for example when I’m trying to study, I’m supposed to stop and think “I’m doing the best I can” but that just doesn’t feel true. I’m not doing the best I can because I KNOW I can do better. I know I can get better grades and I know I should be able to focus because I have in the past. I have this internalized idea that I should always be able to reach that high standard I set for myself. I can rationally recognize that I need to be kinder to myself but saying the words FEELS wrong. 
I know it’s bad to just sit on the couch and berate myself for things I feel like I should be able to do but coming up with the right words to counter those thoughts is so hard for some reason. It feels like saying them is a lie and an excuse. I want to say “I’m better than this” but that feels problematic because it just points out how I’m not doing what I want/need to be doing. 
So I was wondering if anyone who’s doing/has done CBT can relate or give any advice? 
I’m just having an especially hard time tonight and I’d really appreciate any response.
Thanks,
Herbarium"
308,"I don't know for how long can I feel this alone, can I think these horrible thoughts and can I feel so worthless of anything, I phisically feel as if my soul wants out of my body, as if they're not compatible. When I think of asking for help, I think of screaming underwater."
309,"Does anyone else feel helpless? Like..why the heck is it SO hard to get better? Why do anti-depressants make you feel worse before you get better? What kind of twisted...
And why is it so hard to get the proper kind of treatment? Why are there so many barriers?
We know the answers to these questions. But they’re still just as baffling. How much longer do I have to wait until I’m generally content? How do I find that contentness here, now, tomorrow, the next day? Ahhhhhhh:( This is really frustrating and traumatizing.  I just want to get better. I just want to feel secure, at ease, and joyful. I know happiness is fleeting but if I could feel it even just half the time...You know what I mean?"
310,"My life has no purpose. I have no motivation or energy to try anymore. I don’t even bother picturing a good life for myself anymore because every time things start going well I ruin them. People leave me—always, every time, and when I need them most. Never in my life has the person I loved love me back. I’m so unhappy with the person I’m with. He says he loves me, but he doesn’t understand my depression and how crippling it gets; he seems to have no compassion and is tired of my bs, saying that it ruins his day when I can’t pick myself up. My mom is an alcoholic and I can’t connect with her on any real level. My sisters and I are so torn apart—we’re all broken and unable to communicate our feelings because we never expressed them as children and it’s looked at as weird in my family. My dad loved my mom and after she divorced him he went into a depression himself, and now clings to a terrible woman with money. All he did was work when we were kids and now he found a situation where he doesn’t have to work, be a father, and pretends the past doesn’t exist. I know it hurt him to have his wife leave him because she was clearly bored of being a wife and mom; she wanted to go back to being a teenager, and he must’ve felt worthless to cling to the woman he’s with now. My heart breaks more and more every day when I think of each of them. I wish I could piece us back together. But I feel sorry for the little girl I was with no one watching out for me. I was in and out of rehabs since 13. Always depressed and ready to check out as far back as I can remember. And no one noticed. I think we were all angry kids caught up in our distractions, though. We’re all on our own, suffering separately. I try my best to be a good sister and daughter but everyone keeps it surface level. I’m hurting so bad. I have no friends because I’m sober now. The one good friend I have thinks I’m weird probably, because I’m so awkward and have lost a lot of my social skills over the years. I have no one and I’m afraid. I know these negative thoughts are cancerous; I wish I weren’t so negative, but I used to always try to bring people up and was always the one of my friend group being stupid and silly. I totally lost that part of me over the years I spent as an addict. As cliche as it sounds, I feel I have nothing left to give. I know I should seek friendship through AA or something of the sorts (I will try again soon), but for now, it felt good to get that off my chest. Thanks and much love, you guys."
311,"I've been on antidepressants for 17 years and my mental health has been stable all this time as a result. They are what enabled me to function as a ""normal"" human being. My doctor was of the opinion that I would need to be on them long term which I was fine with.  

2 years ago I moved to a new town with my husband and had to register with a new surgery. As soon as I had registered I was asked to go for a medication review and was told I had been on them for too long and needed to try and come off them.  I was told to reduce my dose from 20mg to 10mg for a few months then stop completely. I did this but after reducing to 10mg my depressive symptoms returned so I went back to the doctor and she told me to increase my dose back up to 20mg. I did and started feeling better after a few weeks. 6 months later I was asked to go for another review and I was again told to reduce my dose again with a view to stopping completely. Again I did this and again my mental health declined and i had to go back and be put back on a higher dose. I asked at the last appointment if I was going to have to keep going through this, having my dose increased and decreased. The doctor said that their goal is always to get people off antidepressants as they don't like people being on them long term. I left that appointment feeling that I had no choice but to try and get off my medication as it had been made clear to me that this was their end goal. 

I was on 10mg at this point and instead of increasing the dose back up to 20mg I reduced it to 5mg, stayed on that dose for a month, reduced to 2.5mg, stayed on that dose for a month and then stopped completely. I took my last dose 8 days ago. I haven't felt great but I thought I was doing ok but then yesterday I just crashed. I haven't been able to stop crying and I have never felt as bad in my life. I was having constant suicidal thoughts to the point where I felt I was a danger to myself. My husband rang 111 and they told him to take me to A&E which he did. I saw a mental health nurse who was quite shocked that my GP surgery had decided I needed to be taken of my medication even though it was working for me and wasn't causing me any side effects. He referred me to the community mental health team who rang me last night and they have arranged for me to have an appointment with a consultant psychiatrist tomorrow.  

I just feel so angry at my doctor surgery, they have basically wrecked my mental health. And for what? What was the problem with me being on medication which was working for me? I feel like I've gone back to the place I was in all those years ago before I managed to get my mental health stable. How long is it going to take to get me back to where I was? I haven't been able to stop crying, I can't even face getting out of bed. I'm going to put a complaint in about the GP surgery. 

I don't know how I'm going to face work tomorrow. My employer doesn't know about my mental health issues. I've never had reason to tell them as my mental health has been stable all these years and it's never affected my work - I've never had to take time off work. I have found it a struggle lately but I've tried to keep it together. I don't really want to have to share this with work as I'm quite a private person and I don't really want to have to share this. I also don't trust that if I did share it with my manager it would be kept confidential. There's another woman at work who suffers with her mental health and has had time off because of it and my manager has told me all about it and what's been said in private meetings between them which I think is so unprofessional. 

There's no point really to this post, I just wanted to vent. Hopefully now I'm seeing a psychiatrist I will get the support I need and things will improve. I hope everyone else is doing ok."
312,"I think the reason is having been like this for so long (I've been severely depressed for all of my 20s) I feel that there is significant discrimination. I'm very isolated and have no friends, and always struggled at the best of times. I think the reason is that I just don't relate to many people, and then I've never put too much effort in really.

Is there anyone else feeling like they just don't relate to anyone? I just feel ashamed of myself now, because my 20s were a complete failure. I just struggle with people, I am intelligent, have a sense of humour and after a decade of this pain, It has toughened me up a bit. It's just find people impossible. Despite the loneliness my mental health has improved somewhat. It's the thing I worry about most."

317,"I have really been struggling to eat the past two weeks. This has been going off and on for about a year now. I just either feel too anxious or too depressed to eat. It isn't like I don't want to eat, I like food and I want to be able to eat it I just can't. I have no appetite, when I sit down to eat I just can't be bothered, I just don't see the point any more. I try to force my self because I know I must eat but I end up getting stressed and breaking down into tears while eating. Sometimes I feel like I am going to throw up from forcing my self. I live with my grandparents and if I don't eat they start questioning me why, I'm just not hungry though but then they worry. I have started hiding food and throwing it away when they can't see so they think I am eating (I always eat later when I can manage it). I'm worried I am going to develop and eating disorder or something. 

I used to be a huge comfort eater but lost tons of weight because of this. I'm not underweight as I was over weight before so it isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'm like 5.1 and 8 stone 10. I'm pretty happy with my weight and body so it is nothing to do with wanting to lose weight."
318,"Here is a PowerPoint slide I made a while ago that hopefully will bring a smile (what's that, you ask?) to people suffering from SEVERE depression. I know that I smile whenever I re-read these jokes! I've read that if you can laugh at yourself with what you're dealing with, you can control what you're facing.

A little bit about me...

I've had depression my whole life. I'm now 61 years old. First my depression was mild, then it progressed to moderate, and now it is severe. I am on Social Security disability and cannot work. I attempted suicide once. Thankfully I wasn't successful at it. I have passive suicidal thoughts almost on a daily basis. I have all of the symptoms of clinical depression. I have treatment-resistant depression. I've tried all of the SSRIs and none of them have helped me. I've tried 15 sessions of ECT (electro-convulsive therapy) and that didn't work. I've tried 36 sessions of rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) and that also didn't work. I wish that people who don't have depression could understand what it's like to have it. My marriage of 26 years ended in divorce because my family could no longer be a caregiver to me. It is a horrible, horrible illness, but I guess everyone on this forum knows that."
319,"I just had some dental work done that went bad. 3 weeks later, I'm in just as bad pain as when I got out (feels like a bad nerve).  It especially hurts to eat. I was taking over the counter Tylenol, but my doctor prescribed 500 mg of ibuprofen which seems to work better. I'm having to take a pill almost to eat now and have to make it through weekend. I feel like shit."
320,"What worth is therapy exactly if the circumstances are hopeless? Either poverty, thats due to disability, loneliness, or other problems due to disability or other circumstances you cant change. Why should you go into therapy then, when its hopeless? Isnt it then just wasting time, and in some countries money."
321,"Bit of a follow up to two previous threads I also wrote (you don't have to read them): 
I hate the way I look (stretch marks, double chin, etc)
https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/threads/cant-stop-thinking-about-an-altercation-from-6-months-ago.336225/

Overall I am just absolutely fed up of being body shamed by people since the start of this lockdown, telling me I am fat/overweight. I am fed up of hearing it from my family, friends, strangers across the street, etc. I decided to have a drink last night (first time in a while). Once I was a few drinks in, I decided to go on omegle and hope to meet and chat with people, which I never usually do when I am sober. I've always been slightly introverted, but when I have a drink, I try to become more sociable. One guy I went passed said ""show tits, fat boy"" and another guy I went passed said ""Eughh you're so ugly"", even though the dude wasn't even showing his own face. Just after this I decided to go out for a long walk (even though I was slightly drunk and it was like 11:30pm), I must've walked over 7-8 miles, doing frequent bursts of sprints every so often. It was really dark and there was barely any people around, it was also very cold but I didn't mind it, as long as I was out moving about knowing that it would help me lose weight and bring me a step further to not hating myself as much. I got home at about 2:45 and I was absolutely shattered since it was way past my usual bedtime and I had pains in my shoulder, elbow, thigh, hamstrings and feet from how much I walked/ran. Today I went out again for my usual 5 mile walk (that I normally complete in just under 2 hours) despite me feeling really sore from the night before. When I got home, literally everything was sore. My ankles, my feet, my toes, my thighs, my hamstrings, even my arms and shoulders. As of recently I have been eating relatively well, drinking over 2 litres of water a day, and going out for walks on a daily basis. Though for the past week I kinda rewarded myself with a lot of unhealthy foods and drinks since I had been dieting and exercising for quite a while. I don't know but for some reason, when people feel the need to comment on my weight, it really affects me personally and I start to get really agitated and that only exacerbates me to work out more. All my uncles frequently comment on how ""fat"" I am, yet they're all literally massively overweight themselves. I am 5'9 I'm quite stocky. 
The other one isn't as heavy but is definitely podgy, and every single time I end up visiting them. The first thing they always say is ""Jesus, you've gone fat"" ""look at the size of you"" ""where's your neck"" ""you've got a fat ass"" etc. Both my cousins always comment on it as well as my grandad who says the same. Always pointing out my neck, my waist, my backside, my biggest insecurities and they always feel the need to point it out and laugh. It really grinds my gears and it's one of the reasons why I stopped visiting them as often. Last year when I was at college, I walked past my friend who just pointed out to me a called me chubby. When I went to see my Dad (who is also bigger than me) for the first time in a long time, he couldn't help but feel the need to comment on my double chin (literally my biggest insecurity) and how much weight I gained since the last time he saw me. I could go on and on about all the instances I've been body shamed including in the links above to my previous threads. I'm currently trying so hard to lose weight and yet I am still being body shamed by people, and it's just so infuriating. To be brutally honest, I actually don't mind letting myself go every now and then and being fat for a while. It's just when people are frequently commenting on it and making me feel terrible about myself, it really doesn't do my confidence any good because I just feel so unattractive. Which is really annoying coz I do indeed wanna be in a relationship with someone, but I just couldn't see anybody liking someone like me. And it's not just because of my weight, but also my facial features, my hair, my personality, my voice, etc. I live in quite a rough town, so being hurled abuse at from across the street is fairly common here. Hence why I only normally go for walks/runs in the early hours of the morning, when all the scumbag yobs and chavs aren't knocking around at them times. Overall I've just been feeling really down on myself recently, I just feel so unattractive, I am absolutely shattered and sore, and overall just not confident in myself or my future with other people. 

I also wanna point out I've been on 20mg Fluoxetine for the past year and a half. And one of the side effects of that is weight gain. Not that I could do much about that though."
322,"I am not sure if anyone will read this or even respond but I need a place to just lay it all out.

Life seemed to be going ok there for me for a bit. I had a decent job, good health, family was healthy. Pandemic hit, lost job, could not see family, I am sure we are all on the same page as to what I am getting at.

I was hanging in there pretty well until earlier last month I was diagnosed with Covid-19. Then from that moment on, for a lack of better words, all hell seemed to be unleashed.

I was asymptomatic for the most part, a little cough here, headache, one day of chills. No fevers. What came next drastically changed my life. I started to have complete delusions, fears, severe crippling panic attacks, about 5 per day. I was in a constant state of anxiety for 3 weeks. At some points I was having flash backs of traumatic periods in my life. Anything covid related on the news, commercials, ANYTHING, would set me off. I would just lock up and not be able to move. 

What really gets me is that I was not really affected by the virus, I knew the dangers and potentials that came with catching it, however instead of it hitting my body, it took a massive toll on my mind and mental health. A few years back I had a TBI, so I can only assume that had something to do with it.

Now, I did reach out to my PCP, discussed the situation and I do have a psych evaluation lined up. I am on some meds and they are helping but this is not the only issue.

At the same time that this shit all started, both of my uncles ended up in the hospital and my dad is on the verge of dying as well. A family member found my uncle bed ridden unable to move, long story short, he had a brain bleed, that then lead to a stroke and it was revealed to me last night that he has not much longer to live because they discovered he has pancreatic cancer and the cancer has spread completely throughout his body. 

My own father is severely diabetic, that is about the best way for me to put it. The meds are no longer working, his health is failing fast. My other uncle, literally lost his mind. I do not want to go into details but he started having mini strokes and one thing after another, he no longer is in touch with reality. 

My mother is trying to handle this the best she can, I am trying to be a support system for her. 
I lost my job a few days ago because the owner of the company I worked for gave no regards to the medical complications I personally started to develop from covid ( pains in chest and difficulty breathing ). I wrote her a long note telling her what I thought of her and she let me go. At the end of the day I personally do not want to work for someone who does not care about my well being anyways.

With all of this said, I am doing my best to hold on. This is so excruciating sometimes. I know so many other people are going through similar things, losing family members to this virus and other causes. I just feel so numb at times. I have no thoughts of suicide or anything of that nature, but I have disconnected from the world so to speak.

I have wiped my social media accounts completely and deleted them. Just I feel those who pretend to understand really do not and right now fake comfort I feel will do more damage than good.

My stress reliever used to be exercising. Oh how I love to workout, but now I can barely walk up a flight of stairs without chest pains and difficulty breathing. I feel like anything I ever had that helped me get through stuff is completely gone. 
Yeah I would have a drink of wine here or there, take CBD to help and even thc at time, which that made stuff worse for me so I cut it out. The medication I am on now basically requires me to live a very clean (drug and alcohol free) lifestyle. Not like I used drugs but something as simple as CBD I was advised against using. 

I know we are all going through stuff and it is hard, but for the first time in my life there is an emotion that I have never felt before. I cannot explain what it is. It is not emptiness, or sadness, nor grief. I just feel broken so to speak. 
I do keep my faith and I try to tell myself put it in Gods hands and I do, but I am still human and I feel.

I am an only child, no siblings. Most of my family is dead and gone now and seeing the remainder of mine rapidly deteriorate in front of me is shattering for me. 

When I go in public I used to get annoyed at how stupid people would act but all I have now in humility and sincerity. I try to make sure I say hello and ask how people are doing. I noticed that this pandemic has brought the worst out in so many people. As you can see I am all over the place here with my writing and my thoughts, but this is the only way I know how to get it out. I can bombard my family members with my issues only so much. I cannot whine to them on a constant daily basis. I just stay quiet most of the time and I am thankful I got the medication I needed in time because I doubt I would have been able to keep it together. Who knows? I am at least trying.

Just wanted to put this out in the Universe and if anyone has anything to say, I am open. I just do not know what or how to feel right now. I wish everyone of you a moment of happiness and peace."
323,"Hello. About two weeks ago, I unwittingly took an expired Lexapro and began experiencing severe depressive mood swings, anxiety, and a desensitized sensation. I had to look up a name for what I was experiencing for the latter, and I found ""derealization"". I felt like I was in a fog, and I had trouble absorbing my surroundings. The derealization was uncomfortable and mildly disorienting, but it subsided after a few days.

For some background: I am on the spectrum but am high-functioning. I have taken Lexapro and Adderall for the past several years but have not been taking them as regularly in a few months since I am not in school at the moment. Two Sundays ago, while I was stressed going over some paperwork for my school, I took 1 expired Lexapro and experienced nausea and a headache, however it went away by the end of that day. Fast forward to that Saturday and I get hit with derealization and depression. I have never experienced something like this. I take Lexapro for anxiety, and have never really gone through a serious, prolonged bout of depression.

The depression has decreased in severity over the past several days, although my symptoms seem to be flatlining in a way, not getting worse or better, but still in the back of my mind. I keep ruminating over past memories, lamenting decisions I've made, dwelling on negative thoughts, and most of all, feeling a profound sadness over the thought I've never really connected with anyone on a deep, personal level. I get anxiety over hypothetical situations where I have to be in public or out and about, which hasn't happened to me in years. Thinking of the city or even sunsets, makes me anxious and slightly uncomfortable. Then I get a moment of clarity, where I feel relatively fine and optimistic, only to wake up the next morning feeling depressed. I don't have suicidal thoughts, which I'm glad. Usually I get a moment of normality at least once a day, though today I did not really have that, which worries me slightly.

My doctors seem to think it has nothing to do with ingesting expired medication, though I find it odd that I experienced these symptoms that are more or less related with exactly what Lexapro is supposed to treat. All my symptoms seem to fall under SSRI withdrawal, from what I've looked up. Could it be the social isolation due to Covid, or a combination of both? I really don't know what else could have triggered this, as I was feeling well and normal before this whole ordeal began. I finally got a proper refill of my medication and have been on it for a few days, thought it'll take a little longer for me to possibly feel any change. I hope it helps. I'm worried and anxious that the expired meds triggered something in my brain and it won't be an easy fix. I'm having trouble enjoying things like reading books or listening to music. My family has started to notice. I'm feeling so alone. My doctors have not been super helpful and were reluctant to prescribe me anything, instead referring me to therapy, which I planned to do anyway. Only after some prodding, did they finally prescribe me the Lexapro. My biggest fear is that these have been my true feelings all along, and the medication has been suppressing them, and now that I'm going through withdrawal, they're coming out stronger and fresher.

I'm reaching out because my therapy isn't for another couple of weeks, and I can't wait that long. I was hoping if anyone had a similar experience with derealization, or an anti-depressant or spoiled/expired medication that created severe side effects. Is my depression exaggerating my feelings? Any help, advice, or coping mechanisms are greatly appreciated."
324,"Im not really sure where to start. For the past year i have days where i feel really low, i dont know why i feel low. I feel like crying a lot but i dont know why. I have thoughts about leaving the house and just not coming back. I am marries with 3 children and i love my husband and children more than anything in the world, i dont want to leave them, i couldnt live without them but i still get thoughts of just going and not returning even though thats not what i want. Some days i am completely fine and happy and i sit wondering why i was so low and why i feel the way i do on other days because my life is good but the the next day i can be so low again. 
I keep trying to smile through it and pretend that im ok, i dont want to tell my husband because he has adhd and struggles to understand or cope with new or hard situations. I am supposed to be the strong one in our family but now im starting to feel like a failure."
325,"i can’t stop thinking about hurting myself and i don’t really think people would miss me. i don’t think i deserve to be alive because i use to many recources and create too little joy to deserve it. i’m very very sad it hurts very much i’m very sad. the world is so dark and scary, it hurts so much to see people go through so much and be in such a painful world. is this how being an adult feels? ur aware of everything that’s painful all the time? my friends are all doing molly and i don’t live in a good area so i’m scared they’re gonna get laced i just want them to be ok i love them so much i don’t think being alive is very easy at all i don’t know how so many people do it. my friends don’t care if they died and they wouldn’t care if i did either. i feel so alone and useless and i feel a hatred towards myself. i want to do something particular bad to myself (i don’t want to say it bc other ppl will have the thought in their head) and the thought hurts so bad it just won’t go away and it comes so much i cry in public so much i started getting migraines. my period has also stopped. i have no hope and i want to go i’m scared i’m so scared i don’t know what to do i don’t think it’s gonna get better. i want to get better i want to be happy. i’m scared i’m gonna kms on the anniversary of the school shooting near my house. i don’t feel good and having taht too i just don’t think i’m going to make it"
326,"I feel... so trapped. I can't breathe. I can't speak to anyone about my issues. And I have no friends. When I start to talk to my family about issues, even simple ones, it becomes a lecture on how I should be feeling and just... I can't get into all that, but... how do I express how I feel anymore idk. I want it to all stop. I wish I had the option to stop time and just sleep for a few years alone. I can't take this. I can't keep everything inside forever and just blow up every week or more. I just want a friend. I just want a hug. I just need SOMETHING. It would be so easy if everything would just stop. I want to sleep forever. I don't even know if I feel suicidal, but I don't fear death really, and I don't know if I can stand life anymore. There r things I've never told a soul about. Things just between me and my dad that idk how to ever say without hurting him and me. But it's like he doesn't remember. Like he blocks it all out.  It's so lonely to be the only one who knows. God, help me please. I can't do anything but cry now."
327,Emotionally physically mentally I put up with it for 8 years I thought by showing him how much I love him things will change they just got worse I'm no longer with him moving on with my life my self-esteem is so low all I do is cry. Because I feel like I'm not worth anything can I do better than that all I do is cry and put myself down nobody wants me nobody wants to be around me but that's not true I have a boyfriend and I'm pushing him away cuz I don't want to please please help me tell me something
328,"I have been struggling a lot lately.

My anxiety has been through the roof thanks to the Coronavirus crisis, and I'm sure I'm not the only one, it has really had a huge impact on people's mental health.

I have been having a lot of intrusive thoughts, mostly about self-harming, but I just don't have the energy or the means to act on them. I feel sometimes like I'm on the verge of just completely losing it and lashing out at my friends and loved ones. 

One of the things about depression is that one day you can be fine but the next day you feel like absolute shit. And also how incredibly boring it can be - I spend most of my time watching TV and movies (a lot of times the same things over and over again) but I just can't get the emotional or physical energy to go out. The only times I do go out is when I take my dog for walks, but even that I don't do as much as I should.

I feel like I have been depressed for so long now (almost ten years) that I'm almost afraid of getting better if that makes sense. I have a lot of irrational fears like I will finally get over my depression and then come down with a serious illness and it will all be for nothing.

I don't really speak with anyone, even family, about it."
329,"I have had enough of everything.My.life is one big lie and I have wasted the last 25 years.My head is a mess was at rock bottom upto and over Xmas.Couldnt function properly suicidal every day head spinning.Not eating or non stop eating.Stopped taking all my other meds for diabetes,arthritis, high blood pressure  etc etc.Birthday in a couple of days and am praying its my last.I long for the one person in the world I love to love me .I've not told them how I feel but they must know.They have told me they aren't interested in ever having a relationship again.Please just strike me down and take this torment that is life away."
330,"I am looking for some advice or support in how to deal with my girlfriend who has depression. I will try and explain what is going on. 

My girlfriend has suffered from mental health problems for a lot of her life and had previously been diagnosed with depression at one point. She told me that she had been in therapy when she was 14 (she's now 22) but never what for. She also mentioned she had self harmed but never how. Anyway, in the last week (or maybe longer as I fear she hid it from me for a while) she became very depressed. She would stay in bed most of the day, would barely eat, didn't shower, had no energy, showed no interest in me or anything etc. 

She said she was tired of being sad all the time so I encouraged her to seek help. She ended up calling 111 and was put in touch with a doctor who prescribed her Sertraline. At this point she was still in our shared university accommodation along with our other housemates. However, last Sunday we had a conversation and she told me she wanted to go home to focus on herself and fight her depression with help from her parents. She also said that our relationship would need to be put on 'pause' while she did this because it was the thing in her life that she could control at the moment. She also said she didn't feel the same about me as she once did. Obviously, I was heartbroken but I agreed this was the right choice. 

Now a few days later, I sent her a message to check in on her and she replied that she was resting and that she had spoken to her doctor once more and now has a therapy supporter as well which shows she is moving in the right direction. That is the situation so far. 

I guess I am looking for some advice and support. I have so many questions which of course she is in no shape to answer due to her situation. I am giving her all the space that she needs but will check in on her from time to time to let her know I'm here as a friend if she needs. I have also accepted that for now, our relationship is on hold which I think has been the hardest part to accept. However, I am encouraged that she is helping herself and that her parents are there for her. How can I help her at the moment from afar and is there hope for us in the future once she gets over this?"
331,"Does it ever ease up? It's like life just keeps throwing stuff at you trying to find your breaking point. Am I just crap at handling it? I deal with one thing and 2 others things pop up in its place. I spent years trying to plan my life, live carefully and do things properly, trying not to ""rock the boat"" just for it all to go tits up, now I'm trying to chill out more and try to enjoy being alive and I'm just in situations where I Immediately think- ""should have done this better, should have checked that more thoroughly"" because someone else's actions have caused me hassle. Its all still going so wrong. It seems like everyone else can live their lives not caring about consequences or how their actions affect others and I'm the one left picking up pieces and getting screwed over at every turn. I can't trust my judgements or my decisions, whatever I try is wrong. I've recently realised that im a naiive clueless idiot, thinking most people are decent when they're not. Do you really only get any where in life by lying and stepping on others? I don't know if my brain can handle always being on edge not being able to trust anything. I want to go live on an island with all the animals, they're so much better than people!"
332,"I was on citalopram for a few years but came off in 2018 as Dr felt I was no longer depressed. However, the depression returned and for some reason I can no longer tolerate the side effects of antidepressants, even when trying to push through those first few weeks. I’ve tried citalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine, fluoxetine and duloxetine. I’m also unable to tolerate diazepam and clonazapam. I find it hard to get the answer as to why I can’t tolerate these meds. Has anyone had a similar problem, know the answer and/or found an AD they can tolerate. Thank you"
333,"I don't even know why I am writing this.

Around 6 years ago (I was 22) I started having suicidal thoughts. I was stuck in a retail job I hated with nothing to show for except a small apartment I could barely pay rent for and a collection of books. I liked escaping into stories. They made me forget how shitty life can be. At some point I had enough and decided to just do it. I still had doubts so I told myself that I could postpone the day of the deed. I said ""You're going to take your life amyways, might aswell take a chance and try something new"". So I decided to do something I always wanted to do before.

I enrolled at the local university. Started studying CompSci. I took a student loan and quit my crappy job at the supermarket. It was nice being around actual people again. It took my mind off all the shit I usually thought about and it gave me a clear goal to work towards. I found tons of friends and forgot all about my depession. I felt like a whole new person. Those 4 years were the best of my entire life. After graduating with a BA in CompSci, I had a choice. Pursue a graduate degree or start working.

In hindsight, I really really should have started working. I stupidly decided to pursue a graduate degree. The first 6 months were great. Business as usual. I was on cloud nine.

Until Covid-19. University went into lockdown. All classes switched to online only. Suddenly I was stuck in my apartment again with nothing but my own thoughts keeping me company. I started attending less and less classes and spend my days huddled in my bed. Weeks went by and less turned to nothing. A few months later I stopped anything course related entirely. I felt stuck.

The only thing that gave me joy during those days? Open Source contributions. Those are basically free software projects anyone can work on. I started helping by implementing new features or fixing bugs. It felt great contributing to something and getting positive feedback from people. My graduate degree feels unatainable though. I don't want to spend another year or possibly two, wasting more valuable time than I already have. I want to apply and start working but who wants someone like me working for them?

I am 28 years old and still have nothing to show for. Friends and relatives are marrying, getting children, buying houses. It feels like everyone has got life figured out but me. Everything seems so hard and I notice that those old thoughts are slowly creeping back in. 

I don't know why I can't be like anyone else. I wish I was normal."
334,"Hi, new here. So, 2020 was a crap year for most everyone. In my case it wasn't even covid that ruined the year, it was losing a sister to cancer, another sister to politics, going through grief with almost no friends at hand due to lockdown, and I was in a relationship that pretty much sucked, I did most of the giving, he did most of the taking. And to top it off, receiving a diagnosis for BRCA2 mutation, like Angelina Jolie, I have to take some bits off my body to prevent cancer.

To make a very long story short, at the beginning of December I found out SO cheated on me, told me he was building a new relationship with this woman but that didn't take away my place (he wanted us both) and the family member who introduced me to this jerk was on his side, tried to gaslight me into thinking this is a good thing for me, new chick wanted to be involved in my recovery from surgery and they practically did this for me. The insane arguments have been going on and on, and it has been a confussing territory, trying to see if things could work out, then feeling humilliated and not enough, etc.

Recently some information came to light, basically they both have a pattern of similar behaviour, cheating, lying, gaslighting and then trashing the person online when things don't work their way. I can see now that they are both scum. I want them out of my life. He stopped talking to me about 10 days ago. She says he loves me but he can't talk to me because I blocked him. I should have. More lying and more shifting the blame at me.

I can now see the BS, the lies, the convenience to them, how much they sucked out of me (time, money, energy) and how little I received from them, to the point of them betraying me just before my surgery. No empathy, no trying to make ammends, not even an apology from her, nothing but blaming me for the disaster. I now see how miserable they are and how lucky I am to get rid of them.

My question is, if I can now see them for the tiny, pathetic, mediocre pieces of crap they are, why are they still occupying such a big place in my heart and so much time in my head? I am meditating, redoing my room, trying to keep busy. I have a full time job and home school to deal with. I am reaching out to old friends, watching TV, reading, meditating, going to therapy, but they are still there all the friggin' time. How long does it normally take? What else can I do to get them out of my head?"
335,valentine’s day is coming up (shooting anniversary) and i’m so scared and so sad so sad i don’t want my friends to die and i keep seeing the faces of the dead and hearing them and it’s so clear in my mind and i hate it it’s too much pain for everyone. i don’t think i can take it it hurts too much. i feel like someone’s going to get the people i love. the people in my area are not as hurt as i am and i don’t understand why. i know people are going to kill themselves that were inside the school when it happened and it hurts to see more each year it hurts so so bad i’m so sad they were so loved and i know the shooter wanted us to see valentine’s day stuff and panic and be sad but i can’t help panicking and being sad. i can’t even say parkland out loud i physically can’t i’ve tried over the years in therapy and stuff. god i don’t think everyone’s gonna be ok and i’m scared and i don’t know i don’t know i can see all the kids i can’t do this it hurts to bad i can’t do it. the trauma is too much the gore and the hatred in this world is too much. and last year was hard enough and i had a gf and my best friends weren’t off doing molly. i have so much to worry about and i’m sure someone can relate i hope someone can help us
336,"Hi I'm really struggling I'm at work and Iv been told that my hairline is receding, Im alright scared about my future, I'm short ugly and skinny, struggle to eat and now I've been told that I'm gonna go bald, Im worried that I'll never get my dream job, 25 never had a girlfriend literally no friends, I don't know what to do I beyond depression right and now and getting suicidal thought. I just wish I looked better and wasn't so ugly, helllpppp"
337,"I can remember how it happened. I was in my late 20s, in the late 90s, staying at my parents' in the spare room. I had recently been in a relationship that ended badly for me. That was the trigger, that was the knock at the door. It happened at night. I awoke, late at night, with this complete change. From not having a clue about depression, to understanding it fully - as I was overwhelmed by this illness in an instant. I went in to pure panic mode, I remember thinking this must be what it's like to experience a bad drug trip, but for ever. On that night I had completely changed. My old me was gone, my old life was gone. For ever. I was terrified, every minute felt like an hour. I wanted time to pass quickly so that I could speak to my parents, but it was far to early. I couldn't get back to sleep. Horrible thoughts raced through my mind, it was horrific. All it took was a push in to the pure hell of depression, and there's no way back. This was to be my new life. 
Over 20yrs later that horrendous moment I had that night is as clear as day.

What are others' experiences of first encountering that dark cloud?"
338,"I have been struggling with my depression so much. I can go through my day focusing on minor distractions and my many blessings to put on a smile. But in all reality, I am so sad it physically hurts. I can't put any reasoning or understanding as to why I am going through the many heartaches and tragedies that I have in my life. I know I can't give up because the man who saved my life, who I am about to talk about, deserves more respect than that.. Recently my boyfriend passed away, he was good friends with my dad for many years and also friends with my brother. We had just started seeing each other so it was super fresh and we were getting to know each other, despite those facts I felt like I had known him forever. Being as amazing of a person as he was, I still can't make any sense of it. Especially because he was literally nursing me back to reality and health after suicide ideation and two unsuccessful attempts of mine. I feel like I should have been the one to die. I should be the one in the grave. But I know how vain and ""poor me"" that sounds. I had been doing well with keeping my mindset on whatever I could do to make SURE his death was not in vain. I still have those desires and want to follow through with it. I love and respect that man so much. He changed my life. I am grateful and I am heart-broken. I know if he had a say he would be here with me and that is all that matters in the end. I just wish I could see him again.

My reason for this post is to vent a little. Let me say first I absolutely love and adore my family, each and every one of them. I have always been more apt to not talk about any struggles regarding any of them because I am very protective of our relationships. I never want to hurt them or gossip about them. But this is an anonymous page so I think of it as a safe space to speak without anyone knowing who I am.... I am grateful for a site like this. 

I guess I just keep having paranoia and confusion around what others intentions are for me. I know I am an adult and I am in control of my own life... But I have always given so much thought and worry to what my parents want me to do. This was particularly hard because I am an addict and have struggled most my life with fighting this disease. This desire to be accepted by my parents is and always has caused me to have incredibly low self-esteem. Mind you, my parents have always been there for me the best they could and have always shown love. I am not naive to the fact that I am a hard person to love, let alone be my parent? It has to be tough. 

I often feel like they are ashamed of me... I was unable to go to the funeral of my boyfriend that I mentioned earlier because I was in a short-term psych ward to get on medication and get stable. I had been okay'd by the doctors to leave on a Friday, which would have allowed me to go to the funeral the next day... I talked to my mom on the phone about it and they had come to the conclusion that it would be too hard for me and I should just wait until Monday to be released. I do know that I am 26 years old and I could have just checked myself out and gone. But with all the family ties and everything I did not want to cause any problems and I wanted to show the utmost respect to my boyfriend and his family. So I stayed until Monday. Which has been super hard for me because I feel like the reason they didn't want me to go was because they were embarrassed in some way? Which I don't know for a fact but its what I feel.

There are just some things where they are very concerned about my younger sister and they don't want her to move out. (neither do I) she is in an abusive relationship and she wont leave her boyfriend. But I guess my point of that is they let them both live here while this dude literally is a total jack-ass, has ZERO respect for my parents let alone anyone else in the house. My sister works and is responsible and all around good person, so nothing I say here has to do with her against me... Its just if that was me, they wouldn't allow it. I haven't been able to live at their house in years and even when I was struggling so hard and just wanted to come home they wouldn't let me because they said it was too hard on the girls (my 3 younger sisters).. But the catch here is HER BOYFRIEND IS AN ALCOHOLIC/ADDICT TOO! So they wouldn't let me stay when it would have been short term and pretty much saved me from so much pain and heartache of being homeless because of my addiction. But they will let someone who isn't even part of our fucking family and has an addiction to live here continuously. It just seems like rules apply differently to different kids. On top of that when I was dating someone they told me that I couldn't have him staying the night, fine ok, but I am 26 and that just seems contradictory to other who can have their s/o LIVE HERE. Just doesn't make any sense to me. I do understand them being scared that if they kick him out she will go with and something bad might happen... But how come they weren't worried about me and all the bad shit that was happening to me when I didn't have anywhere else to go or I was stuck in a super abusive relationship... They literally just didn't see it first-hand so I guess its different to them. I have no idea. I just know there were many times that I wanted to leave him and just get on a plane, and my parents advice was to go to a womens and childrens shelter. Which was fucking horrible and the most depressing place to be ever. I still can't get the way that place made me feel out of my mind... 

I know I need to work through all of this with a therapist, I get that. I just needed to get this shit out because it starts coming out sideways at my family and I don't want that. At the end of the day they are my parents and I will love them regardless. It just feels like I am going to have to put some distance there and not let my mom have as much of an impression on me and the decisions I make. It goes back to wanting to be accepted and just doing whatever I could to make them happy but then at the end of the day I am just seen as this addict who is a total fuck up loser and I don't feel like they see that all I wanted was a place to call home all those years. (I lived in different facilities and starting at the age of 15 and moved out at 18) I know I probably am just being immature about all this but I do think others would feel the same. It would be one thing if my sibling wasn't an adult but we both are. It just makes me feel like I am pretty much expected to keep fending for myself out in this shitty world and that if anything bad or uncomfortable happens to any of my other siblings they will be right there to help them. I do think they helped me the best they could and I am so grateful for that. I truly am. But at the end of the day fuck this fucking loser that is disrespecting the shit out of my parents. I would never allow any dude to sit around and live off my parents not doing a fucking thing and outright disrespecting the home that is THEIR'S! 

Its just crazy to me... And the fact that they wont just sit him down and tell him what the fuck is up. It is because they say that it will just cause more problems for my sister and he will take it out on her... But honestly I hear the fights... Half the time it is her wanting to fight with him because she doesn't truly like him. she just thinks she does.. and I've been there. I have.. It's not an easy thing to fix and there isn't a set answer. But I swear I will end up punching this loser in his damn face.

I have faith she will figure it all out. She is amazing and worth so much more than this.

I must give her the same respect to let her make her own choices, as I did mine. I just want to badly to protect her and show her how beautiful learning to be alone really can be. Although, it took me years to figure it out and it still is a struggle for me as I am typing on this site right now and currently still on social media...

I guess family is just hard, and there are so many different emotions going on for me. I am still trying to get myself healthy and finally on medication for my depression again. So maybe most of the shit I just word-vomited was just me feeling certain ways because I am really depressed, grieving my boyfriend who just passed, and desperately working on staying clean and sober. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading!
Much Love,
Parker"
339,"Hey everyone I hope you're all well. So lately, I just feel like I'm at a cross roads of sort. I recently finished college and now I awaits Uni in September. And lately, I've just can't figure out what to do with my life in the meantime. I'm a foreigner and I don't really have any close friends here, so I have nobody to really hang out with and because of the lockdown, I can't go out and meet people, or do anythimg for that matter. I've been told to just go with the flow but really it's like I'm not moving at all... Im just plain bored and lonely and I just want my life to be more exciting than this... But the catch is that given the world's circumstances I am at a loss with solutions. Im not asking for advice, ofcourse it's welcomed I wouldn't say no to it but really I just want to vent... All this isolation has me trapped with my thoughts and it's just exhausting."
340,"I feel like I'm worse off now than I was back in 2017. Even though back then I was way more depressed and had a lot more suicidal thoughts I also interacted more with other people but now that's just way too high of a mental hurdle for me.

I was also way more active in trying to get help but now I'm basically just waiting for something from the outside to happen that'll significantly effect my current life or just straight up kill me because either or is way better than how I'm currently living my life."
341,My mother's funeral service was one year ago today on her birthday.  She was my best friend and we spent a lot of time together.  I struggle with expressing my feelings and so have decided to spend today alone.   I find it easier to cry when no one is around.  Does anyone else find this to be true for them?  Just once again wondering if there is something wrong with me.
342,"One thing life has taught me is that to have positivity in our lives we have to think positive, act positive, be positive and we then attract positivity. I know times can get hard and believe me when I say I know the worst of times but if we let our bad times define us we will always be down"
343,"All I want is a simple life but shit just keeps happening. Nothing ever goes the way I want it to, only bad things seem to happen. I don't ask for much, I don't want a lot of money or a big house. I don't even want perfect health or a lot of friends. All I want is to be happy and have no drama, is that really too much to ask for? I feel like everything has just gone to shit. No one cares about anyone anymore and I'm just here to suffer. It is like someone is playing huge joke on me, and they won't even kill me because then they can't laugh at me anymore. Sometimes I just want to scream, I don't no what I did to deserve so much pain and misery. I'm fed up of seeing people living their lives and being happy while I'm stuck, life is just so unfair."
344,Has anyone had luck with this? I have generalized anxiety with irritability
345,"I can't even describe how my day went, without let tears fall down my eyes. I look in the mirror all the time and I hate what I see. I despise it, I live with my mom and I don't know if you are supposed to love your parents or if there's something wrong with me but I despise her I cannot stand her, and I have no idea why. I don't really know if I'm depressed but I feel sad all the time and I cannot remember last time I was happy, majority of my time I spent alone because that's just how I was made I guess. What's wrong with me? Why can't I be happy? Why can't I change?
Why do I feel sad all the time? I still don't have an answer to this questions and it hurts."
346,"I literally see no positive outcomes in my future. My life and situation is utterly hopeless. I am terrified to end my life and leave my loved ones behind. But it’s just too much. The stress and torment I put up with daily. Life has always had a way of forcing me out of the things I love and away from people I love. People keep telling me it’ll get better. But time slows way down especially when it’s hard. At this rate it feels like I’ll be here in this hellish phase forever. 

I knew life would be hard. I always understood there would be challenges. But life has gone from hard to torment and relentless antagonism. Now my dreams are,  having a stable mind and a normal life. Forget running for a team, publishing one of my books, getting a career in art and perhaps a wife. No sir now it’s all about survival and simply minimizing pain. Because thats all I can do. 

Nobody can hear me. People hear about my depression and scoff and call me weak, or my problems ‘small.’ Or I’m just mellow dramatic. I can’t take it. I’m so sick and tired of EVERYTHING. My life is never going to be good or normal. I am at least 99% sure that I am going to some day take my life. This year, 2021 is when we officially hit the wall. I’ve put up with a lot and I sure hope that God or the great cosmic being understands. Life isn’t supposed to be this bad. When you’re in pain 99.5 percent of the time then how the fuck is that acceptable?

Plus things don’t really get ‘better’ for me. That’s just not how it works. Understandably it takes a lot of elbow grease but even then I attain maybe 1/4  results that anyone else would. So I just worked myself into the floor and got almost nothing. But if I make a small mistake I’m treated by the cosmos, like I committed an egregious  unforgivable sin. 

I am... unreachable. You hear those horrible stories of people getting trapped somewhere and nobody is able to save them, like the man who didn’t make it out of his burning house. Well mentally/emotionally this is of similar nature. The good people in life want to help me but I just think I’m a little too stuck. 

I guess it’s not within my realm of ability or cosmic allowance to be happy. I feel like a disease born against his will. If the universe didn’t want me to experience true long lasting happiness or prosperity of any kind why was I born? Because I see no purpose in being born and being forced to experience so many hardship and destruction. All I’ve gotten is much grief, loneliness, self hate due to societal indoctrination, and endless fear and anxiety. 

I have always believed that hardships and pain will make me a better person but the amount I have daily far surpasses anything useful. Nobody hears my inner screams. Nobody gets it. At this point my suffering isn’t teaching me anything. It’s just all vain."
347,"I've been on 20mg Citalopram for 17 years and have decided to try and come off it for various reasons - I reduced to 10mg and stayed on that dose for 3 months, then did 5mg for a month and 2.5mg for a month before stopping.  I took my last 2.5mg on Saturday.  I feel quite low, very weepy but I understand that's to be expected - these are powerful drugs that alter your brain chemistry and after 17 years it's going to take time for my brain to readjust. I just wonder if anyone has successfully managed to come off antidepressants after a long time and how long it took before you started feeling like your old self again?"
348,im in shock more than anything and cut my knee i cant stop crying
349,"What is wrong with me? Why am I like this? I'm so done with it. I can't do anything. I can't even bother myself to a ring a doctor because I know how anxiety-inducing it will be and I like to avoid my anxiety as much as I can, which has also led to me so far failing my first year of university (this is a whole other problem and I don't know if it's possible to even recover it after I've missed every assignment, tutorial, lecture - basically everything - since October). I try to put off doing things for as long as possible. Even personal hygiene. I used to have showers every day but now I just have them when I need them so that I don't have to go through it every day. I can't even read a book for more than 5 minutes without getting irritated or bored. I lose my focus easily. I'm never physically or mentally comfortable. I've lost most contact with my friends since we left school. At least back then I had people to talk to everyday and I got away from my depression for a while. The only thing was that I didn't ever go out with them outside of school because that gave me social anxiety. I felt more comfortable in school. We even had a formal in the final year of school and I did not attend this because the thought of it made me way too anxious. And I was one of the only people in the year (and the only person in my close group of friends) that did not attend the event. We also had a final year performance which I was planning on skipping but I was off for a few days for some other reason which I cannot remember.  Anyways, school for me ended ten months ago due to the lockdown. In ten months I've had barely any proper social contact. There was one time I was dragged out with another group of friends which I'm not as close with but still talked to a lot in school and after I drank for a bit I was socialising absolutely fine and I was pretty confident. It's just the anxiety and lack of confidence that makes me normally suck at/avoid socialising. There's lots of things I want to do but anxiety prevents me from doing. I wish this was not the case. And the depression makes everything difficult doing no matter what. Little things can set a depressive episode off because I'm a lot more sensitive to things like that now. Anyways what are my options with regards to all this?"
350,"Hi Guys,

I am from Bavaria so sorry for my english.
I am currently living in the separation phase after a long-term relationship (28 yrs) and have learned to love someone who also comes from a long-term relationship (23 yrs).
We have - the classic! - both of us very clinging to each other and thus whitewashed the pain of separation, that ""being alone"".

We both are aware this and try to reverse our mistakes, because we don't see ourselves as ""consoling partners"", we are already promising a future together.

In addition to the mentioned separations to be managed, we both had to face several life problems, which she - actually a power woman - always ""smiled away"" and worked through confidently.

In the last few weeks she has changed increasingly, everything started to turn faster somehow, she had more and more plans in less time, surrounded herself with more and more people, began to drink more alcohol than usual for her and so on.
She also behaved differently towards me, somehow not quite as loving anymore, more plus more demanding in bed.

She has been complaining for weeks that she cannot sleep through the night and that she has nightmares.

Then suddenly last week she was just a pile of misery, was just crying. She went to a psychologist and has now been taking light antidepressants since a few days, but of course they haven't worked yet. 

At first I didn't understand her ""coldness"" towards me, because she had always literally overwhelmed me with love, now there is ZERO emotion. 

We live in separate households 1 hour apart and last we met 3 days ago for 3 hours in a neutral place to walk and talk. I took her in my arms and patted her head, which she said felt very good for her. She also kissed me on the mouth.

She wants to limit personal contact at the moment, which affects me very much. She says she needs time for herself now, has to ""go through it all alone"" and it has nothing to do with me personally, I shouldn't doubt her love for me and if I really loved her, then I should give her peace and quietness for now and go through there with her together. 

I am currently seeking treatment myself for separation anxiety, so two things come together that don't go together at all - I am seeking to be loved which she can't give at the moment.

After I googled something about depression today, I'm beginning to understand her ""isolating herrself"" better, at least that it really isn't necessarely because of me or our relationship.

Can her emotional coldness be conclusively explained as an acute depressive episode / adaptive disorder / reactive depression?

She said she NEVER experienced something like this before, she is a positive person, always has been. 
As I said, many bad things happened this year, which was extremely stressful to her. Her narcistic husband also made her feel guilty and pained her psychologically. She says the whole year has come up in her now.

How can I behave towards her? 
Can I tell her how much I love her (such words are not coming from her side at the moment) or is that too much to handle for her?

I didn't get in touch for 2 days after the meeting, also no WhatsApp, NOTHING, when she called me via video telephony out of nothing. 
We talked for 1 hour and she said that she'll get in touch again next evening. 
She called me (no video) as promised and said that she did not feel like talking today. I said ""that's OK, let's try again tomorrow"".

She is extremely cold, very strange, has empty eyes, cannot smile, speaks factually and seriously. 
I'm not sure how to behave. I don't know how long this will take either, because it's already very hard for me to take. 

She has promised that we can meet at the weekend for a walk again. 
After staying with her 5 days a week and practically living in her house always from Friday afternoon until Monday morning in the last weeks this seems kind a unsatisfying for me.
We already had plans for me to move into the house at some point, to change my job and help finance the house (the house is newly built), how the terrace and carport should look like, etc.

Her 14-year-old son also likes me and accepts me as ""family"" - according to his own statement towards me!

This compulsory break is very hard for me, I am grateful for any tips regarding the possible duration of her depressive state, how I should behave and how our relationship could possibly continue.

I love her very much and want to get through it with her, but at the moment she is just so strange to me, it's so hard to handle.

Today she posted a quote on Facebook, saying ""When nothing is sure, everything is possible"", which I don't really understand what she wants to say."
351,"Anyone have any feelings like everything is empty? It's like looking all around you, and everything is just white.. it's  these past few days or weeks I've been looking at material things like houses, cars etc, and I think ""it's just material"", and I get a hopeless feeling. I used to enjoy the house, but i start breaking everything down in my thinking. I look at things before what they are now, and ita hard to enjoy anything.  Just seeing things as material, and not able to enjoy them...

It's been a rough few months, as I've been trying different meds. Its gonna be my 3rd week on sertraline, but haven't seen improvement..
Thanks"
352,"So I am wondering to what extent grandmother members on here are able to maintain
close relationships with grandchildren and their parents.  I am asking because for the
 past 4 years I have done a bit of childcare for one of my sons and his wife.  They live
10 miles away.  It has not been easy because much of the time I tire easily [legs get
heavy and painful} and of course my mood does not remain constant.  I have struggled
on with this because I love my family and I thought it was what families do?  Tonight a
friend has got me questioning if I am over involved in their life!  So I guess I am asking
is it unusual to stay close to family?"
353,"I find as a person with not so exciting of a life and being mentally ill that geekiness and nostalgia culture can be very addicting. I find myself constantly escaping in video games, philosophy or book novels. I am glad I see a friend once a week though. Really grateful since I had no life before which was super tough. I hate envy but their are people out there partying , socializing more, have more money to do more, have a bigger life than I do. I just feel really invisible. They are times where I wish I could just disappear out of thin air and go out of existence. At least I'll no longer be in pain and suffer like I am now."
354,"It's been months and I'm struggling. Every day I feel anxious and empty. I'm not getting enough sleep lately. When I do sleep it's a restless sleep. I've tried everything to help myself with hobbies, working, diet changes etc. I need help and it's hard to find a doctor. I still have voices when I fall asleep and that has me worried."
355,"Hey, first post here. 

I've been depressed for a long time. I got bullied for 6 years which resulted in this I suppose. Since then everything's just been sort of a blur. I don't really know who I am.

I struggle with my emotions, often having emotional outbursts over small things which I am unable to control, often shifting moods between happy and angry within mere seconds. This has been going on ever since I was a child and makes my whole family frustrated with me. Truth is, I don't know why it happens.

I feel invalidated in my family. Often times I am teased by my mother and sister, which is fine I suppose, but sometimes they cross the line with their jokes about how I am overly ""sensitive"" and ""sad"" all the time. Yet they have the audacity to say how I never tell them what's going on. 

It's also quite ironic. Last week, an 17 year old boy attempted suicide because of the stress of exams. I was deeply affected by this, and they were too. My sister in particular was sharing around mental health tips, and spreading the word about depression. I thought that since she is so open about it, I could finally tell her all the things going through my mind. That I needed help. So I did. And she told me there was nothing wrong with me, that I am just overreacting. I felt deeply hurt.

There's a voice at the back of my head telling me that I'm a crybaby, and other people my age are more efficient at doing things, at their studies, at being useful human beings.

I know I'm going to be okay, after all I've struggled with this almost all my life. I attempted suicide on New Year's but I woke up. And honestly I'm thankful for that. It's the only motivation I have to keep me going right now."
356,Can I volunteer to go into hospital? Has anyone got any experience of this? Or how I go about this. Im in a state of dispair. Just can't think. Thank you
357,"I have been married for almost a 10 years now, we have several kids together. I have been unhappy in this relationship for years. We have not had a real connection for about five years now. I tried to leave several times, I tried because I knew that's what I needed to do for myself. He wouldn't allow it, he didn't think that was the right choice. Not realizing what he was doing he pushed me deeper into depression. After months of fighting I finally gave up. I made up my mind to stay and to forget about my own happiness. It worked for awhile but then that feeling of needing to find happiness kept creeping up on me, I tried to ignore it. Recently my doctor decided to put me on anti depressents because I showed several signs of being depressed. The meds worked they shut off my feelings but that also shut off why I was willing to stay. I had horrible side effects from the meds though so I decided to get off them after only a few days. Then the feeling of needing to leave to find my own happiness came back but with a vengeance. I don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm trying to ignore it, to push it back, but it's eating at me. He keeps wanting to talk but I can't because if I bring any of this up we will just start fighting again and I have no fight left. I'm tired, this is draining any energy I have left. I know this is starting to effect my kids too I can see it, I can feel their pain. I just don't know how to make this better. I can't keep my head above water anymore. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I need someone to talk to but I know nobody will understand. What am I supposed to do???? I feel so alone in this world."
358,"First off, I would like to say I know a lot of you are Biden voters. I am not here to fight with you. Feel free to support Biden. I am opened minded. I am here to talk about my depression. I want to feel better. Feel normal again.

Here goes: I am a extremely intense political person. I watch Fox News like a religion, mostly Tucker Carlson. I hate the neocons on early on Fox. I even worked hard and campaigned for Trump to win. And he lost. I feel like I did that all for nothing. I feel like my work and effort is meaningless. I lost my political excitement. I want to have my political passion back. I stopped watching the News. I do not care anymore. Especially seeing how Biden is setting back America in terms of foreign policy. Pro-war president is back in the white house. Foreign policy is one of the main reasons I stood against Biden. And he is giving amnesty to 11 million illegal aliens. A slap in the face to all legal immigrants. Why be political in a dying nation? I know this sounds dumb, but I do not feel like myself. I want to feel normal again. I feel like punching myself for being like this. What do I do? How do I snap myself back into normal? I wish I can be like everyone and not care about politics and just be happy."
359,"Hello, I've been taking ranitidine for over a week with only a little relief the doctor wants me to take omeprazole. I've had a reaction to lansoprazole so I am hoping omeprazole is ok.

360,"I am severely depressed after going online dating / meeting someone who was a sweet talker/player. I was ghosted and this is driving me crazy. I wish I knew how to get over this very quickly. But for days I couldn’t stop thinking of it and lay in bed all day. I hate rejection and embarrassing myself. I embarrassed myself for believing the guy was really into me. I feel like a loser all
Of the time. Useless and unworthy."
361,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t have any friends, I don’t have a good relationship with my family, and the person who I’ve been dating for 4 years clearly doesn’t respect me or care for me. Lately I’ve just been having problems with him because he continues to do things he knows makes me feel bad, and he says he wants to change but he never does. He is quick to apologize but ends up doing that same things like lying or ignoring me again a day later which just shows he doesn’t care. Now he’s wanting to try a break where he can be alone and figure himself out so he can start respecting me, but shouldn’t he respect me if he loves and cares about me? He tells me he does care but he doesn’t act like it. He knows I’ve had problems for so long with depression and anxiety but he always tells me to just stop being sad or to just stop being insecure because it’s hard on him. I just feel so lost right now. I’ve done so many stupid scary things when I’ve felt down in the past. I don’t want to take a break with him because he makes me so unhappy but I can’t leave him. I hate myself for not being able to leave. I’m scared and just want the pain to go away. My family blames it on me and that it’s my fault I feel this way and that I’ve let him treat me this way for so long so they aren’t there for me. I don’t know how to feel better and gather up the strength to leave him. I’m scared of being alone and I know if I leave, he’ll just expect me to come running back like I always do when I try. He’s left me so many times to be with other people and it’s my fault for letting him back into my life. What do I do at this point? Am I just doomed?"

363,"Hello, I joined this forum back in December when I was at my lowest point. At a time when my belief that I would not get better was absolute. I am now some weeks into recovery and tentatively optimistic.

365,"Hi everyone, nice to meet you! I am new to the forum and hope that I have come to the right place. My question is more directed towards professionals (especially with pharmacological knowledge), but educated patients and others are also welcome to the discussion.

Short version:
How are SSRI's that are also 5ht2a antagonists working long term (For example trazodon/trittico) and is there a downregulation of 5ht2a receptors, just like in conventional SSRI?

Long version:
Normal SSRI's are increasing synaptic serotonin levels, therefore stimulating (5ht-) 1A as well as 2A receptors. Since people with depression tend to have a lot more 2A receptors than healthy individuals, one of the suspected ""healing"" mechanisms from the meds is to downregulate the 2A receptors due to overstimulation by the excess serotonin. So far so clear.

Now there are special SSRI's like Trazodone (Trittico) that not only increase serotonin levels but also block the 2A receptors. Logically - blocking the receptor has a similiar effect to downregulating them, so these antagonistic SSRIs work more directly. But whats unclear for me is: Isn't the blocking of the receptor ""protecting"" it from getting downregulated? In my understanding, if you increase stimulation of the 1A receptor and block the 2A receptor, you are only downregulating the 1A and not the 2A, since the latter one doesnt get overstimulated (or stimulated at all).

Now wouldn't that be counterproductive longterm? My educated guess would be that the bigger part of the antidepressive effects would vanish within days after getting off Trazodon since the blockage is lifted and the ratio from 1A to 2A is even worse than before treatment (1A being downregulated already, while 2A remained the same).

Even after extensive research I wasnt able to find clear evidence proving or falsifying my theory. Am I missing something? 

Maybe there just isnt a definitive answer yet, in that case I would be very curios to hear about your opinions on the matter and maybe your experiences in treating patiens with Trittico vs normal SSRI's and how the development is longterm."
366,"I've had depression for 3 years now, I'm on antidepressants higgest dose, but according to partner Im always having mood swings. I don't know what else I can do I've spoke to doctor, she uped my dose. Its hard i am stay at home mum to 2 boys. So very alone but I've always been like that since I was teenager."
367,"i feel like ive really lost myself. when i look back i can see that this lost has been gradually happening in the last year. the person i was in 2019 doesnt seem to exsist anymore. 
back then i was the friend who helped others through hard times, saw everything in a positive light and tried to understand depression to help others. now that im that person whos in need of help i dont feel like myself. 

a few months ago i wouldnt even have dared of committing suicide, even though my depression was already present for a very long time. now id do it if it werent for those around me. i wouldnt be able to do it and leave all those wonderful people behind in sorrow, so i keep hurting to see them happy.

i just stopped caring about everything else besides those people, which might not seem like a huge deal, but it is.
i dont really care if i dont get the best grades in school anymore, i dont care if i die alone or if i find my significant other, i dont care if my body has scares, which leads to me harming myself again and i dont care about my future in general.
all of those things were really important to me in the past. i was the top student of my school, i really wanted to find love and stopped self harm because i didnt want people to have assumptions. i had dreams and hopes about becoming a surgeon. now nothing of that is left, im just an empty shell.

if i dont distract myself with something i get depressed every single time and have breakdowns. i just feel overwhelmed all the time.

i really want to go, but i cant."
368,"Hi,

I was already struggling since december with bad old memories. And things accumulate and become worse due to to recent events.
When I was in highschool, 9 years ago, I lost a friend by suicide.
I was myself self harming and tried once to do that too.

Now I have a job, but I have been triggered by a colleague who showed me a recent mark of sh, in March.
Then in december, I felt bad due to the ""death anniversary"" of the suicide of my friend. And at the same moment, my neighbor, on the same floor as me in the building, did an attempt and was rescued by the emergencies.
Some days after I learned that a colleague had her niece who did an attempt. And I helped her morally.

And now, my own brother (16 years old) told me that he was thinking about death and was self harming since the last week of december.
So I try to help him as I can, but I don t live near the home. He called me every evening to talk. I do what I can and I talk to our aunt to provide him some help (because my parents are a source of problems).

I m so overwhelmed by all that. I m scarred that I can t save my brother like I couldn t save my friend years ago.
Or scarred because I know how it is to feel so alone and self harming in this house and I don t want him to do like me before.

So much pressure, I just want to self harm too. I m so lost..."
369,"Hello all, hope you are well. I’ve been on sertraline 100mg for nearly 6 months now and although it’s taken away the really low feelings, it’s left me feeling nothing. Where as before I felt suicidal and SH’med a lot, now I feel nothing. Even showering and washing is an effort and I have no motivation for anything. I don’t even feel like SH’ing. There’s nothing there. At least before SH gave me a relief, now there’s just nothing. I am just existing like a shell. I don’t know who I am and what I feel. I drink to let myself be honest with how I feel. I don’t want to make my next birthday. Sorry all x please stay safe"
370,"Hi all, I recently posted about losing my boyfriend who was sleeping next to me. I am still struggling so much with guilt and just wishing I could go back and stay awake that night. It's so hard. I have been thinking about trying to contact him through a psychic but my boyfriend was very religious and a man of God. Not to say that psychics are not Christian or anything.. I am just curious about it. Do you guys think its something I should do or would that be disrespectful to my boyfriend and is it better left alone? I just have questions and I want to feel him again or hear something from him. I am back and forth and I know I am still grieving so there isn't anything that will make me feel better. Anyways, what do you guys think? 
Much Love...Parker."
371,"This is going to be long so I am apologizing ahead of time:
My mom and I, my whole family really, never truly got along. I always fought with my sibling, yelled and bickered with my headstrong mom, who made an almost exact replica of a daughter(AKA me), and felt like my dad never understood and his overly kind demeanor was an act. My sibling left me a long time ago. We fought so much: things would be thrown, mental illnesses developed, for both of us, and we never spoke unless it turned into an argument where the ""last word"" took 20 minutes to say because we fought over who could say it. They left to college at 16, an even more complicated story than this, and I thought that would make us closer, the space bringing some much needed alone time and clarity. Then they never spoke to me again, their reason being that I raped them, which never happened. They have BPD so I understand that their reality can be changed by trauma and I guess their brain pinned that on me since I was always the person they fought with regularly. Then we never spoke again, not because of a choice I made, but because they didn't feel safe, which is 100% understandable. It just sucks that I didn't do anything but still had to lose someone I always looked up to and loved. Whom I still love and would do ANYTHING for. Anyway, then came my parents. We got into a fight over xmas and I left, assuming it would be temporary and I asked for an apology before I returned home. Although they did issue an apology, it was several weeks later and everything was too far gone by then. I now live in an apartment that they pay for because they decided I couldn't come home until we resolved the unrest in the house, which you would assume they meant from them since that's what started all this, but no. They blamed it on me, so now even though the xmas fight is resolved mostly, I can't come home because they thought it was the perfect time to blame everything on me and say they need ""peace"" from me. Now I'm sad, alone, in an apartment I don't feel comfortable in or know anyone I room with. I have no family left and every time I think I'm at rock bottom, it gets worse. And all my friends don't understand. They loved my sibling, who hasn't been around or spoken to me or anyone else for over 3 years. They love my parents, too. They are kind, I will admit, and since they wanted me out of the house so bad and they gave me this apartment, my friends think it's a blessing. A joy. When in reality it is an out for my parents so they don't have to do just that, parent. I'm totally alone on another front with 2 friends and no significant other, either. And the friends I do have think I complain too much since "" wow you have an apartment how cool!"". I understand their excitement but if they just listened they'd realize this isn't a blessing, but a punishment. It is hard to understand because I see all the benefits and joys too. But what they don't see is that I'm alone. No family left. They all disowned me. No maid of honor, father, or mother of the bride anymore at my wedding(imaginary bc I'm alone lol). How does no one understand that I'm dying from the suffocation of my depression right now? where do I go from here? I have nothing but some lousy apartment that everyone thinks is the best thing since sliced bread! I get it, I do. But how do they not get it? That I'm dying here. I'm so alone and no one gets it. In fact, a friend accused me of being selfish and complaining like she just suddenly FORGOT I got disowned, kicked out, and left alone within 2 weeks. When I say alone, I mean it. But NO ONE gets it. Does anyone get it here? please just tell me you see my point of view because everyone is putting me down for being upset for something I think I should be upset by...I understand the positives so please don't bring it up again because trust me, everyone has told me them a thousand times and I realize I'm lucky. I do. Thanks, Sarah (F) 18 year old high school senior:/"
372,"I honestly don't know why I even use the internet to get help. It's all I got, and I do it to distract from my feelings, but it's pointless. And, the truth is people online are so often unhelpful, and uncaring, and judgmental. I've tried a lot to find someone to talk to, but I waste my time with idiots. The truth is a lot of people are idiots, and no one cares about your mental health. And I don't care how that sounds anymore. 

I've had major life issues, and a major issue that has made the past months hard. I don't want to say here, because if I do say it it's better for me to explain one on one. And I really cannot find a single mental solution for these fucking issues. And you think people online will help me, or anyone in my family? No. And it's incredibly stupid and annoying to hear over and over that that's not true. But there's also so many other clichés and idiotic things people will say endlessly no matter how unhelpful. 

I really want to die, and I'm hoping I find a way to soon. No it doesn't get better. 6 years later and I feel genuinely worse. And I'm also tired of stupid fucks that don't understand the issues I have."
373,"i have good news! even though i am tired as fuck because i havent been able to sleep at all lately, it seems as if my depression cloud has passed for now. its sunny and peaceful in my head and i feel like myself again. i think its really important to keep track of these good times and recognise them because theyre gone really fast sometimes. you have to be grateful sometimes, right?

this following bit is just me ranting and being proud of myself so you dont have to continue reading on if youre not interested

basically i had very early online lessons today, german and english, which both went very well as i participated very actively in both of them :) even tho i just wanted to go to sleep afterwards i had a discord call with my best friends, which later on turned into a group call with some other friends. we just chilled, talked and bathed in old memories. 
also i was very outgoing today: i talked to some new people who texted me & some that i contacted.
i even wrote an email to my elementary school to ask for the email of my old teacher bc i always wanted to reconnect with her 

im gonna work on some homework now and later on im gonna play some video games with a few friends which im very excited for!


i havent been this enthusiastic in a while so im trying to suck up all of these emotions and not just take them for granted. you never know how long these good moments last, so relish them :))
thank u all for all the support btw, im sorry if im not that active its just really hard for me to be active ngl.

i love yall, take care of yourselves <3

374,"I am really hesitant to post this, because I definitely do not want to be insensitive or inadvertently step on anyone's toes, but I am hoping to gain some clarity about a situation I am in.

My gf and I (both 30) have been together for 2.5 years, about 5 months ago it became long distance. She's usually super up-beat, but I noticed a decline in her behavior pretty much as soon as she moved away. She began telling me things are really difficult: She had went to stay with her family temporarily where a lot of childhood trauma had happened, work wasn't going as planned, and she didn't see the point of living just to struggle. I told her to call me whenever she needed, not ok to hold all of that in. So that's what she would do, she would call me and cry. I had never known her to fall apart like this, I've never really seen her cry before, I was glad she was confiding in me and felt bonded to her. But as quickly as the tears came, she would pick herself up and tell me she was ok, but in the back of my mind I wondered. We kept in contact pretty routinely.

However, around February I noticed her withdrawing from me even. I asked her about it, ""Hey I feel like you don't care or want to see me anymore?"" She told me she's just struggling and said her life was falling apart, family drama, etc. and it had nothing to do with me, she said she wasn't handling any of it well, she apologized for her inability to reach out. She said she missed me and so we planned for me to fly down and see her in March. It got cancelled due to Covid19. Communication between us became more and more splotchy.

I was thinking about everything, and I that the content of our conversations these days was always her venting about her crappy family, crying, and talking about nonexistence. Whereas the woman I know is happy, upbeat, funny, and always laughing. I finally said enough is enough, I need to be there with you. Asked if she wanted to get a place together, she said absolutely. The talk was that we would do that in about 2 months. However, about 3 days later out of the blue, I woke up to her sending me a video of an apartment she found, and she told me she would apply for it. She seemed really happy. However, I found this really odd, because I thought we had planned to move into together. I know her enough to know that something awful must have happened at home, that caused her to find something so quickly, without any regard or thought of me. So I let it be. This was a week ago, and I haven't heard much from her since.

I spent some time feeling like crap, like she left me in the dust as I planned to move there. But I was able to pick myself up and put my feelings aside. I texted her about 5 days ago and asked if everything was alright. I basically said, ""Hey listen I think we had a misunderstanding, I don't want any grudges between us, is everything ok between us? Here if you need me."" She said we are fine, she mentioned nothing about our plans together, but told me she just shut down, she's over everything, has no patience, doesn't see the point of living, and month of May looks bad, she feels like ""harming herself, that's how over everything I am."" I do not know her to be suicidal, so it's raising some alarms.

I am really trying to understand what I can do to be there for her without making it about me, but I am not sure where the line really is drawn.  I feel like I need to be there to cook for her, shower her, hold her etc. but maybe that's selfish of me?  I asked her if the thought of me moving there to be with her makes her happy at all, she said ""yes, it's like a dream.""  I am not sure what that means.   

Of course, in trying to understand her new mind frame, I am battling my own thoughts of (imagined?) abandonment and falling out of love due to the extreme change in her behavior towards me.  I find myself to struggle a lot with her absence: no goodmorning text waiting for me when I wake up, this was a ritual for us, no texting throughout the day, no phone calls, and of course feeling like she has moved on by getting a place without me. I can't help but wonder if she's moved on.  It's tough, but it feels so wrong -- like my girl is hurting and I may be throwing my own pity party, but it's difficult for me to *truly* understand all of this.

I checked in with her 2 days ago, I sent a text, ""Hi, just checking in on you, I know you're struggling right now, please know i am here, good and bad times."" and told her that I loved her. No response, she just ""hearted"" the post.

Does this indeed sound typical of depression? Is she suicidal? What am I supposed to do to help her. How can I be there for her? Have any of you been on the giving or receiving end of what seems to be a partner who suddenly stopped loving you.. how do you not take it personally so you can be there for them when they need you most?"
375,So last week I had a Telehealth Appt with My APRN and She prescribed Me some medicine called Gabipintin She says it wil help with My anger issues. Is this Medicine safe to use?

377,"Hello. I have posted on here in the past, but I'll give a quick description of what's happened in the past and why I'm feeling how I do.
So last year (late July) my wife left me and also took our two young daughters. She moved into her parents and for absolutely no reason stopped me seeing the girls. It was getting evident that her stance in me not seeing them wouldn't change so i instructed a solicitor to help me gain access through the courts etc. After a while she would allow me to see them, but only if it was round her mum's with her or her mum supervising (again, no reason for this). 
A couple of months later, my wife met a new man and they rented a new home within a couple of weeks of meeting. For about three months, while they were ""getting the new place ready"" up until a week before Christmas, the girls remained at their grandmother's while my wife and her partner lived in the new place. As the weeks went on, her mum started struggling to cope with the girls and eventually let me have the girls over the weekend etc. Ever since the girls moved in with their mum, I've been having them every weekend, which has been lovely. Yesterday was the court case (over the phone!), and unfortunately because I and my ex (she is still technically my wife) are so far apart in what outcome we are after, it has to go to a second hearing. Unfortunately I am currently suffering with covid, so haven't seen the girls for two weeks which has been hell. The courts gave an interim decision that I have them every weekend between now and the second hearing. 
The trouble is, despite my ex treating me over the last few months like a piece of **** (she even tried telling the court that I'm a violent alcoholic, despite the fact I'd not hurt a fly and the last drink I had was one beer on Christmas day!) aswell as her new man threatening me with violence on a few occasions, I'm still really jealous and hung up over her being happy with someone new. It's obviously valentine's Day soon, and thinking of them two together while I'm in my flat all alone, lonely and totally fed up. I just want the happy, loving life where I have a partner who had a mutual love with me and my two beautiful daughters to spend more time with me, but it just all seems to be going wrong. I can't see myself ever having that happy family life with anyone again, and she has found it within weeks of leaving me. Our marriage was far from perfect. I slept on the sofa for the last 18 months (we were only together for 6 years) we were always bickering and arguing etc and I was deeply unhappy, but I never stopped loving her, so when she left, it hurt so much. I just don't know how or if I'll ever snap out of this, considering I've got to keep in contact with her and always see her and him together all loved up, i hate it!"
378,"don't worry cori fans.... no spoilers

I am just reminded  of how little I have lately because of peter barlow's story in cori

I know  it's easy to say well don't watch cori then if it upsets you, but I have never missed an episode since I've been watching it so don't think that's easy for me to just skip it."

380,"Hi all, first time doing anything like this and I want to ask a million things.
Got pnd after my last child and 4 years later struggling more than ever, iv had everything that my gp has had or wanted to offer and its mainly involved antidepressants that has of course helped with one thing  then.......just swapped it for somthing else like no sex drive ever again,daily headaches, restless leg every night to point you want to jump out the window anyway. And then I'm still ment to be able to function and look after 2 kids ??? How how do I do that!! Sorry this is becoming not so short or sweet. I came off sertraline 6 months ago and ever since have tried a massive health overhaul taking a herbal treatment route but 6 months down the line I am worse and the idea of going back on some antidepressant scares the hell out of me because I'm just swapping a clearer calmer head for pain and insomnia and the break down of my relationship. My poor partner Seeing that I am a little bit brighter and dare I say happier when I am on somthing but then still not being able to be intimate..... after years of this I am done I cant see a way out of this and is this what my life is going to be like ? Because I cant do it i cant keep going round on this bloody roulette wheel. my family are suffering because of me!! Like what the hell.
I don't no how you can answer any of that but maybe I just need to say it."
381,"Evening everyone,

I've just joined and hoped you might be able to give me some ideas about anti depressants.
I’ve been down on and off since 2016 when my partner left me for another woman, it was really just the tip of the ice burg as my life has been full of trauma and abuse,  but it was the last straw sent me spiralling, I’m sure you all know that feeling.

I’ve avoided taking pills, the doc sent me to a therapist in 2017 (she was awful!)

So, I found my own therapist who’s brilliant but since pausing my business last year (Covid) I could no longer afford her.

My partner is currently very ill in hospital, he’s been in a life threatening condition with several scares but looks like he’s on the mend. He may well be out in the next couple of weeks but is likely to be bed bound and will rely heavily on me.
My daughter self harms and is currently doing her GCSE’s

I’m finding increasingly  that I can’t cope with the stress of my partner, both being ill and coming out and the caring responsibility I’ll have, whilst having to look for work and trying not to stress my daughter out to the point of self-harming herself, too hard to cope with. Every night  I’m having nightmares and waking up in panic attacks in a state of pure dread - horrible!

I spoke to the doctor. 
They prescribed mirtazapine. I was reluctant to take them and asked the doctor what to expect she said ‘nothing much but in a couple of weeks you might start to feel a bit better’

 I took the first one last night and woke up this morning like I’d been hit by a train. Unable to co-ordinate my movements, weakness in my arms and jaw - I couldn’t even close my mouth without effort. I’ve smashed plates abd the entire contents of the fridge fell out on me, clumsy I guess and absolutely knackered!!!

I just had to go back to bed and try and sleep it off, when I started coming round I felt an overwhelming sense of hopelessness, I can’t function let alone like this!

What can I do?! and only now at almost 8pm do I feel any kind of ‘normal’ and am vowing never to take a pill again!

I’m hoping you might be able to convince me otherwise as I just don’t know if I can trust the doctors now!"
382,"I was involved with a man for a few months and for a while it seemed we would have a long term relationship. He talked about his depression. I've written posts on here this week in regards to how he is making me feel. He's 6 months into alcohol recovery after a suicide attempt. 

The months we had our thing was very up and down. He lost days to sleeping. But there were weeks he was so down he couldn't even think about sex or romance. Those weeks were hard as he also was quiet in general. It was hard not to worry he wouldn't come back to me. I started to naturally feel a pain, always feeling abit unsure on how to deal with him. 

Since Christmas he's been worse than ever. Problems from pain medications and low moods. It's created alot of anxiety in me. All week I was thinking I need to walk away. I can't keep doing this. 

Yesterday I made the decision to speak with him. I barely made it through one sentence and he snapped at me. He claimed I was always doubting him and creating scenarios. Then he swore at me. Said he was done. Hung up. Refused to speak to me. Sent me some unkind messages. Said he lost respect for me and wouldn't be messaging me again. 

I was shocked at how harsh he was. He has spent money on me on lovely presents the last two weeks. He promised me a wonderful life with him and said he would always be there and I needed to always talk to him. 

I got through last night and I've been teary all morning today. I have no intention of starting it up again but I sent this 

Your reactions yesterday were unfair. I want you to realise I did care and love you and you saying you meant nothing was cruel. You did and today is so hard knowing we are finished. Xx

He replied. 

I don't know what to say. 

I replied. as you go forward remember what I've just said. I cared alot and I won't get over things overnight, it's going to be hard. X

He replied 2 hours later 

Same for me. 

I said I feel like I've lost my best friend. X

He replied 3 hours later 

I don't feel great myself. 

I replied
I've been sad all day and feel so lost. But it does nobody any good to be upset and mad. So I hope we can be friends in the future. Xx

He put a thumbs up. 

I asked if he felt he would want to be friends or if he would prefer me to cut all contact now. X

He said. I just don't want any silly messages

I said there's not going to be silly messages, but just us being able to be mature going forward and not makes enemies out of eachother. Xx

He put I'm not your enemy. 

I put I'm sorry I have contacted you today but the way we left it yesterday was horrible for both of us. It feels like you have gone from loving me to not liking me anymore at all. X

He put 

I don't know what to say. I'm feeling useless. Guess just have to get on. 

I said why useless? X

He said because I thought I was ready to meet someone and I clearly wasn't. 

I sent him a final message and said all his good qualities. Told him to be happy always and to find someone else when he's ready. I told him I understand why we didn't work and encouraged him to feel positive going forward xx

He replied 2 hours later and just wrote sorry I fell asleep. Going to bed now. 

I sent these messages because I want us to move forward without the horrible silence after cruel words. To check he's ok because he attempted suicide last year. Also I don't want to go through life being nasty. 

But his replies. I can't tell if he's being blunt and short because he really wishes id go away. Or whether he's sunk to a bad place and is suffering. 

How do his messages seem? Should I contact a friend of his to keep an eye? 

Sorry for the long post."
383,I never was welcomed here. How do I leave this group?
384,"My Psychiatrist setup Spravato treatment for me. My oral antidepressants I have been on for 4 years are not working. I have been in therapy for the last 4 years.  I have physical signs of depression which are not showering, not cleaning my house and failure to engage with people. 

Please let me know what you think  Love Jules"
385,"I realized today the difference between wants and beliefs. Up until today, they were inextricable. I started to see that I was afraid to not believe because I thought that meant I could never be happy. In other words, my happiness was dependent on my belief.

Everybody is always telling you to believe. But what if I don't? Is my life over? Will nothing good ever happen to me again?"

Can't even remember if I even had fun in my life. Now they are forcing me to take the PHD course which I don't want to take for a lot of reasons.

391,"Are any others here in severe depression and isolation because of this latest lockdown?It has only been about 20 days and I am so struggling to cope.I need human contact and face to face communication.I am so lonely and isolated.I used to spend a long time in the cafes,coffee shops and pub.I went to see films got chatting to shop keepers.I don't see anyone now I am stuck at home and it's tough I am severely suicidally depressed now.I am not going to survive if this goes on until September or even July.

I emailed samaritans for support and sent a message to my Dr asking for counselling from the surgery.They will probably want to refer me to mental health team but I told them no to that cos they only offer drugs and have been abusive to me in the past.I also wrote to my MP explaining my condition and situation and asking him to tell ministers how badly this is affecting people with MH issues.I asked him to reflect we need them to lift restrictions and go back to tier 3 at least.I won't hold my breath I don't think they care to be honest but if people let them know at least that its so hard they might do something.I don't know if I am writing to my MP that shows I am desperate.

Any words of reassurance and comfort from any one else here who is concerned about isolation due to lockdown very welcome.If you can share tips how to deal with the depression and get through lockdown that would be good,thanks!"
392,"Hi, been off Venlafaxine since last March and am still experiencing ""brain zaps"" clicking, swooshing and sometimes an almost physical jolt. I am finding things very difficult at the moment as are so many with all the restrictions. A close member of my family passed away two days before Christmas (Covid related) and she was the only person who had time to listen and try to understand. I had started to open up about the abuse I suffered in psych hospital and now she has gone. It was such a difficult funeral given all the restrictions.

I feel I need medication but don't want it. I wake every morning with a feeling of fear and dread and not too sure why plus overwhelming sadness. OCD has increased to an upsetting level. I try to keep busy all day including walking. I am at a loss

394,"I wouldn't want to do a self-diagnosis as I have never tried seeing a shrink because I just can't get myself to do it and I am afraid and I don't see it helping but they way I see it is that I have depression, anxiety (especially social anxiety) and ADHD. But I only want to talk about my depression here.

I hate life. Not MY life. Just simply life. I have zero motivation for anything and nothing interests me. I don't want to do nothing. I am currently a senior in high school. (I'm from Europe though, despite the wording, if that even matters.) I feel like I have always been like this even when I was younger. Even as a child I was always told by everyone that I am so ungrateful and that I cannot appreciate anything in life and nothing makes me happy. Of course there were better times too but these thoughts have never left me. They have always been there even in good times. I have a really good life. Loving parents, great family, friends and I have been in a relationship for almost 2 years and it's such a good relationship I couldn't even imagine anything that would make it better. My parents are not rich by any means but we live a very comfortable middle class life. I have everything I could wish for. I wouldn't want to come off as cocky but I would consider myself very good-looking, tall etc. too and also quite smart and intelligent. I have also been playing basketball for about 10 years now and I would consider myself really good at it. Objectively, I couldn't wish for more. But despite this, and despite knowing deep down how great things I could be capable of, I have self-esteem problems. I hate myself, I have zero confidence, even in basketball. Even knowing that I am a good player (I was averaging over 30 points a game last year.), I don't trust myself and hate myself on the court. There isn't a day I don't think about how good it would be to die. But I could never ever get myself to kill myself because I am afraid of any physical pain and because of my family and my loved ones, so suicide isn't a worry. But at the same time, I just look forward to the day I finally grow old and get this burden called life off of my shoulders. I have some physical symptoms too. I am tired the whole day and have zero energy but at the same time I find it very hard to fall asleep. It takes me hours sometimes but I almost never fall asleep under an hour - hour and a half. Sometimes I can't even sleep and I just go to school without any sleep. I have appetite problems and sometimes go a whole day without eating anything other than having like a glass or two of water the whole day. But even when I do manage to eat and drink normally, I am constantly slightly nauseous during the day and very nauseous every single morning. I am also very irritable and angry most days, with some exceptions. I try not to take it out on anyone but sometimes it happens and I always feel so bad afterwards. I always try to be as nice and polite as I can to everyone. I try not to show any of my symptoms to anyone as I don't want people to care about me and I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me. The only person that knows about any of this is my girlfriend.

I just don't know how to proceed at this point. I wish I didn't have anyone that loves me or anyone to whom I am important so I could just pursue ways of ending my life with the least amount of physical pain possible. I just want it all to end."
395,"Hi

Has anyone been feeling hopeless?
Like I have been feeling like things are just going to get worse. 
Every attempt to make things better is pointless and just going to make things worse.
Everyone has too high expectations of me.
I'm not good enough.

I'm really struggling to find any motivation in life, because of the above reasons.... and don't really know what to do..."
396,"Hi I'm Deano 51 year old male and I have suffered with severe depression and anxiety issues since early 90's, I can go short periods when things are OK in my life but mostly just can't get sorted out, no GP's really give you more than a few mins and always prescribe antidepressants before anything else..

I been on far too many to remember all the names but last prescribed was sertraline, from the first day taken I had nightmares, kept being woken by voices that sounded real right next to my ear, had nausea palpitations and just felt worse with them my sleep was great before these and I just thought no I cannot bare the side effects which are worse than you are trying to solve and this has been the case for all others.

Since lockdowns have come I have been struggling to cope as part of my coping mechanisms are my hobbies which I cant really do right now so losing interest in the hobbies now themselves, I live with my long term partner and youngest child 9 who himself has severe ADHD @ Autism and that is hard work too especially now his school routine is gone, things got so bad last year I was driving to a known spot to just end my life as I couldn't take any more but during the drive I was a mile away from where I planned my exit only to get stopped by Police and then shortly after an ambulance the officer called due to my state.

They took me to hospital and went through a thousand questions then said if you promise to go home you can go so of course I said OK I promise and just like that they let me go, and walking back to car I had time to think about my partner and son that would of been devastated so I did just calm down and go home but I never told her where I had been and after some time it got impossible to tell her so I left it at that.

Now lockdown 3 is ongoing nothings changed I hate my job, am very depressed and anxious about everything money, Bills, work, etc just my miserable life in general and the restrictions on my life are unbearable which probably are to most people but mental health sufferers have a real hard time and my mind is always ticking over at break neck speed worrying about everything and now just thinking negative thoughts again looking desperately for a way out and even seeing GP is impossible but a call back I requested was practice nurse so I couldn't even speak about my issues at all."

400,"It doesn't matter how much sleep I get. If I wake up at 9 am I won't be able to get out of bed until the afternoon. I wake up feeling so exhausted that I might as well be glued to my bed. I don't even feel like picking up my phone for hours even though it's right beside me and it might help wake me up more if I used it for a while.

When I eventually get out of bed, anything I want to do takes way too much effort and I don't feel like doing anything except sitting down at my computer all day. I have university all online because of the pandemic yet I don't even touch my university work or look at it at all because I don't feel like it.

I feel like a failure. I'm lonely, tired and thinking about driving somewhere quiet and taking my own life.. not saying I'd actually do this, but it's how bad I'm feeling right now. The only thing I actually do enjoy is going for drives and listening to music but I don't feel like doing anything useful ever.."
401,"I suffered really bad in 2018 with aniexty and depression, the depression side has always really been there I had a tough childhood and was put in care from the age of 3 and I guess it comes from that, anyway no matter how bad in the past I've felt  I'd somehow put on a brave face manage to work and get done whatever I needed to for that week, my way of dealing with it is to cry myself to sleep at night. 

With this third lockdown I've felt my self slipping back, I'm struggling to not cry at work, I feel so crappy about myself and nothing seems to change it, no point talking to my GP they must be snowed under with people who are suffering at the minute. 

I walk about with such a heavy heart I have so much sadness and know matter how much I talk about it. It never goes."
402,Need to talk
403,I've been feeling alone a lot lately due to this coronavirus and the situation we are in. I watch YouTube videos most of the time and draw pictures. I can't go out and see my friends now and its sometimes hard to contact them on the phone. I've got depression and anxiety which makes the situation worse. The only people I'm with in the house now is my parents. Yet I still feel alone and it's really bothering me.
404,"Loneliness is a state of mind.
You can be alone and not be lonely.
You can be in a relationship and have lots of friends and feel very lonely.
The key is finding inner contentment with yourself. That’s easy for me any time I’ve been alone for years because I have always been able to keep my mind occupied with projects and interests.
If you can find something you like and have a passion for, that’s a great cure for loneliness. Again this is easier for me because I prefer to do things a lone a lot. But let the media and people tell you that the key to happiness is being in a relationship because that is misleading. A relationship may help or hinder your life. It all depends very much on who you are in a relationship with, that persons nature and how compatible you are, this also applies to friends (although friends can be given more slack and forgiveness for differences because degrees of friendships can vary a lot).
Keeping the mind occupied is key.
I grew up with animals and they are such a joy, a pet dog or cat. But I haven’t had one for years."
405,"Does anyone ever feel like a part of them is drawn to depression, like your brain just wants you to be depressed all the time? Even when things seem to be going well and you're in a good place mentally, your brain finds a way to bring you back down again into that pit of depression. Idk if its self sabotage or maybe its because ive felt like this most of my life so its whats familiar to me which i find comfort in? Sorry, just curious if anyone else feels the same."
406,"I can't expect to feel wonderful in this situation, I want to and will embrace all the negative emotions that will come, but how can I make it less painful?
I'm aware there is no real answer here, but I thought some kind soul here might share some experiences, some kind words, something that helped them.

I'm young but my family is very old, and even if this is not my first loss in the family, it surely is my first one since I got diagnosed with depression.
I'm losing my last grandparent due to the fact she fell into such a deep depressive state, we physically can't keep her alive anymore. She's old, I was prepared to lose her someday, but there's no real way to prepare yourself for death, is there? Furthermore, what's haunting me is the knowledge that she's not physically sick, she could still live, she's fully aware of what's happening, and yet she gave up. We could save her but in the end we can't do anything.

I would love any kind of advice, words, anything not to fall into the depth of a depressive episode now, not while my family is suffering already.

A quick edit: I am seeing a therapist, I am covered from that point of view"
407,"My Paroxetine (Paxil) medication has lost it's beneficial effect after being on it for 25 years. This effect is called tachyphylaxis and it occurs in some people, not in others. Your body gets used to the particular medication you are taking over time and compensates for it. Sometimes you can increase the dosage and we tried that, but eventually it no longer did the job.

I spoke with the Psychiatrist at my mental health center and she advised a change in prescription-we're doing a phased transition to Sertraline (Zoloft). A little less Paroxetine every two weeks and a little more Sertraline. Eventually I'll be completely weeded-off the Paroxetine.

Only a couple weeks into it, but I already feel a beneficial effect. My body must have been just about unaffected by the Paroxetine after so many years. At any rate, I feel a little bit better so far.

If anyone else has been on the same medication for many years and no longer feel like it's helping you like it did in the past, you should consult your medication specialist. I'm glad I did."
408,"Hi everyone,

hope whoever reads this is doing well.As you can see from the title I’m just not doing well. I’m so tired of living and being in pain.I feel hopeless like no matter how hard I try it’s never enough.

I’m constantly talking down to myself and things are just falling apart in my life. I barely get any sleep and I’m not motivated to do anything.I’m trying to get better but i always end up feeling depressed again"
409,"I'm a female in my early 20s and already a failure. I've been at uni for 3 years and failing my course, I have no motivation for it and anything else in life. I'm so scared to tell my parents that Ive used their money for nothing. I struggled with depression in year 9 (13),never told them and dealt with it. My depression got worse at uni first year, I started drinking constantly (blacking out) and self harming by injuring myself. I've never been scared of death, and recently have been having lots of suicidal thoughts as I honestly have no reason why I should be here. I just honestly don't know what to do anymore and I'm so scared to disappoint my family and friends."
410,"I think my fate is it always to be lonely, never having a partner, never having true friends, always being lonely and misunderstood, even hated. So how i cope with that fact i will always be lonely, i will always be a failure in life, i will alwaysw be hopeless, i will always be useless? 

What if there is not way out, what if you already tried years of therapy and pills?"

And what if you cant focus on Money Power and a Career either?"
412,i feel like a burden and the world would be better off without me. i care too much and annoy those around me and i should get out of their way. i love too much and care to much about my friends i can’t stay alive. i feel so sad i try so hard to get better. it hurts more than i can bear the guilt of just little things like i care too much about a drawing when my friend wants to color over it. i’m too much pain i cause too much pain my mental problems cause too much pain and i can’t help the things i do sometimes like hurt myself. it’s like there are two of me and one keeps hurting me and the other me feels so hurt that it would do that and it’s me i just don’t have any control and am so scared. i ran out into the street and hurt myself and my mom came after me and i didn’t even know where i was and it’s just too much to bear. part of me feels like i deserve to be tortured and the other feels so sad i could think that about me
413,"So tired to do everything alone, no support.

My mother have whats called Vascular Dementia (dementia caused by a stroke). Its not a new thing so I dont need advices about this 👍.

I found a forum about dementia, I asked if any have a parent who had a stroke before their 40s, because most people carry parents who are over 70 old, with hard deep dementia, and mostly alzheimers, and its really a different case my mother have.

But no, didnt found anyone. 

So its like.... Ok, keep dealing with this alone and with no one to relate. No one to talk about this, just suck it up and... make like nothing is happening.

I know its such a specific thing, not much people have a case like this, but always thought I was going to find someone to relate in internet. 

But nope. All alone continues."
414,"im not rude or mean to people, it’s just that I don’t think I actually love anyone. I don’t think I ever did. I’m not even talking about romantic love, just any kind of love. I don’t know what true love would even feel like. My grandma says she loves me, but I guess I don’t feel it. What does unconditional love feel like? It must be nice. what does it feel like to love your friends and family? It must be comforting To love and be loved back."

I've always been a nerd and I never was underprepared for a test. However, this depressive episode has been the longest in a while due to which I couldn't concentrate on my studies and I haven't studied at all. I've never been in this scenario and now all I can do is panic. I can't bear the thought of failing because this is the only thing I was at least average in. I can't focus, I can't concentrate and it's taking a toll on me. Please can someone tell me how they manage to academically do well while being depressed? Since English is my second language, I apologize if this was hard to read."

418,"So he phoned me today.  My GP practice had written to him on 7th December filling him in that I was struggling.  Cannot get to sleep and stay asleep.  Sometimes sleeping, lying in bed way too much.  Just no motivation for getting up.  Feel a bit better as day goes on but dreading night time.  Eat too much/ eat next to nothing and then it can be rubbish.  Anxious to the point I am imagining stuff? Not sure.  Complicated by fact I may have MS.  Also recent blood tests meant reduction in thyroxine needed.  So we have agreed on my Venlafaxine going up from to 225 to 300 mg for a few weeks to see what this does.  Might introduce Lamotrigine as well but got to wait see.  Nobody said this was easy, did they? I also have 300 mg Pregablin daily but I might be happy to try with less."
419,"Hi all, I hope you’re doing well or at least getting by; sending good energy to whoever needs it.

Just having one of those days where nothing bad has happened—by and large it’s actually been a good day—but I don’t feel grounded in it. Nothing is wrong but nothing is right either. It’s like reality is unfolding around me but I’m completely removed from it, not actually part of it. I feel like half of a person. This detachment scares me and I don’t know how else to say it, but I really miss *myself.* I hope that makes sense."

422,"I didn't talk about this topic with anyone as I remember, just with my mom. Not all of it with her too
A person, who is my relative abused me while I was little. Yeah, he was little just like me but, I just can't feel alright about it... I forgive him in old days but when he started to act a bit bad to my mom, I felt bad, to be honest. Decide to not forgive
I still love him, like he is my cousin, he was only 9 when he did the things but I was 4 or 5 as I remember. I don't know how to feel about it and without a reason, I feel guilty about it. I feel bad. 
But, this feeling is getting better... I feel better than old days (I was feeling really disgusting before...)
I don't know how to explain this feeling. It's like I feel guilty and not feeling guilty at the same time... I just don't know, the feelings change due to time...
Whatever it is, it's nice to see I can handle this feeling. It's not hard as it's been..."
423,"Well, let me start by saying that around a year ago I decided to cut my eldest brother out of my life. At this point, there was no particular trigger, I just realised I'd had enough. I never said why I'd broken contact, one day I just stopped responding to his messages. He tried to call a couple of times afterwards but I responded by blocking his number. Part of me is still not sure I did / am doing the right thing but now I sort of feel committed to it.

So, with that out of the way, allow me to try to explain why I did this in the first place. When I was a child, and he an adult teen, he would force my sister and myself to fight for his own amusement, something which deeply traumatised my other, much kinder brother. Around eighteen months ago, I went for a walk with my eldest brother and he brought up the fighting, laughing about it and mentioning his favourite move of mine. I tried to make it clear that I didn't wish to discuss it through body language, as I'm deeply ashamed I was ever violent towards my sister, but he carried on talking about it. How can a man in his 40's be this way?

There was also another occassion, around this time, that he listed all the shortcomings I had as a child, told me what an angry, miserable kid I was and then went on to describe how happy he was as a child. I told my other brother (whom my eldest brother disowned over addictions he likely contributed to) this and he suggested the opposite was true, that our eldest brother was a frustrated bully and to simply try and forget what he said. Ultimately, I have to surmise I was told this to dent my confidence, given that I can't really see any other motivation.

When I was a teenager he would burst into my room, and when I made it clear I wanted privacy he would fly into a rage and threaten me with violence, slamming and kicking my bedroom door - remarkable behaviour for someone who no longer lived there. My room was my only retreat, being a cripplingly shy kid, and he had no respect for my boundaries whatsoever.

As an adult, I was his slave and failure to comply resulted in sulking and angry behaviour. I once had a day off work and because I went out for the day and got back too late to take him to the supermarket, I received abusive voicemails threatening me and calling me a ""flouncy little bastard"". Sorry, I don't want to answer the phone to an angry baby. And talking of flouncing, he had just stormed out of my mother's house in a rage because I never took him shopping.

For years, I felt like I was on eggshells around him, so did whatever he asked to keep the peace. I'd come in from work, shattered (as I also have insomnia) and he'd ask me to do favours for him. I'd get calls in the middle of the night asking me to pick him up from some nightclub even though he knew I had to be up for work the next day. Should I say no, he would just relentlessly harrass me until I said yes.

Every time I saw him, he would invariably do or say something to do upset me and even on the rare occasions he didn't, the fear of that happening was enough. Constant criticisms, mocking me in front of others, taking all of my comments out of context, sulking because I dared have a different opinion to him. Should I share an opinion with somebody else and no him, we were ""ganging up on"" him. Every little thing I said, I said because I was this or that, not because I just said something - he was hugely exaggerating my foibles and traits to create a cartoon version of me he had in his mind. I realised, quite a long time ago, that he never actually saw me as a person.

Once, he flew into a rage because I decided I didn't want to go to the cinema, even though he was still going with somebody else. He showed up at my mother's when I was visiting, sulked, and then shouted at me for daring to look at my mother. Because looking at my mother was the real crime, not the fact that he acted like a vile piece of s**t. He texted me later saying he ""didn't want us to fall out"". Excuse me? Because I was tired after a 10 hour shift and didn't want to see a film? He even brought this up more recently and said ""You looked at mam"". That, despite several years' distance, is still what he gets from that. I pointed out that I've seen him do the same in similar circumstances, but apparently he definitely doesn't do that. He evidently has this elevated state of awareness in his mind that we can only envy, which I find ironic as he has no self-awareness at all.

More recently, he was learning to drive and I got all manner of entitled behaviour, how disappointed he was that people weren't helping him more. He really thought people should bend over backwards and spend any spare moment sitting in the car with an incompetent and dangerous driver. He asked me when I could take him out next, I said I'd check my work shifts. ""Oh, I hate that, don't call us, we'll call you"". This is a man in his forties.

There are numerous other things, his utter selfishness, his hypocrisy, his jealousy (once he saw that I looked happy in confident in my new clothes, so told me my jacket looked cheap), his total inability to see the bad in himself.

So the question is, does he sound like a narcissistic and did I do the right thing cutting him out? Sorry for the ineloquent waffle, it's just my way."
424,"I have always struggled with depression and a few weeks back it was particularly bad. I had joined this site in search of finding some resources or someone to talk to. My depression had gotten to the point of suicide ideation and I ended up leaving my parents house out of fear of them being the ones to find me, since I knew I was feeling so horrible and wanted it all to just end.

I had relapsed on using drugs which increased my feelings and made me think I should definitely end my life. It was as if my mind was telling me to do it, over and over again. I do think I was holding back because honestly I was scared to end my life. I just felt like I had to.

The next few days I continued sleeping in my car and avoiding talking to anyone who reached out or trying to reach out to anyone. I just had no desire to talk. I felt like that was where it needed to end. But then I got my weeks worth of meds and thought that was how I would do it. I ended up injecting taking far too much to self harm. I was sure that would cause a fatal overdose, but I woke up. A few hours later. I was getting more and more hopeless and tried to plan ways of finding another resource to be able to go through with my plan, I had picked up my paycheck which was barely anything but I had written a note and left them next to each other to help with at least a little bit of the arrangements if possible. My boyfriend who I had recently started seeing then texted me. He had just gotten back into town, he insisted on coming to pick me up and for some reason he was the only one I felt comfortable opening up to. So I ended up going home with him, his mom was also visiting from out of town with him. We had a great couple of days even though they were a bit of a blur to me, as his mom had given me some pills to help me sleep and they ended up blacking me out for most the next day and through that night, I slept a bunch. But it was good for me I thought and I had my boyfriend to take care of me.... but then the horrible next morning came.. I had went to sleep with him at 1:30am that night.. I didn't wake up again until close to 1 pm the next day.. I was so tired. But when I woke up I realized he was no longer snoring.. I thought maybe he had put something over his mouth and nose to sleep as I saw there were bubbles.. I couldn't comprehend what was going on. I went to the bathroom walked out the room, changed my shirt, came back in and laid down next to him. I was just waiting for him to wake up.. Then I was woken back up by his mom coming in she didn't say a word, she just slowly pulled the covers off me and told me ""He is dead"" That is when I went crazy, I kept trying to grab him, to do something to help him, but she pulled me off and told me not to touch him. I couldn't be in that room any longer it just made me so uncomfortable, and so upset. I didn't have my phone as it was in the room next to him on the bed.. His mom was in the room taking photographs of him on her cellphone.. She had no emotion, nothing, she even came to me and told me ""This isn't a crime scene, you might as well go ahead and leave since I'm about to call the police"" I refused as I had no reason to leave him alone, I wanted to be of help and do anything I could until I knew for fact there was nothing else we could do.. She went on to call the police and during the whole process I just couldn't make sense of her acceptance when literally it JUST happened. How could she even be in the same room as him without some sort of horrible emotions? Not wanting to try to save him or do something, not letting me do anything to help him. It just felt off. I was questioned by the police and then she told me that she had to start calling family so she needed me to leave. At that point there was nothing else I could do and I realized that. I left the house because I wanted to be respectful even though I just wanted to be by his side. I know I didn't get to be with him long at all but he was one to make me feel so loved and we were already going to have a kid, he pulled out my IUD the night before already! I wish you could get pregnant that fast, and who knows maybe you can, but at this point I just don't know yet as it is still so recent.

That same night I admitted myself into a short term treatment/mental health facility because all I could think was I had to do something for him, to not let his death be in vain, or without something positive that was in my control that I could do, and getting sober and getting help on my depression was the first place I could start, So I did. As much as I felt and wanted it to be me and not him, as much as I wanted to just numb it all away and forget the images in my mind of my loving new boyfriend laying there that dreadful morning. I still have so many unanswered questions as the autopsy results are still not back and can possibly take up to 10 weeks, which is just causing my head to spin more and more... I just can't understand how such an amazing, loving, beautiful person left this earth at such a young age... And his mom tried to tell me she already found peace.. that he was pretty much never going to get better so that was that... but that is just not true! I keep thinking maybe she did something. Even people who have known him much longer than me and were so much closer with him were thinking the same way as well. Which only confirmed that my suspicion was at least not completely off the wall.. But I have no place making assumptions when I just have no proof and honestly didn't even get the time to know him, or his mom, well enough to speculate. But I just can't keep from going there. At the end, the result is still the same, no matter what, he is gone, I am so upset, angry, sad, lonely, helpless and just praying this is all a bad dream and I can go back to that day and do something to change this loss and have him here with me again. I just want him back, I loved him and love him. The only thing I know is that he would have wanted me to help others and to be a shining light in this dark world, because that was what he was... He was an incredibly bright light of love and everything good in this world. I will never regret the time I got with him, only the time I didn't. I love and miss him so much I don't ever want to love again. Rest Easy MY Angel. I will see you again."

426,"Hi all. Hope this is the right place. 

tldr: husband is depressed, won’t accept any help and I’m broken by being the support network

I’ve been with my husband for 4 years. And over the years he’s just gone into decline. He’s very negative but has gone into catastrophing everything - the smallest thing turns sounds like a massive disaster and he dumps all his worries and negativity on me.

As his wife I thought I was there to provide support so I haven’t put in the boundaries I realise I should have. 

However last week I thought a night playing games and a few drinks would be fun - we both needed a pandemic lockdown break. The evening turned into him drinking fast and heavy and getting very angry about his mother. His mother has terminal cancer but his anger was about his childhood and her as a person rather than the situation. I knew he disliked his father but this was new. 
This led to him refusing to get out of bed the next day and having a full on panic attack. (I’ll point out pre Covid and pre his mother’s illness it was becoming common for us to go out and the evening turning into him offloading and moaning the entire time to which we’d discussed.
Thursday he came home from work and was having a melt down because he had decided to quit his job next year. We’d agreed and discussed it. But he was having a panic about if it was the right decision, crying and demanding we go thru the finances. So we did. 
The next morning I just started crying and spend the day crying. I’d broken. He came home from work and seeing my distress we talked it thru. He told me he’d arranged to go to a mates for a drink for a boys night as he needed a laugh and once we’d chatted about my distress he asked about dinner because his mate was picking him up at X time. He spent the evening with his mate and wife (wasn’t a boys night) whilst I was home alone still crying.

So the blinkers came off. He’s previously lied to me about boys nights that were not boys nights and oh’s were there. I realised he’s lied to me about other things and it’s eroded the trust. He does things to placate me but doesn’t mean them. So he had counselling last year for his anxiety because I said things needed to change. He’s just admitted he lied in counselling and didn’t open up when asked. He said it was because it was online (everything has a reason why he can’t do something) He been on work courses to help with management and then ignored all the advise and spent 2 years moaning he can’t do his job.  He moans his mother doesn’t listen to anything he suggests and I pointed out he is exactly the same.

Anyway I realise now, he’s not ready for help and he’s the only one who can ask for it. 
I’ve suffered depression myself but was single so I’ve no idea how to support someone, support someone I’ve lost trust in, someone who doesn’t want help. I understand he’s depressed and anxious but he just doesn’t want help.

I’m broken with it all. He doesn’t consider my feelings at all - and I think it’s hard to understand now if that’s him or the depression. (First week I moved in with him he told me his ex messaged wanting him back and then went on a boys weekend camping - leaving me very confused. Massive red flag, I should have realised then but I’m in this bed now - was he depressed then or just selfish)

I probably sound like the selfish one but thanks for listening x"
427,"I'm sure we can all relate that the past year has been a difficult one. My depression and anxiety has put me on such a crazy rollercoaster of ups and downs, even more so than it usually does. Add on seasonal depression with my regular depression and my 2020 depression...well, you get the point. I'm struggling.

Anyways, I'm hitting a bit of a slump right now. I feel apathetic, flat, and endlessly exhausted (mentally and emotionally). I'm having a really hard time focusing at work and following conversations with people. I'm irritable. I'm maxed out on my doses of medication and I've upped my frequency of therapy from monthly to bi-weekly, but I keep going through these waves of waking up and feeling like my life is on auto-pilot. Even on non-stressful days I find myself zoning out and not really ""there"". Lackluster. Empty and dull. I hate it.

It's especially frustrating because I'm doing everything I can think of to cope and take care of myself, but I can't seem to shake feeling like this lately. And I know this is my usual winter cycle for my mental health, but it is disheartening to be working as hard as I have been on my mental health and still get this down regardless of my efforts. I know I need to just wait it out, but Michigan winters drag on forever and I feel myself slip even farther every day.

I would love to hear some suggestions, support, feedback - anything. It's helpful just to write it out and vent, especially knowing I'm not alone. But man, this is getting tough."
428,I was born with a birth defect called erb's palsy.. the doctor pulled me out by my left arm causing me nerve damage my whole life for 35 years. my arm is a little underdeveloped and a little shorter and weaker than my other arm but I can still do things with it but not like my right arm and I can't turn my palm over and I can't live my arm fully over my head because of this birth defect I will never have a girlfriend or wife or kids because no woman will ever want a man with a birth defect..ever!  people look at me like I'm a freak everybody makes me feel so bad about myself even tried committing suicide I hate life because of what the doctor did today when he delivered me I don't know how to cope with this after all these years the pain I have suffered and when I was a child no doctor wanted to operate on it and the doctor that delivered me couldn't be sued because he had so much backup protecting him so my whole life I have suffered I'm trying to lift weight to make it stronger but it's not working I'm just so tired being a loser because of bus my life ended before I was even born bothering me more and more everyday for the past 35 years.. so my question is what do I do in this situation?...
429,There was this ps2 game I used to play when I was a kid called Ico and I was just obsessed with it. Does anyone remember that game? You played as a young boy trying to escape a large labyrinth-like castle all while bringing along a princess who was also trapped with you. Once in a while these black shadow figures would come and grab the princess and bring her down into this shadowy black hole in the ground if you didn’t protect her well enough. And damn it if those shadow creatures grabbing and dragging you into a hole isn’t exactly how this depression feels. And the worse part is she would just stand there and let them take her! No yelling for help or running away; the same shit I do now. I remember thinking how stupid and utterly helpless this character was not to mention straight annoying. So disappointed in what I’ve become in adulthood and kid me would be majorly let down.
430,"Hi guys,

I’m dealing with something that feels unknown to me. Maybe it’s because it are many different things at once. It’s very hard to explain what’s going on exactly, also because like I said that it feels unclear for myself as well, but I’ll try my best to explain it clearly. It’s also hard to decide where to post this, but I think depression currently may fit the best.

(Alright, so I tell you right away some stuff may trigger and the total story is a long read, I think it’s necessary to really get a idea where I d

First of all, I’m currently 21 years old and have been globally dealing with this for 4 years on high intensity.

So, where do I start? I’ll quickly tell you my current diagnose which psychologists gave me in the past. It’s add, generalized anxiety and social anxiety. I think they thought these are the main factors. The last one thought autism instead of add, but that wasn’t the result of the test I did. Add is something I doubt myself, since I did took meds for it, but they did the opposite.

Anyway, now that’s out of the way I’ll give you some quick explanation how my childhood looked like, because I think it’s a important factor to understand the full picture.

As a kid I think I always was sensitive. The first kind of flashbacks I have is my shyness. I did have friends however and I was actually hanging out with the ‘popular’ kids of school. My home situation unfortunately wasn’t great. When I was 5 years old my parents divorced, my mom met a new husband and well.. Let’s say, it wasn’t great. Not great at all. There where daily conflicts everyday and it’s started getting really out of hand real soon. He threatened to hurt my mom nearly every week. My brother as well. Me as well. And it also happened. The physical abuse for me wasn’t the worse, it was the psychological that was. I was afraid. Not for my own self, but for me my mom and my brother. My brother eventually left home to start living at my biological father when I was like 12 years old. I was too afraid of making such choice. When I was 13 years old, we went on Holliday, which ended up horrible, but also like a way of getting out. My broke her arm from the abuse and we escaped to another city.

I’m now thinking this isn’t going to be short story at all. I haven’t even describes all the details, but just a few.

When we arrived in the different city I tried building a new life. But I didn’t reached out for help. At that time, everything made me just super insecure about myself and I wasn’t very trustful. Making new friends however wasn’t that bad. I finished high school and I started smoking weed. Partly due of the friends I hang out with. I didn’t want to be different. Social situations in groups became to be harder and harder. But I still could continue just living like that. The marijuana wasn’t doing me any good favor and I often felt anxious while doing it. I’m actually a person who wants to keep his 2 feet on the ground.

I started following a new study. Nothing I really liked however. I wasn’t really busy with thinking about the futher. The bad social anxiety started to grow. Or well, better said, it started to build up. More and more painful situations occurred. Romantic relationship wise, the social anxiety was even worse. I just learned from my early years to be very thoughtful of actions and words. I was doing internship for school at a restaurant. I’m not going to say a lot about it, but it wasn’t enjoyable at all. After my first year I went on holiday with my friends for the first time. I had fun and we went out to parties a lot. Kinda healthy stuff. Another painful moment happened unfortunately on the way back. I took a 24h busride myself with strangers back to home and I was very ill. Probably of all the alcohol lol. Alcohol was like the only way to have a tiny bit of confidence back then.

Now I’m going fast forward to 2 situations which I personally see as the start of the mess I’m in today.

They are both drugs related. The first one, was due of my first (and only) try of hard drugs called magic mushrooms. It was just extremely stupid to do it and I still regret it. I thought that if my friends did it I could do it as well. So we went to a forrest (the stupidest place to do it) and started tripping. The first hour was like the most terrible I had ever felt back then. I just wasn’t enjoying not being in control. I felt uncomfortable, stressed etc. I think this was the first time I actually panicked about losing control. I felt that way before in social events, but this was more extreme. The rest of it is kinda blurry for me, but the symptoms decreased and I just told myself it was not going to last forever.

I didn’t actually said it before, but I fainted in class in the first few months of my study, which was pretty traumatic taking in consideration I was socially anxious. The symptoms also happened again, but I didn’t faint. The trigger was weed. Right before the first hour began I smoked some marijuana with a classmate and when I was in class I regretted it right away. My heart started to raise, I began to sweat and become dizzy. I was extremely afraid someone would notice it and especially because it was because of marijuana. So I ran out of school, I was too anxious to take the bus, so I walked to my home in like 3 hours.

After this I stopped doing drugs, but unfortunately it was too late. 2 months later I started experiencing panic attacks and this was the start of the development of a severe anxiety disorder which was going to grow and grow and take everything away from me.

I started going in therapy. But this didn’t work out too well unfortunately. I just didn’t make progression. I tried EMDR and cbt. But emotionally I just couldn’t open up anymore. I also lost the ability of crying for example. School was getting extremely hard and I just couldn’t keep up at it anymore. My anxiety was the only thing which was keeping me busy. I tried meds which was a big step for me, but no results. No good results at least. The therapists gave up and I fel in a gigant black hole of no help at all. Oh, I still lived at my moms house btw (I still am to this day). So first my problems where very socially orientated. I did have the fear of losing control and then really focused on social situations. First school became impossible, later simple bus rides became impossible and a bit later I couldn’t see my friends anymore. The only thing I could do was staying at home. I was often busy with music back then. It was like a distraction for me.

Now I’m going fast forward to the point I was trying new therapy. I was 20 years old right then. The first attempt was at a place and it was really traumatic although it was just a first meeting. Basically I was told my symptoms where to severe. Everything there was just feel extremely discomfortly. I was all alone at the session and I was feeling I was losing my mind. It felt literally like I ended up in some kind of horror movie. I wasn’t allowed to leave which was making it worse. I started questioning myself of being paranoid or schizophrenic from then on.

Well, I didn’t gave up and searched for a new one and I did found one. After all, I think it was pretty solid, but not for me, it wasn’t fitting my symptoms. It was completely focused on exposure. It was a full week program. It was just, it was too much. I started self harming heavily to feel something else then just fear. Resulting in scars on my belly. So, yeah. I was allowed to finish therapy at home due of corona, but it wasn’t helping me at all. Luckily they offered to help me search for another option.

In the meantime yet another traumatic event happened for me. I visited my brother (which is a huge exposure itself) and when I went to swim at a castle in a forrest I experienced the exact same feeling I had during magic mushrooms. So that make me wonder a lot.

And that’s where I’m at today. I’m currently following a program which is focussed on doing sports via a personal coach. I have had like 10 appointments, but I didn’t make any improvement.

So just some extra important info of what I’m actually fearing. So, personally I think the fear of losing control. But it’s just so extremely frustrating I don’t know what I deal with. If there is a answer. If there is a way out. Right now I just feel very depressed. Not seeing any clear way out. Life feel surreal, intense and frightening. The fear of losing control has taken away everything. Literally everything. I feel like I’m miles away from social society. And this is just very hard. I experience intrusions (where I actually didn’t talk about) of harming others and myself. I hope it are intrusions at least. My psychologists where aware of it and they didn’t see me as a threat. But I do see myself at a threat. That’s the reason I actually do all of this to myself. I also started fearing certain colors and now the newest one is that every single food doesn’t feel good and I just don’t know what I can thrust and not. I can’t watch movies, I can’t keep myself busy. It’s just very very hopeless. I often feel like I can’t run from death for much longer. How I’m still alive is a question. And yeah, feeling like a threat to others isn’t helping that at all. But it’s just very weird. I can even start to feel anxious looking at a wall. Like what’s going on? Am I a psycho? I feel uncomfortable even around my own family. Well you can name everything and I have a reason the feel anxious and very often I don’t even know why anymore. I also sleep badly. Dream intensely. It’s just, what am I supposed to do at this point? I just feel like the only one like this. I’m lonely. I’m hopeless. Ok, I sound very frustrated right now and I actually am. How can life ever improve when you are this deep. And just a small improvement isn’t enough. I think I have to fix 90% to start to feel some what healthy again.

Alright, so everyone who made it to the end. Thanks a lot for taking your time for it. I had some difficulties writing this. Some parts are just hard to speak about. As detailed at this is something I haven’t told anyone."
431,"Hi all Thos weekend was to much for me. First yesterday I was forced to go to a day support which means no rest for me on Saturday I have one day to rest wish is today. Tomorrow I have to go to another day support I hate it. I can't handle much of anything anymore since my mom died, I found myself in a new life a life I can't take. I just want to end it so bad. I miss my mom so much, Im crying right now cause I know she's never coming back.  I can't even get help when I need it. Why dont the staff understand at my group home. Thats not all, My coffee time was cut back to 6 pm not 8 pm once again they are controling me. I can't handle this anymore I wish I could end it all."
432,"The couple that I lived with for two months moved out just now and when they were here at the start I was like they’re okay but they’re annoying and couldn’t wait for them to leave. Then today after like 3 months they left and I helped them move and gave them a hug and waved at them as they left and I came inside and I walked up the stairs and sat at the top huddled up and just cried I don’t even know why I’m crying maybe it’s coz I’m in a house that’s empty and alone again and once again people have left me - I know they got to live their life but I just hate the fact that I’ll probably never see them again it’s upsetting I like people and life is just transient friendships and transient everything and I’m relevant to people when I’m in their life and now they’re gone, I can’t stop thinking of ending my life and it seems like a perfect solution, people keep leaving me and everyone goes that’s life but if I killed myself then I leave them . Also I know that even though I love people I’m losing that day by day, I feel like a boy in a mans body who just wants to be friends with everyone but after rejection for a while you just give up.

I watched a Netflix documentary about people who died and came back and it sounds so peaceful. X

I would do or give anything to anyone but I don’t fit in I overthink everything and I can’t remember the last time I felt happy or even felt hope I just feel constant despair sadness or occasionally apathy - sorry for the post I just needed somewhere to write it out as I don’t have anyone to speak to x"
433,"Dear people, 
I found this forum on google as a last thing I do before seeking professional help (very difficult as its CoVID now and also need to find an english speaking therapist in Germany that can accessed by private insurance). I live abroad, alone where I am not familiar with the people and their language. I have been struggling every day to wake up (starting a month or two ago) and am usually looking at the most unproductive things on my phone till afternoon. I bathe maybe once in three days. I used to love cooking, trying out new recipes. I find it very difficult to cook now. Feeling drained all the time. I also have a problem being vulnerable especially with my closest people. Ive always been so scared of disappointing the people that I love. I hate for them to see me in moments of weakness. Hence, I bottle all of these things inside me. Im not sure if I am depressed, since I have not been clinically diagnosed. I am a masters student, and to finish my degree, I need to write my thesis. But Im finding it so hard to start. And even if I start, I feel like Im going to fail and then stop whatever progress I have made. I hardly get out of my room these days. I don't want to explain to my flatmates why Im in the same clothes I was in two days ago or even have enough to make a polite conversation. I cannot seem to follow any kind of positive routine. I try for a day or two and then slip back into this. My relationship is also struggling as my boyfriend is also going through a low-period in his life and we are not being able to be there for each other. Now here I am, reading the posts on this forum, crying at 2 AM unable to fall asleep. I hope I don't sound self-obsessed or mad. I dont know what to do. Can someone please help me?"
434,"Hi everyone,

I hope you feel well or at least not too bad.

I m 26.
I feel depressed again since before the beginning of december.
Due to my problems in my region (rapes especially), I almost haven t keep any contact with people I knew there or my family (except when they invited themself in my appartment...). I m living now in another city.

I would like to talk to someone, but I m afraid. I would like to talk with a colleague but I don t know if it s a good idea. I m a little lost, what if he thinks I m crazy, or too unstable to be trusted ? He is 1 year older than me (27) and I was the person who introduced him to the work in the company.

He told me the last week that he was here to listen to me if I need it. But I don t know what/how to do...

What is in my mind actually ? Bad old memories from 6-10 years ago. Among others :
- rapes during 9 months 
- self harm tendancies ( I haven t do it since 4 years)
- a friend who wanted to help me by killing me, until I was unconscious
- a suicide tentative and worst self harm episodes
- The suicide of a friend (an other), it was 9 years ago in december and I feel very bad about it and guilty."
435,The tittle says it all. Chat in private message. If any wants to message me.
436,Hello I just found out I'm actually on unpaid leave so not getting a salary in february.im gutted  they sent me a really rude email as if I hadn't been listening last week when I had I only asked what was going on because they said I would be asked to come in days a week and I haven't been at all :(:(
437,"Samaritans .. never answer

Council housing officer .. like a stone with no emotion despite one day stand in my living room nod yes when I say we vulnerable residents and likely need more help.  Complex ptsd is on my housing file .. yet I feel like outcast and that she does everything to AVOID helping.. to anyone ask her.
Dopey dumb cold housing officer."
438,"For the past few weeks I’ve been having suicidal thoughts. It’s been off and on during my past 3 years. I feel like no one understands. I try to explain it but the feedback is like why do I dwell on negative thoughts but I can’t help it. I literally physically can’t stop these thoughts. So I don’t want to talk about it anymore. It’s effected my 3 year long relationship. I feel like I should just break up with her so she can live without me and my problems. Ive lied to her and my family and friend so many times about how I feel, that I feel crazy. I go for long walks just thinking about how my life seems it’s in ruins. I am doing therapy, I’ve just recently seen a psychiatrist but it’s like what’s the point. I hate myself now again."
439,"The title isn't meant to sound melodramatic, I promise. I genuinely just don't know what's wrong with me. I haven't felt like myself for awhile now, but then again I feel like I don't really have a true sense of who I am. I feel like I spent the past 5 or 6 years floating from friend group to friend group, adapting so that they didn't ever get tired of me or leave me behind. That was a real fear of mine, getting left behind. And because I tried so hard to fit in I feel like I never really developed a true sense of my own personality? I see bits and pieces of everyone I've ever cared about within me but I can never find myself. Like, I'm working on getting my bachelors right now because I know it's what I have to do, but when I step back and ask myself if I really want this degree, I'm so indifferent about it. But I don't know what else I'd do, so I guess this is okay? Does that make sense? Like am I doing this because I want to, or because it's what's expected from me?

On top of all of that I feel like a robot most days. Like I'm just going through the motions of living. Every day just feels like a chore. My favorite part of the day is sleeping. Sleeping. I used to love doing things like drawing, or writing, or sewing, and now it all feels so forced. I just feel so empty most days, like every laugh is fake and every smile is forced and it's become so exhausting. Not feeling anything has become exhausting because I have to fake it so no one thinks anythings wrong. On the other end though, it takes the littlest of things to set me off into an intense anger or intense sadness. I think people around me are starting to notice how irritable I'm becoming, and I hate it. One moment I'm fine and the next I'm terrible to be around. I'm aware of it but I can't do anything about it, no matter how hard I try. 

I know where it all stems from. That isn't even a question for me. Growing up my father has always been extremely mentally and verbally abusive. Walking around my family home felt like walking on eggshells, trying to avoid saying something that would set him off. My mom suffers from extreme anxiety because of it, but she's on the side of things that therapists and medication are useless and you can help yourself with essential oils & meditation because the first medication she ever tried made her feel like a zombie. This meant in high school I was never allowed to go to a therapist because she assumed I would hate it. And my dad wouldn't ever let me get medicated if I did go because he also had a bad experience with medication when he was younger. So I was kind of screwed over. And now I am, a grown adult who knows I have problems and no proper diagnosis other than looking at google and going ""I mean, I guess I do that?"" 

It's just become so exhausting. I want to talk to someone about it, because I feel like it's been getting worse. I've been thinking about death a lot lately, about how easy it would be. I want to die, but I don't want to kill myself. I just want to stop existing like this. And the hardest part is I know I couldn't ever tell my mother that. When I told her I didn't want to be catholic she had a breakdown because she felt like a failure of a mother, I can only imagine how she'd feel if her only daughter told her she doesn't want to be alive anymore. 

If you've made it this far, I'm sorry for the information dump, I got carried away. I guess my whole point with this is, is there anyone else who can relate to what I'm going through? I've just felt so alone in this for so long I just want to know if there's anyone else going through/who has gone through anything similar. Thanks for reading, and I hope this makes some sort of sense."
440,"When my depression hits, it comes from nowhere. I liken it to a wolf that hunts it's prey and to the prey, it strikes from nowhere. 

I've looked for triggers for around 20 years and there is none that I can see. It just happens. It's part of me, my psyche.. I hunt the wolf.. I want to kill it. 
But at the same time I also know I am the wolf. It's given me strength when nothing else has."
441,"Every time I adapt even a little bit to the bs and pain I get kicked harder. It’s like life doesn’t want me to even become stronger through my crushing hardships. It just wants me to continue being made weak to suffer and squirm all alone in the dark. 

I went to a family lunch and I did not feel invited at all despite ‘putting myself out there’ and ‘engaging in the conversation’ I literally felt invisible because everything I said got ignored. The only person who didn’t ignore me was my autistic sister and she kept telling me ‘go away George.’ ‘Go’ ‘go’ ‘please move out George’ so I ate and quickly got out of there. 

My problems have descended to a level which now I’m having depersonalization whether sober or high. This happened long before I started smoking weed and the weed helps most of the time. I’m about to share a ridiculously crazy idea but sometimes I wonder if I’ve already died and gone to hell and just haven’t figured it out yet. I grew up in strong Christian family. Sometimes I wonder if I’m in a coma because life doesn’t feel like life anymore. It’s just endless torment for me. To deal with all my own big and small problems and to be ostracized constantly everywhere I go. 

I’ve been told by people before that I’m a disgusting human, creepy, annoying, stupid, putrid  and don’t deserve happiness and that I don’t deserve good people. I honestly don’t know what caused people to say this based on the little information they have about me. There’s nothing I can do for myself anymore then what I have already tried or am doing. I really don’t want to die or go away but it’s looking like o have no place to go or be. Im sorry I  don’t belong anywhere and should never have been born.

I really wish I could just go away and forget all about this life. Or at least feel some validation and like I actually matter to somebody."
442,"My partner of three years has just broken up with me. The problem is,  we’ve moved to his home country from mine where we were both living and I have no support network here at all. We haven’t even been here two months and he’s called it quits. 
We’ve been planning this move for over a year, because he has been so unhappy and homesick where we were. He’s been unhappy with his job for a long time and whenever something stressful at work takes place (he went on stress leave a few months ago) he pushes me away and inevitably breaks up with me, blaming me for all his unhappiness. Am I really to blame? I’ve only ever tried to help and encourage him and make him happy. 

He’s had a hard childhood and has some issues he needs to sort out regarding his parents, but when we went to counselling and this was bought up he dismissed it and won’t talk about it. 

He recently started taking antidepressants but now wants to stop them because he says he’s not depressed but that it’s me who has been making him so very unhappy throughout our relationship.

Our relationship has never been perfect but we love each other so very much, and I’m struggling to recognise the cold and angry person he is being now. 

He’s told me he will book me a flight home if that’s what I want to do and that he won’t be changing his mind. Please does anyone have any advice? I’m absolutely devastated, and can’t accept this is truly what he wants or whether this is his depression talking."
443,"I found this poem years ago...

Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep
by Steve Feinstein

Now I lay me down to sleep
Another day is done
With nothing gained and nothing lost
Like every other one

I stand before the mirror
And the tears begin to well
What have I done that I've become
That empty joyless shell

The hair unkempt the face unshaved
The teeth a smokey brown
The cheeks just hanging by a thread
The lips a lifeless frown

The eyes are black with weariness
Yet I am loath to lay
Too brief will be my restless sleep
'Til falls another day

At last I can resist no more
And curl up in my bed
I might decide on suicide
Were I not already dead"
444,"Hi all, 

I guess i'm using this forum to let out how i'm feeling as its hard for me to express how i'm feeling in person to people. 

Recently I've been feeling really stupid about how I'm feeling.  Me and my mother watched some old baby videos of myself that we found and since watching them i've been feeling so low and depressed.  My childhood was wonderful (apart from my father leaving when I was 11).  I know i'm probably feeling like this because I wish to go back to then.   Responsibility to be taken away from me and have that feeling back I had when I was a child.

My mind keeps going back to how my mum looked after me and all that she has done for me through everything and her love really shows in those videos and it hurts me.  It hurts me that my mother was treated so poorly by my father and I wish that I could be happier for my mum.  I'm 27, I still live at home and work full time at the hospital which is pretty stressful at the moment due to COVID.  I help my mum out as much as I can (I pay her rent and help with food bills etc) but I feel like i'm going nowhere in life.  My younger sister has settled down with 2 children and is getting married.   I was in a relationship for 10 years and engaged and that relationship broke down. I want to be able to get married and have kids and have my own place but that seems so unobtainable.   I feel like i'm stuck in limbo and I want to make everyone proud of me and I feel like i'm not.   I've been crying constantly the past week and I can't seem to stop.   I feel so stupid cause I feel like these are such small issues and there is so much going on around me thats worse than what i'm feeling. 

 I'm not sure how to handle my feelings and can't seem to stop feeling this low.

445,"Hello everyone, I just joined and I'm happy to be on here :).  I wanted to open up a discussion about sexually based depression.  What I mean by that is depression surrounding sexual issues.  Either feeling worthless because of your sexuality or your lack of sexual vigor.  Or finding that general thoughts about sex end up leading you depressive feelings.  I would be happy to hear about any and all of that because those are all things that I have dealt with and I haven't seen any other posts about it.  Hope everyone is doing well :)"

447,"Hi guys, I'm currently crying as usual in bed and can't sleep. Thought I'd get my feelings out there nd try and help others. It's not nice to see how many people are suffering. I have been having this depressive episode for around a year now, its taken me some time to realise I don't remember the last time I felt happy. I have been smoking weed every day which helped escape from the depression but I've just turned 30 and I know I can't go on living with a drug or alcohol dependency. So in December I stopped smoking weed, taking drugs, drinking, got a personal trainer and a counsellor. And after a month I am actually feeling worse. Perhaps because I'm feeling everything rather than escaping now. I have lost almost any motivation for my job, cleaning, cooking or self care. I've avoided phone calls or even messages from friends. I don't want to feel this way anymore and I'm not sure I'm strong enough to continue this constant battle to try and live a normal life. I have every opportunity in front of me, but I'm so depressed I don't even want to follow my dreams anymore. Im thinking life was easier when I was on drugs. I won't kill myself but wishing I was dead when I wake up every morning is not how I want to live my life. I know I'm not alone in my feeling this way but I just don't want to be me anymore. I'm on meds. About to change them but I'm too scared to do it during lockdown as you get worse and I live alone so scared I might actually go down the suicide path if I'm unstable on my meds. Feeling desperately unhappy."

I dont even feel human anymore, i hurt everyone a round me, and obviously they give up on me, and a get it, because i wanna have friends but i hate to socialize, I want to be alone but not lonely, im scared and tired at the same time, it would be so much easier to just kill my self."

451,"Hey everyone, this is mostly to vent. I am an animal person, not so much a person person. When a person dies it does not really phase me but loosing animals is devastating. You guessed it, i lost one of my dogs 3 days ago. I have stayed functioning albeit depressed. About 10m ago my bird died. He was my first and a rescue and had a real special place in my heart. he was thrown away in a box and someone found him, then we took him and he became such a happy bird. We have no avian vets where i live and my research shows it was most likely old age, same as my dog from a few days back. He was ancient too. i still have 3 other birds that i dont know the age of. been typing this forever now, keep stopping. tremors are really bad right now too, usually im on my phone when here but im on keyboard right now. i cant hit the phone buttons. sorry for the abrupt end but im just staring at the screen now not typing anything."

454,"I'm at an all time low and I don't know what to do anymore. I've suffered with depression most of my life but I've been able to manage it reasonably well - only with occasion breakdowns. For context, I quit my job in 2019 to go back to university to finish my masters. I ended up finishing and left unemployed during a pandemic. 

I live with my boyfriend but away from my family. It's been almost a year of job searching and I'm still no where. I've ended up burning through all of my savings and I'm almost left cashless. I feel like I don't have any worth or purpose. It doesn't help that I live in a 1 bedroom flat with no garden, so I feel like I'm trapped inside as well. Every day is the same loop of applying for jobs, doing free work for exposure and trying to stay positive. My boyfriend knows I suffer with mental health but I feel like he's close to getting annoyed. So I keep everything bottled up now. But, I'm sick of just crying most days and putting on a fake smile. I've tried speaking to others, speaking to the doctors, exercising - all the regular stuff. It's not working. I'm miserable and I don't know what to do. 

My ""friends"" just say the same old thing of stuff like ""keep your chin up"" and other stuff. They are just saying whatever they can and aren't that bothered. They never ask me how I actually am because they don't wanna know. I feel distanced from my friends and family - mainly because of the pandemic and I don't know what to do. 

I guess by posting this I just want to feel like I'm not alone."
455,"If someone I know, say at work, starts being nice to me I think they're taking the p#ss. I mean, as if they can't be trusted. People who are nice to you will let you down, because they are after something.that they can gain from you. I find it hard to trust anyone I know, even people I've trusted in the past, who were good to me. 
It's different on here as nobody really knows me, and can't get close. It's hard to explain.
Does anyone else find it hard to trust others for fear they'll end up hurting you?"

I just suffer silently. I have no valid reason to feeling bad. My reasons are too old, they probably are just an excuse to have attention. I don t want to be an attention seeker. 

I just want to sh without consequences, without thinking. But I can t because people say that it s a bad thing to do. Can t I do what I want of my body ? Why do they care ? it s nothing to worry. It s not like I absolutely wanted to die. 

It hurts inside and I can t do anything about it.
I can tell one day that I will not abandon myself in the darkness, and the next day, just want to abandon all these good resolutions. I feel miserable and ashamed."
458,"5 years ago I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. When she was one, I gave birth to another. My life hasn't been the same. I love my children with all my heart and I am the most loving affectionate mother despite my depression. Before children I didnt know what it felt like to be depressed. I was so full of life. Bubbly, outgoing & confident. Now I'm all front. 

The last year has been particularly hard. Especially with being in and out of lock down. My mood drops and then gets better. I find myself wanting to die & then wanting to live and enjoy every moment. I feel unstable sometimes. I'm losing the will to do simple things like house work. I can do the basics but anything more than that feels like effort and for someone who usually finds house therapeutic, it is rather sad. I feel like I am watching life go by. 😔"
459,"i do....very much so.....i currently have no friends but the friends i did have growing up looked down upon me and desserted me.....i remember one time when i was 20 and i met up with a friend in the states.....unfortunately i had a touch of social anxiety then and was quite quiet then....anyway i had to go out with this friend but i also had to mix with his wider circle of friends, people that i did not know.....i was a little socially awkward

anyway, my point is this friend looked down upon me, he was embarrassed of me......anyway since then i haev never heard from him....he distanced himself from me.....i nevar saw him again but i have heard through others that he thought i was a loser....that hurt

anyway all the friendsthat i had from that era all desserted me......i had depression and none called on me or asked after me....that was about 20 odd years ago.....i look back with a little bit of resentment but i try to forget about it

how about you, do you feel looked down upon by former friends, or pepole u know"

I shouldn’t exist. My life is almost entirely suffering. Even simple things I used to enjoy I can’t anymore. I’m so lost and disconnected from everyone and everything. I don’t know what the fuck I’m trying to say or do anymore. I’m a burden to everyone. I’m embarrassed for who I am. I have tried to get help. My respect for humanity and myself has deteriorated. I’m sorry but I have been treated like a sub par, absolute piece of shit of a person my whole life. I can’t even tell you what I’ve been through and what I go through. I literally can’t explain it to anybody. When I do people go, ‘well George is it possible you are blowing it out of proportion?’ Me, ‘if that’s what you want to hear. But that isn’t the truth, so sorry.’ 

I sure hope that God has mercy for people like me when I’m gone. I hope he understands that this shitty hell hole we call life is just not possible for me."
461,"Depression can have moments of experiencing happiness, but it doesn't mean the darkness goes away. I find that I (like others) rely on others to feel happiness, like a drug dealer supplying me drugs.
Living alone, and being single for years, craving to be with someone can add to the emptiness of depression.
I had recently met up with an ex from several years ago, who is also going through depression and a home life where she feels stuck. 
We had spent time together, and our feelings were close, and it was like the first few days of dating.
However the making contact has dropped from her side, so I have given her space. She will reply if I contact her, but is this just her being polite - I never know. I think she feels I let her down in her hour of need, but I did explain the situation to her. Maybe I did let her down, but we have been in contact since then.

I miss her terribly, she is the first person I have let into my life for years.
I know it'll get to the stage where my feelings for her will stop, I realise this. Thing is, I so loved her back then, and my feelings for her started to be rekindled. I think of her all the time. I know I need to move on, and I have begun too, it's just time."
462,"I have hostile extraterrestrials in my body the female spirit has abused me daily sexually, emotionally and physically for about seven years now. She keeps on passing through my head as to kill my spirit I go a blur I don't know how long I will last two years maybe. 
I am miserable most my family have rejected me over it and I have no friends I have no one to talk to, no can do with it because it repeats. I have messaged Ben Wallace uk defence Secretary, Lisa pratt nasa, nasa, seth shostak, seti and the white house with no responses the white house have blocked me. 
People just pass me off as been schizophrenic but I'm not sick of it."
463,"Im at breaking point with him

When i graduated he told me that ""he could have gotten a degree if he wanted to""

When i got a promotion he told me that ""he did better than me with work"" (he hasnt had a job in over 20 years and even when he worked he was always getting fired)

A cousin i wasnt close to commited suicide a few years ago. My cousins mother (my dads sister) was always pretty awful to my cousin but took the buscuit after he died by:
- claiming my cousin didnt have a son to gain ownership of his house
- accuse my cousins fiance in court of causing him to do it
- lied about telling him she wished she had an abortion a little time before it happened
-wrote to a local newspaper saying how close they were and to donate to some charity page she was running but no one knows where the funds are
-got his kids mum fired from work by going in drunk and causing a scene

(The list goes on but id be here forever and she isnt the point anyway)

Tbh she was disgusting. We all understood she was grieving but she completely made a mockery out of the whole situation.

She berated my dad and anyone else who told her she was wronf and my dad wanted me to stick up for him. So i did.

To this day i still get the occasional nasty message off her, not that she gets a reply and my dad has made up with her and is happily letting her name call me.

He now tells me i shouldnt have said anythint even though he did because she was upset (she did stuff like this before but i never denied it was going to hurt her and absolutely would never wish that on anyone)
So now i guess i kinda feel guilty for that too until one of the messages pop up again.

Hes spent the last year on twitter calling the pandemic a hoax and making racist remarks.
He lies about his life and what hes doing on there too.

He also outed my depression on there too. A thing i told him i dont like being in a public place with my name atached (we have a really uncommon last name too so its not like i could pretend we werent related if anyone saw it)

My brother refuses to talk to him since four months ago and since then hes laid it on me like i should fix it. When i tell him its not my business he accuses me of not caring and cant understand why my brother is acting that way when in actuality hes said nastier hings to him than he has me so i cant blame him for not wanting to speak to him.

He brought up the situation with my brother again with me the other day and i completely lost it.

Im thinking of cutting ties because im now getting anxiety attacks when i get off the phone with him and hes exacerbating my depression. I keep thinking about how he doesnt want to listen and its making me really upset.

Everytime i tell him enough is enough he guilt trips me to speak to him again.

I know i need to cut him off but i dont know how to do it when hes like that."
464,"There are so many levels to the way I feel at the moment - anxious, stressed, I constantly have a frown on my face - uni work isn’t getting any better, I still feel like I’m in a loop of feeling like I’ve accomplished all of the work, for them to throw more my way. That’s the same with everyone so that’s not a big deal. I was having a conversation with one of my closest friends the other night, and we were both talking about how shit life is at the moment. They hadn’t ever really opened up to me before, even though we’ve known each other for almost 10 years, but that’s not the type of person they are. They were telling me things, emotions they’d been feeling, how even after all of the help they’d received (professionals, speaking to others, medication), still felt shit. Some of the things they said really hit home to me, because I had been feeling the same way, but didn’t know how to put it into words, or speak it into reality. I mentioned it before but being self-conscious and not feeling like I’m worth much plagues my head. I’m constantly trying to better myself, make myself look good, be happy with my appearance, but I can’t help but feel such extreme negative emotions towards myself. In this conversation, we were talking about how dating apps, or just simply chatting to new people (like at uni) only demoralises the both of us; the only way we saw it was that we weren’t ever ‘good enough’ to be talking to these people, that we were boring/not attractive etc. As bad as it sounds, it was nice hearing someone have the same problems as me, that it wasn’t just my weird brain playing tricks on me. We both shared stories and experiences of having our self-esteem destroyed in front of our eyes, by our lack off confidence. As much as it may not seem like it, I would consider myself to be an introvert. Yeah, sometimes I’m just happy to have left my house so I act excitable, or have had alcohol/drugs which help to forget about the shit stuff and just have a good time. What people don’t seem to understand is the quiet, self-conscious side of me, which weirdly annoys people whenever I act like it in front of them. I have countless examples of times where I’ve gone quiet in social situations because I’m just deeping everything in my head, hating myself, and people act weird about it, saying I’m grumpy and ‘always acting moody’, chatting shit about the way I’m acting behind my back. I get it, mood changes can dampen a situation, and I get it can be annoying sometimes, but without knowing what’s going on inside my head, chatting shit about it really isn’t the best way for me to feel better about it all. I really did value the conversation I had that night; letting each other speak about our emotions, both getting shit off our chest, sharing similar experiences, definitely helped me to realise that these issues are real, and not just some shit in my head. During this lockdown, I have had no distractions, no ways of realising steam. The longer I’m stuck inside with my feelings, the worse it’s going to get."
465,"Reading all of this has scared me even more.
I’m really wondering how many people I’ve met during my life hiding something so big. This society is so messed up. It scares me so much. Everything scares me, so much that I’m 23 and after graduating from high school all I did was 5 months of uni and after that, after more than two years of doing nothing I worked for one year and now I’m jobless again, it’s been a year already.
I can even begin to explain the feelings of worthlessness, guilt, sadness, pain, frustration, obsession, and all the other bad feelings that exist.
I feel like I have been burdened with all of them.
No matter where I am, who I’m with, what I’m doing, I always feel alone. I feel either irritated by people because all I can think of is that they will never truly know me and they wouldn’t even care, so why open up to them? Or because someone has a lot to talk about, that person is even smart and sensitive but I just feel stupid and inappropriate. I’m always scared to find myself in a social situation because the question “What are you doing with your life?” scares the shit out of me. I’m afraid they’ll just think “That spoiled lazy little brat”. What else could they think? 23 living with my parents again, almost finished my savings from the only job I ever had. Doing nothing all day, can’t even sleep anymore. I’m always exhausted and I always have a headache. I cry for so many things and get overwhelmed for the tiniest “problems”. My thoughts are so confusing and so contradicting that I watch tv shows all day so that I don’t have to hear all that shit. One moment I feel so overwhelmed, my heart starts racing, my chest hurts and breathing becomes difficult, all those voices become so loud I just want to hurt myself and make myself stop, I just pray for something to kill me so that I don’t have to do it myself and destroy my parents...next moment it’s like I had a switch and someone turned it off, I feel nothing, complete emptiness. I just sit there in silence, in apathy. And then, sometimes, out of the blue, comes this tiny spark of let’s call it hope, burning, but it lasts just a few minutes before it gets crushed again by self-destructive thoughts. “You can’t do it. You are worthless. You are stupid. You have no interests. Don’t even bother. Look at you, you’re a complete failure. A waste of time energy and money. A waste of space. No one takes you seriously. No one listens to you. What does someone like you have to say? You stupid little shit.” Bulimia has also accompanied me for a few years now. Sometimes the only thing making me feel “better” is eating like a pig but of course the result is a huge feeling of guilt because I feel fat again.
I can’t remember a moment where I felt Free. Where I felt like I was happy and everything would be ok.
I have present parents, love, not in a very affectionate touchy way but they love me. They just don’t understand. And I see how it hurts them. To see me like this. I try to hide it the best way I can but they’re not stupid. My dad has stopped constantly calling me Lazy and stupid, I think it has to do with one of the many breakdowns I had, this time I hid but by mum found me crying on the floor and we talked all night. I think he heard it. But they both still can’t do anything for me. Most people don’t know how to deal with this it doesn’t mean they don’t love you. I shared some thoughts with my mum but not the hardcore stuff because it would destroy her. I feel guilt for not giving my parents anything to be proud of... I know they don’t talk to friends about me, they’re ashamed. Most of their friends kids are in college or doing some serious work. I’m nothing. I wish I was, at least for them.
Sometimes I‘d like to shout until I lose my voice and destroy everything around me. I’m in prison. I’m in hell. And yet even the people that love me the most still see a lazy person, with no talents and no ambitions. They don’t see or don’t want to see all the pain I’m trying to deal with. What do I wake up for in the morning? I ask myself. I truly believe life can be enjoyed, it can be beautiful and full of love. Just not for me. I don’t think I will ever get out of this. I’ve somehow pushed away/scared so many people. I have screwed up all my relationships with my huge mood swings, my obsessions, my big emotions, now I just feel like I shouldn’t even bother finding love, I won’t be able to manage it. Just like I won’t be able to manage anything else in my life. I’m doomed."
466,"Hi, I had a long slow decline in mood over several months last year. To be honest I didnt even realise it was happening until my wife confronted me about it. Unfortunately when she did, part of that conversation included her informing me that she has reached her limit of looking out for me, and that our marriage is probably at an end. This caused my mood to go through the floor.
Almost quit my job through just general despair, but thankfully my boss is a legend and was ultra understanding. Went to my GP and had my SSRI dose tripled to cope. Also was put on temazepam and zopiclone to try and get a proper sleep. Plus, after 10 years of offering, I took a referral for counseling.
Worked from home for a couple of months to limit exposure to extra tasks, and my boss controlled my workload.
Now, 3 days into work after holiday break, I'm disappointed to find myself feeling overwhelmed and jittery again. Can't focus on tasks and the usual strategy of writing out huge detailed 'To do' lists isnt helping.
Feel like I'm letting my boss down after he's been so awesome about the whole situation, so I'm reluctant to talk to him about it.
Damn, that turned into a download!
Can anyone suggest any possible coping strategies?"
467,"I'm a single child, never had siblings. But I always wanted a big sister. Trust me, my mother cares for a lot. But somehow I always wanted an elder sister who'd adore me and love me and take care of me. 

Now I see all these great bonds between little brothers and elder sisters. And after that the sister gets married and hardly gives her brother good time. There are few who communicate daily. But a lot are there who talk once in a few days and for like 10-15 mins.

 I see the brothers getting hurt or losing feelings his sister(natually) and at one point or the bond slowly detoriates and loses most of the love and care. 

They're only there when they need each other(a lot of friends show up when you need them, but a sister should be more special than a friend). 

And all of this has impacted me heavily, whenever I see a girl getting married I feel like someone is losing the great care/bond of his sister. When I see a baby being born and photos being posted by its maternal uncle on social media, I feel like someone has already lost the care of his elder sister. 

I've even started to get annoyed by words such as priority, time etc. Whenever I hear them I picture this whole brother sister bond and get depressed by overthinking an emotional scenario.

I held up with this for a year, I thought it'd slide. I told closed ones of mine, they laughed at this issue. I don't know whats wrong with me, can anyone please help me?"
468,"Hi all, I’m new to the forum and it’s been really helpful so far. This is my first thread! :) 

I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for a few years and have noticed that when I experience happiness (those awesome, bright moments of calm or peace), I tend to undermine it because I wonder if it’s “real”. What I mean is, when I feel joy, I then genuinely wonder if I’m actually happy, or if Im trying so hard to fight the depression that I’m just creating artificial happiness for myself. Like am I actually happy, or do I just want want to be happy, so I make myself do it? I don’t know if I can tell the difference; honestly, I don’t even know if this is actually happening or if I’m just afraid it’s happening. Either way, it’s distressing because it always ruins those happy moments. At the end of the day, I’m over analyzing joy (real or not) to the point of ruining it.

Does this make sense to others? Does anyone else experience this? It sounds weird as I’m writing it but I’ve been wanting to talk about it with others for a while, so I hope it makes sense haha. Thanks all."

470,"Hi, i’m new I found this because i’m online at 1.20am trying to work up the courage to book a GP appointment so sorry if I’m not doing this correctly

My main question is can I book a GP app and talk about symptoms of depression AND anxiety or should I book separate appointments?

Here’s my symptoms, I used to be quite “popular” and really outgoing, around sept 2019 (no triggering event) I started to develop symptoms of anxiety (I think) it started off quite mild, I’d feel extremely anxious going out with friends and often cancel, then by october I ended up quitting my job Id had for 4 years because I felt so anxious every time i walked in, I’d cry for hours before I started and I’d feel so sick while I was there. At college I’d cry outside until one of my friends took me in and I couldn’t go to the toilet or eat without one of my friends so I often came home for lunch instead. Also something that really triggered my anxiety was clothes so I’d wear the same clothes everyday to comfort me which made me more anxious thinking people would notice and think it’s weird. At the moment I have to be escorted around by friends and if they’re not at college I don’t go in. Recently I went to town with my Dad for the first time in almost a year (after repeatedly cancelling and making excuses to not see my friends) and we had planned it for weeks however when we got there I felt so anxious I had to beg him to bring me home, I felt like I couldn’t walk or breathe and I was about to be sick or burst into tears. Often I am awake late at night panicking or feeling stressed/sick at the thought of going to college, I sometimes get dermatillomania and trichotillomani (not by choice i just get so anxious)

On the other hand, this is becoming less of a problem for me as my symptoms of depression mean I barely leave the house. I sleep for at least 14 hours a day and when I don’t sleep I usually just stare at a wall until I fall asleep again, I feel permanently exhausted and like I can’t move at all. I used to have really high goals, I’m almost into med school, but now I just can’t see a future or any point in anything anymore. I used to SH but I don’t anymore instead I binge eat (I know this is not a symptom of depression bc that is lack of appetite). These symptoms bother me more than anxiety symptoms, i can’t get anything done, it feels more serious that lack of motivation bc I am v motivated to get into med school. I can barely concentrate and I just feel fuzzy all the time, nothing feels like it has a point anymore. I’ve had this for a year but it has rapidly become worse in the last 4 months. I feel like there nothing that can be done to help and I think about su*cide quite often almost everyday have really intrusive thoughts telling me to self harm. Also this might not be related but I have like anger? if something really small happens eg my zipper gets stuck, I don’t do well on a test, I burn a meatball, and I’ll spend all week in bed crying and crying about it or I have an angry fit and scream and throw things then almost sleep for a week (kinda like a coma ig)

Sorry if this is not the rihjt way to do things or is too long, I’m just really really needing to reach out


My second questions is I’m not sure if this is sort of normal teenage behaviour (18 next month) or if I should seek GP help? If so should I discuss all these symptoms or make 2 appointments?
Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated  :)"
471,"Hi! I'm a 25 year old graduate student. My life has been in a downward spiral for the last many years. There was a temporary moment of respite but it was ephemeral. I don't feel like doing anything at all. Haven't felt doing like anything for the last decade. Everything I do is to make sure I don't end up starving one day. That's all the motivation left in life. Nothing interests me anymore. Things that I was passionate about in the past don't really arouse the same feelings in me. I have tried therapy before and it hasn't worked. I neither have the patience, nor the monetary resources to continue with therapy. Besides, it will hinder my career prospects and there is a cultural taboo as well. I consciously took the decision to drop out of it cause I felt like I was weakening myself. People around me seem to get a lot of things easily which they take for granted. I hardly have any friends, can't get along with most people and find it really hard to hold down a job. My fucked up mental state ensures that I suck at any new activity I undertake. I don't like living with my parents either. Can't wait to strike out on my own. But all my savings are gone. I haven't been productive for the last many days and there's something really holding me back. I don't know what it is. It's been this way for the last 7 years, at least. I was miserable throughout University but I thought it'd change. It didn't. Uni was a massive waste of mine. Can't see how it could have been any different had I done it differently. Future doesn't look very bright right now. Not like it ever did. I was always told I'd be either mediocre or a failure. Pretty much failed at everything I did. I am extremely frustrated at this point and don't know what else to do. I don't even know what I want in life anymore. I know there are people who have it a lot harder than me but I am not them. Getting through the day has become hella difficult. Pls suggest a way out of this misery. I absolutely resent everyone and everything around me, those from my past and those that will come by in the future. The only thing that gets me off any more is my own pain and seeing others in pain. Spreading misery all around me and poison in the lives of those in my family and circle feels like the only meaningful thing left to do now. Cherry on the cake - I am developing a drinking issue. It was always on the cards but now I it is very much in sight. My physical health has suffered a lot in the last half a decade or so. I no longer feel healthy - mentally or physically."
472,"It should be me. Not my kitty! I failed the poor sweetheart. She was never even allowed to have her own litter of kittens. Her kittens got aborted when she was about to get fixed. Ever since then, the beautiful kitty has never been the same. She never got to be the mother she wanted so badly. She is such a precious sweetheart. She's literally never even hurt a fly. Honestly. She doesn't have it in her to hurt others. I'm wishing I could trade my life for hers. I wish I could somehow give her my ability to have her have her own kittens. I don't want children. We made an appointment to have her put down peacefully tomorrow. We told her it's been a pleasure, honor, and blessing to have her in our lives. My sister has been doing everything she could think to make her passing go easy. We both cried about this. We are still crying. We love and respect the cat so much. May she please rest in peace. She deserves a beautiful, blissful, brilliant after life. In her next life I hope she reincarnates into another female kitten so that when she grows up she can have kittens of her own.

473,"I'm 23, I've always been a creative person, I've never fit in with ""the norm"" or with a crowd. I gravitated towards music and the arts, which is pretty much how I ended up not pursuing a realistic career and got stuck being poor and working a cycle of dead end horrible jobs. The things I enjoy all require energy and creativity, which I have none of right now. I go through cycles of ups and downs, but I've been down for too long this time. I feel inadequate, like a failure no matter what I do. I have a hard time looking at my unfinished projects, because I end up just beating myself up for not being good enough. I'm on the spectrum and can't find enjoyment in things ""normal"" guys my age do. Like video games, TV, sports, etc. None of those things interest me, but I'm just too exhausted and depressed to even do the things I love anymore. I try but the spark just isn't there anymore."
474,"So it basically all started when I got accepted to a talent programm regarding volleyball. I was a bit younger and it was one of the happiest days in my life. It showed me how I was actually good at something and could achieve something great. 
So I started to participate in all the practices that were humanly possible for me, but that didnt come without a price that I had to pay. My social life shrunk to my sports team, freetime was something I didnt have anymore and constant mental and physical pressure were a part of my new life. 

While I put everything into my dream, my family was struggling to keep together. We all had our personal issues and were under a lot of pressure, which resulted in everyone not giving a damn about others and not wanting to come home. I was between 15 and 16 years old and struggling to not break under the pressure that was put on me from my family, school and sports. I always saw what I did wrong because I wanted to improve at all costs, in every aspect of my life. Sadly things didnt go as planned. Multiple injuries that took long to heal from, family problems and intense school phases were mentally exhausting.

But it was just too much to take. Mental breakdowns happened on a weekly basis and not to begin about fights with my brother, mother and my father.
This went on for about 3 to 4 months until it escalated. After a really hard argument with my mom, I just couldnt see a point in life anymore and wanted to end it all. My parents put me against my will into therapy because they didnt know what to do with me. About a month after the incident with my mom, I got diagnosed with a major depressive episode. 

Things got worse and a few months later I wasnt able to leave the house anymore. At the about same time, my father decided to separate from my mother. I would have been more or less coping fine with it, if he hadnt lied to me about it. He was the person I trusted most in this time and he didnt even think about me when telling my mom and on top of that, even lied to me. Loosing my dad in such a manner triggered something inside of me that made me unable to talk to friends or my therapist about what was going on with myself.

I got drugs from my therapist that made me feel numb and I was after half a year able again to go back to school but had to retake the year. I hated going to therapy. I hated having to talk 3 times a week how shitty I feel without any improvement. Eventually I got out of therapy because I acted like I was doing fine again, which led to my family thinking all this would be over.

I knew that this was not over at all, it had just begun. Because I had to retake the year, I got put into a completely new class. I was scared that they would find out about my past and abandon me just like my father did. Somehow I managed to make it seem like everything was good on the outside. I got used to all the negative and suicidal thoughts in my head and just told myself that I was fine and that I didnt need any help because I knew that I would never kill myself.

But with time passing, I read other peoples stories and realised, that I was walking on thin ice with my mindset. Since then I havent been able to talk to anyone what is going on deep inside of me and its all just spiraling out of control. My grades are dropping again and the suicidal tendencies are getting stronger and I just dont know what I'm supposed to do."
475,"Hi there,

This is my first post on a forum, I couldn't really find any information on the internet to help with my specific problem, so here I am.
I'm afraid that being with me is causing my girlfriend to be depressed. We are in love, and have been since basically the beginning, and we still are. But lately, for the past 3 months, she's been absolutely depressed and maybe even manic? I'm not sure really...
So she was assaulted in the summer, while I was away, and that really shook us both up. She had been withdrawn since then, but not visibly distressed. Then, maybe a couple weeks later, she found some pictures of a photoshoot of me and my ex on facebook. I had never bothered to hide them, as they never meant anything to me. She had seen them before, but I guess she had forgotten, and she got really upset. She started to ask me all sorts of questions about my past: what I had done with those girls, how many times, where, every little detail. And I would answer, because I thought being honest was the best thing to do. I know she was distressed and maybe not thinking straight but I didn't want to just make her distressed mind suspicious by denying her the answers. Those past relationships meant nothing to me so I had no qualms telling her about them, in my eyes my current partner is a dream come true: beautiful, exciting, intelligent, I really feel like I've landed the perfect package in her.
So this goes on for a while... 3 months. Every night, she's upset, crying, yelling sometimes, asking for details. She says she feels like she isn't special anymore, like she can't find what is special about our relationship compared to my past. She says there isn't anything that we've done that I had not already done. And she says the reason she feels this way is because I have lied to her. When we first got together we fell in love so quickly, I fell just head over heels, and I said a few times things like ""I've never done this before"" or I've never felt this way"" or otherwise say that we were unique in some way. And it was always true, I think she would just take what I said too literally too much, for example, I think the time that's really burned into both our minds and now causes her much grief, is our first real date. We went hiking, and she had a meeting, but we didn't want the date to end, so I dropped her off, and picked her up afterwards, then we proceeded to go to dinner and then make out all night at the beach. At the end of the night I think I said ""I've never done this before"" and I meant, I'd never been with someone all day, and felt so good, and had such a great time, and in general just never felt or experienced something like this before. And she took it to mean: ""I've never made out in a car""
So there are several things kind of like this, all of which she says she drew self value from, but now that they aren't true the relationship doesn't feel the same, and feels like a lie. 
A month back just about, she was afraid she might take her own life so she checked into a mental hospital. It was so scary and she has a past of self harming thoughts.
I've been telling her, even the things that were similar, they just didn't come from the same place, they didn't have the same meaning, they didn't look or feel the same. And she doesn't care. She cries every night, or yells at me, we talk late into the night and she talks in circles, often rambling, she begs me to ""prove those relationships didn't mean anything"", she says she feels stupid and naive, she calls me a liar, I feel abused and hopeless. Oh and if that isn't enough, we're long distance, but only by like 6 hours, our jobs keep us apart.
She spent winter break pretending to be better for my sake and is now mad at me for not realizing she wasn't okay, I've devoted lots and lots of time to her but it never seems like its enough. It's gotten to the point where we yell at each other, I get mad at her too quickly now. I feel bad because I know her behavior is not normal, she's trying to get help but access to health care is slow going, I want to be there for her but I think just having me around makes her feel worse. Everything I do she says she thinks ""did he do it with her"" or ""he would have just done this for her"". She seems to be getting more depressed, she has crying attacks, calls herself stupid, says its okay because ""nothing matters"" and everyone just ""does stuff and life is just doing stuff"". I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say since so much of her pain is linked to me, and we can't switch conversation cuz I'm right there reminding her of stuff. I know its related to her own inner struggles with self esteem and jealousy but I don't know how to help.

Thanks, I know its a lot, I honestly can't remember everything but I think this is the gist."
476,"Just wondering what anyone else here has to say about DBT therapy and whether is has helped them or not.   Talking to a therapist has never really helped much, even though I SO wanted it to.   I am told it's good that I keep trying, but after 30 plus years of struggling the options to try have dwindled.  Meds, therapy, and even a try at ECT briefly have never helped much.   After getting so frustrated with the DBT my therapist has slowed things down a little and we are basically just talking about how i feel instead of the ""homework"" that goes with DBT.   I'm near the point of just stopping the therapy for awhile.  It's just getting very frustrating and going over and over the same things does not help.     Feeling hopeless does not get better by writing things down, meditating, or taking a walk....   So, anyone else had this happen with DBT?"
477,"Ok.... So this is me reaching out. 
Me and my bf have been together almost 18 months. We live about an hour's drive away from each other, I don't drive so I catch the the train, and we both have kids, mine live with me full time and he has his every other week for the week and weekend. I stay at his house every other weekend and he visits me 1 evening a fortnight but rarely stays over because of getting up for work the following morning. I love the bones of him and he says he loves me. We have both suffered with depression at some point in our lives and I thought that this would help us be there for each other when needed.

In summer my bf was suffering with his mental health, everything got on top of him to the point where you could hardly walk around his house due to the clutter, his huge garden was almost waist height front and back and he could see no way out. He wouldn't let me do any of his chores when I started over because ""it's not my job"", but he finally admitted one night that he was too overwhelmed with everything so 1st thing next morning, I dropped everything, jumped on the train (actually a taxi, 2 trains and another taxi) stayed with him for a week and sorted out his garden (I hate gardening) and helped him sort the clutter and I cleaned, and on my further visits I helped him keep on top of everything while he was getting his head right. 

I am currently suffering with my mental health, largely due to relationship issues (which I'll go in to shortly) and I too have let my house get on top of me and kind of expected the same level of help that I gave to him.... Or at least something close. The help I have received is... Him telling me by message that I need to get up and get my house sorted, a short visit for hugs and a lengthy message basically saying that he's been there, got through it so to ""snap out of it"" and ended ”I wish I was the person you need that will make everything right again.
I'm not."" 2 minutes later an afterthought message of ""but I want to be"".

I mentioned that I'm in a depressive state currently largely due to relationship issues... Well here they are.
My daughter will be leaving for Uni this year and my son will start year 10 so will begin studying towards his GCSES. We have previously talked about maybe moving in together at some point which I've been holding on to and looking forward to. Due to the way things are I would be the one moving, but obviously a decision would have to be made soon because of finding a school place for my son so that there's no disruption to his GCSE education. Well a few things have been said in passing by my bf that made me realise that this is not what he wants after all and the sudden realisation hit me like a ton of bricks. We spoke about it (through message if course because he hates talking about things face to face) and it turns out that he has no intention of letting me and my son move in with him at all.... He's not ready he says. But it won't be until August anyway by which time we'll have been together 2 years. And to me, if you're not ready after 2 years then are you ever going to be? We're both in our 40's after all. I'm struggling with the constant back and forth and him never being there when I need him. So basically the situation boils down to put up with the crappy back and forth for another 2½ years or end things and I don't know what to do for the best. The fact that he doesn't think enough of me at this point to want to make a life with me makes me feel like I'm wasting my time and that I'm just prolonging the inevitable. Oh... Another option (he came up with) is for me to move closer and basically see what happens.... So he expects me to uproot and cross my fingers. I don't know which way to turn, I have no one else, no friends (as my ex's made that impossible), no family. What do I do? I can't clear my head enough to think straight, just sitting around like a zombie, crying intermittently.

Sorry for the long 1st post"
478,"I feel like I am just going through the motions lately. There is an element of routine that is banal and empty. I feel stuck in this rut that I want out of. Like I have become docile and want something to wake me up. I just don't know how to escape this rut. I used to have ambitions and goals. But all that has faded and I don't know where it has gone. If you were to ask me what do I want? I wouldn't know how to answer anymore beyond saying, not this. How do you fix this feeling, escape the rut? The polite autopilot where you say everything is fine."
479,"Hi everyone, its been a year, I have been suffering from depression. I have tried antidepressant but the side effects where horrible. Can anyone advice me on supplements that could assist with depression. 
Thanks all."
480,"Hello I am missing my mom. My mom passed away about a year ago and since then my life changed. I ended up in a group home cause I cant take care of myself alone. I have been in and out of hospitals about nine times. All I do is cry sometimes I want to join her as in taking my own life, I just want her back and I can't stop crying I have screaming spells all the time. I don't know how to help myself getting over this How do I fix mysekf when I can't have my life back,"
481,Think it's crazy for this new normal to continue and for people to be brainwashed or manipulated to think it's just for the best. I just couldn't stand another year of this insanity. The things that are keeping me sane are volunteering and my hobbies.
482,"I am really depressed my disorder is a depressive one.Lockdown is making it a lot worse and I have support but it doesn't feel like it's helping like it usually did.I am either slleping too many hours day and night or not sleeping enough hours.I also have buritis in my shoulder and arm and so am in a lot of pain.I feel so bad I don't want to do anything but I am keeping up with my chores.I have support by text from my sister and I see my niece every three weeks.Apart from them I don't have any friends and I rarely see anyone.I just dischared myself from therapy cos I thought my therapist was incompetent.I have an eating disorder ,I am an overeater and I ate for comfort from depression and she told me to eat to feel better.Also I'm a sugar addict and she said have what you like,'a little bit won't hurt', you don't say that to an addict!Anyway if any of you can think of ways to get me out of this depression I'd love to hear them and would be very grateful.Has anything worked for yous?"
483,"Hello. I'm new here as I have been in denial about my state of health for a very long time. In mid-December I acted on a very irrational decision made in a dark time, believing it was the right thing to do. I became suicidal when I realised how wrong I'd been, and I have been diagnosed with depression. I want to know if there's anyone here who has had a similar experience... And if you have come back from it. Right now, I'm aware that I've caused a lot of hurt and I have burned bridges that it may not be possible to rebuild, and I just feel utterly hopeless. Thank you"
484,"Two months ago, my husband left me. He came from another country to be with me. Once here, he had begun to insult people on the street, characters in TV shows, my family and friends- with such an earnest hatred that it hurt me deeply to hear each and every time. I begged him to stop every time. He began a pattern of not looking for new jobs, or leaving after a short period. He would start college classes and quit halfway through the semester. All of this without telling me. While I worked and went to school at the same time to support us. He would criticize me and get all surprised if I was upset by this. I made so many excuses for him, claiming depression or other mental health problems and that’s why had become the way he was, even though when I met and dated him abroad, he hasn’t been this way. Towards the end I told him I didn’t like the path we were on and I didn’t see us lasting unless we got professional help. After our first session, he started shutting down. I was going to individual therapy at the time and my therapist stated that the patterns she had been seeing for months indicated that he was likely a narcissist and as soon as someone pointed out his flaws he just wanted to run. Within the next month he told me he didn’t love me anymore, he could only be happy alone, and that he wanted to leave. He finally did after I became so tired of begging him to wait for another session, that we could talk things out- I told him “fine, just go.” I moved back with my parents, we lost our apartment- which I had to deal with almost alone except for the support of my angel mother. A week later he was begging for me to come back. He says that his father’s health had been weighing down on him. His father even ended up passing away a month later. I’m trying to be compassionate, because I loved my father in law a lot and I know how much more he loved his   father, but I feel like this is too much. Is it possible this was all depression, or is he a narcissist? Will this keep happening despite himclaiming he will change?"
485,"triggers, I guess..

Feeling very low. very low. A family friend quit. I didn't even see them down.  A family member doesn't have long.  Here I am in these low moods, can't breathe, close to tears, and numb.  Isn't it a mess? I mean if life is short....then why let depression, anxiety and all of that affect ya? But it isn't you who is letting any of those things happen, right? Sometimes I feel like maybe I am doing it, or something.   If I am ""making this up"" why can't I make it go away? I don't do it for attention, I stay in my room, and actively try not to be in anyone's way. I might be rambling, but I am trying to discuss something. I don't know if I am making any sense."
486,"Hiya, Does anyone feel clarity after a depressive  episode. Sorry I’ll explain, I’ve been getting these bad lows that don’t last for long , a day if that, then I feel amazing, like I’m up in the clouds, daft I know. I feel clarity. 
I’m speaking to my Gp Monday, bit worried but better I tell her. 
Does anyone have these mad mood swings?"
487,"I’m going to try and make this short but there’s a lot I need to say so I appreciate it if you do read all of it.

When I first met my boyfriend he told me he had depression but was on antidepressants. He seemed depressed but coping. Fast forward to July this year and he stops taking them for unknown reasons (won’t tell me why) he got pretty depressed for like a month . Went a whole weekend without really talking to me. I’d message him asking if he was alright etc, say goodnight. He would respond but one word answers. It absolutely destroyed me because I felt like I was losing him. I managed to get him to open up and he said something like “I’m just constantly in pain” meaning emotional pain and said he didn’t want to drag anyone down with him. He then posted a load of rubbish on Snapchat like “fuck you” (this is to everyone not me) to “piss people off” I managed to get him talking again and after promising to go cycling with him (he wanted to start again) he seem to “cheer up”.

He came out of it a bit after that but things were still bad. He didn’t say I love to me (first, he would say it back) for a month. This again destroyed me. Then we went out for his sisters birthday and it was like a switch was flipped. He was the happiest I had seen him, so loving and affectionate. We were really happy for about a month. Then November things stated to go down hill again. He has slowly become more withdrawn. It’s even worse this time. He doesn’t tell me he loves me anymore, since last week he doesn’t seem to want to cuddle, or kiss me. I try to make conversation with him and I just get “hmm Urm” a lot of the time. We go upstairs to watch tv and he just lies facing away from me. I ask him if he is ok but he just says he’s fine. He will have patches where he ignores my messages but also patches where he suddenly seems ok both in person and away. He also just seems angry, everything stresses him out and he’s become aggressive (not towards me just things like if there is something in the way he will throw it rather than move it calmly)

The thing that hurts the most though is he has become mean towards me. We have always had a banter filled relationship, and I can take a joke. Often laughing even if it’s about me because I can tell it’s banter. However recently it feels more like he’s just picking on me. I just get insulted all the time and half the time it’s just childish things. For example I’ll say “it’s cold in here” and he’ll go “you’re cold” (he will do this with anything a few examples are “you’re a pole” after mentioning a pole and “you’re a fridge” after mentioning a fridge or sometimes they can be nice like “you’re great”) but then he can take it further. I can’t even think of examples because tbh I don’t care what he says it’s more why he’s saying it. Sometimes it’s straight up insults though. Or I’ll say something like I don’t understand something and he’ll roll his eyes which makes me feel stupid. I think half of it’s done out of banter and he doesn’t get it hurts me and the other half is spite?

I’m just feeling very confused because he can be so lovely and sweet but recently he’s just been horrible. He was like this a few months back too (when he was last very depressed) and I actually realised I wasn’t being very nice to him myself so sorted my self out, and he improved so I thought it was him just retaliating. Guess it was a coincidence. It’s not just me he insults either he will insult his own family members, my family, random people on tv. I can sorta relate because I used to be like this. Just hated everyone, bullied everyone and then suddenly they all left me and I realised I loved them and treated them terribly because I hated myself.

anyway he started his antidepressants again Christmas Eve but seems worse since then? He lives with his grandparents (he’s 23 I’m 21) and they are really concerned. He hardly talks to them. Recently he has just been sleeping a lot too. He also talks about suicide and self harm a lot. We both have alcoholic mums and he was neglected and abused as a kid (not sure the extent he won’t talk about it just said his step dad was abusive and his grandparents adopted him when he was 10) I was also abused and neglected by my mum when she drank so have, anxiety, depression and ocd. He’s generally a very detached person as well, very little friends. Doesn’t know how to express himself. Like if I’m upset he doesn’t know what to say. However as I’ve learnt to read him I’ve learnt other ways he expresses how he cares.

There is probably a lot more I could write but that’s the main things. I’m just feeling lost and confused atm and I’m not sure what to do. He’s my best friend and I love him to pieces but it’s like who he was is gone. I look into his eyes and just see emptiness. I can’t help but feel unloved and unwanted. I’m really scared to talk to anyone in real life about this because I feel like the immediate reaction will be “leave him” which I don’t want to do, not at this point anyway."
488,I don't know anymore. I'm a single mum and the father of my son has not had him for three weekends now. I feel like he's putting anyone else before his son and I can't cope. My mental health is taking it toll on me I even cried when he said he couldn't have our son until tomorrow. Has anyone else been here like me
489,How do I access an NHS care home that has staffing with mental health nursing.
490,"I'm feeling discouraged tonight. I've been missing hugs. I see others who have extended their ""pods"" to include others who live alone. Yet, I live alone and am not in anyone's ""pod"". I just feel lonely and sad. I could really use some encouragement and, if you're into it, I could use some prayers too."
491,"had a severe relapse during the night
was struggling to breathe and kept collapsing
the vet came out this morning and said it would be kinder to let her go as she was a good age and is suffering and has been for four months with all the eye operations and infections

am broken"
492,"yo i dont know who else to talk about this shit to then other depressed ppl. for reference, i'll normally bathe maybe once or twice a month, brush my hair twice a month and brush my teeth once every like 3 months. i change my clothes 2-3 times a month and ive been wearing the same bra for a year. 
i know i constantly smell like shit, and when im around ppl ill try not to get near them as not to bother them. i know its a problem but i cant find it within me to start caring . whenever i take a bath or something it feels like such a big victory.  i dont know how normal ppl can do this shit almost everyday, its like a dream. My sister is always on my ass about showering and stuff, like not in the supportive way where she reconginzes i need help but in the ""u smell like shit lmao"" kinda way. 
does any1 else experience guilt over this? i sure as hell know i do. i hate to bother ppl. but no one seems to understand that i know i should be bathing 2, they always seem to asume im just disgusting and that's that."
493,I feel as if my family depends on me too much and I always make sure other people are happy but they never ask how I'm doing? or what I want? I have to be the one to get a job due to these harsh times and I want to help but I feel as if I'm being crushed. Thanks to the overnight shifts and doing college at the same time I'm exhausted mentally and physically that I just don't know what to do anymore. I haven't been truly happy in a long time and I'm not sure I deserve it or want to be.
494,"I feel like everything I do leads to failure and like the universe has something against me specifically. From life events to just stupid little tasks and everything in-between, I get nothing right while everyone around me gets everything right. Life feels so unfair. It would be kinda funny how everything always happens to me if I wasn't so depressed about it. I feel so so bad. I cried until I threw up. I feel like every time anyone close to me talks to someone new they want to replace me bc I'm so bad at everything and I become more and more depressed so I'm not capable of being fun anymore. I'm so tired. I just need some kind words or a hug but I don't have anyone. And if I get rid of this feeling, new problems arise and I just can't get a break. It just feels like whatever I do, I get a sign that life is not meant for me and I don't belong here"
495,"My Intro gives a rough sketch of me. First time back for a year.

Anyway the last few weeks the darkness has returned. I am seeking therapist help and have a telephone appointment in a few days. I don't find meds help, so haven't asked Dr for any.

For years I have lived on my own as I have learnt others can and will hurt you. I've built that wall to protect myself. Well stupidly I let someone through that wall recently and the hurt came too. Sometimes in the darkness you so want to be felt wanted and not alone that you become vunerable. It's like being hungry, you'd eat food someone threw at you, eat it if they threw it on the floor next to you, and laughed at you. Your desperation for being with someone kills any self respect.

I need to build that wall back, keep everyone out."
496,"Hi, I’m really struggling today, I wish I didn’t have to go through this torture year after year!
I just wanna go to sleep and not wake up, selfish isn’t it.
I’m resentful against ppl who I have to stay here for, they depend on me. I know it’s gonna destroy them if I end up doing what’s going round my head.
I need support from doctors & mh services badly but it’s just not there at the moment. A minute feels like a day.
I can’t talk to anyone about my shit, no one is aware of my struggles, they see me as happy go lucky Barny. They got no idea at all. If I did end my pain, id be a distant memory within a month.
Sorry I’m rambling, ty."
497,"Could really do with a chat/some positive vibes. 

I've had depression on and off for years, was on sertraline for about 6 then doctor weaned me off a few weeks ago. Since then I've been feeling increasingly irritable, low and tearful, and my most recent relationship experience has really pushed me into a dark place.

Some history - I spent 6 years with a very abusive partner who nearly destroyed my life. Very long story and this probably isn't the place, but it was bad, and what caused me to go on anti depressants in the first place. I left that relationship a few years ago and have been wary of relationships since, not least because I wanted to focus on my daughter who is now 18. A few weeks ago a friend encouraged me to try a dating app (bad idea!) and I met someone who seemed really genuine. On the first date he told me he has bipolar, that wasn't a problem. We got on great, he was really keen, calling me every night and treating me well. if anything he was a bit full on and I was cautious, but he was still respectful and nothing physical happened between us (mainly because of lockdown and lack of opportunities!) We went for dinner a couple of weeks ago and he referred to himself as my boyfriend, sent me a text when he got home, all seemed good. Then the next day I suggested we should be in each other's support bubbles so we could go to each other's houses, and that seemed to be the moment that changed everything. Seemed ok at first but that night was the first night he didn't call. Then the next day he said he was ""having a wobble"" and would be in touch when he felt better. 

I spent a week worrying about him, thinking he was in a depressive state with his bipolar. I tried to give him space but just sent a couple of ""checking in"" messages, which he again responded to saying I was ""a really special person"" and he'd be in touch. Another week passed and total radio silence. I tried to research as much as I could about bipolar so I knew how to support him, being mindful of space, but the longer it went the more paranoid I became. Last night I suddenly had a gut feeling to check the dating site we'd met on, to find he'd been active within the past 24 hours and uploaded loads of new photos, including some he'd sent to me over the past couple of weeks. By this point I was a combination of upset, confused and angry, and sent him a message asking to know what was going on - which he of course ignored. This then sent my mind in a spiral of basically madness, and I sent about 20 other messages, all read and all ignored. Because my abusive ex would ignore me for weeks on end as part of his tactics, this has triggered me beyond belief. I know feel all those feelings I had before, all about not being good enough, and I don't know what to do to dig myself out of this. 

I don't really know what advice I'm looking for, but it would be great if someone could remind me this will get better"
498,"I’m currently pregnant with twins and I’ve now had my second panick attack last night because of my husband stressing me out and making me feel so low. He just doesn’t seem to understand the way he comes across and doesn’t care about my feelings. I don’t know how much more I can take.

We basically had an argument because he turned round to me in bed last night and said his best friend was coming over today to walk our dogs as he was passing by. Now bearing in mind that I haven’t seen my best friend since the summer and in this time her dad has died and I’ve become pregnant, I’m desperate to see her and she’s desperate to see me. So I said to him as long as he follows social distancing as they were only going to go outside for a walk that’s absolutely fine. I then asked him why don’t I ask my best friend if she can come over soon for a walk with me so that I can at least see her. His reply was “no I wouldn’t advise that as I’ve seen text messages that you’ve sent each other saying you will give each other a big hug when you see each other again” I told him with the current situation obviously I wouldn’t do that and with being pregnant that would just be silly. He didn’t listen and just kept saying I wouldn’t advise meeting her until after the birth or even maybe in the summer! Oh but it’s okay for him to see his friend whenever he wants while I sit and struggle for months on end not seeing my friend? I don’t know if I’m being silly and overthinking things but to me that doesn’t seem very fair. At the end of the argument he said that’s fine I will text my friend and cancel him coming over tomorrow because your freaking out. I haven’t told him to cancel anything, all I asked was that I would like to see my friend too but he turned it round as if I’m being the bad one.

Also ontop of this I’m struggling at the fact of not only when I’m going to see my best friend next but when I’m next going to see my mum. (I’m an only child and never met my dad so me and my mum are extremely close) I seen her at Xmas and before that it was in the summer because of COVID. My husband seen his parents too. We are planning on moving into a bigger house next week and his parents were going to come down to help us move things and build some nursery furniture in the new house. However my mum keeps asking me if she can come and help us too, I asked my husband and he said he doesn’t want her coming because he doesn’t want to risk spreading the virus. I understand this but he doesn’t seem to understand that it’s ok for him being able to see his parents again so soon and I’ve to sit here while already missing my friend and worry when I’m next going to see my mum. He actually said I will be lucky to see my mum before I give birth in the middle of March because of the virus. I just can’t bear the thought of that and he doesn’t care as long as he is alright and sees his family and friends

The previous argument a few weeks ago that caused me another panic attack was along similar grounds where I felt he was telling me what I could and couldn’t do and I’m now starting to feel depressed and genuinely miserable.

Sorry about the long message but I’ve been struggling for so long and didn’t know who else I could talk to"
499,"Hello to everyone! I'm writing here because I feel the urgency to talk about my suicidal thoughts and can't discuss it with family and friends, as that would be really upsetting for them. However, I've been struggling with these thoughts for a really long time and this has made me almost dysfunctional. I get panic attacks at work, thinking that I'm gonna kill myself one day because I will be left with no other choices. The thing is that I don't love myself, I only live because I have to. Because I don't have the right to inflict so much pain on my family. When I realise that suicide is not an option, then I get really depressed, as I think that I will never escape from the pain. I don't have the strength to get another job or socialise with people. I can't do many simple things, can't consentrate on anything. The worst is that it feels permanent and I feel ashamed of me. 
Thank you for your time reading this"
500,"I don't know how to feel about that. I never hide my real emotions or feelings. If people ask something like ""are you ok"" I always say the truth ""no, I'm not"". Sometimes telling about my suicide plans. That I'm sick of this life and want to end that. Soooo the point is that when I say ""I want to end that, I'm thinking about how to do that"" I always hear ""go ahead"". Or ""if you don't like this life just go and kill yourself"". Or ""you are faking it, if you really wanted so you would go and do that"" or ""you just NEVER had real problems and just stupid"". Or offering me ways how to do that.
Honestly I don't know how to react to that. Sometimes I think they are right, sometimes I want to die more to prove that I'm serious, sometimes I want to live more being disgusted by the entire situation. I don't know. If it's something wrong with people or with me. How to react to that."
501,"Night comes, I have nothing to do, I grab the phone and look around, no one to chat. Any other deals with the same ? I pass time just reading the news over and over, checking facebook over and over, watching this, watching that, until I just get tired and go to sleep. No real chatting with anyone. Theres any other whi also wants to have some chat once in a while ?"
502,"I just found out my parents have lied to me (well they haven't told me the whole truth). They wanted to move into a rural area (well my mum did) which isn't ideal for me due to work. I know she wants me to drop my career and go with them. I don't think she really believes in what I do.
I haven't had the easiest start in my career and have really had to fight for it. Non the less I can't afford rent (not keen on getting a room mate), I've lost of my savings due to covid and ideally, I wanted to save for a house. Its going to take a few years for me to get sorted again.

I know they have been looking to move, well really they wanted a holiday home. Because of what I have been through and losing any sense of independence I had throughout the year, I had a complete breakdown about it because i felt like a puppet with no choices anymore. I'm also very close with them and the thought of them being hundreds of miles away is very traumatic for me (a fear I've had throughout my childhood) After my breakdown my Dad said they couldn't afford to move anyway and they are going to buy a caravan instead. This did bring a sense of relief. Especially in what we are going through now, it took that pressure off and I could just focus on one day at a time.

Yesterday and earlier tonight, I heard them talking about selling the house and how much they could get for it and the savings they had. For a moment I was ok, but it triggered me. I had to hide and cry, I couldn't breathe and then I was sick. My mum found me, I told her and Dad and they assured me they wasn't going to move until I was ok and on my feet. But at the same time my mum is also pushing that we all go.
They keep telling me one thing but I keep hearing another.


I want them to be happy but Im so so scared of being alone. They are all I have. Plus I dont' know when it will happen. I always thought I would have my own small family and my parents would be close by, plus if they get sick or when they are old I want to be able to help them. I wish they were just straight forward with me and let me know what is happening, which I tried to get from them tonight but I got the same answers as before.
It has been a strange couple of months were I feel like I suddenly have to have things done at a certain point in my life.

I have only recently realised the depth of my mental health over the years, and how I have been isn't normal. I was an outcast at school. My final year of college was a disaster, my friends have stabbed me in the back and now this. Past couple of years have been a rollercoaster and how I have been feeling was something I was able to hide up until now. However, now my anxiety and depression have been a lot more severe and the physical symptoms have been worse, everyone around me now knows how I am now too, which I thought would be helpful but it hasn't been

The past couple of years and  what I am experiencing now, has made me feel really bleak about my future. I'm trying to be as mature and as adult as I can be, but I'm really struggling to control my breakdowns. This generally feels like trauma but  I don't know why I'm like this. I just wish I was normal.
My doctor gave me medication, and the pharmacy gave me 5 boxes for some reason. and I know this is dark but I became well aware that I could overdose on them. I don't want to commit suicide, but it was a thought I had I wish I wasn't here. Sometimes when I'm really low, I wish someone would tell me that I had a limited time left. Which I know is really selfish of me.

I am getting help soon. I really do wish I wasn't scared of my future and could go with the flow of things. But what I heard tonight triggered me and I wasn't expecting it to. When I heard what they said, I was fine for like 2 minutes and then I really broke down and wasn't able to stop crying for the rest of the night.

Does this sound like trauma to anyone else, or any root causes as to why i could be like this?

I'm sorry this is so long and rambly"
503,"Im going to try and make this post as concise as possible. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and severe contamination OCD. Ever since Covid began I started sleeping a lot. Now, almost a year in, I am sleeping for 16 hours usually at a time. Ive slept for 2 days a few times (not straight thru but with a couple of wake ups in between). This is making my depression much worse. I have no motivation to break my sleeping issue and nothing is helping me. On top of this all, I have severe contamination OCD where I wont touch things without a glove and anytime i touch something i wash my hands vigorously. My moms on my case and doesnt understand that I cant help this bad routine I am stuck in. Ive been in therapy for awhile now, it is not helping. I want to stop going and some days I cant seem to find the bigger picture to all this. I dont know what to do or where to turn. Nothing excites me. I am beginning to think even my small circle of friends dont care. I am angry at the world. I dont want to keep struggling in a world where everything is based on me trying to survive my mental illnesses. Some days I want to just move away but then ill have even less human interaction than i do now. Please help"
504,"Hello,
I suffer with anxiety and depression.
At the moment it's more my depression. I feel terribly low and it's really not a good feeling!
I'm experiencing some despair as well which is also not a good feeling!
I've suffered with anxiety and depression for so long, i often wonder if I'll ever be okay.
I know it's a cliche but i just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel."
505,"Hi, Folks.

I thought that some of you folks might already be feeling apprehensive about how alone you might already be, or how all-the-way lonely you expect to be, starting on Christmas Eve and going through Christmas Day to, who knows?...New Year Eve/Day. Maybe, starting this thread would be helpful to any/all who feel so moved and would like to share thoughts, and listen to woes, about this period.

Either way, here it is, if you're happy to use it!

I'm alone every year, come this period: I live alone! I eat alone! I watch films and TV alone - I'm just kinda.......alone! 

What are your own circumstances?"
506,"Ever since my Dad passed in February 2015, I have had both depression and anxiety. It was in late 2017 that my mental health got severely bad; my only sister passed on christmas day 2017.
I was extremely close to her, not only was she my sister but also my best friend. We use to talk everyday in one form or another; I would see her most days a week and I miss her so much. I am completely lost without her.

Since being diagnosed with mental health issues in 2015, my M.H has gone through periods of severe to moderate. Lately though my M.H is at an all time low; but I also think covid is not helping in the slightest.

For quite a while now I have such a problem at bedtime. I either cannot fall asleep or I have trouble staying asleep; pretty much waking up every single hour. The doctor gave me Amitryptiline (a Tricyclic antidepressant) to help me sleep; they don't help with sleep and make me feel really out of it, like i'm disconnected from my body. I have stopped taking these and I am being put back on Prozac. I have tried CBT, wellness apps and other forms of non medication therapy; but for me the only way I can feel any form of normality is to be medicated. I am only 35 however, I really don't want to be medicated for the rest of my life but I cannot see anyway out of this hell without it.

Anyway that's a bit of background. The main problem that I have is that at the times when I can sleep for any length of time, I keep seeing my deceased sister in my dreams. The dreams are not bad, but the fact I see her gets me down and causes me to think about it non-stop for days. Its like she is constantly there, but unfortunately for me I cannot take any comfort from it.

I do feel extremely guilty as I went to see her in intensive care on the christmas eve; seeing her like that I completely broke down and just couldn't stay as I was a complete wreck and couldn't gain any composure back. I never got to say goodbye properly and tell her I loved her as she died early christmas morning before I could get back to the hospital. I've hated myself ever since.

I wonder if the guilt I feel is why I keep seeing her in my dreams?"
507,My life is about to change. Just wish I could turn the clocks bck
508,Is it normal that my bf goes out for 8-9 hours straight and sends me a short message after 4 hours or so.. and when I say that I don't think it's okay for a taken man to be out this long and frequently he says I'm the problem cause I'm not understanding enough. Can someone please tell me if I am crazy or not.
509,"my dad used to make my mum do things she didn't want and i could hear from the other room

510,I am satisfied with what I tried to accomplish. There is nothing that interests me. No one who loves me. No one I love. Think it's time to go. Why not go out on your own terms.
511,"I was talking to my husband about missing my old job which was looking after people with severe brain injury, anyway he made a comment I'm surprised you liked that job as you are not very caring.

Not that I'm very positive about myself but that is a word I would of used of to describe me! 

It's made me think now maybe I'm not as caring as I first thought 😪"
512,"Hey there,

I have been struggling on and off with long spouts of depression for a long time. I have a lot of people that care about me, and it makes me just feel really guilty for wanting to end my life. My mum brought a house with me with my father’s inheritance and is working on buying another house and if I kill myself now I know she will have to leave work, she also struggles with depression and I worry it might trigger her to kill herself and then my brothers will have to deal with everything. I do believe if she could keep living it would actually be better for everyone in the long run, they could keep the house for instance or use the money from it to cover my costs. That wouldn’t be so bad. I don’t want to be a further burden on them but this is what I need. I can’t keep acting through this life. I know everyone is going to say there is a way to feel better but is it really so bad that I don’t want that? I have been isolating myself to make it easier, so people are used to me being gone. I guess the scariest thing is I don’t want to fail and end up a vegetable and they won’t kill me even though it’s my choice."
513,"There are a few however one at a time would be helpful.

516,"How to make them again. Over the past few years, I’ve pushed them all away due to anxiety and depression. I have nothing interesting to talk about because I don’t DO anything interesting other than work and sleep."
517,"I'm a 25 M, if that matters. I've always had trouble in social situations for as long as I can remember, but over the past five years or so, that's gone from me having just one or two friends to complete isolation, no matter how hard I try to break out of it. 

Most of the time, I'm outright told I'm ""too awkward"" or ""too weird"" to be around. This has happened in multiple situations from work to school to even church and support groups. I'm not trying to be awkward but for whatever reason, I've come off to the large majority of people as awkward. I've never been able to figure out why despite nearly six years of therapy with three different professionals.

It's not for a lack of trying, I often try to put myself out there and meet people. I've joined church groups, gone to bars, sporting events, even internet meet-up things based around some common interest. I've either connected with no one despite approaching different people, or the group has outright asked me to leave because I'm too awkward. What's really pushed me over the edge was back in February of 2020, I was in a support group for social anxiety...and the leader of said group asked me to not participate anymore ""because you're just too awkward.""

I don't really know what to do at this point. I don't have any friends, my parents are not very understanding of anything related to mental health (every time I try to express my feelings to them, I usually get berated by my dad to just ""get over it""). With COVID going on, I now work entirely from home, so I can't even go to work for some minimal social interaction. I haven't spoken to or texted anyone besides my therapist since July, other than various failed attempts to be social. It's gone from occasional feelings of isolation and sadness to severe and overwhelming feelings of loneliness and depression that seem like a crushing physical weight on me. I can't think of anyone who'd even be upset it I were to disappear, so suicide has really been on my mind lately. Mainly because it would end the overwhelming pain I'm feeling, and from my interactions with people including my family, I don't think they'd care that much either.

518,"As we get closer to Christmas, I can’t help but see so many people’s happiness on social media. At the same time all I can be is sad during these times. It’s not that I’m not grateful for a lot of what I do have, because I am, but I’ve also lost a lot of family over the years. My dad deals with mental health issues and alcoholism and hasn’t talked to me in over 2 years and the last thing he told me is that he never wanted to talk to me again even though I did nothing wrong. I still have a good relationship with my mom, but she’s always super depressed during Christmas time because my brother died two days after Christmas over 30 years ago. My sister seems to have it all together during the holidays because she has a dream life with a full family of her own and children living in a big fancy house. At the same time I don’t even own a Christmas tree and have a very tiny circle of people around me. I’m just a Scrooge during the holidays and wish that they wouldn’t exist because they really do negatively affect me. I’m trying to be grateful, but I look at the state of the world right now and can’t help but think of how much despair and sadness there is out there. How can we all possibly be “joyous” if hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives this year to a virus? Shouldn’t we all be mourning these losses? I don’t know, I’m just venting.

I genuinely do hope everyone’s holidays are going well, I’m just feeling a bit bitter and in my head.

thanks for listening."
519,"Been on fluoxetine for 32 days and still not feeling right , is this normal?"
520,"So I've been suffering from mental health issues for a while and im sort of at a loss. I have a few issues that Im struggling with


I have pretty severe but varying depression and I was diagnosed with dysthymia. I often think of killing myself and how I would do it but I feel confident that I would never act on it. I had a bad episode a few months ago that prompted me to start therapy again. I can't say I've had a particularly difficult life and I struggle with the idea of being depressed because I feel like I have no reason to be depressed. I do this despite knowing that its an imbalance but I can't help it.
I work in a creative industry and have little to no creative drive until im in the thick of a project that determines my livelihood. Independently, I am rarely artistically motivated which is something that has grown more problematic within the last few years. Overall I feel indifferent to almost everything. This leads to some pretty heavy self destructive thinking because I see colleagues becoming better and better as I remain stale.
I have an incredibly hard time focusing. Even writing this, I'm thinking about a million other things. My mind feels like its in a haze and I constantly forget things. I have a hard time completing tasks and its fucking up my career, my relationship and life overall.
Occasionally I tend to fixate on one thing - can go hours without drinking water, eating etc - psychiatrist described it as a manic episode but not sure I agree

I have tried so many things to try and deal with these issues so ill just go through what I've tried and maybe someone can recommend something.

Physical Activities


Tried running in the mornings (stopped doing because of weather)
meditation (inconsistent on this)
yoga (inconsistent on this)

Lifestyle Changes


improved sleeping habits (recently got worse)
Therapy bi weekly (last 4-5 months)
psychiatrist monthly (last 3 months)
Trying to learn a language (failing miserably)

Dietary Changes


Mostly Vegetarian diet- only occasionally eating fish
Gluten free for celiac
way less drinking - used to be a few 6 packs a week. Now about one or two 6 packs a month
Improved eating overall - lost about 25lbs in a few months
Multivitamins

Medicinal approaches (self prescribed)


Nootropics
Kratom
Mushrooms (this was the best performer but didnt try it long enough because I ran out)

Medicinal Approaches (psychiatrist prescribed)


Buproprion XL (low dose then increased dosage - felt absolutely nothing)
Adderall ( was concerned about taking it regularly)
Pristiq (about 3 months in - not feeling very different)
Concerta 18mg ( few weeks in - same)
15mg L-Methylfolate ( yeh nothin)

So these are all things I've tried over the last few years and I really haven't found anything that helps much or that I notice offers much improvement so I'm just frustrated. I'm not really sure what to do. I'm pretty tired of feeling like this and I really don't know whats wrong with me so just wondering if anyone out there could recommend anything or offer any suggestions. I appreciate any help."
521,"Ever since I was in a car accident I’ve just been... better off mentally and emotionally. Despite getting fines and damaged car I just.. I expected to be wrecked but I feel so much hope and appreciation for life. 

I was rear ended while going 62-64mph. The man who rear ended me was going about 80-85mph claimed full responsibility, he admitted to distraction. I’m still getting a dui. I feel like from here I can start my whole life and outlook over and it’s exhilarating. It’s hard. It’s still hard and there have and will be some very hard days but I feel I have a good chance to make it."
522,"Hi, All.

I wish for you to have a fabulous New Year!

523,Anyone watching and upset by this?
524,"Hi everyone

I've been on 20mg of Citalopram for 17 years. My mental health is stable while taking this and a few times over the years I've wondered if I still needed to be on it and I've tried to wean off it but have had to go back on it due to my depressive symptoms returning.   Due to this my GP was of the opinion that I should stay on it long term which I was happy with. 

18 months ago I moved to a new town with my husband and my new GP surgery have a very different view. They are very much of the opinion that you shouldn't be on antidepressants long term. Soon after registering with them I was contacted and asked to go for a medication review. At the appointment I was basically told I had been on it too long and needed to come off it. I told them I wanted to do it slowly due to my previous weaning attempts which I believe were done too fast so I was told to reduce from 20mg to 10mg for 6 months then stop completely. I was fine for the first couple of months then my depressive symptoms returned again. I tried to stick it out but after a couple of months of feeling miserable I went back to the doctor and was told to increase my dose back up to 20mg. I did this and within a few weeks started feeling better. After I had been on the increased dose for 6 months I was contacted again and asked to go for a medication review. Again at the review I was told I needed to try coming off it again and was given the same instructions as last time. Again, within a couple of months of lowering the dose my symptoms were back. I felt low, lost all interest in things I usually enjoy, was tearful, moody, irritable, I started having suicidal thoughts. Back I went to the GP and again was told to increase my dose back up to 20mg and was told it will be reviewed again in 6 months. 

Each time I see or speak to a GP it's someone different, I've never seen the same GP more than once but they all seem to have one goal, to get me off antidepressants. I can't keep going through this every 6 months, increasing then decreasing my meds so after the last appointment I decided I was going to try and see it through and get off it completely. I did contemplate changing surgeries but how do I know that the next surgery won't have the same view? I don't want my happiness to depend on a someone else and whether or not they write me a prescription. I want to, if I can, manage without medication. 

So after my last appointment which was around a month ago, instead of increasing my dose back up to 20mg, I reduced from 10mg to 5mg and have been on this dose for 3 weeks.  I have good days and bad days. I definitely feel down and I don't feel like doing anything and don't really have any motivation but I've been pushing myself to do things like exercise and meditate. Some days I feel ok although I'm definitely more moody and irritable then usual and some days I feel really low and tearful. 

I've been on antidepressants for 17 years so I know it's going to take a while for my brain to adjust and settle down. I do wonder how much of how I'm feeling is due to the fact I'm withdrawing from these drugs and how much is actually a return of my depression. I've been reading online about antidepressants discontinuation syndrome and wonder if this is what I'm experiencing rather than my depression returning.  I feel like if it's just the withdrawal process and I know it will ease eventually then I could see it through.  

I just wondered if anyone has any experience of coming off antidepressants after a long time and what your experience was?"
525,"Hey guys! I was prescribed nexito 20 mg 3 years back ,took it for a month then quit it.Again took it after few months before stopping again. I've been doing this for quite a while because I feel antidepressants are hoax and that there are other ways to feel better . Please someone help me clear my doubts on medication. Are they irreplaceable?"
526,"So I don't often talk about my depression on this forum. I like to help people and I can often use my experiences dealing with OCD to encourage others on their journeys. But while I've done a great job tackling my OCD, I can't seem to beat my depression.

They are quite different actually, with one being a surface-level fear and the other a deeper dissatisfaction with life based on low self-esteem, fractured trust, and a lack of a strong community.

I have my good and bad days as we all do. I've met a great friend on this site who I talk to constantly. And I've ventured into online dating as well, making a couple of friendships that way too. But all online. And even though I have more belief than I used to, it goes away so easily and I end up crying in my bed.

I think about suicide almost every day. You don't have to give me the websites or the calls; I know what sources are available. I also get therapy and that's been a big help.

Really I think I just posted this because I want to know your experiences while relating my own. Can you tell me about your depression? How do you cope?"
527,"First of all, sorry for not being able to express my ideas in the best way possible because English is my second language and maybe if it was my first one, that text would be more clear.

I think there are only 3 paths we can choose. At least for me personally there are only 3 paths I can choose. The first one, and that's the one I've been living for the last years, is the path where you just stay here alive but not living at all. It's when you let it be whatever it is, you are struggling but whatever, you are feeling pain but you don't really do anything to get better, you know your routine and habits are trash but it is what it is. Maybe you try something new to change but it is too hard and you just give up immediately. That's path 1, that's the one I've been living my life and I think it is hell.

So, the second path is when you are actually living your life, maybe not happy yet but at least there's something inside of you that makes you do stuff, that makes you be functional, something that drives you. It's when you are working on yourself and see results and you are growing and finding meaning in life. So that's the path I want to take, that's the one I'm planning to start this next year. That's the one I remember living for a few years in my life when I was younger. That's path 2.

Then there's path 3, It's when you can't stay living on path 1 because it is too painful and you finally understood that you don't have energy, motivation, time, will, anything to help you take path 2. So path 3 is ending it all.

So, guys, I'm going to make my last decision, I'll try path 2 next year, I'll try to do my best, but if I finally understand that it is impossible for me, I'll choose path 3, because living right now on path 1 is like hell, it's too painful, it's not a choice anymore."
528,"recently, particularly today, i have felt like no one understands me at all. i’m rly close with my mum amd we usually always confide in each other but sometimes i feel like she is judging me (even tho i’m sure she’s not).

just over a year ago my dad died to cancer when i was 17. at the time i was isolating myself from friends and missing so many days amd weeks of school that i had to move down a year. luckily i had managed to strengthen friendships before moving down so i could still hang out with my friends at break, lunch and free periods. however due to covid i have been completely isolated from them. i now don’t see them at all because of lockdown-can’t meet up. i now just hang by myself in the art block all day not talking to anyone but the teachers. 

because i’ve been feeling so so depressed i reached out to a friend of mine who also lost her dad to cancer around the same time my dad died. i can really relate to her and we often feel the same way about things but recently she hasn’t been to well (mentally) at all, so i have no one whatsoever to talk to. 

sorry this is such a long msg but i was wondering does anyone else feel like no one in the whole world gets them and they’re just so alone."
529,"Hi!

I'm new here. I was looking for such space because I've been suffering from depression and because of the coronavirus I'm left without psychological help I used to get.

I'm a single mom, divorced, in a long distance relationship for last 4 years. Me, my son and my partner were supposed to finally move in together and start our life this year. He was supposed to come in April and sign his work contract. But covid came. My partner lost his job, got stuck for months in foreign country and fell into depression. Since he's pilot, there's no job for him now. 4 months ago he broke up with me because of his really bad mental health. We've been talking all this time, we really love each other. But we are both depressed and can't see the way to make things work right now. We don't have energy.

He is my best friend, but because of depression, he is not really himself. Neither am I. Today is my birthday and I feel really bad, I can't stop crying. I feel very lonely. We haven't seen each other for a year, I haven't been seeing anyone here either. I miss feeling loved, feeling like someone cares. 

Everyone tells me to focus on myself and my son. But I don't know how to do it. Last years were filled with dreams and being a family, having a life together, my son having a good male figure in his life. Now I feel lonier than ever. And with no purpose. 

I'm a freelancer and right now I have no work. No income. 

Also, I have asperger's syndrome. I struggle to build strong connections with people. So I don't really have friends and I hardly leave the house. I do journal to vent but it's not helping today.

I never imagined a person could be so broken hearted. Everyone was saying it's gonna get better. But it's been 4 months and I keep crying. I wake up with tears running down my cheeks. I keep checking the time and I just wait the whole day to go to sleep so the day would finally end. 

I had suicidal thoughts but I couldn't do it to my son. And I wouldn't even know how to end my life.

Parenting with depression is such a hard work, impossible at times. I don't want my son to see my like this all the time. 

I don't know what to do. I just want to feel better. I just want to feel normal again."
530,So I’ve been depressed and suffered from PTSD for 10 years now seen more therapists than I’ve had sliced bread but I’m always alone I don’t have many friends and my partner will never understand the feeling of loneliness I’m wondering as I come up to spending another Xmas alone not seeing anyone if taking my own life would be the best thing to do to free me from this pain It’s all planned out but am I being selfish would anyone actually miss me cause I feel when I’m alive now I’m not important to anyone so what’s the actual point in living with pain
531,"I've been on my meds, setraline for almost 3 months now. I've noticed if I take it late in the day (ex. no more than even an hour late/ not on my exact scheduled time), my brain feels shot and numb. My eyes hurt and almost feel dry and my mood is super low and I feel extremely agitated and restless. I don't know if this is normal? I take my meds in the morning. Again even if its half an hour or even an hour late is it normal to have such an extreme reaction???"
532,"Hey, depressed as hell again. Per usual. It does help having someone to talk to one on one though if anyone wants to message me on discord and hear me out it would be nice thanks.

533,"My psychiatrist diagnosed my severe major depressive episode as characterised by agitation. I am in recovery with help from lots of medication. I feel the darkest moments of this episode are behind me (I hope), however the agitation persists relentlessly.

I have a feeling of discomfort in my chest and it makes me twitchy. I don't know how to describe it but it is entirelly pyschosymatic. I keep needing to rearrange my t-shirt and spend most of the time with my hand on or over my chest. I cannot relax or sit still properly. I sit the only way I can in a really bad posture bent forward which is ruining my back. I also feel the need to be occupied constantly, which is not easy when depressed. I find it impossible to ignore. I’m desperate for my mind to let go of this.

Anyone else dealt with anything like this? Does it stop?!"
534,"I have no energy to do anything no matter how much I sleep, I can sleep 8 hours during the night and still have to take a long nap in the afternoon. Nothing I have tried seems to help, I have tried caffeine and all different supplements but nothing seems to give me the energy and motivation I need to get work done. It really makes me feel like a lazy failure and I struggle to get any tasks done during the day, even little things like showering and getting dressed."
535,"I've had problems with my mental health for years. I was sectioned at 14 with anorexia and fostered out shortly after. My parents neglected me and my relationship with my mother is particularly difficult. I stabilised for around 14 years when I was in a relationship. I managed to get a flat and a job and although life felt boring it was stable and predictable. My ex was obsessed with the x box and weed and I started to feel very lonely in the relationship as he would play online with his mates from the point of coming home from work. We never went out or had holidays and when my pet died u started going out. My ex didn't seem bothered about this as he was able to stay on his console. I cheated on him a couple of times. I never thought j would do this to anyone but I got to the point where I didnt care. Eventually j met someone online and finished the relationship. In hindsight this was a massive mistake. I didnt know the new guy that well but gave up all I had built up in order to move down with him. It soon became obvulious that the new guy was lazy, selfish and a drinker but because I'd invested so much in the relationship idug my heels in. The last year has been awful. I was living in a hostel in order to gain accommodation but covid stopped everything. The new guy was becoming more verbally and emotionally abusive, saying im ugly and I make his skin crawl. Im a psycho and its no wonder my first boyfriend beat me up and my family don't want to know me. Hes never been massively affectionate and his drinking steadily increased. There have been a few incidents now where he has become physically violent. He says j look old and j have a saggy but. I have no confidence at all and I've developed a massive complex about how j look. I have no where I can go though and I feel trapped"
536,"Hi, I'm new on here so this is my first post.

Is anyone else a really jealous person? To the point where you will do crazy things just to get attention, like stop eating, when you feel that someone else is in the spotlight.

My husband got sick Christmas eve, and, I don't know why, but I got really jealous because I knew everyone was going to be focusing on him. I know it sounds so childish and petty. I feel like I have 2 brains, 1 is telling me that all this is stupid, and the other one is telling me that if I get sick, everyone will want to pay attention to me. Unfortunately, the crazy brain is the one that is in control right now. I haven't slept, or eaten since Christmas Eve and I just keep google-ing ""how to get a fever"" 

I just don't know how to make it stop. I do this with everything. Whenever someone gets any kind of attention. 

Thanks for any and all advice"
537,Last night I was feeling down and went to bed early. I kept waking up and couldn't stay asleep. The last two nights I slept well though. I have no idea what to expect with this anymore. Sometimes it seems like you're doing good and other times it's a struggle.
538,"Holidays are very stressing. Dont have money to make a travel. The weather is burning hot, and I stay just inside the house, doing nothing.

So its ""yay, holidays, time to think how much I would go to other place but dont have money to do it"".

Havent have proper holidays in 7 years, and before that didnt have good holidays either.

And being honest, I havent live life and enjoy it since ever.

Yesterday night I dreamed I was swimming, lot of times Ive been dreaming this, because its something I would like to do, also would help me phisically, but its just that, a dream."
539,"Hello all,
I'm not sure if this is the right forum to post, but perhaps someone can help. I am a single mature student who lives with their elderly father. He has multiple medical conditions including diabetes and had his third heart attack three days ago. I have some medical problems myself. This has included severe anxiety and I am paying for sessions with a psychologist and desperately want to resolve the issue. The trouble is all health providers take it for granted that I am on hand to see to everything, to take my father to appointments, to deal with situations as they arise (this is very disturbing for me -and I have already spent twenty years looking after my mother). The physical and emotional impact on me is usually disregarded. My father's consent is required for any outside help and no social services assessment are being conducted during the pandemic in any case. Any suggestions?"
540,"I'm a SAHM/Housewife 
I spend most days doing Cooking Cleaning & Taking care of My Kids. I read a lot in my spare time. I may sew Sometimes. Garden a Bit.  Whatever I could do to pass the days. As I said before I'm usually an Issue for someone in my family. If I speak for my rights Its a Problem. I don't say anything & Let a Fool Make a Fool of themselves, still a Problem. 
Now my husband was talking with me & he told me As I'm home I haven't Acquired Any Skills..... that Hit me really Low..... I've done a lot of self improvement over time. I've done hands on sales with a Micro business we had. I suck TERRIBLY at Math, I gained confidence in Checking Money etc.
I've felt less socially Awkward, gained confidence in Meeting & Greeting people. Well maybe those things ain't even ""accomplishments"" anyways. What can I do to acquire more skills at home??..... 

I just feel like I have to race against time to do what everyone says. & not do me for me on my own accord. I put everything behind my back until my children have reach a certain age  my son is now 5 & my daughter is going to be 2. So that's good adjustment for me to start to do what I like to get a career. Is there anything to suppress emotions? Because I can't seem to control it & it's a bother for people."
541,"I feel like shit. I am hated and pathetic. No one likes me, they all hate me and take the piss out of me. I am completely worthless and an embarrassment. Sorry all x"
542,"I just need someone to talk to
No one understands and when I have tried to open up to someone all I get is .. itll be ok. You'll be ok. 

I'm stuck at the moment and getting mentally abused at home. 

I literally have no one that cares about me or will talk to me. 

Cutting a long story short.. I'm in love with someone that mentally abuses me and I know in my head its wrong... but I have no where to go and am scared of leaving"
543,I am trying to figure out the best way to ask my job if I can come in late tomorrow so I can go to therapy. I don't really want to tell them I am going to therapy but I also don't want to lie. This appointment was made very last minute because I need it very badly. it is tomorrow at 9 am. I don't know what to do.
544,I am dying inside.
545,"I’m sure we all have flakey friends that come and go throughout our lives. I seem to have many of those and only one real trustworthy friend. I don’t think I’d like to be popular but I don’t like the feeling of being used as a subject of pity. I’ve known this person, I’ll call her MB, for close to 20 years. We met in our teens and dated a short while before deciding friends would be best. I was upset by this and expected it to fade away but to our credit we did achieve a good friendship for a few years. Things eventually become distant and we turn into the classic Facebook friends, just liking the odd thing and a few messages and comments a year type thing. Anyway lots of time passed until she put a post of Facebook about depression and how she’s always happy to listen to friends with problems. I was going through a bad time then after having a break up and a few other issues so I opened up to her. We met up a few days later and she revealed her recent problems and it was great to have a real life conversation with someone, I think we both got something out of it. We met up a few more times and spoke on the phone and I thought we were helping each other out. Then she met a guy. I was happy for her but from that day on she blew me off. That brought back the depression and anxiety about talking to people. We stopped speaking for a while then she messaged me with an apology. She offered to meet up then cancelled. Same a few days later. I told her I was ok and we’ll catch up one day. She knew I wasn’t ok but just got on with her life with her new guy. I tried reaching out two more times before giving up. I haven’t spoken to her for a year now. The point of this is, if you want to be a shoulder for people and help them, then be sure to keep that promise or at least be honest if you can’t. I’m ok but I can see this affecting some people very negatively. Are these sort of people common? I think posting a message on Facebook is almost like a badge of honour to attract likes rather than actually helping people. Has anyone else ever had a person like that in their lives?"
546,"Hi, everyone who's reading this post. 
I have mentioned this before, I self isolated myself from all human contact as posible. 
Deleted all social networking accounts and haven't gone back at any of them.  
I have a weird thing where I have a strong feeling some day that I should talk to someone, make friends, maybe even try a relationship, of course my head says that when I'm not on a strong depressed day. However, I can't keep contact or keep a chat with someone and sometimes I just stop replying. 
So, trying and failing makes me not think about it for a while, but maybe a few months later i find myself trying again. 
I know is a bad thing to not have friends. 
I know is a bad thing for a depressed person to not be open with people of their feelings. But I try. 
Not everyone understands how deeply I'm into this and at the same time when they think they do, they don't either belive or understand the level of effort I put into making me stay alive. 
I have found support here on the forum and I really appreciate it. It has been helpful for me. 
And at the same time, makes me feel way too alone. Just refreshing the page hoping to see someone making a conversation with me, and i believe that's pretty bad."
547,"I do.

Even as a kid I would feel sad when all the decorations got taken down, tv went back to normal and everything else as well went back to normal. 

Normally I enjoy Christmas, I hardly look forward to anything anymore and I think it is a protection mechanism. This year, I was not bothered at all, I thought December went by really quickly, but even not ""feeling"" Christmas I still feel low and emotional that it is over. 

Does anyone else feel the same?"
548,"i dont know whats wrong with me. all i do is lay in bed and the only time i get out of bed is to daydream. i pace back and forth and talk to myself while listening to music. i have so many assessments to do and its my final year of highschool yet i have no motivation to do anything i have nothing to look forward to and the course im applying for isnt what i want to do because i dont like anything and i dont see myself working at all i put off all my work and lay in bed all day and im not sure whether this is me being lazy and faking my sadness. i just want to live in my daydreams and in my daydreams ive created a perfect family that is entirely different from my own and ive started slowly preferring them over my own family and it makes me feel guilty and ungrateful (im not delusional i know they dont exist) and makes me feel even worse ive gained so much weight from overeating and i hate my body but i cant stop eating even though i hate eating. i feel like im never ever getting anywhere in life with my poor work ethic and lack of self discipline and it makes me feel like a failure
i jusr wanted to get this off my chest"
549,"I need to see how I can help my partner. He is currently suffering depression, he admits this himself and says he knows he needs help but keeps putting it off. I’m desperate for him to seek help now as it is affecting his ability to be a parent. We are currently living apart but I want him to come home badly.
I try to talk to him but he feels like i am to blame for all of his depression, it’s because of me he is so unhappy. He says he doesn’t think he loves me anymore (he shows this is not true and has a number of times told me he still does), he had an affair as in his words he was looking for happiness.
He doesn’t realise that how he feels towards me could all be part of the depression. I’ve asked him to just trust me on this and seek help and we can make the big decisions once he is feeling better as he is now trying to pull away again after spending some time trying to get us back on track. 
Please tell me there is hope not just for him but for our relationship, has anyone been through similar and come out the other side? I will be there to support him no matter what happens in our relationship but I need to protect myself and my own mental health too."
550,I can’t stand them.  I hate hearing them BS back and forth on the phone when they don’t care about what happened to me.  I was too young to do anything about it myself.  Happened in the 70’s. It Kills Me.  How can they be that uncaring.  Empathy..not a single bone in their bodies.  I have the Will to leave but no source of survival at the moment.  Low income housing is still 6 years away.  Every F@=king day is Hell.  A balancing act..just to survive mentally.
551,"I have been doing lots of reading about suicide and ways to commit the act. I’ve thought about suicide on and off since I was a teenager (now 36). The major reason why I haven’t taken my life (yet) is because of the fear of pain and suffering before the actual death. I get that it’s sad to lose a loved one but it’s sad for people to have to keep living in absolute hell in their own minds. People always say “I had no idea” “they should of reached out for help” well it’s not always that easy. Sometime there is no help and sometimes people don’t have others around then that care.
I want to die so bad today. I wish so bad I could go to sleep and never wake up. I wish that was an option."
552,"Hi everyone,

First time posting on anything like this but I’m hoping that a forum like this will make me feel less alone.

I’m a 30 year old male who has a history of depression and anxiety. I grew up in an alcoholic and both physically and mentally abusive home for most of my childhood and was also surrounded by drugs and had no real stability growing up.

I myself turned to drugs and alcohol at a very young age, got expelled from school, was pretty much going nowhere in life and tried committing suicide at one very low point.

Thankfully I took myself to college and university, cut out drugs but struggle with drinking every now and then (not a daily thing but definitely a dependency for stress and other emotions).

My main reason for posting here is that the older I get, the worse my mental health seems to be getting. Or at least the less I’m able to function like I used to be able to by putting on a brave face (which is never the solution, I know).

I went from being expelled from school to getting a 1st class honours degree and I now have a steady albeit very stressful job, I’m almost financially stable after being in quite bad debt and I’m in a relationship that I’ve been in for 4 years (my first real relationship).

There just seems to be this emptiness within me where I feel like I’m broken, unfixable and won’t ever really feel happiness again. I love my partner but have no understanding how they can love me back. I’m more anxious, especially socially than I have ever been. And I just feel like it’s never going to get better.

I don’t want a magic wand to make all this pain go away, I just want a way to manage better and have a bit of hope for the future.

I’ve recently started psychotherapy (therapist number 6 in the last 15 years) and I’m on Duloxetine now where I’ve tried to avoid medication up to now but I’ve lost hope of fixing things without them at this point.

Thank you so much to whoever takes the time to read this, just writing it has been helpful.

Take call all,

J"
553,"Hello, I am new here.
Having stopped taking my antidepressants earlier this year I relapsed severely in October / November. I suffer from major depressive disorder and am (hopefully) coming out of a severe episode now. my psychiatrist has me on Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine (California Rocket Fuel) as well as Pregabalin, Diazepam and Zopiclone for chronic insomnia. I am still having some hours of serious low mood and am still highly anxious but my thoughts are at least under control most of the time. 
Does anyone have any thoughts on how long it might be before levels of normality return?"
554,"My computer lagged so if this message ever shows up twice, I'm sorry. 

I don't know how to introduce this so I'll jump straight into it. 

When I was a kid, I always wanted to be an animator. So I drew every day hoping I'd get into the top schools. However my dad, since a young age always discarded this and told me ""no"". When I turned 17 I applied to law school cause I sucked at maths and wanted to get out of home (i mean the choices my dad would give me would be architect, lawyer, doctor or engineer). I got in and cried the first day, while everyone was happy to bz there. 

All of my friends went to art school. Yet, we all come from the same ""immigrant's children"" background. I don't know how their parents were so supportive but I'm so jealous of them. Even now, my best friend's sister is going to animation school and seeing her dad so supportive of it makes me cry. 

I know people have it worse and that I'm lucky to even go to college. I acknowledge this privilege of mine, my mother didn't go to college and my father was the first one to go. But every time I think about my future office job I go smoke, hoping I'd shorten my life to never live for long. I wake up hating the sh*t out of law school, and it results in me being a very average student. I barely pass. I make sure to get the bare minimum and go play video games or draw cause these things knock me out and make me forget life even exists. 

I can't quit law school because I don't have the money to do so. But I regret deeply not rebelling against my dad, and I tell that to myself every night. 

Thanks for reading."
555,"Hi,I’m 19 and just want to write down how I am feeling. Well how I been feeling since I remember. I’ve seen online that someone is always round you love to talk to but not in my case and I know I’m not alone. I have an elderly nan who is my daily company. Life is just getting a bit to much for me at the moment but a voice in my head says ‘wait something good may happen soon’. Nothing ever does? I’m just wondering will it ever? Because I can’t cope living like this forever. So lonely with no friends or family. I am worried about my future. I just want desperately to be loved. If you seen me in the street you wouldn’t realise I am feeling like this. I’m dead inside. I feel nothing anymore towards no one just angrier and loneliness I have a pain in my chest that’s the only reminder I have that I’m a real person with no one or nothing . I don’t know what to do? How is everyone? I just wanted to say Merry Christmas incase no one has said it to you today."
556,"I mostly feel numb today. I haven’t done anything today, not even showered. My boyfriend went to see his family but I’m just being antisocial and to myself. The holidays weigh on me more than I’d like but they are almost over."
557,"I was never good at hiding emotions (or as people like to say, putting on a mask)

now I just don't care.

I just display as I'm feeling and don't care what people think about it

558,"What seemed like a normal morning turned sour real quick after I received a few presents, which were mostly books and a puzzles. I love gifts like that because they helped enrich my life and I love to write and read. Anyways, I woke up and had a cup of caramel espresso (literally my only vice) and thought I give in for the sake of Christmas cheer. Little did I know my dad had other things in mine as he seems to always be the catalyst for conflict. He literally waits right after I open my present to complain about the mattress I kept on my floor. About a year ago, we purchased a mattress for the never ending project of getting a new bed. We chose a bed that was taking up to much space in my bedroom, I was also an indecisive teenager when we bought it. I ended up giving to my older yet estranged sister and I haven't heard about it since, she could've given it away for all I know. After that, I basically said goodbye to a goodnight's sleep, poor judgement on my part. Since I waited over a year for a bed, I couldn't help but hastily take the mattress out of the box. Again, poor judgement on my part. 

These actions came out of a place that felt empty and impatient. Whenever I undergo a change, my dad always finds a way to criticize it. No matter what I seem to do, whether in poor judgement or clarity, it's always my fault. He makes me feel guilty and ashamed for no reason, even though he's apart of these renovations as much as I am. He called the mattress on the floor an embarrassment even though there's no one else in our house. He acts so vain and makes me feel like I have no business doing anything at all. He talks to me like I'm a piece of scum over the most frivolous things just to turn get under my skin. He either knows what he's doing or simply finds it normal to nitpick others. This is the same guy who only just a few days ago gave me a business card to a new therapist. He both contributes to my social anxiety and depression. He's meddling with my mental health and thinks it's helping me. He's delusional and his help is killing me!

My dad is also severely racist and xenophobic. He makes enemies for me as well. This is why I can't make friends or be in a relationship because daddy bigshot might meddle with that too. Are you a race besides white? Sorry, my dad might just ruin our relationship too. Sometimes I feel like I can't be myself and not doing that will do me in. Merry Christmas to me I guess. Screw this!"
559,"Hi everyone.  I am living with my wife of 35 years.  She is in a depression and refuses to acknowledge it.  I am begging her to seek therapy and medication.  In fact I am looking for a therapist for her to no avail.  It seems as if they are all booked out.  

She is beginning to push me away and I'm pretty sure it's not much longer before we split up.  This saddens me greatly as I know without help she won't improve and will possibly commit suicide.  I don't expect much in the way of guidance here as I know the answer - but she refuses.  Just venting.

It helps me reading the success stories of those who have faced anxiety and depression and won with therapy and medication.  it helps knowing if she chooses that path versus leaving there is hope.  

Thanks everyone for sharing."
560,"Hi everyone,

The first of all I'm sorry if there are any grammar mistakes in my post.

When I write this post it mean I made a decision for myself and I'm happy for that. I used to cry a lot in every night but I don't why? I pushed myself to find out the reason and in the end when I think ab the death everything in my mind just like be released. Maybe you will tell me like a negative person and selfish person but I'm not enough the reasons to live the wonderful life as the others within 2 years recently. I can not stop thinking about the death everyday and it's really hard to smile with the others even the family it make my mind like be separated many parts and I have to live with a lot of the emotions in my mind

In my point the death is not too dangerous, I'm afraid the pain but I'm not afraid the death.

Thank everyone so much for listening to me."
561,"Hello all. I'm hoping that I can get some advice or talk to people who are/have been in a similar situation as I am. As we all know, 2020 has been an absolutely terrible year and one that we will never forget. The trouble is, even without the pandemic, it's still been the hardest of my life.
Back in early August, my wife (we'd been together for 7 years, married for 3) decided she wanted to leave me, so one day she suddenly left and moved into her parents. The thing is, we have two daughters aged 2 and 4 who she took with her. She spent the first few weeks not letting me see them (for no good reason) and so I got a solicitor/barrister who is going to be representing me in court this coming January. Since those initial weeks, I've seen the girls a bit more, bit no way near as much as I'd like. 
In October, she got into a new relationship and quickly rented a new home, in which he has moved into aswell. She left the girls with her mother while they ""prepared the house"" and they only moved in with her yesterday. 
I don't know where they are living, all I know is that's it's not far from mine. I've been feeling so lonely the last few months and even dated a new girl a few weeks ago, but sadly it fizzled out rather quickly. But all I can think of is her and him being together, living the life that I should have with her and the girls, instead of him. It's even getting to the point where I sit at home at night and think ""I bet they're right now cuddled up together or doing 'other things together' etc"" and I feel like breaking down. I didn't do anything wrong in our relationship, she just fell out of love with me and walked out of our life together, although we are still technically married. For the last couple of months, I've been on dating sites etc (I know I'll probably be about down for that!) Because the loneliness and boredom/frustration is really getting me down. But even on those sites, I must have messaged 200+ women of all types, and never had a single reply. 
I just feel like everything in my life has fallen apart and I'll never find that happiness again (I'm not good looking, only have a minimum wage full time job, rent a 2 bedroom flat etc, so hardly a ""catch"")and I don't know how to be happy again. I'm hoping that the situation with my girls will be sorted at the court case next month and hopefully I'll be awarded 50/50 access/custody or near to that, so in terms of my children things will hopefully be ok in the long run, but it's the other aspect of my life that's just getting me so down, I've even had moments where I've thought about doing something silly, but then have looked at a photo of my children and stopped myself. I don't know what to do! I just feel my wife is in her new place after treating me like ****, and is there with her new bloke (who has even threatened to do all sorts of physical harm to me!) Laughing at me being a single wreck with no future, while they are all loved up and having a great time, acting like they are the parents to the children and I don't exist. It's horrible!!"
562,"I wish I was around 17-20 again because my life was so much better back then. My depression and anxiety were not as bad, I got to spend every day at school (i also loved school for school) with my best friends then spend the evenings just chilling talking to them, watching tv and youtube. I was just so innocently happy and content. These last couple of years, especially this year, has just had a lot of awful stuff happen. Now, I'm 22, I'm an unemployed graduate and I feel like I'm getting so old so quickly. I don't see a future for myself because I feel like I have nothing to offer, everyone on social media is like 15-19 and I feel so insecure when I see them. They all look so good and have 'aesthetics' from a young age whereas I'm now discovering new fashion styles and things yet I feel like I'm getting too old to wear them and follow the trends. I also live in a student city so I constantly see teens about and it makes me miss that part of my life so much. 

At the same time, I have amazing friends, including my best friends from school who I'm still close to, I know I;m not 'behind' when it comes to the age people start their careers. I should be grateful that I loved my teen years and had so much fun to the point where I would choose to go back-I know not everyone is that blessed. I should cherish the memories I have from that time of my life and work on making new memories, but I just..miss it so so much. I'm so unhappy right now. My entire life feels like it's just come to a stand-still since covid and I haven't made any progress in any part of my life in months. I just don't know what to do and how to actually start doing something with my life."
563,"I remember how much happiness christmas used to bring me with family together , not bothered by anything . But now I imagine all holidays will be like this one was , where u only get reminded of what u dont have and never will , and just how much u suck in life ."
564,"I’ve struggled with depression my whole life (Been bullied, self harmed, attempted suicide, etc.) but as I get older (I’m 26) I realize  that it mostly stems from being lonely. Ive lived in CA for 3 years now and I’m from MO and all my family and friends I grew up with are still there and are getting married and all that, I have been single for over 5 years and haven’t made many friends in this town( I currently have 4 friends in this town). I have burnt bridges with 3 other friends this year. 2 of which (roommates) were stealing from me and probably back on drugs, so I moved out and they cut me off and starting spreading rumors about me, the other I was friends with for 2.5 years and after a small argument decided to tell me how much I’ve worn her down and that I was so rude, even though we hung out 24-7, went on trips together, etc... I was extremely blindsided by this since she’s never expressed these feelings to me EVER. With all this I started spiraling into the endless thoughts of how Im a bad person and self hate and maybe it’s me that’s the problem and that’s why I’m single and have like no friends. Anyway with covid and all this I’ve really struggled with depression and have been thinking of self harm but really don’t want to go back down that path (5 years self harm free). I constantly feel lonely, I don’t have that best friend out here or a boyfriend or family and when I go home to visit everyone’s getting married so I feel like I’m just falling behind in life. I’m very active with my dog and it helps but it’s not enough.

How do you guys cope with constant loneliness ?"
565,"I've been having (possibly) a depressive episode since 8 Oct. Which is when my mother stopped talking to me bc I didn't wish her happy birthday. In 2018 I spent my 30th birthday in a psychiatric hospital bc she lied to get me admitted. But I'm the bad guy, apparently.

I feel like I'm a complete mess. Literally. When I'm depressed, I can't clean. What's the point? Doing the laundry is very hard as well, I'm running out of clean clothes, but again, what's the point of doing anything? I only wash my hair bc I work. I wash my face only before work bc when I'm at home, no one's bothered by the dried tears on my face.

Nobody in real life cares about me, when I hit by a car in winter, I had to spent almost 24 h in hospital bc my mother didn't care enough to find me. I could be half-decomposed before my parents would think: hmm, maybe sth is wrong. We live in one flat and my mother hadn't spoken to me since 8 Oct.

There's a very long list of awful things my entire family had done to me, all sorts of abuse. I think they all hate me bc I'm more emotional than my brothers and it's easier to see I've been through hell as a child. Like, I used to wet my bed and no one thought: hmm, this means she's stressed, possibly from all the fights between parents she witnesses. No, my mother once yelled at me: why don't you just get up and go to the bathroom? The funny thing is, my parents both favour their sons and it's those sons who hurt me. The thing is, I've noticed everyone who hurt me appears to be an extrovert, they all have friends, partners, have no problem talking to people. I'm an introvert, all the abuse I suffered when my personality developed certainly didn't help. So maybe my parents prefer my brothers bc they are easier to talk to but still, this is so incredibly unfair.

What's more, my father is an alcoholic. Everyone thought I'd be one too. Since this current wave of depression started, I started drinking more, yesterday was the last day of work and I was so severely hungover I barely got to work. It's over 7 km by bike and I had to take a few breaks.

My mother believes I'm mentally ill and hid it from 3 professionals, but not from her. The thing is, my parents know how horrible my life was, since I was maybe 11 their divorce nightmare started, I honestly can't tell how many years they fought, I think 9. They lived together in one flat and fought in front of me, they treated me as a therapist, even when I asked to be left out of this. And now they are like: why are you such a failure, why aren't you a successful, confident person? It's amazing I only ended up with (possibly) depression, hair-pulling, (possible) social anxiety and constant suicidal thoughts. When I was in my twenties I thought: this is it, time for early signs of schizophrenia. How did I not develop that or other serious illnesses? I've never felt safe at home, had to always hide everything from my family, now I have no support from either of them.

My parents always take the side of anyone who hurts me. My father felt sorry for the driver who hit me bc 'I let myself be hit'. As one does. My mother let my brother keep the laptop he stole from me for a couple of months. Also, they have the best reasons for my poor mental health: my mother said I'm depressed bc I don't eat, it was during my stay in hospital when she would bring me food bc I didn't want to eat crappy hospital food. My father, an alcoholic who only returned to church after he spent 4 years in prison for drunk driving a bike, asked a social worker if I'm not normal bc I've stopped going to church. These are certainly the reasons why I'm depressed, not their traumatic divorce, being beaten, emotional abuse, poverty. Sure it's easier to blame me for everything, but I don't think conflicts between two people are caused always by only one person. Also, I believe that's it's nurture, not nature. I'm biased, but I've met an introvert who wouldn't be pushed around. I just let things happen to me bc I was taught I deserve to be abused.

Things got really bad lately. I can't get any help bc I've honestly tried and met the worst 'professionals'. I don't think I'm always right, so when sb tells me sth I disagree with, I take a moment to think about that bc I'm maybe wrong. Bad when you meet awful doctors. Like, I said a male paramedic was angry with me I thought I had chest pains and to humiliate me, he grabbed my shirt and yanked it up to reveal my bare breast. Very painful, considering I was sexually abused and don't know how to protect myself. My parents said nothing, my mother witnessed it and didn't help me, the therapist who knew about my past said coldly that sometimes we have to undress for the examination. This made me feel like I was being crazy for feeling bad about this situation. Similarly, when they took my mother's side and said I had to be locked up in mental hospital bc of her lies, I said she should've TALKED with me first and no one agreed. I don't think I need some strangers' validation for my emotions, but mental health professionals making me feel like I'm upset over nothing was very odd.

I wanted to tell my parents during the meeting with 2 psychologists that their son sexually abused me for years since I was six and the other son threatened me that I'd be kicked out of the house at 7. But the reactions of everyone made me feel like they would blame me and make me feel like it's nothing to cry about after so many years. But now my parents are preparing Christmas that I won't be invited to and they don't care I've been depressed for months. I want to ruin their celebrations by telling them the truth. I hope they will make me furious enough to commit suicide without a second thought."
566,"It is day 4 and i cannot bring myself to eat or sleep.. I have gotten a few hours from passing out and people are looking at me funny and trying to ""help"" but i just want to puke and cry and be alone. I lost a 4 year relationship mostly from my toxic traits.. I have been raped,  had stage 2 Cancer, overdosed and i am now sober for almost 3 years and have been hearing voices... I am scared of becoming schizophrenic..  i feel like after all i have made it through I am still completely worthless and i break people... I just ruin everything i come into contact with and i dont know how to stop 
I lost a good person.. And i cost my children the chance at a family.. Again.. 
I dont want to be here... 
I have to, for them. I pretend every day all of these things never happened.. I just want to get better 😥"
567,"Hello, all, hoping this post finds everyone well. <3 If not, sending love and good thoughts your way~

So I've wrangled with degrees of depression and anxiety for... Duuuude. Decades at this point, and I've done just about everything ""right"" re: coping with these things. I exercise (obviously, I'm in training so it kinda by default comes with the territory, lulz), I eat healthy, I engage in healthy activities like reading and drawing, I spend time outside, I pray/meditate, I stick to a routine, I do gratitude lists, and etc. I'm on 20mg of Lexapro daily. Lately, however, I almost feel like I'm so just... down that I can't muster to do the things I enjoy and that help me to cope with these conditions. 

I mean, good LORD, you guys--I don't drink because of the fact that just about everyone on my mom's side of the family is an alcoholic as is my husband, and I'm sitting in my pajamas allowing myself some wine because f*ck if I know why. It's here because my mom sent it over so I could cook with it but it's all going to get thrown out tomorrow once I've made my recipe since my husband doesn't need the open temptation and I don't need to pick up a drinking habit to match his.

As mentioned in a previous post, last week's session with my therapist was difficult--she asked if I felt my husband was being emotionally abusive to me, and I couldn't honestly answer her with a no. Emotional abuse doesn't always look like it does in the movies or fictitious novels. Like on a day-to-day basis, in spite of everything that's gone on between us, my husband and I get along pretty well. But on breaking down about our relationship to my counselor and having her ask me that question, it opened my mind to the possibility that that ""getting along"" doesn't really mean much when there's a larger pattern of abuse.

I can't ignore or deny the fact that he is, at the very least, controlling--like YES, I made a stupid f*cking decision and got involved with a dude I thought would be there for me when I decided I was going to leave my husband. 

Okay I'll just say it *grumble grumble* I had an affair *grumble grumble* Even if one might use the term EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES! that's still what it was. *SIGH*

Anyway. His actions following were justifiable and understandable, but in the wake of facing up to what I had done and taking responsibility for it I conveniently left the fact that even before this affair my husband regularly broke into and read my private instant message conversations, emails, text messages, journals, and diaries without my consent on the back burner. He has always been uncomfortable with my external friendships (regardless of who they might be--if they don't present a romantic threat, they are someone I ""will talk sh*t about him to,"" and otherwise, they are... well, a romantic threat.) I can understand wanting to know my friends and build hedges against potentially inappropriate friendships to protect our relationship, but it is to an extent that lifelong friends have been blacklisted due to reasons such as ""He doesn't regularly acknowledge me, I don't understand why I am not always included in your conversations,"" or ""She didn't care about what it meant for me when you told her what happened last year,"" or etc. (The friend in question did, in fact, very much care what happened to him last year when I effed up.) I cut off contact with one of my closest friends in spite of this friend being married to a wonderful lady that I am also friends with to try to respect my husband's needs and boundaries. I have been writing a fan fiction with a friend out of state, and so have brainstormed via text with her to get this story written. I have been careful not to allow it to interfere with my time with my husband, and my screentime on my phone is less than two hours per day--and this includes texting, checking/reading/replying to emails, checking my fanfiction site and responding to messages and reading fics and replying to them, shopping, listening to music, and etc. However, I have been accused of being ""buried in my phone,"" so I have stepped away from the phone entirely except to make sure everyone is healthy and well in my family and among my friends once--at most twice--a day.

I have brought up some goals regarding work to him. Bear in mind he effectively asked me to quit my previous job because the strain on him with childcare was too much. In the end, it wasn't a huge arm-pull because I didn't feel comfortable at the salon in question, but I had at least wanted to see how I managed on the floor before I made my decision. So following this choice, I just mentioned it might be a neat goal to work hard toward honing my techniques and maybe try going out for a beauty company's Fashion Week team and have the opportunity to go to one (or several) of the Fashion Weeks around the world and be a part of the events. I've always loved cosmetology and fashion and being a part of Fashion Week would be an incredible thing for me and what I felt an interesting goal to aspire to. A mentor at this previous salon had been a part of a major company's Fashion Week team for the better part of a decade and therefore it seemed like a lofty but still wholly plausible goal. My husband immediately said, in a sickened and disturbed murmur, ""That thought makes me SO uncomfortable,"" and when I asked him why, he said he didn't know. When I asked if he'd be okay with me doing hair out of our home, he said that was fine with him. However, each second I mention any work out of the house, he is very shut down to the idea. If I had to guess, it is because the two times I met this ex-person (we'll call him Humbert) it was after my cosmetology classes at night, and therefore any cosmetology work outside of the house might trigger him. But to not have goals beyond just finding a hair and nails client for the next week and be indefinitely stuck in the house possibly even when COVID is a little more brought to heel is counterintuitive to my nature (I've always been very driven and aimed high), and I don't know how to approach the subject anymore because it's not changed or gotten better over the past year.

Years ago, when I mentioned working out of the home, he would become surly and explain that he felt I was only seeking work to try to leave him. Conversely, he would accuse me of using him for an income when I wasn't working out of the house. More recently, he has made similar accusations--that I stay to use him, and that if I had a legitimate job, I wouldn't be with him. It feels sometimes that he resents my dependence on him but then becomes embittered by the concept of me attempting to seek some form of independence while not leaving or indicating leaving the relationship.  

It feels sometimes like my husband's standards might be more than I, as an individual, can meet. I'm sure there are women out there who could, just... I'm not sure I can. I try, and it's exhausting. He still wishes me to maintain total transparency (I'm just hoping he doesn't find this since it's supposed to be a safe venting ground to people who have no connection to him) as in he gets full access to all of my conversations, emails, messages, etc., wants regular sex (at least a few times a week--I feel about as sexy as Jabba the Hutt on meth these days and I'm still... I don't know, so HURT about his affair in September October--and frankly might still be ongoing, there are signs, but who knows, maybe I'm just paranoid and being stupid about it--and therefore just don't feel much like having sex, needs several forms of one-on-one connection each day from playing board games and doing conversation starters and ensuring all of our activities are ones that can be done together to engaging (at one point daily) in deep, hard communication about our relationship and continuously discussing harsher topics, like how badly I hurt him last year (2019) and how he felt so abandoned in 2015 (which oddly hurts me, he was drunk that whole year and lying about it while I was chronically ill and waiting massive surgery and just kinda trying to survive, lol) and etc. etc., needs me to time my activities according to what schedule works for him regardless of what the activity is, needs almost constant physical touch and contact (like I'll be up and about, cooking, vacuuming, cleaning, whatever, and he'll step in front of me and just hug me for like 3-5 minutes straight... hugs are fine but I REALLY wish he wouldn't time them when I'm in the middle of something. He claims I'm always in the middle of something but I TRY VERY HARD to be affectionate with him to ensure he feels loved but he still does this several times a day), and takes exception to me spending ""too much"" (from what I can tell, more than 5-10 minutes maybe once or twice a day unless I'm doing work for my job) time on my computer and is very sensitive to my phone usage. I spent a lot of time on my phone while he was drinking so I understand the aversion but I don't use any social media anymore and haven't for some time (it's been five years since I used Facebook or Twitter and one year since I stopped using Instagram.) I recognize his discomfort but I wish I could at least text friends here and there or look at stuff on Amazon or read a fanfic in bed without a probe or an interrogation to follow. (Or just him flat-out looking through my phone and checking its history and my conversations. Can't say as I say anything bad about him or have anything to hide but I'm always afraid there will be something he'll get upset about.) Just today I discovered that he was sifting through my email, some days after I tried to say the window for transparency was closing per our counselor's recommendation and that these probes into my private conversations were no longer appropriate and he needed to start working toward some level of trust or asking for consent before looking at my private things. He said he still needs the transparency, but I never agreed that I still want to give it to him. It's not because I want to unbridled-ly whine about him to all of my friends and family and acquaintances and coworkers and bank tellers and gas station attendants and etc., I just want to have conversations and correspondence without feeling like a cave woman in ice being observed by a scientist.

I want to make this work, but I don't know if I can revolve every waking moment of my life around my husband and his laundry list of needs and desires for this relationship. He has claimed that he does not ask for much, if anything, and when he asks me to list examples of what he requires, it then sounds like I'm out of line and selfish expressing being overwhelmed about his needs. And maybe I am--like maybe it's reasonable that he want the things he does, and I'm just not cut out for marriage because I can't fulfill all of those needs without being overwhelmed.

Meanwhile, I feel so helpless with COVID and like I'll never find or hold a job that will provide for my kids on its own. While I'm not a point that I want to leave or end it, even if I did, I don't feel I could because with the pandemic it's not like cosmetology is a secure field. I don't want to place my kids in a position of wanting or struggle just because my stupid ass with its useless talents couldn't hack it as Hubs' wife. It just makes me feel so trapped, like there's no choice anywhere. Again, I'm not at a point I want to leave him, I still want to make this work--but I wish I had choices.

As such, I can't seem to get up at a reasonable time, fall asleep at a reasonable time, find the energy to train or run, eat properly on a consistent basis, focus on the things I enjoy doing (time window limits and forced schedules aside), etc. I used to shower and bathe every day, and I'm down to every other day now because I just don't have the energy and I don't see the point since I rarely go anywhere other than the boxing gym and now I'm quarantining for two weeks. 

I'm doing my best to keep my chin up for my kids but I'm really struggling. I know they say to do x y z and etc. to cope with depression, but what if you can't even muster up to do x y or z in the first place? What then? What do you do?

SIGH. I just don't know...

Happy Holidays, y'all, thanks for the vent sesh. Have a good night <3 Focker... OUT"
568,"I need advice for dealing with depression while living with my family. My mother declared her marriage over after continuous verbal insults. I wouldn't consider my parents marriage abusive, but it's still toxic in many ways. My father is emotionally distant and has a bad relationship with money. Ever since he entered my mother's life, all the decisions were made by him despite my mother having all the credit. I feel robbed of the traditional dad-daughter dynamic, I have never had a stable relationship because of how detached he is. Although, I will admit that I'm closer to my mother. I'm currently 22 and working on getting my life together so I can move out. I feel guilty that I'm still at home because I feel like I should have decided on a career already. My dreams and goals aren't to climb the corporate ladder or get married, I honestly just want to be apart of something big. I've always wanted to have a career that allowed to express myself creatively and collaborate with others. I know it sounds cliché and I can hear the cynical voice telling me I'm useless for wanting that life.

I feel useless and very alone, as if my dreams mean nothing now. I have no idea where I'm heading in life, all I know is that I have nobody to talk to about it. I fear that maybe this life is just a cruel joke and that my optimism is only hurting me more. I just want to know where I'm going and that it's not as bad as it seems. I'm not looking for an easy way out, but rather, a place in this world where I feel worthy. I've gotten to the point where I'm getting sick and tired of labels, the old fashioned categories that people conjure up to create animosity. Why can't we live in a society where learning is a way of life and ideas are the only currency, that honestly sounds like paradise. I feel brain dead being lumped in a position that only isolates me from others with no idea on how to reach out.

Apart of me is afraid of stepping into a job position or making friends because I have no social skills. My misunderstanding of social queues makes it difficult to communicate with anybody, plus I struggle with a low-esteem. I don't know how to balance depression with a emotional distant father and gaining independence altogether. I feel like an idiot for being unconventional and messing up my education. I feel ashamed of having depression because it makes me feel like screw up who needs to shut up."
569,"I don't know where to start exactly as I feel like there's wo much going on in my life so I'll try and sort it a bit.
So since around the beginning of this year, I felt pretty sad. I sometimes felt a bit down last year too but still had many things to enjoy and be happy about. During this year it felt like it all is working back at me, like I CAN'T be happy no matter what I do. I try to distract myself? Doesn't work out because of too many unwanted thoughts. I try to enjoy the things I used to love (tv shows, my favourite artists, etc.) - doesn't work out either. Instead I find myself feeling badly jealous of my favourite artist's lifes and being unable to enjoy their music/shows/etc because of this jealousy/envy. Sounds terrible and rude but I can't get it out of my head and it's annoying because at least music or shows had managed to distract me until earlie this year/late last year. I have no idea where this jealousy comes rrom? Maybe bullying at former schools? 

Anyways. It's not just the jealousy that makes me angry and upset of course. It's the general feeling of sadness to the point where I feel numb and heavy at the same time. I can't enjoy ANYTHING anymore, I don't see any reasons in carrying on... apart from not wanting to upset my parents. Don't get me wronh I have a good life and I'm thankful for having a family, a house and a good life - but I don't feel happy. I don't feel like I want to be on this world for a second longer. It's like no matter what I would do or change it wouldn't bring happiness at all. 

I feel anxious about the future because I feel like there'll never be a way out. I'm scared of losing the peopoe I love because they're the only ones that keep me going. 

I've researched so much of what is wrong with me or where it might has gone wrong, what I could do or change and I feel like there's no solution. I've never been diagnosed with depression or anything but around 1,5 years ago I started to show signs of OCD as well. I'd seen a therapist twice during the oast 1,5 years. One of them told me to ""buy books and help myself"" (no joke) and the other one didn't believed me at all and said teens and young adults can't get depressed, they only want attention (sorry if that triggers someone, it was what he said however) so I'm scared to go to another therapist. 

I've thought about hypnosis as I've read some pretty good experiences about that and feel like it might be a small start into a good direction. All I want is being able to at least enjoy the small things in life again so I've got something to hold onto... and not to hate my existence and be jealous and sad the whole day without seeing an escape.

Thanks for reading this post and sorry that it's quite a long one. All the best xx"
570,"I've been struggling with depression for a long time. Let me tell you, it only gets worse. There's no help, literally no help. I'm not exaggerating, when I was hospitalized after my second suicide attempt, the psychiatrist immediately decided I'm a stupid attention whore, a narcissist and I've spent 9 days there with no treatment. My roommate was older than me, she was admitted bc she was feeling suicidal and she got all the care imaginable, group sessions, therapy, she was hardly ever in our room. But I look younger than I am and I'm short, so people assume I'm a stupid teenager that fakes depression for attention. One of the 'doctors' saw my eyes were red bc I had cried and started interrogating me, do I get visits? how often? who comes to see me? Then threatened me with being sent to the first floor, which was for less normal patients. You are totally not going to believe that but at that time, the psychiatric hospital in my town was in the former TB hospital, there was a second floor, which had maybe 3 rooms and a bathroom, no supervision there, the two rooms were occupied by male drug addicts and for one night, I was alone there with them, in separate rooms. One of the guys was a pimp and he told me stories about his girls. I've been sexually assaulted, so this weird guy hanging out in my room creeped me out.

I did everything imaginable to get help for my depression and suicidal thoughts. My mother just had to make it all about herself, she literally asked me: why, bc you have a bad mother? When she lied to get me locked up in the psychiatric hospital, she mentioned I hadn't eaten for a week. They drew my blood, the nurse said it would clarify if I had starved myself or not, but then yanked the needle out bc 'there was no other way', which caused two weeks of inflammation, a large bruise, and a round of antibiotics. No one later mentioned my supposed eating disorder, interesting. 

The second time I was imprisoned in the mental hospital, for three weeks for no reason, I talked to a psychologist. She seemed fine, the first of those charlatans who felt like she was genuine. But it was a trap. My honesty was punished by them claiming I was dramatic, theatrical and therefore I had histrionic personality disorder. Which main symptom is craving attention and being sexually provocative. I've never been on ay social media, didn't have a phone for a couple of years in my twenties, don't have friends, probably suffer from social anxiety, leaving home ifs stressful to me and I'm an attention-seeker? Even in my discharge papers, they mentioned only 2 or 3 reasons for their diagnosis. 5 or more are required for the diagnosis, but what do I know? They also told me very vague things about this disorder, that it makes it difficult to make friends. That's not the right description of this disorder. Also, the psychologist and the psychiatrist said that my telling my mother I felt suicidal was a manipulation, not asking for help. 


When I was freed, I went back to see that psychologist/therapist. She was the first person I told face to face that I was sexually abused by my brother. She took his side, saying he had problems and our parents should've given him more attention. I'm not paranoid, but I'm almost sure she did that on purpose. Who accidentally sides with a pedophile? I think she wanted to hurt me. 

Sometime after that, I had a session with her, my parents and my mother's psychologist. I told them all that before my hospitalization, I was basically assaulted by a paramedic. He was clearly angry with me bc I had chest pains despite being young and slim. He was about to give me EKG, one of those sorts of plasters goes under the left breast, I pulled my shirt up, he could see I had no bra on, then he let out an angry sound and yanked my shirt up, revealing my bare breasts. I was mortified. My mother was there and did nothing. I thought I learned how to defend myself from sexually motivated assault, but I couldn't move, didn't cover myself up until that asshole gave me his permission. I should've punched him, beat him, choke him, threaten him with the police, but I was taught by my brother to let men assault me and never complain. So, I told this story during the session with my parents, they still don't know their son raped me, but still, they should've felt bad about this. They said nothing and my psychologist, who already knew about my past, said that we need to get undress for the examination. And that was all. No: this must have been hard for you, this sounds terrible, nothing. No compassion at all. A man aggressively pulling my shirt up is completely fine. That's what a rape victim deserves, clearly. I remember how shocked I was by everyone's reaction. My parents always take the side of anyone who hurts me, but why did psychologists do that too? How did I deserve a psychologist that took the side of TWO men who assaulted me? She was the first wheelchair-bound person I met, I was nice to her, didn't offer my help bc she din' t ask for it. What did I get in return? 'It's justified this paramedic assaulted you, get over it.'

That my parents didn't care about this assault shouldn't surprise me. They always took the side of whoever hurt me. Even my brothers. Sure, there are unclear moments where siblings fight and there's no way of knowing who started it. But there's one crystal clear situation that shows how much my mother hates me and prefers my brothers. A month after my second suicide attempt and the hospital, my mother bought me a laptop, which I was not expecting at all. A day or two later, my brother stole it. We were both living in the same city, away from home. I had just started university, needed a laptop for homework and stuff. He had a laptop but stole mine. I called him, went to his flat, countless times. Almost 2 months later, I went home for Christmas, he did too, but since he wasn't sure I would do that, he left my laptop in Cracow, 800 km away from home. I was so distraught, not bc I wanted the laptop itself, no, it was my mother's reaction to it. She took his side, said: oh, he'll give it back and genrally made me feel like my emotions weren't valid bc 'he'll give it back eventually'.

 I needed it to study, he wasn't a student and had his own laptop. It was over three months before he gave it back, of course, right after I went home for winter break. He then left it in the dorm, making me either wait for a fortnight or go back just for the laptop and then return home. My mother paid for our tickets to and from the city and even that didn't make her despise her stupid son. No, I was the bad one. Later they laughed that I failed my exams bc he stole my laptop. Before the laptop, my brother helped me get settled in the city and I thought: hmm, maybe this monster changed, after making my childhood a living hell. No. He later apologized and admitted I was the most abused person in our family, but I don't trust him.

To make the laptop story funnier, back then I was talking to a psychologist online, we exchanged emails. I asked her to contact my mother and say how upset I was by her behavior. The psychologist sent me a draft of her email to my mother, where she explained how I felt and when I accepted the draft, she said: actually, I cant contact your mother. I'm pretty sure she knew that already and just wanted to hurt me. 

Anyway, there's not a single thing keeping me alive except maybe for a fear of killing myself. Sure, it sounds scary, but I now know it's the bravest and the best thing I can do. No reason to suffer every day, knowing no mental health 'professional' would ever treat me right. I never expected them to coddle me, pat me on my back, and say: oh, you poor thing. I expected neutrality. Not them taking the side of my abusers. The paramedic story proves people would do anything to make me feel bad, even side with a violent man who exposed my boobs for no reason. 

I can't look after myself, self-neglect is my number one depression symptom. Getting drunk and eating crap food is on the list too., along with intense self-hatred and self-harm. There's no help. Psychologists are like: sure, you were abused all your life by your entire family, but you're an adult and there's clearly no such thing as childhood trauma affecting your adult life. My parents are like: sure, we were horrible, abusive parents, but how can you bring this up, this makes your ungrateful. I can literally pick and choose which trauma I can relive each day, my parents' divorce, being beaten as a child, raped, bullied. The day before my first summer camp at age 7, my mother lost some money and decided I stole it, not my brothers aged 10 and 13, so for hours she beat me and interrogated me, I was too scared to move, I think I even confessed. So how on earth am I a suicidal adult? It's a total mystery, most likely it's bc I'm stupid, mentally ill and dumb.

My point is there is virtually no help for people like me. None. I literally admitted to a psychiatrist I attempted suicide for a second time bc of a bunch of childhood traumas and no one thought I had depression, my official diagnosis was adjustment disorder bc I had just started attending university.  I think none of the specialists I've seen ever thought I was depressed bc it would justify feeling bad and suicidal. Ridiculous disorders they diagnosed me with only confirm I'm stupid and don't deserve empathy. Also, I think they want to make me feel so hopeless and helpless that I do everyone a favour and just kill myself. And I will, bc there's no help and no compassion. No cure for depression. My plan is to tell my parents what their son did to me, they will get angry, accuse me of lying, take the pedophiles' side, I'll get insanely angry and end my life."
571,"It's been one full month since my current depressive episode started. My mother basically excluded me from the family and refused to help me financially bc I didn't wish her happy birthday. 2 years ago, she lied and had me admitted to a psych ward and I spend my 30th birthday there. I thought back then that if they brought a cake or some presents, I'd angrily refuse to see them, but I stupidly assumed they were good people. There was no presents, wishes, nothing that could cheer me up, and that very day, one patient died and I missed seeing him being taken away only by chance. Also, this year, the day before mother's birthday, she and father went ou without me bc they prefer their stupid dog over me. But I'm the bad guy.

I was just watching a documentary about some rapper finding out what made his father commit suicide and they all talked about people not asking for help, keeping their problems to themselves. I did ask for help, many times. After my second attempt, I admitted straight away what I'd done, thinking it was time to seek help. Stupid me! The psychiatrist laughed about me being beaten as a child, then said I wanted people to know about my suffering. At no point during my attempt did I think: oh yeah, this will show everyone and they will feel sorry for how they treated me. But unfortunately, I'm short and look much younger than I am, like 18 years younger, in primary schools I'm often mistaken for a student. It's a horrible thing, no one ever respects me, everyone thinks I'm a dumb teen that doesn't know anything and cannot be taken seriously. I thought that maybe if I told psychiatrists/psychologists about all of my traumas right away, during the first 5 minutes, maybe they wouldn't treat me like an emo kid that just wants attention. I know it's not my fault and it's theirs, I've met many mental health professionals and 100% of them were completely devoid of empathy. Nothing I could say or do would make them treat me right bc they care only about themselves.

I also told my parents I'm suicidal, two years ago. My mother got angry and asked me: why, bc you have a bad mother? Then said I was stupid. She also insists that the day she called for the paramedics to drag me to the hospital, I was nearly catatonic, that there was no way to communicate with me. I just didn't answer when she talked to me, then I magically healed when the paramedics got here and I talked to them. When it was being decided if I could go home or be admitted, a man was brought in, after a row with his wife he threatened to take his own life, then punched the paramedic. He was released bc his family got there and took him. My roommate, really volatile, was also released faster than me bc her husband got her. She was hysterical before she was imprisoned in the psych ward, talked openly about committing suicide, then repeated that during a round in the hospital. I was chilling in my room before I was imprisoned, had pickle soup and was about to watch a documentary about Titanic, I didn't struggle or yell when the paramedics threatened me with a straight jacket and police. The psychologist who admitted me said she would've let me go if my parents came for me. It was August, around 6 pm, the hospital wasn't far from our flat, but they didn't come. And later said they would insist I was admitted. After 3 weeks of hell, I was released, without any meds bc I'm not crazy. My parents told me I should've been kept there longer and be turned into one of those zombies patients that slowly walk up and down the hall, drugged out of their mind. It's clearly written in my discharge papers that I wasn't insane when admitted but my mother insists that I deceived three professionals and sneakily hid my mental illness. She said that in front of 2 psychologists and no one said anything.

Last year I was hit by a car, had a concussion, the neurosurgeon said I was so confused and dizzy I had to stay the night. I feel I was very lucid from the moment I regained consciousness, I waited for my mother to come there and as always, make it all about herself, but come nonetheless. It was January, it snowed after I was hit, it was Thursday. I don't have friends and don't go to parties. Also, maybe 3 years before that, mother gone missing for maybe 4 hours in late April, I called the ER, then morgue, then ER again and was informed she was admitted. I jumped on my bike and got there as quickly as possible, then went and got her something to drink bc you have to have your own water in hospitals or die. So, I waited and waited, afraid I'd end up in a psych ward. The nurses were supposed to call my mother but didn't. I was hooked up to the monitor, couldn't get up without help and had a concussion. I was so thirsty. I was there almost 24 hours, getting progressively angrier and hurt. My mother noticed my bike was gone at 1 am and only sent me an email. I had to get up, find my phone, and make a call myself. My boss, of course, knew straight away I was in hospital, she saw the accident site and knew I missed work. But my mother? Instead of waiting maybe 20 min for the bus, she made the scene of having our neighbour bring her there by car and as always, her first words when seeing me in hospital were about her, that she was feeling stressed out. I've lost 1,5 front tooth, needed to see a dentist straight away, bc of her stupidity it was Friday afternoon, also someone had to find out about my bike. I told her all that once we were home, expecting her to make the phone calls, but she just took potatoes and sat down to peel them.

A few months later, we were arguing about her being a horrible mother to me, mainly about her lack of care after my accident. She said: but I didn't come eventually! Her complete lack of self-criticism and empathy made me so angry I yelled, so she sent my father to threaten me. An alcoholic with a long history of domestic violence. She heard him say he would destroy my laptop with a hammer, then left us, me with this drunk monster. He threatened to hurt me, it was unclear how badly, so he specified he meant beating me, then added I'm useless, hopeless and won't achieve anything ever. After he left, I went to tell mother about his threats and she said I imagined it, that I'm delusional. He was standing half of a goddamn metre away from the spot he once tried to strangle her. I've defended her many times when he would yell at her, although I was scared of him, and she took his side. She prefers the man who abused her, me, who's been awful to his entire family. She also called my uncle who I wanted to talk to and told him my father only wanted to disconnect the wifi, not destroy my laptop and beat me. I've read somewhere that mental abuser wants to make their victims doubt their sanity and tell them they are crazy. but it didn't make my mother's reaction any less hurtful.

Other people in my life know I'm struggling. But people mostly think about themselves, especially these days. And what would they do? Have me admitted to a psych ward again? I know from experience no one there wants to help anyone. Nurses and guards make fun of people, swear at them, even lose their belongings bc they keep them in 4 different places. One nurse refused to give me a painkiller that the doctor allowed bc of period pain, then treated me like drug addict. I had painkillers smuggled in and later discovered I've got a double uterus (double the pain), so I was right.

My brother, the only person who knows about the hell that is our family, stopped responding to my mails. He was diagnosed with PTSD bc of his traumatic childhood and he himself admitted mine was worse. I guess I'm a trigger for him. My aunt called me when I was in the psych ward and like a truly crazy person repeated that my parents love me, regardless of what I said. My parents blabbed about my 'mental illness' to our neighbours and people think I'm crazy. This helps so much with my shyness/social anxiety.

I don't even know why I'm still alive. I regret not dying in that car accident. How quickly would my parents notice I was gone? I know I needlessly blamed myself for all the problems in the family, when I should've blamed the real culprits. My parents know I'm suicidal and yet didn't modify their behaviour. My mother said after that psych ward thing that I'm being nasty to her bc she's old. 2 weeks before I was admitted, she was supposed to have surgery on the other side of the country, I offered to go with her to look after her. She then left me in hospital twice. Her surgery was cancelled bc it would cause a stroke, I think about it often, had she died, I would've been free and none f  this heartache would have happened. I'd have been sad, but I wouldn't have known how cruel my mother can be. There's been countless times when she took the side of the person that hurt me, but when she sided with my father, I don't know why she hates me so much that she thinks an abusive alcoholic is better than me. I know no one from my family will be affected by my suicide and they will only blame me and my mysterious mental illness.

Lately, everything's been falling apart, job, family, covid, the fridge and water purifier broke down. Nothing is right. People tell me it's the depression talking and it's not real, but my family's outrageous behaviour and the lack of professionalism in those so-called mental health professionals are real. I know for a fact that no one wants to help me here in Poland. the only consolation and understanding I get are from foreigners on the internet. But you guys don't know me. Maybe I really don't deserve sympathy or help. If my family hate me this much, there's sth wrong with me."
572,"So I’m 48 at home with mom. No job. No girl. Never been married, no kids. I’ve failed at everything my whole life. Kicked out of schools, been to jail, fired from 90% of my jobs, never held a job more than 3 years. It’s been rough. After my last failed relationship, I needed answers, it was too much, I tried so hard. Digging deep, I made it therapy, where I learned about my childhood. It was bad. From 5-13, beatings from my sister (7yrs older) whenever single working mom wasn’t around, which was often. She didn’t care, never defended me, never spoke to sister about it as far as I know, definitely never in front of me. At 13 after an attack I fought back and had grown enough to handle my own against her. When mom came home and found it she defended her. Our relationship broke that night. Anyways back to now, I guess the abuse from them did more than I realized. How I learned to “be” from them makes me lame. That’s why nothing works for me. I can’t go back in time and I would just have the same bad experience. How do I  change negative behaviors so ingrained, it took years to even realize i was exhibiting them? If in have to drug myself to be a capable adult, is it really me or the drugs? Will I even be conscious? What kind of life is that? I feel like I’m doomed to be miserable."
573,"For the pass year I been cycling through periods of being motivated about something then not having the motivation to do anything at all. It started in January with fish and that lasted until early March, then until April 15 I would binge drink, then after April 15 I would workout every day, and that lasted until June 28 I believe. After that I was into mountain biking, and that lasted until July 28; after that I started to binge drink every day until about September 15. That is when I really got into video games and until recently I would do that daily. Now I am to depress to even to leave my room and don't do anything except watch you tube videos worrying that I am losing my mind."
574,"I hate myself more and more everyday , i wish i would just ceize to exist if  i could donate my remaining years to someone i would gladly do so . I hate everything about my life . I hate that im social degenerate whos even afraid to go outside and make fool out of himself . The only person i was in love with  i cant be with because  i never met her IRL and every time i think of her which is quite lot , iam remainded that i dont deserve anything in life and that i will never be happy . I cant feel anything except tiredness , self-hatred or self-pity i dont remember last time i was happy i lost every hope that i will ever be happy and im tired of everything , everything i attend to do with good intentions just ends up hurting me more and more . I have whoever created me and decided that its good idea to put me in life . And ofcourse the only way that would free me of this agony is the way which would put my mother in desperate pain because as a parent she would of course would blame herself over my mistakes and that im practically garbage ."
575,"I think I just need to write some stuff of my mind. I have posted on this website quite a lot in the past telling about the stuff I deal with from day to day bases. It’s just that I have become even more tired lately. I wake up, I smoke a cigarette and drink some water and I just want to go to bed again immediately. I haven’t been diagnosed with depression officially. I also don’t think it isn’t the case that depression is the actual problem itself, but it’s more of a extra thing I deal with. I just can’t live with myself and that’s caused due of how my mind functions and causes constant problems. I want to point out directly that my living circumstances are very unhealthy. I’ve been in social isolation for 4 years. But like, I really rarely come outside my home. Whenever I do I usually take a walk when it’s dark outside with my mom. Social anxiety is another big part of my problem. And it’s not the social anxiety like being afraid to do a presentation in front of a group or whatever, but it’s like in a every little thing. But yeah, socially it’s one of the hardest things, but I can freak out by anything. Basically almost anything comes to the one main fear of losing my mind. And I’m trying my best to do everything I can to avoid it. I can’t listen to music, watch a movie, being in social contact or even draw something. Even doing sports at home is difficult now. Why? Because I’m afraid if I’ll be stronger I might be more dangerous. Also colors and numbers are a thing for me. And food and drinks. I can’t eat any red colored food normally. I still do at this point, but I just feel really bad while doing it. And lately the only drink I could drink relaxt which is rooibos tea also came in clutch. I start to worry and this time I don’t even know why anymore. I’ve been in multiple therapy stuff and none worked out. I just feel like a lost case. I do feel sometimes like there is just no point of me living on this planet anymore. I told my mom and she said she wouldn’t survive without me, so well, I have no option but to try to hope for a miracle. I’m 21 years old btw. I feel just so far off of what a normal person should be like. The worries about going crazy, it has made me busy for so long. I lost everything. After been and going through so much I don’t see how things could ever change. Change doesn’t seem to come up in my system. At least not positive change. I’m also afraid of change. Even a small adjustment in my own home can take a long while before I can settle. And the worst part is is that I don’t even know what I’m dealing with. So how can I ever do something about it.. I wish I was just a different person. But that seems impossible. I can’t cry of be emotional. Which frustrates me incredibly. All and all I’m just afraid I’m delusional and becoming worse. Being a danger to my own and others. And what’s so weird is that people can’t even see anything wrong with me. It’s like my outer appearance doesn’t match my inner one. It feels like I have been born for a bad luck. It looks like I’ll live in this situation forever. And it’s just that no one gets me. I don’t see how I can ever live on my own, have a job, have a girlfriend etc. And also just doing basic stuff basically. A ‘perfect day’ for me would be waking up energized, doing some sports outside like going for a run, listen and making some music, drinking a cup of tea and eating a big plate full of spaghetti bolognese while enjoying it, watching a movie, seeing my brother, going to a store to buy nothing in particular, having a comfortable conversation with a stranger. Just to name something. I think it’s very normal for basically anyone. And it seems so far and unrealistic to me. All I’m busy is analyzing 24/7 if I’m a psychopath. I just need to be able to feel like I take part in society in a good way. The only big thing I worry about of missing is being alone for the rest of my life. I’m not, I live with my mom, but of course that’s not very healthy on my age. Or well, I’m coming to a point it’s normal I should take care of myself. I just wish I could receive a hug. Anything that’s are some things I needed to write off my chest."
576,"At this point my depression is as severe as it gets probably. As the title says, I no longer care about anything. I have no hobbies, no interests, no dreams, no goal, no purpose, no job, no college degree, nothing really. I no longer even care to heal, you know? Like I don't care to get up, go to therapy and heal. I don't care nor want to read, learn, educate myself, watch something, listen to something, do something. Funniest thing is that I can't even be BOTHERED to kill myself. The process of getting up and then doing it is bothersome. I don't give a fuck. Don't get me wrong I tried to force myself. I forced myself to do certain things, but stopped not even finishing. No joy, no pleasure, no excitement, no interest. I'd see other people on the internet with depression and other mental illnesses and they do things, you know? They have dreams, they work, study, they want to learn, to see, to know, they care about things. And then you start feeling alone, thinking ""damn, am I really the only one who completely gave up on everything and has no ounce of motivation, energy or care?"""
577,"Hello, I don't know if I'm depressed, I've never even had a psychologist. But recently, I started just not feeling anything about any event in my life. I fail a class? ok. I lose my job? ok. I'm not happy, I'm not sad. I'm nothing. And I can't bring myself to do things, especially cleaning. My room is absolutely disgusting and it physically pains me to even think about cleaning. Even thought I hate living like this. I have to force myself into the shower when I have work in the morning. I don't want to talk to anyone about this, most of my friends didn't see a change. When I go to work or talk to friends I act like my normal happy self that never sees bad in the world."
578,"So, in September I started a new university course.

Over the months, my mental health took a huge hit. I am in the process of deferring but it has been advised that I finish my assessments for the current semester. I done everything I could to submit several of them, but I have a huge one due in a few days and I haven't even started it because I honestly cannot bring myself to combat it. I have no energy, I wake up feeling exhausted and I have no motivation or care to even look after myself let alone do a huge assignment. It makes me feel worse knowing I'm letting the hours pass without even trying to do this assignment, but even when I sit there staring at it - I do nothing. I try to talk to the people I have close to me, but their advice is to just keep trying and 'get it done'.

I feel pathetic, and kind of just want someone to turn around and say it's ok if I don't get a stupid assignment done.
I am more than a grade.

The fact that the people around me are only seeing all the things that I am no longer doing or able to do rather than acknowledging that I am so mentally unwell right now makes me feel so horribly alone. I feel as though everyone is so used to me getting things done that they're not really sure how to react now that I've fallen so low and are expecting me to just sort it out myself and the fact that I'm failing to do that leaves me feeling even worse.
 
The fact that something so stupid makes me feels so upset when there's so much 'worse' that could be happening is something that I really battle with too. But, I feel as though not being able to compartmentalise and sort my life out is so unlike me that it just cements the feeling of disconnect between myself battling depression and who I was/am without it, if that makes sense?

Depression really sucks to say the least - and I just needed a place to get it out my system when no one around me really understands. Honestly, thank you to anyone who reads this and has something positive to say, I really appreciate it."
579,"Is filling of emotions, lack of libido, lethargy more associated with Lithium or Remeron
(Mirtazipine?)
I'm hoping it is the Lithium as I am reducing it. Feel quite groggy in the mornings also."
580,"I am well. I was in a very bad place shortly after lockdown. I was treated in hospital for psychosis / agitated depression for almost three months. It was bad and I was put on a range of sedatives and tried various anti- depressants.
I left hospital on Lithium and Mirtazipine, a tiny fraction of the meds I was on while in hospital.

Now that I am better, I’m grateful.
But I hate the fact that I am being ""drugged to sleep"" Am I over-reacting?

But – should I still be worrying about the fact that I AM sleeping?

I’m told that neither Mirtazipine or Lithium are addictive. They are not viewed as sleep meds, I know, but they might be helping indirectly, off - label , so to speak.

However, I feel torn – glad that I can sleep – and unhappy that is not a natural , “unaided” sleep. Like it is a form of cheating.

I fear the sedative effects of Mirtazipine and Lithium wearing off and being left unable to sleep.

My negative mind says to me – “you’re only sleeping because of the meds” !!!!!!!

I’d love to know if there was someone out there in my position, who can advise me somehow. Someone who has been in hospital for a long period like me, and managed to get back to regular , normal sleep.

Am I over- reacting here? Should I just take the meds – forget about it and to hell with the consequences? 
I fear I'm psychologically addicted if not physical."
581,"I've been having a rough time for awhile. I get up times, but feel lousy again. How I feel is keeping me from some of my goals and wanting relationships. I still keep busy with hobbies and part time work though. My sleep issues with voices and dreams are bothersome. I think that keeps triggering my anxiety. I recently had a psychatrist say it's normal if your stressed. I'm trying hard to find relief from this. I'm not sure if this is depression or not. I tried online tests and the results vary."
582,"Im just venting here

I feel so worthless
I lay in bed depressed
I spend hours re-thinking circumstances and trying to break down the why’s
The conclusion I always end up at is that I’m a terrible person
My personality is like a buzzing black fly
Know one likes flies
I’m flawed and broken 
And people around me see it
My husband doesn’t want to be home
He wants to live life and have fun with his friends and family 
To get away from me
I’m left with all the responsibility
Bills, cleaning, cooking, laundry, baking cookies with the children, buying presents, planning Christmas dinner - alone
I have a full time job too
I’m not his servant or his maid
I need help (in more ways than one!)
I get angry and tell him how I feel
He wants to leave even more
We are polar opposites 
I’m logical, calculating, reserved, detailed, responsible, cold
He’s carefree, happy, friendly, irresponsible, warm
He doesn’t want to take care of life’s necessities
He’s happy to leave it all on my shoulders 
I try so hard to be more like him
But my brain and heart know it’s forced
I try to spend time with his family
Mine are all gone or far away
I feel constant anxiety and rejection 
His sisters are beautiful 
They won many pageants as children
All blonde haired and blue, almond-shaped eyes
Men stare 
His mother’s expectations were shattered when he chose me
I don’t fit in
He said no to children for me - he has two already. He doesn’t want the restraints of a baby
Oh well, I wouldn’t want to bring a child into the world like me or like my parents. It would have our DNA
My parents were black flies
My dad was abusive
My mother was cold and neglectful
No I love you’s were ever given. No hugs to be found. Only fake love when someone was looking
Head battered against the wall
Face punched, nose bloodied, busted lips
Belt down the back and legs as I am forced into the front leaning rest for an hour
The belt was his favorite though switches were an easy find if a belt wasn’t available 
They liked crack cocaine, and of course hard liquor
Not a good mix for an Indian and Irish blooded man
Fostercare in the mix
I met many other broken flies
Uhhhh no good ever comes from reminiscing 

I came into this relationship broken
I can’t love him like he deserves
So he doesn’t want to be home
He’s stuck. So why does he stay? Why doesn’t he just call it quits? 
There are many fish in the sea
No one would judge him
Some would even celebrate 
His mother and father surely would. I don’t belong 
For all my abilities of analytical thinking, I can’t answer why he stays? 
Sometimes I think that I should do him a favor and leave- set him free
I could go back to FL
My parents are gone. The weather is always sunny. It’s so dark here.
I have dark thoughts
But I’m a coward and I fear Gods judgement and hell
My brother wasn’t a coward
A result of our broken childhood
Life was too hard. The devil got him.
His heart was so soft. He was kind, not a fly
I loved him more than anyone on earth!
My heart was shattered into a million pieces. It’s been nine years last October 
I still cry like a baby, a gallon jug isn’t big enough. A trough would be needed
People don’t understand me or why I am the way I am.
People like to judge and take things personal 
They’re the victim of my meanness
My husband says I’m cold
I just cry when I’m by myself. To get it out so I don’t follow through with the dark thoughts the devil plants
I just cry, at home alone in my bed
My pillow is tear-stained"
583,"Hi All

This is the first time I'm doing something like this so bare with. 

Since I was 11, I've had 6 operations down below, and to be fair to myself, I've bottled it up and kept that lid closed. In 2020, particularly this week, I don't know what has happened but I'm finding myself asking, why do I want to be here anymore. My story continues:

I was admitted twice into A&E as I was mis-diagonsed. Turns out that there is so much blood being pumped that my sperm is overheating, meaning that in the future, I probably won't be able to have children. On top of that, (and you will hopefully get me if you have a pet), my 15 year companion was going into heart failure. I made the decision to put him down on Friday. I was basically my cats carer, needed 9 tablets a day for the last 2 months, but was also the one constant I could talk too. I would be relieved of all stress. Now he's gone, I'm thinking I can't cope - but I also know deep down that this isn't the case. 

I havent a clue what to do. I am the support pillar for the family. Last year I cared for my mum who went through cancer and thankfully is in remission this year, but I just keep getting knocked down. Do I even have a mental health issue or am I blowing things up way out of proportion?"
584,"I feel really ill. Not sick, but butterfly feeling in my stomach, big headache. Everyone seems to be so fucking jolly, all the time. Whether they’re putting on a fake ’smile’ or whatever, I always seem to be an anomaly whenever there is a sesh or something. I try to stay happy and not seem like I’m deep in my own shit but after a while it just catches me up and I can’t help myself and I just enter this pit. I just stare at the wall, am easily sidetracked by stuff in my head and I don’t know what to do. I don’t ever think anything is as bad as it probably is, so I would never speak to someone properly about this, I guess i’m in denial. Everyone seems to have their own group chats, have their own sly digs at everyone else, and I seem to be left I’m the dust. Maybe its because I went to uni and everyone else stayed and saw each other, but even still, I’ve known these people for a long time, so I shouldn’t feel like this. I wouldn’t even be able to pinpoint the beginning of these shitty emotions, just one day recently, all this shit just entered my head. I wouldn’t even say it was at the beginning of lockdown, because I was still with M, probably the closest I’d been with Konnor in a while, my family weren’t at home so I wasn’t being constantly annoyed by them, I had left my god awful job. It’s probably more recently, when, as I already said, people seem to be doing more without me and having private FaceTimes and shit. I really hate to admit it, because its such a petty and childish emotion, but I am jealous. I guess another word for it is FOMO, just hate ‘being the outcast’. Its in quotation marks because I know its only me that sees it that way. Whenever everyone else does stuff, laughs about something I don’t get, they aren’t thinking about how I feel. Its selfish, yeah it is. However, I feel like my whole life, with some exceptions, I try to be as selfless as I can. Going out my way to try and keep everyone happy, checking up on people who don’t do the same thing for me. 2nd year Sixth Form was the most damaging for me, losing so many close friends, feeling like I’m constantly in ‘beef’ and yet I still tried to keep everyone happy. R, V, M, J, D, K, Y - all people I considered my closest ‘boy-mates’ at some stage in these recent years. How many am I properly friends with now? 2/3 of them max. They each had their beefs with each other, and at times, I felt like I was in the shittest situation being mates with them all. For example, if one day I went out with J by myself, I knew the others would get salty, I would feel the same. But it was so unfair that they had a go at me for it. As much as I probably didn’t show it, that really affected me. I always tried to put my friends first, but sometimes it bit me in the arse. This is why I feel I deserve to be a little bit selfish, just to fuck everyone off for a while and sort myself out. The reason I wanted to go to uni was so I could have a fresh start, leave everything from my city behind. All of the people I have annoyed, lost, forgotten about, just leave that shit behind and start over. I think meeting all those new people, who know nothing about me, who’re going through the same ‘new beginning’ shit as me, really benefitted my mental health. It was a breath of fresh air. Having to come home killed me. I obviously missed family and friends from here, but returning  meant coming back to all of the old, shitty memories, beef, pettiness etc. I know the same can be said about me, 100%, but it seems nobody has grown up. The same shit seems to be happening, day in day out. I seem to be in a constant cycle of distracting myself by getting football booted at me, to then going home and being deeply upset again. Trying to get back into cycling again, helped momentarily with staying distracted, but the emotions soon catch back up to me. Of a night time, I regularly stare at the ceiling, listening to the same songs on repeat, thinking why/how things have gone so wrong in these last few years. Again, it seems like peoples’ lives are just progressing and getting better - getting into relationships, getting promotions - and it seems mine is still just stood still. I do find going out for drives by myself, listening to my favourite music, exercise and weirdly, hitting things, helps with my mental state. I have so much more going on inside my head, which I’m trying to figure out and fight back against, this is just a start. I hope writing things down will help not just me, but others see that this shit happens, all the time. I think I need help, but I don’t know how to go about it right now."
585,Music is a great thing which can be used to relief our stress. And it gives us many benefits to keep our mind more calm and smooth. So it also prevent us from getting with depression. Here is such kind of music track which I mentioned above

587,Christmas is cancelled all thanks to boris I can't stop crying people say it's only temporary but it's not don't know how much more I can take of this
588,"I am writing because lately I have been feeling very overwhelmed. I am married to a man who is a constant nag and the uninterrupted companionship since the start of the pandemic is really starting to take its toll. I cannot handle him 24/7 and it seems as though through his perspective, I cannot seem to do anything right. I am feeling trapped in my own life ... my job is incredibly stressful and my personal life does nothing to alleviate that stress.

Feeling like my life is very mechanical ... I work insane hours with insane people all to just buy things that don't even make me happy. It does warm my  hear that at least I am able to help out my family financially during these challenging times ... but that's about the only ray of light.

I guess this is just my venting ... and finally looking for an outlet for my bottled up feelings of sadness and dissatisfaction. 

Thank you for listening."
589,"Lately I've been feeling overwhelming feelings of stagnation and worthlessness. I'm naturally a spiritual person and have New Age beliefs but also am a sufferer of depression and anxiety. This crisis has caused me mental turmoil and has me thinking suicidal thoughts. I've been frequently putting myself down for not knowing how to deal with my depression better. Any advice for staying productive and optimistic while soldiering out of a depression? Thank you, I wish you all the best!"
590,"I keep telling myself I need to stop talking to him. Or else he will find out I am unemployed, no talents, and the only hobbies I'm capable of are editing video game videos. With my phone. I'm not trying to feel sorry for myself, but my circumstance makes it hard not to. Every time I start talking to a potential partner, I feel pressured to invest my time in non stop ""self improvement"" which ends up in anxiety and guilt rather than genuine self improvement. I can't help I was born with a disability, I'm not wired for this world.

Can anyone here relate?"
591,"I'm a right old cry baby tonight. I have been thinking back over my time here and worrying about everything and people too. I hope you are all doing well. I wish we were all sitting face to face, sharing cake and coffee and tea. I'm so glad i joined the forum and i really enjoy being around the forum too. 

Christmas is coming and i hope you are all planning something nice, even if it is just you on your own, the forum is here, i am sure i will log in at some point. I come on when i feel a bit restless or stressed out as it is an outlet for me too. 

It has been quite a year! 2021 who knows what will happen but i will continue to get up each day and try to get through it, hopefully doing something positive. I have been fairly well illness-wise but still a few worries that get me down. I hope that next year your lives will be a bit easier too. Things do get better with each year that passes so we have to keep moving forwards. Life goes by very quickly and that makes me feel better. 

Have a peaceful Christmas, although it has been Christmas since 1st December ;) the day itself has a little more pressure. Just another Winter's Day though :)

Even breathing seems difficult

593,"Hi, guys and girls. 
I wanted to ask you if any have experienced the same. 
I can't make friends easily or maintain them. 
Thing is I can't trust on people even on my family to express my feelings. And I have noticed, when i trust someone and that someone hurts me someway, somehow, I abruptly stop trusting in that someone. And even if that someone didn't broke my trust, just hurt me. 
And as hard as I try I just can't make it better. 
Happened with my sister, my family and friends I lost. 

Wondering, have something like this happened to one of you guys?"
594,"Wasn't sure where to put this but here goes. I had a text through from my GP surgery asking me to make an appointment. I rang and told the receptionist about the text etc and was quite surprised when she said it was about a letter from the mental health team. Surely she shouldn't know the reason for the Dr wanting to see me or am I just naive?

595,feeling lost. Not sure what the future holds for me. Had therapy today spoke about childhood which left me feeling low. Just sitting here drinking and don’t really no what to do. My life is a mess
596,"I  was diagnosed with MDD/PTSD/Anxiety three years ago and taken out of a military theater of operation overseas (Army) because I was going to end it all. I have now been in therapy for three years and feel like nothing has changed. I am still worthless, low low self esteem, SH always on my mind as punishment for being a horrible person, constant failure, someone who doesn’t deserve to be happy let alone live, would end it all but I fear that I may fail at that as well, and feel that I am a “let down” to my family because I am unable to meet their needs. Therapy has taught me that I am sensitive to narcissistic people and that’s about it. Is there anything better out there? I guess thoughts of harming myself, ending it all, memmories of failure, and bullying are simply the building blocks of the structure that separates me from the rest of the world and are a part of my psychie now. Is there anything out there to help remove these feelings/behaviors before it’s just to late?"
597,"Hi, this is my first post here.
I’m in my late 50s and on face of it have everything I guess, but I’m incredibly lonely and unhappy. I always worked in high stress jobs and took responsibility seriously etc, anyway looking after everyone else meant I didn’t look after me I think. I have house, pensions etc, but now no job and I’m living away and it’s isolating, my 16 year marriage has not been physical for past 10 years. I played a video game to destress  and formed an amazing relationship with a woman who is besotted with me but lives in USA but it’s kind of difficult to maintain and has many highs and lows as she is quite emotional and with everthing (being married of course and travel restriction) I haven’t been able to see her ever in 2 + years. It’s just nothing is working out, my future is either slave to an unsatisfactory marriage, divorce and hope I can maintain things with the on line lady or lose both (highly likely) and end up with no friends and completely alone. I’m alone 90% of time now anyway, but I know it’s not good for me, I am starting to have dark thoughts ....like what is the point and nothing will work out. My upbringing wasn’t warm, with highly critical mother and I think I crave the love I never had. the thought of never experiencing true intimate love before I die really hurts me and everything else in life doesn’t matter....money etc, I don’t know what I should do, no one to confide in or advise .....that’s how sad I am now"
598,"Don’t know if anyone else thinks like this

couple years ago when Anthony bourdain took
His life, it really affected me .I admired him greatly.   I had read a lot of his personal
And mental struggles 

I was discussing it at the bar shortly after... and a man commented on how selfish bourdains act was.  Especially for his family

I don’t see it that way.  I know what it’s like to be so broken mentally that you feel like a complete burden to your loved ones.  I’m in such a bad state right now.... I can see the fatigue on my wife’s face      She’s dealing with the same financial and personal problems I am... but she has the added weight of trying to carry this horribly depressed person through her life
It has to be fucking awful... and makes me feel even worse than I already do

I want to prop her up and tell her we’ll make it through.... but I can barely get out of bed or function

I honestly believe in my heart.... that after the initial shock period of losing me.... at some point in her future it would be like a huge weight off her if I was gone. 

ive seen it happen to people that have lost loved ones that were hard people to live with in some way.  Eventually their lives can be so much better without the human baggage they’ve been attached to"
599,i have had luck with ssris in the past to help my depression and anxiety. for a while now i have not had any luck at all relieving it. i have tried quite a few different antidepressants with no luck. theres no drive and nothing to look forward to and all i feel is guilt and anxiety and just everything opposite of happyness. my mother is getting older and i should be helping her out. i have had my own issues going on which is preventing me from helping. did anyone else take an ssri and was helped out by them but than they lost its effect? did you have to try something lamictal or different type of antidepressant. what was your treatment option that kicked in i need someone to relate to all stories are appreciated to over come this what is your experience?
600,"So yesterday, I had shared a post here and I got really kind replies from people here and honestly, it made me feel a little better; like a weight was lifted off my chest. 

I had a tough morning at work today and even though I was in a very strong mind to just ditch work, I faced everything and dealt with it. Which is quite okay and since it's been dealt with, I don't need to worry for a while. 

I was feeling reasonably okay since the morning- handling my work okay-ish. I received a bit of heat from my direct superiors but that's fair because I was lagging behind at my work (I had 3-4 days of on-going depressive episodes). I would be lying if I said that I don't worry that I will be sacked.

A lot is riding on this job, to be honest. This job is my ticket to get out of the city. It's well paid and the work culture is good but most importantly, this job lets me finally leave the city and be financially independent. If I lose this, it'll be a huge set-back in my life. I know that. I recognize that and I am willing to do what it takes to change the current scenario. At times, I am even positive about it. 

I am willing to work on it... but just now, I don't know what happened, but I felt that switch flip in me and suddenly I can't do it anymore. Everything is too much and I am very overwhelmed again. I feel dumb and inconspicuous. I feel like I am being looked down upon and that there is no chance that I am going to get through this. I feel extremely demotivated and trapped and all of this is happening in a matter of just an hour. I was just fine an hour ago. 

Anything anyone says feels like an attack and I am generally good at taking criticisms but not in these times. Any hint of criticism and I feel like there is no way I can get back up and face the world.

I feel unworthy and quite frankly plain shitty. 

Is there anything that can be done about this?"
601,"I just have a question and would like some opinions. I had a major depression with a suicide attempt and was hospitalised for the main part of three months. During hospital, to sleep, had a combination of Benzos and zorclone. After leaving hospital, I was on a small dose of Xanax and a prescription of Lithium and Mirtazipine.  
Now, 4 months after hospital, things are OK. However, I am extremely worried about sleep. I am sleeping- but feel that it is the Lithium - Mirtaz which is sedating me.
I'm very, very worried about becoming dependent on medications to sleep. I know that Lithium and Mirtazipjne are not sleeping pills. But they have a sedative effect. 
So, I'm a little stressed at the moment thinking how I am dependent on ""pharmacological sleep""
Has anyone out there had an experience where they took meds long term for sleep?
If so,it it POSSIBLE to live / sleep without them?After taking sleep meds,did you go back to normal?
 Would love to hear some of your opinions."
602,"Hi all.

A little background...

I was born into an abusive family so ended up going into care at age 6. I was passed around the system until I turned 18. I was referred to CAMHS at a young age for various issues, including an eating disorder. I made a suicide attempt in my teens which led to hospital admission. I was put on fluoxetine which helped a lot. I took myself off them after I started to feel better.

Fast forward to 2020. I moved to a new area of the country in February for a new job. Lockdown came in March and, having no family and little friends to connect with, I became depressed again. I spoke to the doctors who put be back onto fluoxetine. These didn't help with my mood and gave me bad tinnitus. I then tried sertraline. No help from these, and the tinnitus continued. I was then put onto mirtazapine. The tinnitus went and I started to feel better. Until the weight gain started.

I spoke to the GP about my weight gain about 2 months ago. I asked if I can swap the mirtazapine. She told me that weight gain is a common side effect of mirtazapine, but the answer was no. She told me to make lifestyle changes. I told her I was eating the same as I always had. Still the answer was no.

I called the GP's again today and managed to speak to a different doctor. She was as cold and unfriendly as the last. I told her I have now put on 3 stone/19 kg since I started mirtazapine and that I am now classed as overweight according to BMI. I told her about my previous history with food. I told her I feel disgusted with myself and that I don't want to eat. Whenever I do, I feel guilty/ashamed. She didn't sound bothered. I asked if I can start a new medication. She told me that doctors can only prescribe three antidepressants (fluoxetine, sertraline, mirtazapine) which I'm pretty certain is not true. She told me that if none of those three work, then there's ""not much else we can do""!

I have, through gritted teeth, agreed to go back onto sertraline just to stop the weight gain. But they didn't help my mood last time round and I feel 10x worse now than I did then. I'm stuck. Depressed, fat, lonely, and fearing a return of tinnitus that will stop me from sleeping. I don't want to eat but I'm scared of going down that road again.

What can I do?"
603,"Hello.
I really don't know where else I can ask that question, but...
I don't know where to ask help. I don't have money to go to the doctor, I have no friends, family doesn't support me. I know only one way out and it's not enjoyable. Maybe someone dealt with that. I feel so hopeless."
604,"Hello,

This place is my last resort. I just generally looked up depression forums online to be able to discuss this problem with people who might be going through the same thing that I am going through and maybe even get some help somehow.

To be absolutely honest, I don't know what's wrong with me. I call it depression, but it's not just sadness I am worried about. It's a little bit of everything.

I am 25 years old. I recently completed my masters and started working in a company with a very good work culture. I recently battled out of a very bad heartbreak and I am over it. If you would look at my life circumstantially, I am doing fine.

But I am not. Every day I am battling thoughts of somehow killing myself in the most painless ways possible. Most days I visualise killing myself. It scares me. It all scares me and I want to sit down and cry and forget the world. I feel like crying right now as I am typing this.

I don't know what is wrong with me. I used to be a very motivated person as a teenager. I had all these ambitions, all these high hopes. I WORKED HARD. I used to study Japanese as well as go to college as well as do part-time jobs to have money. I used to be able to do stuff. I had so much potential. I used to read, write (I'd wanted to be an author), draw, dance. I used to DREAM. I used to know exactly where I was in life and I used to know exactly where I wanted to be and I would just...know that I'd get there. I had that self-assurance.

Disillusioned: Today, every day I am not sure if I will live to see another day. It's like I have lost control of myself. It's like my mind has become my enemy and any given day, I might just realize my visualization. I don't know where I am going and I don't know where I am. I feel like I have strayed away and now I am completely and utterly lost. I don't see a future with me and that scares me so damn much.

Constant paranoia: I'm scared of people and most of all, I am scared of me. I am just constantly scared of everything. Every day I am worried that someone will do something, say something that will send me down the rabbit hole. Every day I am scared of myself wondering when I will fall off the edge again. I'm scared that I don't see my future at all.

Lagging behind in everything: I don't do anything. I have an amazing job. I have a handful of good friends. I have so many books. I have all the materials I need to draw. I have all the materials I need to indulge myself in forms of arts. But I am way behind in my office. I have so much work piled up and I don't do anything even though I know it's heading towards a nasty direction. All my books are just collecting dust and turning yellow. I think my paint materials have gone hard already. All I do all day is compulsively scroll through social media and watch series.

Decreased intelligence: I also happen to feel like my brain has slowed down. Simple things feel so very hard. I used to be able to do lots of things together and now I'm just... somehow here. I used to think that as long as I can read it, I will be able to figure it out. Now, no matter how many times I read something, understanding comes very very late, comprehension comes much later.

Everything is too hard: Everything is too hard. Reading, writing, working, understanding something, talking to someone, socializing... thinking. My body feels heavy and breathing is a task. I can't deal with anyone at all and I used to be a fierce person. I know it. I used to be able to talk myself out of any situation. I was so adaptable. I almost envy myself.

I want to live. I have tried to seek help but somehow none of the therapists has clicked with me. I can't do that anymore. My family tries to be understanding of me but they don't know what it's like, so they can't be understanding all the time. I feel like isolating myself completely. I feel guilty for feeling this way because I have everything, more than some people do yet I am here, constantly visualizing killing myself. This is such a long post and I am worried no one is going to read it whole and I will never get a solution.

I want to live. I really want to live. But I just can't live feeling like this anymore. I don't know what to do. I've exhausted all my other options.

There is always a voice in my head, literally, crying ""please help me"" but who can help me with something so perilous, so difficult yet so invisible. I literally hear ""please help me"" in my head but I don't know who I can relay that cry for help to. I don't want to be like this. I want to live. I want to stop feeling this and I am so very scared."
605,"for years when i was in my young teen years mind you i am older than my step brother, he treated me so horribly, he bullied me, called me so many names, i brought it up to my mom a couple days ago and she tells me forget about it, get over it, do you know what a brother bullying your own sister does to a person's emotions every freaking time i am around him, all the things he freaking said to me i have low self esteem from that emotional problems, and she wants me to forget and get over it! that is not something you say to your daughter, i've also been bullied in school around the time he did that and he knew and made what i felt about myself worse, if my mom reads this ""hey i get it he's your favorite child for some reason but have a dang heart woman or i am as good as dead to you"" i feel like i am going to have a nervous breakdown when he's around. i hate it"
606,Hi on Friday I was working at other site and made a huge mistake which they know about I can't relax and don't want to go in tommorow feel like I wish I wasn't here anymore
607,"I am struggling with depression.
I think loneliness might have a lot to do with it as well. I just get tired of it."
608,"Not sure where to go at this point, i'm a 27 year old male, (28 next week) and i've accomplished nothing with my life.

Basically I've been severely depressed since around 16 and every year was a year i wanted to die but never had the balls to actually do it, I don't like pain and everyway to do it is painful.

So my story, okay, around 10 years ago (17) i got heavily into steroids because my mother was overprotective and would always want me home by like 9 am, so my friends became distant and I really had no one, they would all party, etc..

So i got into the gym and found steroids, i never really wanted to do anything with my life because i kept thinking i'd be dead in a few years, now i'm old and still working the same dead end job that i'm sick of, i also got heavily into everything bad you can think of, i started gambling, was so in debt until this year, got out, but have no money to my name.

I keep thinking if i would of lived at home and saved money, i'd have 200k by now, but nope, i have nothing, but keep thinking that's okay i'll be dead soon.

Flash forward to last year i started having shortness of breath and other issues, got diagnosed with a disease i will not name which is manageable. But apparently now, they ruled the shortness of breath down to anxiety, or so i thought, we recently found out i have heart problems, not sure how bad but i did an echo, and ecg and my family doctor got the results and said they were ""concerning"", me the guy i am not caring about dying wouldnt even call my cardiologist but he finally called and i have an apt tuesday, so not sure what its going to be about

but over the last year i completely came off of steroids and lost tons of weight, body image has always been a huge problem to me, and hearing people at this dead end grocery store job constantly tell me i'm looking ""skinny"" or getting ""thin"" really screws with my head.

It's not even that its the fact that people getting hired are so much younger than me now, i remember when i started at 17 and i was one of the youngest, now a few years later i realize how much older i am than these people, i don't really get along with them, i'm not hated at work, but with the people that's been there for a long time and seeing me lose over 50 pounds due to having to come off steroids, i feel like i can never move on with my life, everyone there has left, went to school.. etc..

I've worked there so long and i just hate it for no real reason, it's an easy job and i get paid, but i feel like if i got another job at another grocery store, met new people, etc, life would be better, not sure why.

I'm just so sick of the same things everyday, i didn't plan on living this long, bet everything away gambling, and what do you know, i'm still here? but maybe not i finally have a heart problem, i'm off steroids now and people constantly remind me how bad my body looks now by calling me thin, i feel like i can't move on if i stay at the same place

It's not as bad since i'm at home living with my mom still (embarassing i know)

so even having 0$ isn't really an issue, i can get a student loan and go to school in september, but problem is i'm not interested in anything, i still just want to die, but i don't want to die, this whole heart thing has made me quit steroids, which i might go back on if people keep saying my body looks that much worse, etc, it's hard to explain since im not sure how many males are on this website but males and eating disorders aren't really a common thing unless it's anorexia.

I've never really been diagnosed with anything but i am pretty anti social and never wanted to talk to anyone my doctor told me too, so i recently just got prescribed random anti depressants that don't really do anything.

I just feel like i wasted my life and it's too late now to do anythiing, not sure what the news of my heart will be on tuesday but i'm not so lost on what to do, the only thing that will truly solve everything in my life is death

every problem i'v ever had will be gone, it's not like i have a girlfriend or anything to worry about or will ever have one with the amount of problems i have, nor do i really want one, i really do hate people in general

thanks for listening and any advice if you actually read any of this is appreciated, i just want to dissapear, i hate this city,i hate the people, i hate everything

especially this job even though i'm pretty well liked for the most part, but the age of everyone in general is close, most are like 18-22ish, and there i am now at like 28 almost.. i just don't fit in/belong anymore, plus they've seen me at like my peak of the gym and i can't escape my own thoughts let alone hearing their comments on my body daily."
609,"This place has helped me SO much

but I’m headed back down a bad path and I’m not a very strong person

I tried a free mental health / suicide line yesterday    They really were nice,and they’re really doing what they can
But... it’s sort of like people reading a self-help script.   If I was in better shape... it might help but I just hung up

because of depression, I’ve pushed most people away.  I don’t have friends
I’m ok with that actually but In bad times....I have no people to lean on.

I have no insurance, so doctors and therapists aren’t an option

Sorry.  I can really ramble.  I’m not even sure what I’m asking 
A close friend on this forum got me through the weekend..... I crashed this morning and woke up in a very dark place.   I don’t know what to do with myself.

610,"I’m not okay. I’m so depressed. Ever since Wednesday night I’ve barely been able to do anything but cry and lie down. I feel so horrible. I feel like a burden. My whole body aches. I feel sick. I feel mentally ill. I feel like this world wasn’t made for people like me. I’m a scared, sad bird. And the wind is too overwhelming. I might be losing some hope. I need more help but I don’t know how to ask for it. I don’t even know what I need. I feel like I’m drowning alone and I’m worried nobody can or wants to help. Because at some point, you’re expected to be better. I hate it when I get asked how I am now. The answer is never going to be positive. Everyone is dealing with so much- I feel like I can’t open my mouth and divulge just how painful and difficult every day is. And my husband has had a hard time with helping me and witnessing what I’ve been going through this year. Even though I still confide in him, I feel like I can’t without worrying I’ll be a burden. 
I don’t want advice or a perspective change. I just want to be heard and understood and accepted."
611,"uhh so depression just upped and left the chat all of a sudden bc things have been looking up for me recently, bUT, without the numb void of apathy to drown out my worries, i'm an anxious wreck. Which is a confusing situation to be in because usually having anxiety will make me depressed about it because it's incredibly limiting, but i feel weirdly optimistic about everything despite currently being in the worst anxiety spell i've ever experienced. Convinced i'm well on track to becoming my best possible self, but can't see the anxiety going away any time soon as i've had it on & off the whole of my adolescent life and in recent years it's begun to be triggered by the literal process of *having* a thought. (which makes mindfulness redundant because thinking about not thinking just perpetuates it lol)  

Maybe i'm just delusional and malnourished from being unable to stomach more than a piece of toast a day lmao but at least im a jolly bitch lmao"
612,"I decided to go see my brother tonight. I got on the freeway and got into a pretty bad wreck but I’m not hurt. I am shaken. My cars destroyed. I got arrested and because I stupidly went out with weed in my car, so I got a possession charge. I wasn’t high. I’d never endanger somebody’s life. I wasn’t going to drive home tonight either I was going to wait till tomorrow to drive home sober. In the most odd set of circumstances I go out and get fucked over in everu way. As if life couldn’t get any harder. I’m up to my neck in suicidal thoughts. I really think I might do it now because I was barely staying afloat. I have no idea how I’ll make it now. I’m not saying this is it, but life just got much worse and I’m going to have further societal trust issues and a much harder time in life. I don’t know. I don’t know if I should pray. Sometimes I feel like when I try to do right I get wronged and when I mess up I get wronged. I don’t know."
613,"Hi everyone.  I've always struggled with my mental health and my teenage years and early 20's were hell until I worked up the courage to go to my doctor and seek help. I was put on 20mg Citalopram when I was 23 and have been on it ever since (I'm now 40). It has been a lifesaver for me. I've never had any side effects and it basically keeps my mood stable and lets me function like a normal human being. A couple of times over the years I've wondered if I still need to be on it and have tried to wean myself off it but I've had to go back on it after my mental health seriously declined to the point I was suicidal. Since the last attempt at coming off it my doctor was of the opinion that I would have to stay on it long term to keep my mood stable and my depressive symptoms at bay. I was fine with this and my mental health has been stable for the past 10 years. 

Almost 2 years ago I moved to a new town with my husband and had to register with a new surgery. Within weeks of registering I was contacted and told I needed to go for a medication review. I was told at the appointment that I had been on antidepressants for too long and I needed to wean myself off them. I was told to reduce my dose from 20mg to 10mg and then after 6 months stop completely. Within a couple of months of reducing the dose by half all my symptoms returned and I felt awful. I went back to the doctor and my dose was increased back up to 20mg and I started feeling like myself again. Fast forward 6 months and I was again contacted by the surgery and told I needed to have a medication review. Again at the review I was told I needed to try and come off my medication so again my dose was halved and again within a few months all my symptoms had returned but worse than the last time - I felt suicidal which scared me. So off I go again back to the doctor, again my dose has been increased back up to 20mg and again I've been told it will be reviewed in 6 months. I asked the doctor at my last appointment if I'm going to have to keep going through this with my dose going up and down and she basically said they don't like people being on antidepressants long term so they always try to get people off them. I don't understand why when they work so well for me they want me to come off them. If I had a physical condition that was successfully treated with medication would they tell me I needed to stop taking the medication which was helping me? I don't think they would. I can't face the thought of basically living like this - having my dose increased and decreased every 6 months, it's really not good for my mental health, the past 2 years have been horrible. What makes it worse is that's it's all so unnecessary - my mental health was fine before they started messing with my medication. 

What can I do? Can I make a complaint? Should I move to a different surgery?"
614,"Sorry for my english, im not native english speaker

So this is my story:
I don't usually look at porn because I think it's a waste of time and energt, but i was depressed and I needed some kind dopamine. So I went to a porn site, it has been almost 2 weeks since I saw a particularly disturbing image and I have never feel more depressed in my life, I keep having horrible intrusive thoughts about the image. Intrusive thoughts that go against all my beliefs and morality, things I would never do. I feel alone, I feel Im the only one who has commited this stupid mistake.
This happened 2 weeks ago.

I was already depressed for about 1 month before that accident, but after that I have been feeling A LOT worse, bad like never in my life.
My mom noticed it and we went to the psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with moderate depression.
I have been stucked in my bed all day, feeling numb, disconnected, helpless, hopeless, insomnia and intrusive feelings about what I saw. I just feel horrible. I will begin to take meds, I really hope that helps because Im going to university in 3 months, if it doesn't work I don't know what Im gonna do.
Well thats my story, I wanted to share it with you
PS: I have not texted my ""couple"" since that, I don't want to lose my relationships. :cry:"
615,"So my whole life, I've always felt like an outcast from my peers... Like I was misunderstood, people thought I was weird. This was constant from primary school all the way until high school.. Which only ended for me 2 years ago... So these memories are fresh in my head. Throughout it all I told myself I was cool with it, but now I feel like I suppressed my feelings for too long and now they've caught up to me. I feel like I never said what I meant to say to people who made fun of me. And now I'm paying the price for it... 

It really does feel like people in school just wanted me to feel bad about myself... Everyone was really just picking on me... And what pisses me off even more is how these very same people say things like ""who wants to be normal?"" or ""embrace your weirdness"" then the next day devalue my existence because I dont fit into socieities idea of normal. I don't know if it's just loneliness that's got me dwelling on such things, but I just really hope I don't have to endure more of this going forward in life. I turned 21 years old yesterday, and I'm really not sure I can handle twenty one more years of this..."
616,"I went to the hospital last September over feeding feral cats that my neighbor didn’t like me doing.

I read some topic of people on the forum, and are too extreme for me to relate.

Even if sometimes Im really bad, and Ive been so bad in the past, I see life as a bright thing.

I have sense of humor this days (time ago I lost it).

Im up to have a light and easy conversation with someone.

For example, if I have the time to have a conversation with someone I wouldnt touch dark topics, Im not up to that, thats not what would round my mind, Ill preffer to talk about anything else.

I live with depression, but its not like something consumes my mind to an extreme.

Any other who transits depression like this ?"

I want to be on my own, I don’t want my partner to be around because everything he does is irritating me. I don’t even know if I want to be in the relationship or if that is just my depression trying to isolate me. I find that he is too much and I feel like I’m suffocating, I don’t know what to do."

620,I get very depressed when the winter comes or when it gets very dark early. I have tried Vitamin D but its not working or 5-HTP and it doesnt work either. Do you guys have any techniques on how to overcome this?
621,"Hello 

I'm a guy who had severe body image problems growing up I've aways been small and skinny, narrow shoulders and not very masculine in appearance. In addition I have low testosterone and a physical problem problem downstairs that cannot be improved with treatment. These only added to my low self esteem and body image issues. 

I avoided relationships completely until I was 28 but have been in one for just over 3 years. Now she's leaving and it's all come crashing down due to my physical problems. There's nothing I can do about these physical issues so Once again my body has ruined my life. 

I'm 32 have no friends and basically no one to provide any support. I've always had difficulty making and maintaining friends. She was my lover and best friend now I'm completely alone.

 I never asked to be born and especially to be born with physical, hormonal defects that render a normal happy life all but impossible. Who would choose to exist as such an inadequate person. Sometimes I feel like ending my life is a good, logical and sensible thing to do. I'm sick of this existence"
622,"Since 2014, I’ve been eating and purging my food out... I’d say at least 3 times a week sometimes more than once a day. I’ve lost over 50lbs. 

I’ve come to a point where I can’t do it anymore... it’s not just effecting my teeth, it’s my mental- it’s draining. It’s making me moody and snappy, agitated and so mean to everyone around me. 

I read online that an eating disorder and depression go hand in hand. So my question is where do I even begin to get help? If you can share your first experiences in getting help, please share."
623,I've tried ssris and effexor with some luck but they didn't last long term. I tried Wellbutrin witch did not help while on it even tho effexor was leaving me depressed and anxious I could feel massive withdrawal symptoms like weight-loss crying spells etc so I'm trying Zoloft 4 days in on the 2nd day it stopped the crying spells. But like the other srris I believe this one won't work as well as it should. I don't get any manic phases it's just persistent anxiety and depression.. I'm thinking maybe I should try lamictal what's your story?
624,"So I will try to briefly explain our situation without this being too long of a post. My boyfriend and I met back in 1999.  We have been together for 21 years.  During these years together I noticed that he would have times that he seemed unhappy.  I have noticed over the years that certain things seem to trigger this, such as a death in his family, family issues, or work stress.  He had three members of his family that truly seemed to care for him and would contact him often and they were two aunts and his grandmother.  Over the years he lost them all.  Now nobody in his family contacts him at all unless there is a death in the family or if they need something such as money.  None of his family calls him on his birthday or for any holidays, including Christmas.  It's very sad.  My parents have been more of a family to him than his own.  I have always tried to spoil him like my parents did me.  I try to make sure he has a very good Christmas with lots of presents and a fun birthday with cake, and I cook big Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners for just the two of us. He went on his first vacation ever when he met me and we go on a vacation every year now. 

Anyway whenever he would go through a family loss or whatever would seem to trigger his feeling unhappy, he becomes distant and always seems to redirect the feelings toward our relationship.  It is as if he can't explain what is causing him to feel this way so he blames the only thing he can think of it could be.  This has caused him to be unfaithful.  He came clean about it back in 2016 that he had been talking to a girl at work (who was married with problems in her marriage).  Apparently this was going on for about a year and I had no clue.  When he came clean about it I was devastated.  I have been loyal for all those years and to find out that he had cheated hurt so bad.  He swore he didn't have sex with her (he he did admit they kissed) but he connected with her, I assume because she was having her own problems and they had a lot to talk about.  I also found out about a couple of other girls he had talked or flirted with early on in our relationshop when he was feeling unhappy.  My boyfriend (ex-fiancé after what happened) and I don't have the intimacy that we used to have when we were younger. Part of this is my fault.  I have had issues with painful sex and dryness since my late 30's and the clinic I used to go to always made it seem that I was probably in early perimenopause and that I would just have to deal with it and to try lube. This has caused me to not have a sex drive and I thought it was something I would have to just live with.  But I have now found a place that seems concerned about my issue and she is giving me good health recommendations so hopefully I can get this issue resolved.  Another thing that he seemed down about is the fact that we never had kids.  I thought I wanted kids years ago but I always wanted to be married first, but he has never really wanted to get married.  He did give me a ring back in 2007 but that never led anywhere.  Over the years I lost the desire to have children.  One reason is I'm scared to death over actually having one because I have heard all the horror stories and I don't handle pain well. Another reason is that I never got married. 

I have read that when people have been together for a long time that sometimes the passion and intimacy tends to fade and it becomes more about companionship but in his case he doesn't take aging well.  He is 46 and feels he is old.  He gets depressed around his birthday also.  I think he has been going through a midlife crisis for years now.  Well after what happened in 2016 I went through a deep depression and I didn't know what to do.  We bought our house in 2010 and he is the breadwinner in the house and I can't afford a place with what my job pays right now.  Plus we have a lot of pets and I didn't know what I was going to do.  It wasn't until I told him that we were through that he seemed to wake up from his state and wanted me back.  We slept in separate rooms for months until finally we decided to work this out.  He finally went to a therapist for how he was feeling. They said he was suffering from depression. But he only went to see her twice  because he said it made him feel worse by going. She had referred him to a psychiatrist also so he could get on medication. He was on medication for a couple of months but never went back to the psychiatrist to get a refill because he felt it wasn't helping him and he didn't have insurance so he felt it was a waste of money and time.  Thankfully he came out of that state for the most part. 

Over the last 4 years we have been doing okay.  He would still have times that he seemed down but seemed to bounce back from it.  During this time we still don't have much intimacy.  The last time we had sex was probably near the beginning of the year.  He said it feels like too much work now and he just doesn't want to do it. This makes me feel bad because I feel like I'm too much work to enjoy.  I can't help that I'm older and not like I used to be. He also seems to have a decreased sex drive now.  He also gets very needy for attention.  I have pets in the home and he seems to get irritated sometimes when I tend to them in the evenings when he feels like I should be sitting there paying him all the attention or if I play on my phone while watching tv. 

A few weeks ago he told me on the phone while I was at work that he was unhappy with his life.  My heart sank because I knew he had gone back to that state of mind again.  He has been pushing me away since and does not want me to hug him, kiss him, or touch him at all, especially sexually.  If we talk on the phone during the day he doesn't have much to say at all.  He works for a major delivery courier service so this time of the year is peak season and always stressful but he received a promotion earlier this year that has him basically 2nd in command for his boss and he is now helping organize routes, deal with all the problems of the delivery drivers, reports directly to the main office with issues, and yet is still having to run a truck load of packages every day.  He literally will come home late in the evening and be bombarded with work texts and phone calls and spends time on his work laptop looking at the numbers for the day and the projected numbers for tomorrow.  He has been working 6 days a week and lately 7 days a week. So yes he is extremely stressed right now, but yet he won't admit it and he doesn't feel work is stressing him out.  So he directs those feelings of unhappiness towards us once again. 

Now if I try to do anything to make him happy or to help him out, he will tell me to stop trying so hard and that I wasn't trying so hard before.  He told me he just needs space right now and to just leave him alone.  So I am trying to give him space.  I still fix him dinner at night and try to talk to him, although right now we are not having much communication.  I tell him how proud I am of him at how he is managing things at work with his promotion and how he is such a good boss.  I don't really know what else to do at this point. 

It is very confusing for me because just a few months ago he surprised me with a gift bag that contained candy and my favorite perfume and a card thanking me for all that I do. He even stated a few months ago that I could go to part time at work since he is making good money.  I haven't done this because I don't want to lose my insurance but I have had my hours reduced due to the pandemic.  Well recently he found out about a death in his family.  Not anyone in his immediate family but someone he had fond memories with as a child.  A cousin of his left him a message telling him about it.  Since he found out, he seems to have spiraled into this depressed state again.  I think it is a combination of the work stress that he won't admit to and the death in the family.  It is all so confusing.  One minute he is giving me a token expressing how much he appreciates me and now he feels like I don't pay him much attention and it makes me feel so sad, hurt, and depressed because I don't know what to do for him especially since he won't admit that he isn't fine.  Sorry this has been so long.  I actually tried to make it as short as possible because there is so much more I could write about.  Any helpful words or encouragement is appreciated.  And thank you all for allowing me to write about his here."
625,So been in and out of hospital after taking 4 overdoses. I feel completely worthless. But can’t keep going round in circles
626,"Hey, Im 24 years old. When I was just 12 we moved to Macedonia a country in east europe, I grew up in Canada until 12. I got bullied here so I turned to drugs and alcohol in high school.

I tried to make a friend to talk and feel better, and I haven't even mentioned that I have depression and already stop answering me. 
And, I'm just afraid and alone."
629,"Hello, did anyone read the book ""Reasons to Stay Alive"" by Matt Haig?
He described that his depression suddenly came from one day to the other. He got stressed out so much by it that he had to throw up. I also experienced this. My very first depression stressed me out to the point I had to throw up. But this means that it was the anxiety, the fear that made me throw up, isn't it? Or this this ugly feeling of depression make me throw up? Not quite sure. Also, did anyone in here experience the same thing? I would really like to talk :)
Have a nice day everyone!"
630,"This morning... still dark out...went for a long walk to try to feel better
Less hopeless/ less like a loser

things coming at me and my wife are about to get
Much worse ( if that’s even possible)

I wanted to take my own life
I couldn’t even do it
I fucking can’t even do that correctly"
631,"Hello. I’ve never posted anything on a forum in my life before, but I’m feeling so bad in myself right now, that I feel I need some answers if possible. 
I’m an 18 year old male, and I have Aspergers. For a great portion of my life, I’ve suffered from anxiety, and some episodes of depression in my early teenage years, but they’ve all never lasted long. I’ve always been very, very creative, a huge reason I studied art and Photography at college. My imagination has always been very strong from what I can remember from a young age, I’m not sure if my Aspergers is a reason for this or not. 

So, I guess I’ll explain what’s happened lately. For the past couple of months before feeling the way I do now, I have been dealing with some stress. I’ve been learning to drive, and because I’m such a ‘perfectionist’ in all that I do, whenever I made a mistake in my driving, I would beat myself up about it all day mentally, Even until the next morning. I’ve recently had a falling out with my older brother, and because I’m very quiet as a person, I’ve never really said what I want to say in an argument, but this time I had to as my mum was being treated very badly verbally by him and his girlfriend. This was about a month or so before I started feeling bad. 
My mum suffers from chronic migraine attacks, which leaves her unable to get out of bed. I’ve been witnessed to this ever since a child, so it’s nothing new to me. 
This kind of relates to what has happened to me. Because I don’t have any friends or family who really are there for me except my mum, when she gets ill now, I seem to become quite anxious and stressed. 
The night I became bad, was a month ago. My mum was having to lie down on the chair, which I do remember made me feel quite down and miserable.
This is when the problem started. I was getting on with my usual routine, seemingly no problems what so ever. Then, I know it’s a strange and probably unique problem, but I tried to visualise a car that I really like. Something that I’m sure I’ve done before with no problems? I felt that I was struggling, and that it wasn’t clear enough in my mind. This instantly concerned me as again I’m sure I’ve never had a problem with doing this before, except now I can’t even remember what my normal self and mind was like before feeling like this. I asked my mum about this, and she wasn’t sure what was going on with me. I straight away started to panic, looking online to see what the problem could be, which probably made me worse as I discovered that some people can’t visualise things in their mind at all, leading me to believe that I could have that problem as well, or have somehow developed it. I have to remind, that this literally happened out of nowhere, no reason for head injury or anything. Just one minute I’m fine, the next I can’t think clearly. I went to bed, and unfortunately the next day was awful. I woke up and felt the same, like I couldn’t think clearly except that something is wrong with me. I went downstairs and just started crying, I’m not sure if it was a mixture of fear about what was happening to me, but I definitely remember feeling so sad about my mum being the way she was in her illness. I didn’t have an appetite all day, and was crying on and off all the time. As previously mentioned, this was a month ago and so far I don’t feel any better. When it first began, I started waking up in the night after only an hour or two of sleep, literally having a panic attack. I could feel my heartbeat through my whole body, and couldn’t breathe properly. I really thought I was going to die. 
I contacted my doctor about this, to see if anything was wrong with me. I’ve been given antidepressants, but for the 3 weeks I’ve been taking them I haven’t felt better. I know that they can take a while to work, but at the moment I feel pretty hopeless. Every day, I feel like I have little energy. My head can’t think clearly, like I’m having some thoughts but they feel incomplete and kind of feel like I’m not having any thoughts at all if that makes sense. I just feel completely blank. I’ve lost all interest in my hobbies since the day this began, and I still feel like I can’t visualise things in my head clearly or properly. It’s like I’ve lost my whole imagination, my head is just so empty feeling. Each day, I feel this feeling in my head almost like a headache but without the pain, like tension? Like my brain is enlarging in my head. It’s all awful. I feel so detached from everything and everyone around me, whether it be people I know like neighbours or even places. It’s like everything feels weird, but I’m not sure why or how to properly explain it. I just feel stuck and hopeless. I’ve never felt this way in my life, and I just feel so dead inside. This morning, I didn’t even want to get out of bed. Just that I can’t be bothered at all. 
Once again, I have to remind that this all started out of seemingly nowhere, just that I was feeling pretty low one point, and then the next I can’t think clearly or imagine anything properly in my head. And now, I can’t even remember whether I could even do it in the first place. This has affected my memory in some ways too. The whole month has felt like a blur, like I can remember what has happened, but it feels foggy at the same time. I feel like I can’t access my memories as fast, or sometimes at all. I just can’t think clearly. I really do feel honestly terrified by it all. I can’t even feel like I can remember who I once was as a person, what being ‘normal’ felt like. I’m just terrified that I’m going to lose myself as a person, I just don’t feel human anymore. Completely blank.

I’m sorry this is so long, I just feel so at a loss and confused by everything right now. My imagination was so important to me, and now I feel like it’s gone. Or questioning whether I ever had it at all? it’s so confusing to me. I know it’s probably confusing to understand, as it is for me haha. I just feel so depressed, I’m in a very dark place. I’m just desperate to know if this can happen and why, whether any of the stress I previously mentioned could be anything to do with it, and my mum becoming ill finally took me over the edge mentally? I’m not sure if anyone would know anything about what I’m dealing with or not, I would appreciate it greatly!
Thanks."
632,"Hey. I wanted to ask how your first depression felt like and if there's anyone who knows how mine was and can explain the details. 2 years ago, after several years of self-hatred, in the middle of the night I woke up with a sudden feeling of emptiness and loneliness and meaningless in my chest/head. It freaked me out so much that I panicked and vomited. Since then I have been afraid of depression, although I have experienced it again, I guess. But why did I vomit the first time? Because it caused me such an extreme amount of stress? Because it completely overwhelmed me? I didn't know this feeling till then. Since the first time, I then knew this feeling and didn't completely freak out over it. Now I am in a point in life where I feel kinda better, its still hard going through each day, but I learned to accept myself. But still there is this fear of this first depression because it has sent me in years of feeling like absolut shit and horrible anxiety. I read a book from Matt Haig who experienced the very same depression, why is it that some people experience it the one and others the other way? Or was it just because I panicked?
Thanks everyone.
Kind regards"
633,"Here I am again. I thought it will get better but I was wrong. Everybody lies to me, everyone say they care but they dont. Every single one is a liar. And they have no remorse. I'm destined to suffer. To drown in pain. I'm used to it, the pain the sorrow. And it's like I'm grieving the person I could have become. But I know nothing else. And the guilt gives me panic attacks. I wish I could feel nothing.
It's so pathetic that they care only if I lose weight. It makes me wanna scream. Is only the weight loss they notice? Am I more valuable only for the weight I lost? I'm invisible and losing weight will be better, better if I will occupy less space, less food spent for me. I am so, so sad. I thought I will learn to overcome this sorrow, but only gets worse with time. I'm relapsing and I think it will get worse than it has ever been. 
I don't care anymore. The scars never fade. And I'm not sorry."
634,"I don't know if this is the place for it but I gotta get this off my chest. Today something happened and it made me realize how tired I was. I'm tired of living. And I'm tired of trying. I honestly can't see what's the joy in pushing myself nowhere. Every time I'm two steps forward, I end up taking three steps back and I'm just tired. I have no friends, no family that cares about me, and nothing to live for. I didn't have the best life growing up, but I tried to make do with what I had. I didn't have a lot but it taught me to be independent and resilient and to appreciate what I did have. I studied hard in school and I'm a good worker. But life just keeps kicking me where it hurts the most, and I'm just tired. I feel like I'm never good enough for anything or anyone and honestly I don't know what I'm living for. I'm not at any harm of taking my own life, I fear death after all. But it's just, lately, I've been wishing I've never been born."
635,"So my psychiatrist changed my antidepressant from Prodin and Rivotril to Jovia which is a higher antidepressant right now I am only taking half a tablet as I am only introduced to it. He also started to question my day to day routine and told me to exercise as it helps. I am doing it right now and it kind of helps... even a little bit. I also share a lot to my parents and my sibling about what I am feeling.

I am also afraid of sleeping as that's when my ""episodes"" as what I call them will happen. I sleep at about 2am my time as my shift from my work is from 6pm to 2am. I sleep for about 4 hours and then I wake up with a painful heart throbbing palpitation and I keep changing sleeping positions just to get some sleep. I end up waking up at about every 15 minutes and have different kinds of dreams and then wake up. It's like an endless nightmare that I am experiencing.

The main reason why I am experiencing like this is because I am doing self pity. I see my friends successful in their careers with all their stable jobs. A lot of us are engineers and are also classmates even. Some graduated longer but ended up in great stable jobs while someone like me who is 30 years old is still struggling to get a stable income. I actually was on the path of becoming successful... the only thing that was blocking me was because I was lazy and was unfit for labor work.

People said I was smart YES. But I couldn't follow instructions properly, I was lazy in listening, I didn't train myself to focus on work, I had fears in handling responsibilities and I tend to do projects very long and sometimes even doing them wrong. I think part of the reason for this is that I didn't feel any stress or pressure when I was a child up until now... I lived too much of a carefree life with no responsibilities. It's also the reason why I graduated college a lot longer as well.

My contract on my cadet engineer job ended and I ended up not getting hired while the others who may have graduated longer and wasn't that much popular on school was absorbed and even promoted. This hurt me a lot and let me wondered where I would be going as I was not successful in my career as an Engineer. So I went freelance as a virtual assistant. It went well for a while but when I kept losing clients due to COVID except for one, I lost interest and I feared for my family as I was the only one having income and my sister is still studying for college. It made me fear that if I lose another client, we won't be having any more income.

My mom encouraged me to transition to freelance and not be an engineer anymore because it was the only thing I was good at. What pressures me most is that I am an Engineer and here I am working as a Virtual Assistant while my batch mates that already successful in their engineering careers already. A lot work in the government and a lot already working either abroad or have very high positions locally. If I don't work on a job that is not of my career soon, I might not be able to work as an engineer anymore and thus will ruin my career.

My mom cried the other night to let me continue my freelancing job as it is the only source of income we have. But I know it isn't stable and I know it will be gone soon and I can't see myself applying for a job every single time I lose a client as it is tiring... I also can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life as always applying for jobs online is stressful.

Right now I am at a loss on what to do. I do still have 1 client left, still doing good with his business but I have lost interest already and want to go back into Engineering... the only problem is, I am already 30 and younger more capable and skilled applicants will be there. The pressure just keeps building up, all the overthinking, all the what ifs, our future, our financial stability, when my sister is going to graduate, or about whether or not I will get a job in the future.

All of it is killing me inside which is why I experience this heartbreak of a pain, all this increased heart rate and palpitations. I don't know if the change in medication will help or if it will heal all this overthinking. I just want it all to be solved, but life isn't that easy. And it made me regret all my past actions I have done. All the time wasted."
636,"With him for ten. We basically drifted i made some mistakes he made some..he left me got married to someone else 4 months later. We've been divorced 15 months. He's not expressed any missing me emotions only once. Now recently he was being too nice lol so I said do you ever see us together and he said no. Why would I. 
I'm happy. 

Two days later he called me saying he didn't get to answer that properly and that it's been on his mind so he said if anything happen in my marriage and things didn't work out..would I get back with you yes i would. Do I still love you yes I do. 

Then he came over next day to see the kids. He ended up kissing me and saying he does miss me and the kids. I said why don't you just leave her then? He said he does love her in a way and can't just leave her 😂i then told him to get out now he just keeps asking me if I'm angry with him and if im okay with him. 


Why doesn't he let me get on with my life? I would take him back within a second but I'm feeling like I'm not really worth much right now in his eyes and I know I'm worth alot more but what's going on 😩"
637,"I thought in the last 5 years id beat this.
I had an amazing career and a loving boyfriend.
Everything seemed to be going my way after years of no luck, bad relationships, constant set backs and lonliness.

In the last 7 months i feel like im back to square 1.
With the pandemic, its put massive strain on my career. Im lucky to still have a job but its just not the same right now. My career really kept me occupied and now its a shell because its becoming impossible to do my job as an event planner because of the restrictions.
The constant up and down on when i can dl it properly again and then all the set backs have made me live on the edge.
I was furloughed for 5 weeks at the start and thats when it all started again. Constant worrying, thinking about the bad things ive done in my life, the lack of routine.
It made me realise that ive covered up my depression with a strict routine and responsibilities ive given myself.
I got back in the office and i felt better, then redundancies happened at work and i lived on the edge of fear and waiting. I kept my job in the end but im now on flexi furlough which means part time hours and no routine.

My partner and i are currently going through the house buying process which has given me a lot of concern and anxiety. Im at the point where im letting my partner do it for a bit cause i cant face looking at it all. I feel like i dont want to get excited for it in case it falls through.
Then on Tuesday, my cat died. She was a happy little thing and she helped me through so many tough times. It was very short and quick, i noticed she hadnt eaten for a day and took her to the vets and she had kidney failure which could have come on so quick because it happens with cats a lot. The vet said we need to put her to sleep because otherwise she would live a life of pain if she were to pull through but it had gotten so bad it was really unlikely she would and just suffer more.
I couldnt be with her when it happebed because of covid but the vets let me take her outside to say my goodbyes. She looked so sick.
Im absolutely devistated. She got me through so much over the years and i got her when i moved into my flat so it just doesnt feel the same anymore here. It makes me want to move quicker.
I now feel completely hopeless.
My careers gone, my cats gone, i have nothing to occupy me.


I hadnt self harmed in 8 years until the other day.
My boyfriend found me sat in the shower and i had injured my legs just staring at the wall. I dont even fully remember doing it.
He keeps telling me to speak to him but i know its upsetting for him and i feel like im making him suffer.

I dont see the point in anything anymore and i feel like the same person i was when i was first diagnosed."
638,"I have posted here only once and last time I was in a really dark place. I still get some off days but after getting a therapist and being prescribed medication I can say at least I'm doing better. 

There's a lot I need to work on, but this is a start. I wouldn't have sought help if there weren't people here and irl encouraging me to so I thank you all for this and I wish everyone here the best. to anyone who's wondering, yes you should absolutely seek help wherever you can find it. it gets better"
639,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for years now, along with that I have other mental illnesses and also many physical illnesses. I’ve tried so many different medications and nothing is helping. I dip every single night, nothing changes that, no matter what I do to help myself. I just want all this suffering to end, I want to be happy, but I am losing any hope that this’ll ever happen. I’m lost and feel like the only way this will go away is if I ended my life.

644,"I have goals. I don't recognize them anymore sometimes. They're so distant. But I logically know I've thought about them, and remember telling myself that getting a job would be useful, but I've been unable to get a job for 2 years and counting.

Now the world passes me by. Month after month, I just want to lay down and disappear. I've tried to make my resume, to finish all the tasks I have, but I look at the screen and all I see is scrambled words that I can't even motivate myself to read.

People have given me things to do for money, and I really, really try to WANT to do them. But I can't even begin to. I just want to lie down, listen to music and fade into the worlds I hear. They are surely more interesting than my purple cloud of disarray, of forsaken promises.

I can't even sleep right. I find myself thinking every day, for months, that maybe if I didn't have a family, I could end my life.

But I can't end my life, and I can't end my drifting melancholy and inability to focus, to do anything. I lie, and say I'm okay, that I'm working on it. Soon! But there's no change. It's always the same. I've been in the same hole for so many years, I've forgotten how to get out.

All that's left is the echo of my promises to myself and others, which it seems I will never fulfill."
645,"Every day for the past week I have cried at work. I am so unhappy here. I hate my job, but I don't know what I want to do instead and I can't just quit because I wouldn't be financially stable enough to pay my bills. I am stuck and every day I dread going to work. Plus I don't feel like I can take time off to see my therapist so that makes it worse. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so hopeless and dead already. I am not going to hurt myself but I feel like sometimes that would just be easier. I have no support from my family which makes it all so much worse."
646,"All my life I was pampered by my mom and because of that, I have not a care in the world with problems. Basically from what I was when I was a teenager, this is the same mindset I have.

Since I was a kid and up until now, My mom does all the work at home. She does all the laundry, she's the one who cooks food, basically she does everything and it makes me feel guilty and useless. Up until now this is the case and I haven’t improved.

By this time I should have been helping with the laundry, the dishes, the cooking, cleaning the house and everything else housekeeping related. I should have learned how to do “manly” stuff like fixing the sink, changing a car tire, going on adventures, learned to overcome my fear of heights, etc. Instead, I stay at home all day doing nothing but playing games, not talking with people, or hiding when people come to our house.

I am a picky eater and eat mostly unhealthy food. I only eat soft or comfort food which in turn didn’t make me any leaner and more muscular. I have a body of that of a frail little boy. I don’t have strong hands, arms or legs, I can’t run that fast and sweat easily. This is because I don’t exercise and don’t have a healthy lifestyle.

I spent my whole life just playing video games, watching too much anime, movies, Netflix, I had no goals in life, no direction, not thinking about the future. Because of that, It took me very long to finish a single course which took me 8 years. Gaming, Anime and Movies became my life instead.

I am not a people person at all. I hide when visitors come to our house. And because I have made this a habit, I am awkward when trying to approach a person and ask questions. I always get bullied and can become the laughing stock of the group.

I was lucky enough to land a job related to my career which was an electrician and but it involved heights and my fear of heights wasn’t helping, it also required some muscle like carrying big things and doing troubleshooting things and like I said, I have a frail body so basically I was useless.

Since I suck at being an electrician, they placed me over to do admin stuff related paperworks at the same company. Again, I had difficulty because all of there are so many variables to work with and I kept doing wrong things. The manager got so mad at me and I had to get tutored so many times by the staff and they started to hate me.

They put up with me until the end of my contract and were relieved that I was finally gone and replaced with someone with actual skill and someone who had the muscle and the brain.

Then I went freelance. I was able to manage it because they are mostly small businesses, not a lot of variables and was thinking this could be a good career. Then COVID happened and the instability of freelance affected me. I lost a client and then I started to panic and worry that we won’t be having any money left.

So I talked with my psychiatrist and told him about my symptoms. He told me that what I was experiencing was a panic attack which is why I am experiencing heartbreaks, palpitation of the heart, less sleep, loss of appetite, chills. He recommended that I be taking meds and observe for a few a month.

I have been taking the meds for 10 days now, but the heartbreak is still there. 
I still feel all that anxiety, all that depression, all that pain and heartbreak, the chills and the sleepless nights. Everything is still there. Always painful, always reminding me of the eventual doom that I will face.

If you have no skills, you won’t get work, if you don’t work, you go hungry, and if you go hungry, you will die. A very long and painful death… all because you didn’t grow up and man up.

It makes me think, I wonder how I will die in this world? Will I die of hunger? Will I get myself euthanized at old age because I am useless? Or will it happen when eventually my parents are gone, I have no money, I will be homeless and eventually because of all of that despair, will die of sadness?

I don’t know. The pain is still there. I want it to end. I want it to stop. I need help. Somebody."
647,"Im quite upset and no one can help me. Im my own worst enemy I don't know the reason I turned out like this. Im helpless to help myself I'm disgusted and in emotional pain. I did something I know I shouldn't have done but I did it anyhow. I don't know if it's me or the anxiety. I must take hold of my life and do what I must but I can't seem to. I have no one I'm alone and afraid. I cant make people understand why I am the way I am I don't know why I'm this way myself. I know I need professional help but I can't do it. I may call my doctor for different meds but I really don't want to get hooked on any more pills. She may suggest therapy, than I have to say what I told her a thousand times, I can't do it I can't get to appts. This is terrible, I wonder what I did to deserve this hell I'm in. I'm sorry for the huge writing, lol."
648,"hello,

I'm 28 still lives with my mom, don't have a job, don't have hobbies and I don't know what to do with my life.. 
I've been struggling with depression, anxiety and eating disorders since I was a teen and always seem to relapse.
I don't do anything during the day (except netflix and eating) I don't go out and even just going for a walk seems impossible atm.
I have a psychiatrist but I don't feel like it changes anything.. I've seen psychologist and hypnotherapist but it seems pointless.
sometimes I'm hopeful and want to do things and be happy and sometimes I'm like what's the point ?
I don't know where to start.."
649,"This is a huge problem for me. I've never done anything to save myself, yet I always hope someone else will save me. I expected way too much from my last relationship. It was online, it was short, and it was intense. I live in the US and he lives in Asia. The man I was talking to told me that he's only been in one relationship - 8 years ago and it only lasted a couple of months. He has a good career and lots of hobbies. He's pretty sure he'll always be alone and he seems okay with it. We became super close from the start, talking for hours a day 3-4 days a week. When we weren't talking, we were messaging and playing games. He knows about my mental health issues and listened patiently when I needed to talk. He was supportive and offered good advice. The games we played were his idea. Less than a week ago he told me he could see no end date to what we have; that our relationship is unique. The games brought us closer. However, two days before it ended, he suddenly pulled back. We spent 8 hours talking on Saturday. He was trying to pretend things were still okay, but I kept pushing until he admitted he feels like he got what he wanted, and he wants to still be friends. He had made promises to me early on that he'd show me the world is an exciting place and he wanted to help me grow. He said he planned to meet me at least one time in his life after the pandemic. We both want companionship. I thought I finally found a lifelong friend. He couldn't understand why it has to be all or nothing. I told him it's because he gave me his all from the beginning and to go from that to almost nothing is something I can't handle. I disabled the account I had on the site we met the next morning. He had told me that I could come back any time and he'd welcome me with open arms. I can't do that. I can't allow myself to heal and then have old feelings flood back. It's better for me to walk away for good. It was a ""fantasy vs. reality"" thing that we had. I got the two mixed up, while it was mostly fantasy for him. He used to constantly tell me I was his special girl and I have the voice of an angel. I'd melt when he called me baby girl. There's just no way I can keep him in my life after that.

I expected way too much. Before we became close, he said he wanted a strong woman - someone with her own goals. He didn't want someone to make him the center of their world. I heard this more than once. I knew it going in. But I did make him my world, even though I didn't mean to. I have no friends and it's been 18 years since my last relationship. I loved feeling so special and cared for. However, he knew my situation, too. He knew I'm not a strong, independent woman. I'm 10 years older than him and I live with my parents and I don't work. He doesn't have a lot of free time and I have nothing but time on my hands, with few hobbies and interests. He knows I have OCD and he did help me overcome my biggest, longest-lasting compulsion, so I'll always be grateful for that. He knows how scared I am of everything. I just wish he hadn't connected with me of all people. I can't expect anyone to save me. I know that has to come from within. I had hoped he would guide me and help me become a better person like he promised. Seriously, I know better. If I keep feeling like this and being so clingy, I'll never have anyone. No adult man wants to be with a woman who lives like a teenager.

I'm sorry this was so long. I just need to share what's on my mind. By the way, we used several personas in our games. ""Daisy"" was a nickname for me and that's why I'm ""A_Wilted_Daisy."" 💔"
650,"After being up for 4 days my mood has crashed, Im hearing voices and I am very tired."
651,"I have ADHD and undiagnosed depression. I dropped out of high school, after years of never doing schoolwork. I've lost contact with all of my friends after not making an attempt to reconnect. I don't have a job. My room is a hellhole wreck. My computers hdd broke months ago. I've felt this way for years but I've been so uncomfortable talking about this. I told my mother but sometimes I feel like she doesn't understand. I've tried therapy once and I've never felt better getting it off my chest. But therapy can be so expensive and there is no money for it. Sometimes I feel like suicide really is the answer, maybe then I wouldn't be a leech anymore. Even then it's not like I would have to guts to do it.

What do I even do from here? I have no education. I have debilitating depression and ADHD. There is a pandemic and I live smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood of antimaskers. I feel uncomfortable being outside, and when I do go outside I get anxious.

My step-dad hates me. He's said it straight to my face, that I'm just a failure. All I want is everything to be over. Sometimes I wish that there was something other than suicide that could do that.

I've truly given up and I don't know what to do."
652,"I'm curious.

If you've had suicidal thoughts, what are some of the things that have helped you get to the next day?




When I felt suicidal in the past, certain things would come to mind. One thing is my cat,. Also I want to be around for my mom when she gets old. And I do believe some people would actually miss me if I do this."
653,So I was dating this girl and everything was fine she took me to meet her family on vacation and called my mom her future mother in law.. but when we got back from vacation 2 days later she dumped me and said she didn’t want to be with anybody right now.I agreed to be friends but I said if another guy comes around I’m out cause those aren’t my intentions to just stay the friend. She talks to me a lot some days then barely talks to me on others she’s hung out with her friends but has made no advance to hang out with me and she just acts like she hates me some of the time when nothing when wrong when we were dating. Most the time she’ll just say she’s aggravated and having a bad day and won’t talk to me for awhile. I just don’t know if it’s whether sticking around for or not I don’t want to give up on her but I care about her but I’m not even getting slightest thing of that back like I said has hung with friends but won’t try to hang out with me at all I’m trying to be here for her but I feel like I’m just getting put on the back burner and it’s like I’m the last option out of everyone she knows to talk to. I’ve read up and watched videos on mental health so I could try to do with it better but it’s difficult when your not getting talk to for hours. I just need some advice cause I know depression is difficult but I feel like she just doesn’t want me around. I care about her and don’t want nothing to happen to her but I don’t feel like the feelings are the same. Idk if she would even care if I left I just know whether to stick around or not or just let her know I’m out good luck with everything?
654,"Hello. 

This is me asking for help. I want to know why it is that I feel this way. I have everything I could ever want, a happy family, I’m doing good in university, and money is certainly not an issue. But ever time I go out or into public I feel nervous, and uneasy. It will only take a couple minutes for me to feel uncomfortable and ready to go home. I’m not worried about what they think of me I’m just nervous with being outside. I know for sure they don’t care about me or even notice because my self-esteem is so low that I know they for sure aren’t looking at me. I just feel really uneasy and claustrophobic even. Often when I am excited about an event it only takes a couple minutes later for me to be sad and I no longer want to do the activity. Or rather I am the complete opposite of excited, and I no longer have the motivation to perform that activity. My mom says I ruin events anytime we go out because I look mad or like a scared animal, but I try my best to not be this way but it hasn’t worked. My family tells me it’s a burden taking me out anywhere, and that if wanted to stay at home so bad I should. But I really do want to get better at this. I want to be able to go out in public for longer than I have been. They tell me not to worry about what others think of me but genuinely that is not what I’m worried about. This deep rooted fear of being out in public has origins that I am unaware of. Another issue is that I spoke to my parents about my suicidal thoughts. They are now constantly worried that they should not say anything bad about me or do anything that could make me upset because they are afraid I might kill myself. But I don’t have these thoughts often only when I feel as though I’m a burden to my family they would be better off without, and these thoughts are not harbored in my mind constantly as they think. I have not been formally diagnosed with anything because my parents do not believe that mental illness is a true illness but one that occurs due to lack of work or drive. I sometimes also feel as though I am faking all of these things, and am simply overreacting. I cry often too so my parents say I’m crying to manipulate them into getting what I want but I genuinely don’t k ow what to do so I cry.  I don’t want to manipulate my parents. What is wrong with me, can anyone help?"
655,"ive officially weened off venalafaxine. i was on it for many years and it helped initially than stopped. i gained weight on it and on the medication i cant control my appetite i over eat. so seeing how it wasnt working like it use to i tried lexapro which did not work so it made me go back to the venlafaxine just to see if maybe it would work again and it didnt. i have been off venlafaxine for about a month now and feel awful. currently trying wellbutrin i dont know if it will work but we will see. i feel EXACTLY how i did many years ago in my 20s the reasons why i went on antidepressants is back full force. i feel it all again...the gut wreching anxiety, this hopeless feeling the world will end. im so fatigued, and the worrying thoughts are non stop. im going through constant crying spells and feelings of total anxiety like ill lose it. im looking for another way to treat this depression. the ssri and Snri drugs stopped the crying spells but id still get OCD like scary sad thoughts. i gained a bunch of weight being on venlafaxine which is why i dont want to start up on another ssri drug. im looking into trying 5HTP and SAM-E but this feeling is terrible. i had a bad year in my 20s and i just got depressed more and more and one day i couldnt control the crying and sad disturbing thoughts so thats how i got on an antidepressant. but now im off it and going through a nitemare"
656,"I have had so much good advice to try to get me through my crisis in the last day
Thank you all..
And I also realize that solutions dont come as fast as we hope ( if at all)

But I understand 
"" it will be better in the morning""
"" one day this will be in your past""
"" It will make you stronger""
"" You will find a way to survive""


Or any number of positive type things to make us feel hope.

But its REALLY hard to put faith in any of these type thoughts...when things just keep getting much worse.
When all the positive thoughts keep getting crushed.
You repeat these things in the middle of a horrible sleepless night

I throw up at night and check my phone and re-read messages from people trying to help
It doesnt last and im back at it an hour later



Its also almopst impossible to try to convince yourself its even worth thinking that way

Sorry......im really feeling bad   much wors than even 24 hours ago"
657,"I’m at uni and my mental health has gotten so much worse than it’s been in almost a year. I’m so scared to go home and have to be “okay” because I’m really not.
Last night/early hours of this morning, I tried to end my life because I just couldn’t cope with how I felt, but I got scared and thought about who I’d leave behind and I didn’t continue.
My body hurts from what I’m putting it through, I’m exhausted and yet I can’t stop saying yes to things- the busier I am the less time I have to think.
I haven’t slept for more than 4 hours a night in about 2 months because my suicidal thoughts are so loud at night and I just can’t take anymore. I spoke to the gp here but she seemed to uninterested and I felt so uncomfortable. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore."
658,"Sometimes I get in the mood where I'm so excited for life, but it's followed with a wave of sadness and realization that I'm not living life how I want to. I have had ZERO motivation to do anything extra, like I'm doing the minimum of what needs to be done, but I have no desire to improve myself/the way I'm living. Before, I would have motivation to eat better, go on a run, actually learn in school, etc. That has disappeared somehow.

Now my life is so cyclic, nothing new ever happens... I get through one week and the next is the same. I have no idea how people work on themselves and learn to happy with themselves. I just don't see how anyone can be genuinely happy with their life. Even if I loved my school/job, it would still be the same every day. I'm so stressed about ending up unhappy- I don't want to waste my life away in a university and job that I hate but there's no other alternative. I feel like I could either have a job I hate and make lots of money, or I could have a job I love and be miserable because I'm poor and can barely feed myself. Regardless, every possible outcome for my life just seems dreadful, I can't imagine being happy with any of them.

Does anyone feel the same? What can I do to break out of this?"
659,"Idk where to begin, but I’m 27 years old. I use to go to therapy and was clinically diagnosed with depression and bad anxiety. I feel like majority of my life has been okay, but I think a lot of my past (like many) has really influenced who I am today. The biggest issue that I still kinda deal with today is a part of my life that I don’t really talk about with anyone except when I was in therapy. When I was little my parents fought a lot. Around the age of 10 y/o my dad left us to be with another woman and her family. At the time, we didn’t know where he was so my mom reported him as a missing person. A year later, the cops found him. Refused to talk to us, but around year and half mark came back into our lives. I remember him leaving us and basically having to move houses a lot bc my mom had no money (my mom was a stay at home mother bc my dad was really controlling and didn’t want her to work). I went to 3 diff schools in 1 year. Bullied really badly (idk why). I am a really shy, ugly awkward person. So that’s probs why. Now, to present day...things are somewhat okay with my parents. I don’t live with them because I can’t deal with fighting or negative stuff. But I live with my grandmother who I take care of. I don’t make enough money to live on my own. I tried college twice. Struggled horribly in community college and dropped out (hated my major). This year I felt somewhat confident in going back. And saved what I could with my job, which was taking one class. For once, I felt motivated and like this was the major I wanted. But I ended up failing the one class bc I couldn’t attend a zoom meeting and participate in a group project because of work. This is definitely my own fault, but I work as a full time nanny (9 hours a day). And it’s very hard to fit online class in there. I had explained to my professor my job stuff, but said she couldn’t help with the grading change, which again is okay because I’m responsible for my own duties. I guess it just sucks because I put so much time into it and to fail because I missed 2 project assignments. It’s like I’m stuck and no matter how much I try I can’t get out. I want to live on my own because I’m an adult, but financially can’t. There is also guilt of leaving my grandmother, too. But living here is so depressing and I feel guilty for thinking this. I just want to live my life without struggling. And it feels like it might not happen and I’ll be in this position of struggling for the rest of my life, whereas everyone around me is moving up. What do I do? How do I get out this? I’m sorry for complaining...I’m just at my breaking point."
660,"Besides this forum you use other sites that at meant for people with depression ?

I joined to every facebook group could find about depression, are so dumb. Joined other forums too, are less active than this."
661,"Long story short: I am in my late 20s and been depressed, anxious and addicted for over a decade now.

I reached a point now where I don't care about consequences of my behavior anymore. And when I mean don't care I mean don't care.

I don't care whether I have a home or not (living with my parents again).
I don't care whether I have a job or not (unemployed for most of my life).
I don't care if I am free or in prison (already spent a year of my life in a psychiatry).

I completely gave up on myself and all I do is the bare necessity that my survival instincts tell me but barely anything beyond that unless I have an occasional good day.

I am spoiled and priviledged and don't want to do anything with my life. If I got kicked out from my parents I would probably just kill myself. That's probably the only reason why they let me stay with them because they don't want that to happen.

Any advise? Therapy never worked, medication never worked, distraction never worked. I feel like I don't even want to be helped because I realized that nobody but me can help me in the end, but I don't want to help myself. I just want to be gone from this mad world where every beautiful thing requires suffering."
662,"I feel empty and anxious at times. Sometimes I think the worst about what's going on with me and my mood fluctuates throughout the day. I'm working, still doing hobbies, etc. Can you function with a severe depression?"
663,"I've suffered with depression my whole life. And it has had major ups and downs.
I'm currently in a situation that is so toxic but I've been in it so long I don't know how to get out. I deal with emotional manipulation, psychological and physical abuse and constant verbal abuse.
I'm just sad all the time. I just don't want to deal with life anymore. I'm just a fake smile and I pretend everything is okay but inside I'm screaming out for relief.
I hate my life so much. I keep trying to make it better but unfortunate events happen to me soon much. I've had three cars break down, I've walked to and from work, I've gotten treatment and am still in treatment for addiction. I pay my child support. I pay my student loans. I live off of 130$ a week somehow. My rent is 300$ a month. I buy my own food. I try so unbelievably hard to make things better. I know being in this relationship is just making things worse but I face homelessness if I leave. I just don't know what to do anymore. The shelters in my area are full so I can't even go there. I just want to end it Soo bad. Soo freaking bad. I just cry and self harm everyday but even that doesn't help anymore."
664,I can't take it. I wanna end it so bad. I think I'm done. I'm fucking done
665,"I’m living a hard life. I struggle with my thoughts and feelings 24/7. It’s like I’ve switched life to the hardest mode there is. Originally 4 years I started to have panic attacks which caused me to avoid social situations and this has continued till a point I don’t leave my house. I visited multiple therapists and I’m currently on week 3 of taking anti depressants. I struggle with pure o related issues (I think, I have no diagnose and I’ve read they don’t diagnose pure o). The most horrible thing are my violent intrusions which don’t let me take breath anytime. It makes me worry if it are intrusions in general. My biggest worry is insanity. I avoided 1000’s of things because of this. It probably doesn’t make sense, but stuff like the color red, social situations, tv or basically anything are things I do. I feel uncomfortable with any change. I live a very unhealthy lifestyle spending all my day time on my phone. I can’t talk properly to anyone anymore. I don’t feel any connection to anything. I feel like I’m the most horrible person on planet earth. I also been diagnosed with add. Took meds, but didn’t work. Everything feels pointless. Everything feels stupid. I hate myself deeply. Everything feels way too intense, but I also feel very hardy because of these thoughts. I can’t watch to people anymore without a normal look. I basically feel completely done. I’m 21 years old and I feel like my end is near. It feels like there is no way out and it’s too much to battle. That I’m so far off everything. I don’t want to die but I also do. I don’t know. It doesn’t make sense and I’m also not making sense. I can’t move into any direction. I wish I could cry right now, but emotionally I’m feeling completely stuck. No one seems to understand me. I feel like a psychopath, but anyone else doesn’t. What am I supposed to do? And why should be on this planet. If I’m spending my last days living like this nothing wouldn’t have been worth it. I’ve been through so much shit. 21 long years. I need help, but I can’t get help due of of my problems."

670,"Hello,

I’m about to finish a fall term/semester in uni and I’ve been feeling extremely depressed lately. I get anxious about assignments and about not finishing them in time. I feel like I’m gonna fail and I’ve lost all self-confidence in my abilities. I’m by no means a straight A student, but I used to believe that I could at least achieve a B. But right now, I just don’t know what to do. I’m feeling so overwhelmed and defeated that I want to quit everything and even drop out. I’m so scared to tell my parents because they’re not the type to be accepting/understanding of mental health. When I try to bring it up, they aren’t understanding that being a student can be stressful. They ask, “Why are you stressed? You shouldn’t be stressed. There’s nothing to stress about. It’s all in your head.” And I don’t feel like they understand and I feel like a failure and disappointment to them. I’ve only ever been praised when I’m doing well so I don’t think they’ll react well if I fail. Please help because I don’t know what to do.

Thanks for reading."
671,"Does it hurt you when people don’t notice your suffering? i Hide my depression very well from others, at least I try to. But at the same time, I think people SHOULD notice. You know? Like, while I’m desperately trying to hide the fact that I’m dying inside, I’m aware that my behaviors and actions aren’t my normal self. Shouldn’t people notice that? Especially when they know I’m diagnosed with bipolar and self harm? They know this, so, when I become more quiet than normal or edgy, wouldn’t you think they would notice that? It especially hurts when they constantly are saying they think other people are depressed. Like, what am I? A picture of sunshine? Another thing that gets me where it hurts is when they degrade people who are open about their depression. They’ll say things like “I always thought she was so strong”. What are they saying about me? And the topic of suicide! Don’t even get me started. they always, without fail will say, “what on earth can be sooo bad that would make somebody do that?” All the while knowing that I was in and out of psych wards for, what was that again? Oh yeah, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS! Are they doing this on purpose? To torment me? Then in the next breath, they’ll say how smart I am or how much they love me. I’m sick and tired of this roller coaster. I’m sick of living, and I’m tired of breathing."
672,"I have long battled depression and bipolar.
I keep it at bay at best
I am an older guy

Because of bad financial mistake my wife made,we just found out we will probably lose everything we have and i see no possible fixes. Only that it might get far worse.

I am not a strong person, I am folding.
I dont want to get up and start any day, but nights are black torture and I just dwell on the worst possible outcomes which are all very likely to happen
I cry most nights...throw up...repeat....havent slept in days

I try to lie and be positive for my wifes sake because i love her so much, and I dont want her to see that I have no hope..

Im not sure why Im posting this or what Im even asking.
I have no one to talk to

i have never experienced anything close to this except maybe the death of my parents.
Im sorry for even posting on here...and taking up space not even knowing what Im thinking or asking

675,"First of all, at the start of every thread I always like to mention that I have Asperger's syndrome as well as anxiety and depression (have currently been on antidepressants for the last year and a half). I currently study performing arts (drama) at college. I have been doing it for well over 2 years now, and I really do aspire to become a relatively successful actor. Most specifically a film actor within the action/drama genre, though I am more than willing to give every genre from every platform a go. I like to think I'm a relatively decent actor myself and I don't really knock my own skills in that regard. Though I absolutely abhor seeing myself, considering the fact I am very self conscious on the way I look, whether that being my body, hair, neck, face, etc. So I find it very hard to watch back video's of myself acting. And considering the fact that I'm constantly body shamed and implied to be unattractive both from my family (which they jokingly do though it still hurts me) and people at college (my friends even, but again it still hurts). And also considering the fact I put a good amount of weight on since lockdown, to the point where I have developed more of a double chin as well as, stretch marks on my waist and in between my thighs. I have been trying to get a haircut and go back to the gym and lose some of my flab, the issue is, is that they're all closed which makes everything else ultimately harder for me. I am also very short sighted to the point where I always have to wear glasses, which again has been ruining my confidence since I personally think I look a lot better without them, and how am I suppose to get a role in anything if I can't even see what I'm doing? I'm also adamant of keeping my hair the way I like (the length that I like) rather than having to shave it off or grow it out for a specific role, though I have been thinking about it if the opportunity was present. I wouldn't mind styling it though, just cutting or growing it a considerable length.

Anyways I have been feeling pretty bad about myself recently and I'll explain why. A few of my friends have been apart of some form of program/performance/acting school/etc. Where as with me, I haven't been in or done nothing of the sort. The only acting experience I have is from in college. For starters I have never really been knowledgeable on where to go for castings or auditions because I always thought you need a certain degree to do so in order to be accepted for good roles. So I have never really actually looked for any (mostly because I have close to no idea on how actors get accepted). I am also from a working class family so I've never been financially able to go to any acting school outside of college. Which is a shame because I really genuinely do want to make myself known and show people what I can do. I'm not at all worried about constructive criticism. I mean our tutors in college are quite knowledgeable of acting and in the industry themselves. One of our tutors is a west-end actor who has been in/directed his fair share of performances himself, and he is always giving constructive criticism. And I am always willing to listen to what he has to say, and then take a note on it and perhaps improve on it in the long run. My point is, is that the people that are currently in the performing arts course have experience/experiences on what it is like to perform outside of college. One of my friends (it's actually a girl I have a crush on), has been in many popular BBC TV productions in the past as an extra/small role and was even a stand in for a major part. The other day my friend had asked her how much money she had made from her recent part and she said around £3000. And she was doing all this before she even came to the performing arts course. Her father is also a relatively well known writer as well (I honestly couldn't say if that would've played a role in her getting auditions because she is indeed a very good actor herself). Overall she has essentially been brought up in that type of environment. And she is indeed quite a posh, polite, sweet young lady (she is only 1 1/2 years younger than me though) I don't mean to be judgmental but she seems like someone who has been brought up in a very good environment.

Where as with me, virtually none of my family have been in that type of performing environment with the exception of one of my uncles who is pretty well financed anyway. I mean her father is quite a well known writer for a popular range of audiobooks. My father on the other hand is a bipolar alcoholic who just always feels the need to shout at me whenever possible. Virtually all of my family are working class, doing jobs that require little to no qualification and a good majority of them don't even work. My mother nor my father even have any GCSEs. So I feel like I'm probably one of the first of my families generations in a long time to have actually graduated with passing my GCSEs (I also received the Maths Award For The Class Of 2017) and moving on to college (and soonly enough university). Considering we're all friends in my course and we're friends with her, I would absolutely hate to use the term jealously. But I am definitely feeling some form of envy within myself. And considering the fact I turn 20 next week and have still not got any performance experiences outside of college, is really making me doubt my future career as an actor. I had a brief chat with her about where she would go to audition for these types of roles and she told me to look for casting agencies on twitter, facebook, instagram, etc (I only use twitter anyways). I still felt bad for myself though at the fact I may have missed so many good opportunities for myself. I hate to say it but I also feel too old to professionally start acting now. I just feel that there was so much more I could've done and could've gained, but I never actually did it. In college, we are currently planning and organizing stuff for our show reel that we are going to make. Our show reel will essentially be a 10 minute video previewing us in many performances, recordings, plays, etc to show off our acting skills. We are also planning on writing a 2000 word essay on how we believe we would be a valid able candidate for this fake performance company. My friend (and other friends) is going to have many upon many different sources from the stuff she has been in, whether that being the BBC, college, some other production companies, etc to put into these pieces of work. Where as with me, the only sources of acting I have of me is from college (and maybe some self recorded auditions if I do some).

Generally, when it comes to acting I think I'm pretty alright at it. When I am at home, I would love looking up scripts from plays, movies, video games, etc and acting them out. I find that to be very interesting to explore different character's personifications. A while ago I had rehearsed a big chunk of Mercutio's Queen Mab speech from Romeo & Juliet and performed it for a mock audition in college. Overall I got some pretty good feedback from my tutor (the west-end actor). As of recently I have rehearsed and learned another monologue from the 2019 film The Lighthouse (starring Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattison), in the scene where Willem Dafoe's character starts off by saying ""Let Neptune strike ye dead Winslow"". I learned that entire monologue within 3-4 days and had it imprinted in my brain. I did it in front of camera today (recorded by my tutor) using that type of sailor accent and afterwards he went on to tell me he was very proud of me for doing it. He said that I had a powerful voice and that I have a lot of potential which made me very happy of myself. Though I still felt bad at the end of the day because of how I felt about my future. My tutor has also told me a few times that I would be a very good James Bond, to which I was very surprised and happy to hear because I'd absolutely love to be James Bond. Though there is a part of me wondering if he is just saying that because he truly means it, or saying that because he knows it will make me feel happy about myself. I honestly don't know"
676,"I'll be spending Xmas alone again this year. Not by choice, it's just through years of depression mixed with a decent amount of social anxiety, that's the corner I've backed myself into. 

I don't want to be like this. Even now when I see happy families or friends on TV commercials, I feel that all too familiar hurt at what I'll most likely never have. 

I'm really not looking forward to Xmas :low:"

678,"Hey everyone, I have an older brother in his mid 20's who has been suffering from depression for a few years. He never finished high school and has had a few jobs but nothing steady. He went to a hospital for 8 months a few years back and was doing really well when he got back but it all went downhill shortly after. He always stays in his room and never wants to talk about his problems.. I've suggested going to see a professional but he gets angry when I mention it. I hate to see him suffer like this, he used to be so outgoing but now he doesn't want to speak or see anyone.. How can I help him get his life back together?"
679,"I'm still struggling everday. I thought maybe I would feel better by now. But my anxiety is tough and I can't figure out what triggers it. I get nights where I sleep, but I'm waking up several times. I feel empty and don't get any enjoyment like I used too. I keep busy throughout the day and work. That does help some. What concerns me is that feeling that something isn't right. I've reached out for professional help and didn't get anywhere. It's the same thing you're stressed."
680,"I don’t really know how to explain but I’m just really struggling rn. Feel as though I’m not doing anything or contributing anything in life.

have explained before how I’m dealing with chronic pain and no progress seems to be made with this despite about 3 years of meds etc. Makes it very hard to find things to do due to the physical pain.

also feel alone and go most days without speaking to many people ,not sure how much longer I can cope with it all tbh.

681,"I am looking to see how you guys feel the depression like?, how would you describe it? Could you please tell me?
Personally I feel like a dark hole where I am stuck"
682,"Lately I’ve been feeling like I need an escape. For the pass few months I’ve been stressed with school and family issues. My parents are the biggest triggers for my depression. My mother is so focused on a man that doesn’t respect her that she neglects her children. In the past month alone she’s told me she’s done with me then tries to come back. The best way to put the issues I have with my mom is that she throws us under the bus to avoid responsibility. Also she’s the one who created the bus. My father loves me I know but he’s controlling. If I don’t do what he says I’m spoiled , ungrateful, and disrespectful. I feel like I can’t be honest about how I’m feeling because there’s going to be consequences. Recently my grandmother gave me a car and when I finally came home this pass thanksgiving he gave me an ultimatum. Mind you I haven’t spoken to him in months due to the fact he didn’t want me to work. He wants me to be dependent upon him but it comes with a price. He throws anything he does in my face when he’s crossed a line. The ultimatum was that I couldn’t drive the car back and forth to school anymore to get to my job in town. Basically I could only use the vehicle when I’m at his home and only for work. Or I could move back home and use the car for work , school , and thats it. I’d have to change schools at the last minute when I have two semesters left. None of it makes sense or is rational. I’ve recently had to get back on medication to cope with how I’ve been feeling. I’m stressed and I feel like I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m tired of feeling like my feelings don’t matter. I’m tired of trying to please people to spite myself. I want to escape."
683,"I feel like I've been hurt but it's hard to explain. I feel really lonely, I was talking to my sister on the phone and wanted to ask her to come over.

I miss my parents so much especially my father. I have no one my sister is there but she's not. I'm going to cry so I better stop."
684,"Hello,

I'm sorry if this is in the wrong thread. But I need to be heard. I have never been diagnosed, but it's something that has stuck with me forever and depression is the closest thing I can link to it.

To make it short, I'm always sad, I always feel guilty, lowkey always think of destroying myself and dying young. I also always think about violence, which is odd since I never really was violent. I keep resorting to ways of escapism (movies, music, games, books whatever) to distract me to the point where I put these things in priority cause if I don't, I'll feel extremely sad and stare at the wall for hours instead of doing my work. It's either this or I have a billion thoughts running through my mind that'll make me unable to read a single line. 

I am a university student, but I don't like what I study as it is very different than my ""dream career"" (if we're even allowed to dream anymore). Please don't tell me to change my major, I tried, but I have very controlling parents even though they live in a whole other country. I can't survive without them helping me since I legally cannot work enough hours to actually support myself (I'm a foreigner). The only way I can break free from this is by having my degree and completely detaching myself from my parents (I mean, our main tie is financial, we broke the emotionnal link a long time ago. I don't tell them anything about me anymore since my only existence seem to upset them to the core). 

I can't really go back to my homecountry since I'm gay and here, in Europe, is the relatively safest place for me. And honestly, I really don't want to go back to living with my parents. They only seem to be bearable when we have a full continent between us. I don't hate them, not at all, but I grew up feeling constantly guilty because of things they say that they end up not even remembering. The little bit of self confidence I have today couldn't be acquired if I didn't leave home. 

I also can't go to the therapist, the one in my university is overbooked, and the only appointements available are always 3 months away from today. Plus, the last time I went, the therapist was nice, but I feel like I overshare too much the minute someone lets me speak. And then, because of that, I feel annoying and regret everything I ever said or done, and the cycle goes on. This prevents me from opening up to my friends, or if I ever do, I feel guilty of worrying them. 

I can't open up to my parents either, the last time I did it went so bad it was the last time I ever told them anything that wasn't a fun fact or related to school. My mother made me look like the villain, and I actually believed it for a while, and thought it was my fault I always thought of these bad things like dying, or doing stupid risky shit cause I don't really value my life that much. 

I have 0 motivations, 0 ambitions, and it makes me sad cause I used to be really hopeful in life. I also used to be really smart, now all I know how to do is watch movies, cry and smoke. 

I don't even know. There's so much things I want to say but again, I feel like I wrote way too much, and will probably feel stupid for writing this. I'm very very very sad. I can't function unless I obssess over a show or know trivia from something. Please help me."
685,"I've started taking fluoxetine last month - I have noticed a significant improvement on my mood and in my capability to do daily tasks. I no longer feel like staying in bed all day and crying all the time.
However, I've also started to notice a lot of other things. 

For example, I loved to eat. I never had an eating disorder or anything like that, but if I was bored or if I had something I loved to eat around the house, I would eat it as fast as I could. I was going to the fridge at least 10 times a day. Now I only eat when I have a sort of stomach ache (It's not on purpose, I don't even remember to eat). I was always looking forward for lunch and dinner, and now I feel like I never want to eat. I'm getting skinnier and skinnier - I'm really tall, so it is quite noticeable. My self-esteem is not a problem, but I'm affraid people will think I have anorexia.

Also - and this is weird to talk about - I always had a huge sex drive and was always thinking about boys and how much I wanted a boy to love me. I don't know if this is associated with the fact that in the last year I have been severely disappointed my men (specially my father and a guy I had a ""relationship"" with). But right now, I never think about how much I need a boyfriend, or someone to cuddle with. I even have been thinking about the possibility of never meeting the ""right man"". A few months ago that would scare me, but now it just seems like something that could happen and that is okay.

Is it normal? Will it go away when I stop taking prozac?"
686,"My wife and I are existing (not living) in a filthy bungalow that stinks of mouse urine, while waiting to move to our new home. I  have fallen completely out of love with the house and every time I go over I see things the builder hasn't finished and I know won't get finished either. I am five months into a deep breakdown, taking Mirtazapine and the GP has given me a psychiatric referral.

I would never commit suicide because I have a lovely son and wife, family and friends but if the world stopped tomorrow I would be quite happy to get off it. I've had enough."
687,"I’m in a really bad spot again, and it just seems to be a never ending cycle of feeling completely okay one minute to it just suddenly switching the next. I feel like nobody in my life truly loves me and that everyone has an ulterior motive.  With all the heartache I’ve been feeling recently, it brought back a few feelings about my ex from a while back, who I found out is pretty much now living with the girl he cheated on me with. If that wasn’t bad enough, the guy I was involved with recently has completely tossed me aside and has rejected me in the most hurtful of ways. None of my “friends” ever check in on me.  I try so hard to be positive and productive but my mind is plagued with all these horrible thoughts about how I’m not good enough and that everyone in my life will always betray me, because that’s all I’ve ever known.  On top of all that I feel like I live a completely pointless existence.  My life is so unfulfilling and there’s always someone better than me in every sense of the word.  The only real interaction I get these days are from creeps on dating sites who can’t take a hint.  I thought I may have bipolar but my counsellor said she couldn’t see it, so I’m not sure what to make of that.  I just feel like my life is going absolutely nowhere and that I’m nothing more than an emotional burden.  I’m just so beyond depressed and I really don’t know what to do anymore."
688,"Hi.

I have been feeling really useless recently. I can't seem to be able to study as well as my friends, and fall behind a lot. My friends keep saying I'm smart... but I study 3 times as much as they do and get worse grades than them...

Everyone just has such high expectations of me... not just in school, but out of it as well, and then are disappointed when I don't meet their expectations... I feel so useless and annoying... My friends just blindly believe that I am equal to them. But I'm really not... Every disappointment just makes me feel more and more useless.

Sometimes I find my self thinking that they would be better off without me... sure they would be sad for a while... but I get the feeling they would be a lot better off in the long run...

I try to tell my self its not true but the more people I disappoint the more I start to believe it is true."
689,"I’m 19, due to a few things I am not starting university until next September, this means that I am constantly around my parents other than when they are both at work Monday-Thursday.
I made a post about my parents last month, but it is long and detailed, so I am just going to quickly mention this.
My parents are emotionally abusive, they are fickle so one moment they are understanding and the next there is a huge argument about a TV show. These arguments never stay on topic either, they end up arguing about things that have happened years ago that cannot be changed.
I cannot remember anything positive about my adolescence, I can just remember getting threatened and chased by them, they have hit me before, making me wear makeup at 11 years old and dress a certain way. They have controlled me for so long. I would lay awake at night wishing I could get taken away, or something would happen to them. That sounds horrible, but it is true. A few months ago I was was so distressed and was telling them about how I need braces for my underbite which I have been bullied for. I can’t walk down the street without a stare or a comment. I was saying ‘I cannot live like this anymore, I cannot do it anymore’ and I thought maybe they would  understand. They did not speak to me for a week, they were furious. My mum stormed off and left for an hour or so, my dad said that I push people around which is why I have no friends. I have no friends because I was bullied so much, I cannot push people around if I barely speak to anyone as I am scared. My mum said that I was abusive because I called her a ‘numpty’ which is a British thing, when she dropped something. It was just a joke, as in oh you silly. She was so mad at me and shouted at me, she did not speak to me for a while after.
I could go on and on about this, but this is how it is in short.
Their presence makes me feel awful, this house makes me feel awful. All of these memories make me feel awful. I try to be motivated, I try to make myself feel better by telling myself that one day it will end.
My parents believe that life is good for me as we are fine financially, we have a roof over our heads. I am grateful for that, but just because people have it worse than me does not mean that my problems are invalid.
When I visit my older siblings I feel much better, I am better with hygiene, I do not wake up feeling really down, I feel better in myself. I do not have to hide who I am, I am not frightened.
I have wanted to cut them off for years, one day I think I need to. They insult me so much, they contradict me if I say they have upset me because everything has to be my fault. My dad said something racist once and I said ‘that is not right’ and they got furious at me saying I made a scene, when I only said it in my normal voice. They started a huge argument about everything, childhood etc. How on earth does this happen? The whole way home I was getting shouted at, it is ridiculous all because I calmly stood up to them.
I cannot deal with them anymore. I cannot live like this anymore with them. After my university course I want to cut them off, once I am financially stable and have an apartment/flat/small house. My siblings respect that, at least I have them. I will never cut my siblings off. But my parents cannot treat me like this forever, they make me so unhappy. They have taken all of my emotions away from me, I wish I could cry but I cannot because I am empty.
I crave affection from others because my parents make me feel worthless. They have ruined my life. I have not loved them for years, I do not feel anything towards them other than hatred.

is it okay to cut people off if they make you miserable and are really not good for your mental health? I know I have 3 years to think about it, but I cannot be happy with them in my life. If I get a partner I know they will end up ruining that for me, they always have a negative thing to say about everyone. My mum really dislikes my sister’s boyfriend, never says a nice word about him.
I want to be happy,more than anything. I am actually going to do the course I want to do because they told me I was not allowed. I want to be me, I want them gone. Forever."
690,"I had a review with the mental health team yesterday and the doctor suggested my problems with motivation could be solved by CBT, specifically using to do lists. Has anybody tried this and found it's made them more productive? 

Similarly, if you do do this have you got a go to to do list software or a particular format, and what do you include? I already manage to do the daily chores like washing up but would that sort of thing be included on the list for an easy win?"
691,"Hello everyone,

I've suffered from depression ever since I was a teen. I'm in my late 20's now. Seen so many therapists...never felt like they worked.

I always struggled with getting and keeping friends. I have really only 1-2 people I feel like I can ever rely on, outside of my family of course... outside of those two, I have maybe another handful of friends that I really don't think care that much about me. I always have to be the person to try to make plans with people...no one ever tries with me.

Luckily, my immediate family, which just consists of my mother and father are always there for me. I feel so lucky to have parents like them...They will always come and see me or have me over if I ever need them.

Anyway, I just moved out about a month ago...finally living on my own...with my cat and dog of course...and I find myself crying several times a week. I feel like I don't have a purpose in life. I get up, work (remotely), watch tv, and repeat. I see either my girlfriend or parents on the weekends and sometimes friends (sometimes being not often).

I found myself today...just thinking about it...what if I did? You know?

But then I think about my parents...my mom, diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer...my father who will need me when my mom is gone. They are the only things I feel are keeping me alive. Once they are gone, I fear I may end it.

I hope that's not the case. I hope there's another way. I hope somehow...someway...things can improve in my life. But if they don't, and the time comes when my parents are no longer here...I'm very certain I'll end my life.

Who will care then? No one. Just another number...erased from existence.

I would never wish depression on anyone...it's a bitch.


Anyway, I welcome any advice anyone has to offer. And if anyone needs advice from me, I would be more than happy to provide some."
692,"First of all I'd just like to say that this issue I am currently having is not making me feel depressed. I just wasn't sure as to what part of the site I'm better putting this on but I figured it is most suitable in this forum.

This is also a follow-up to my previous thread: Slightly unsure on how to confess to my crush

Basically for those who haven't seen my previous thread as of yet. I have been close friends with this girl for over a year now and have liked her for several months. My friend also has a crush on her and has actually admitted it to her over a year ago, and even though he still likes her, to this day he has not asked her out (he doesn't know I like her too). So I figured I should probably give a shot at asking her out myself. Again this may be confusing for people who have not seen my previous thread, but I think this issue is better off in a separate one.

Okay so, by the end of my college day today when me and her where alone waiting to be picked up. My friends (including the one that liked her) had already went off to the bus station. I thought to myself that I finally have a chance at talking to her properly considering I was planning on doing that the day prior considering there is a time-frame where me and her are alone together, but my friend (who likes her) decided to just stick around for whatever reason haha. I asked her at the start of the college day today if I could ask her a question in private when we finish, so I was pretty glad to let her know that I wanted to ask her something at some point. Anyways after college today, me and her where alone outside the front of our college building and I started talking to her about stuff, then we started talking about how my friend feels about her (she only see's him as a friend though) and then we started talking about the topic of dates in general.

Eventually I had asked her how she would feel If I asked her out on a date. I virtually got the exact response I was expecting haha. She looked down and to the right, shrugged her shoulders and then told me she wasn't really looking for a relationship right now. And then she told me that she was busy with stuff, to which I fully understood because currently at college we all have mountains of work that needs to be done all of which are going to our grade before we go to uni next year. Not only that but she is also really busy outside of college, job-wise. She was overall very nice and kind about it though. I told her it was fine and that I completely understand what she means. Though I only saw this as a polite way of her saying ""No"". I also told her I wasn't necessarily going through the best of times either (since I was having some unrelated personal issues of my own). Anyways I was being picked up shortly after this so I ended up having to go. I asked her not to tell both my friends about this and she said she wouldn't which had me relieved a little especially considering on how my friend feels about her.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed but to tell you the truth, I don't really know how to feel. I just feel strangely empty. It's very odd. I feel slightly embarrassed at the fact that I made a move on her but I am honestly proud that I did it and actually took a chance at something. It's just going to be pretty awkward for me seeing her in college now knowing that I had actually asked her out. I am just kind of worried that I may have gave her a sour taste in her mouth. I'm also worried she might tell someone even though we are pretty close friends and she promised she wouldn't. I just hope she doesn't see me any less of a friend for asking her out. I also don't know how to feel because to some extent I am not sure on what is mean't to happen next if anything at all. I feel like I might've just shocked her by asking since I don't think she was expecting me to ask her out and thus resulted in a pretty hesitant response. But to be honest, who am I kidding."
693,"I'm not a very good writer, but I'll try to explain my  situation. I have for a long time had terrible depression, even to the point I find it hard to motivate myself and do everyday things. Sometimes  this has led me to not even want to get out of bed for days. I have really low depression at times and really irritable depression, which is a nightmare and has led to self harm and overdoses at times. The  problem is, I'm left confused after visiting psychiatrists and seeing  what they have written about me.

Even when I am feeling at my worst, I feel I have to make the effort to wash and tidy myself up for an appointment to see them. I don't really want  to do this due to how I'm feeling and it is not something I do at home  when feeling really low, but they don't see what I'm going through at  home and what I experience, so I present as if I'm coping when I'm  really not. The thing is they don't seem to ask if I am always tidy and  things though."
694,"For the last 2 years i have been dealing with a depressive episode, which just became acute due to a major life breaking change.
During this time, my memory, short amd long term, retention, and ability to learn new info has been getting progressively worse.
Research tells me this could actually improve and be restored once the depression is under control (just started meds and therapy, hoping to find some combo that works.
So, my question:  Has anyone been through this, achieved some form of remission, and their faculties were actually restored?
I am terrified that 30+ years of depression has permanently impaired my brain."
695,"Hi.. I'm a 22 y/o female.. I have 2 kids. 2 different fathers. The first happened when I was so young, and that relationship ended tragically and I suffered trauma from it. For 2 years I could not stop contacting him, and the things I would say would make the situations worse. I was forced not to be in contact, and that is the only reason I stopped & moved on. 5 years later, I have another baby. I fall in love, he feeds me these beautiful lies.. and then wakes up one day 3 years later saying he no longer wants to do this anymore.. Blocked me, already sexually active, avoids me at all costs, and even informed him my kidneys are absolute sh** and he just straight up ignores me. Last week i was told that if I killed myself, they [child's father & family] would come take my baby from me at my funeral and not shed a tear. I dont have family or friends but my kids, so that hurt and made me realize how alone i truly am again. Atleast in my love life.. Although he's said nasty things to me & goes above and beyond to prove he wants nothing to do with me; what can I do to improve my self discipline? Sometimes, it's like this rage just clouds over me so intensely, and I HAVE to let him have a piece of my mind. I do it involuntarily it seems, like I black out going in the entire process of messaging him. He leaves me on read/seen all the time, or will give me one sentence usually saying something like ""move on"" and ""i dont want to talk unless if its for the baby"" I'm starting to do things that are making the situation even more and more irreparable, even though this is already broken beyond repair. Now, we can't even effectively co-parent. It breaks my heart, and I often feel suicidal because I can't control myself, and people often make me feel really bad about it. 

I try everything; from drawing & digital art, to music, to writing, coloring, playing with my kids and teaching them, taking walks, playing video games, reading, all that healthy good stuff.. but i keep getting flashbacks that make me extremely depressed and in the middle of my happiness, the light inside me seems to instantly die. it's only been one month, and I am so so hurt.
By 8pm im writing to him the same things i told him and begged him about previously 1mil times.
My mind doesn't want to process letting go.  

Please, if anyone can leave some tips on how to really build discipline, I would extremely appreciate it. 
I can't sleep my emotions away bc I have kids.. and I can't really just get up and go anywhere/do anything bc I live in a terrible neighborhood, no car, covid, short funds, and half the time im too depressed to even get out of bed sometimes."
696,"I know I should be thankful for having a job when so many people have lost theirs, but lately I wake up every morning wishing I can just stay in bed. The sad part is I have a good job with good, supportive people, but I just dread going in to work. I stress about performing and being productive, about messing up, basically about everything work related.

I want to quit every day but know that will not solve how I feel. Any advice?"

so my beagle puppy went to the vet on tuesday because she was shaking and lethargic ,they said she had a high temperature and we took her back 24 hours later as they requested and they said they thought it could be a tummy bug/virus ,they gave her some anti biotics and said she should be ok
but today she was shaking so much and there was a tiny bit of blood in her poop we took her to the vets again ,it COULD be a virus ,they have taken a blood test
or it could be my fault ,i gave her a bone on tuesday morning and we thing a sharp part may have caused an obstruction
the vet can't feel anything but said there could be a partial obstruction 

how thick am i? i will never ever ever give her bones again
she is suffering cos im a twat"
699,"so right now we are using over £50 electric a week ,there is always some sort of light heating on
so i come across as a right moaner when i say we have to cut down there is only 3 of us in a 2 bedroom place
almost £70 week is ridiciulous

we might not always have the money we have now ,am i unreasonable saying we should cut down?"
700,"I'd say these days mornings are unpleasant for me, the mood is down when I'm awake early, or don't feel well-enough rested, and would like to have longer sleeps; have been napping during day too, something I haven't done in years. Nothing serious, not really going through depression, just a down mood in the AM. It clears up and the rest of the day is mostly OK. Afternoons are usually all right when I take my walks to the shops."
701,"Yeah...today is/was my 64th birthday!  I got a card and a phone call from one sister, and a card and no phone call from the other sister.  I gorged myself on chocolate, hot drinks and a weepie movie, which was kinda nice. (""Playing With Fire."")  I've lined another weepie up for my 2nd, tonight!

It would have been even nicer if I lived a normal life, in a normal world, but this virus?...it's going to change everything, now. Normal is being upgraded and it takes a few years to discover that we have a new normal to live by.

If I were normal and socialised, I'd've got more than 1 birthday call and lots more than 2 cards. The really odd part is that I quarantine everything that comes into my house, so those two cards were not in the TV room...they were in the weights room, instead, standing up, smiled about and appreciated! A crazy Covid world!

So, here's hoping I'll be able to make my 65th birthday a touch more animated and populated.

702,"Before I continue, please do not read this if you have a history of self-harm or if your depression is really bad. I have placed a trigger warning in the title.

I joined here back in 2013 and it's been a while since I last been on here.
Since 2013 I have been in and out of many relationships, I lost a few close family members, I was bullied, sexually assaulted, abused, nearly died and other horrible things.

Recently my own brother told me that he wished I never existed and it hurt.
I'm currently living in East Yorkshire and the people here are treating me so badly, I miss all the people back in south east England. I'm absolutely miserable.

I've become anorexic, in the Spring/Summer time I also had thoughts of ending it all. I started self harming again and hadn't done it since 2017/2018, I took an overdose several times.

I'm a complete mess.

Where I live, the police aren't very helpful either, I got beaten up by a few, I never even did even to provoke them either.

I'm so sick of this life. I really want out. I tried calling my mental health crisis team and nobody is picking up the damn phone! I even tried Samaritans as well. It's like no one even cares!"

704,"I've had depression for a long time, I think - It's never been formally diagnosed, but I know that I have no motivation to do anything. I hate everything about myself, and can't do anything right. I know that people are lying to me when they say that I'm a good person, because I know the kind of person that I am - And if other people really knew me, they'd hate that person too. I find myself being so empty all the time, the only thing I want to do is sleep, and I can't get done the things that I need to get done. More than anything though, I'm lonely, and stuck in a cycle of hating that loneliness and knowing that I don't deserve it. I'm a hopeless person, and I don't know what to do about it anymore. I wonder, all of the time - How could anyone love me? How could anyone stand me? I just don't know anymore."

i got no friends
i lost all pleasure and interest in any hobbies - video games/music/tv shows/movies/books/sports/travel
i am self isolated and don't talk to anyone
i have terrible social anxiety,low self esteem, very lonely
i asked my doctor to try transcranial magnetic stimulation, i am so sick and tired of living"
706,"Havent feel so bad since long time. 

I deal with loneliness since years. 

Dont have anyone to talk, to share, to have a nice momment. 

I was being able to cope with this lately.

But theres a moment when this just overcomes me.

It really stress me. When the weight is just too much I started feeling rushed. I stand up, I sit down, the mental void is just too much, the need to have someone to talk to is too big. Feel so alone. I try and try to find people online to chat, but its not so easy as I thought."
707,"I was journaling, just trying to find a way to work through my thoughts and feel better. I wrote this below, and I can't stop thinking about it. I have such a dislike for myself and I don't see any way it can get better. Any thoughts?:

So much of these feelings stem from a genuine disliking of myself. I don’t like the person I am. I don’t like my personality, I hate the things I say, and I hate the way I feel. I am constantly paranoid that people don’t like me or are conspiring against me. I push everyone away. I have so much trouble trying to make small talk. It seems to come so easily for everyone else. Everything I say, I cringe at later. Everything I do seems wrong. I overreact because I’m always assuming people have bad intentions towards me. I create false scenarios in my head and convince myself they’re happening.

But deeper, I feel that there is something fundamentally wrong with me. I feel that people meet me, and their instincts tell them to stay away. Like some sort of negative force field around me. Its like meeting a sociopath – many people immediately feel uneasy around a sociopath even though they don’t know why, because something just feels “off.” I feel like that’s how people feel around me. And maybe they are right to. I am a source of negativity, whether it follows me around or it comes from within. The only people I tend to attract are people with their own issues, or people who feel obligated to keep me in their lives. I feel like I am toxic. I feel like I was born this way, which is why my mother did not love me and my father easily abandoned me. Its why my sisters had no problem letting me be my mother’s punching bag. Its why no one saved me. Its because their instincts told them that I deserve it. My instincts tell me the same thing. If anyone deserved this maltreatment, it was me."
708,"There are so many contradictory messages out there about shooting for the stars yet being happy with what we have. If we were happy with our current state, we wouldn't need to shoot for the stars. Why have dreams or fantasies at all if we're supposed to be content as we are? I get miserable wanting more, but I also feel like I'm not grateful enough for what I do have. How can I ever make myself happy this way? Any thoughts?"
709,"I'm feeling so depressed and I don't know how to help myself. I have so much support around me but I don't know how to use it. 

I get so depressed about things but I cause it. I don't help myself at all. I have no clue what to do with myself. I know all the options of help around me, but it doesn't help. 

I'm left wondering what the hell to do. I've felt stuck for a very long time now. I hate my situation, but at the same time get so scared to change. I dont know what direction to take. I feel so empty and so full of sadness."

Thanks all..."
711,"So, for about two months now, my mood has changed dramatically and I've lost interest in many things. I don't know if it's depression or not, I had bouts like this before in the past but not for this long. 

- College is not what it's cracked up to me, in truth I hate it and don't see much of an outcome from it. Also, I'm so sick of being reminded about this group chat that I didn't sign up for. I'm not interested in making friends or whatever because with my luck, they'll just leave and stab me in the back off the school chat. It's different here and in these Discord servers I'm in, I doubt I'll see anyone outside of them plus nobodies looking for anything from me.
- I hate drawing, it's just a chore and I'm not good at it at all. I used to love it and it comforted me but now, it just frustrates the hell out of me. The only reason I'll draw is for college, I'm going for a graphic design degree.
- I've come to the realization that not only do I hate my family, I generally don't care about any of them. I'm just the servant/pet feeder, nobody has ever given a damn about me but I'm suppose to care about their problems. I don't think so, that naïve person they once knew has grown up and doesn't want to hear it."
712,"It's hard for me to put into words how i'm feeling but i'll try. I feel like i'm numb or sad all the time. That that is my main emotions, i'll completely block out what i'm feeling and just be numb until suddenly, usually out of the blue, i get these waves of sadness and thinking. Which i'm in right now, so that's why i'm here trying to write into words what i'm feeling. It's exhausting. I'm tired. I just wish there was a magic button to get back to normal. I tried to create my own anonymous blog and write about it, but i think having more of a conversation might be better for me. I don't know. I'm distancing myself from everything, everybody, everything feels forced and like effort i just don't have."
713,"This is my first post here, so I’m a little nervous! But the last few months my mental health has been going down the drain quite rapidly, and just under a month ago, me and my partner of 6 years broke up. Dealing with him moving out, not seeing my 4 year old son every day, not having any confidence/body confidence in myself as we both got “comfortable” in the relationship, not being at work due to the doctors signing me off for nearly 9 weeks now, work was stupidly stressful before being signed off as I’m a senior carer and the care home had covid, AND the whole covid situation in general, it’s all becoming a bit too much. The doctors have upped my dosage of antidepressants, but they aren’t helping at all.
I’m 25, and have always isolated myself in previous “breakdowns”, but this time it’s so much worse as for half the week, I don’t have my boy keeping me going. 
I suppose I’m posting this because I’d like to get a thread going for parents, both mums and dads, who struggle with their mental health, and maybe feel like there’s a bit of extra support out there for people maybe in the same boat..."

715,"Hello everyone
well, my first post ever

I've decided to join this forum because everyday is getting worse, my depression is getting out of control. I almost cry daily.
This should be the best time of my life but seems like I dont deserve it.

I've had depression since like forever. I am anorexic and suicidal. I am fairly young but my life is shit. Since I was 13 my life became a pit of endless sadness and sorrow. My family does not give a damn about me. It seems like they are not even sorry. They treated me like a maid since i was a teenager and they still continue to do this. i wonder just why. why i deserve this? why me? i dont have friends, ive been bullied just for fun. God knows ive tried to befriend people but they treated me like shit.  
i developed an ed in order to ""have friends"" but ive destroyed myself. so 8 years of constant pain. ive self-harmed for a period it was hell. 
I spent my teenage years doing house chores and babysitting my sibling. no parties, no holidays, nothing.

Now at 20 yrs my life is destroyed. i am mess, a failure. who fucking cares im going to get a degree when i barely stop myself from crying. who cares im pretty when i dont even stand myself. 
i never had a boyfriend, have never been kissed. i cannot even talk to people. 

I 'd like to be dead so i would not suffer anymore. life is unfair. my siblings have 100% better life than mine. 
when i try to speak to my mom and tell her that because of them (my parents) my life is shit and i am a broken soul, she just says to not dwell bout the past and that my life will get better. bullshit. 

maybe i seem selfish but i've always put my family first. turns out it ruined me. they didnt deserve any of my love.
sometimes i feel so sad that i dont want to get better, its like im used to feel like shit. nobody cares about me, and this breaks my heart. ive always cared about people and gave them my support but nobody ever gave a damn about me. 
now i feel empty and bitter, bitter about the things ive lost, the things ive could have enjoyed like anyone my age. if only my parents could show their appreciation but it seems ive no right of it. my siblings treated them horribly, showed them no respect and they have always been forgiven. instead, i am yelled for every little thing. ive always been treated worse than my siblings and my parents deny it. i hate them for this. i fucking hate everyone. hope they feel proud of making my life hell on earth. but i ve always hurt myself for it. and i dont know why. 

seen from outside my life seems great and my family amazing. lies. i just want to kill myself. 

maybe posting here should make me feel better but it only makes me suffer more cause i am so fucking alone that i can only vent on an anonymous forum. i am truly pathetic"
716,"Hey, I suffer from severe depression and at the moment suicide seems like the only way out of my misery. Did anyone have a good experience with going to a clinic somewhere which helped them in some way?"
717,My dream is to move from Germany to Sydney one day.
718,"When i was younger, my dad always had affairs, he even had an affair whilst my mother was in hospital with scizophrenia so my brother and i were often at my aunt and uncles at this time.

He has trouble holding a job down, controlling his temper and often stole bill money.

My mum stayed with him because she thought it would ruin mine and my brothers schooling if they split up (absolutely isnt the case and wasnt)
It came to a head one day when i went into my dads room to borrow his comb and found a mobile phone on the side.
I found more texts from yet an other woman. I was 15 at the time and confronted him. He told me if i told my mum he would be done with me.
I told my mum, we packed his stuff together, locked him out and i didnt speak to him for a year and a half.

Eventually we spoke again and he seemed a lot different, fast forward a couple of years and him and his partner were getting on with my mum, my mum was a lot calmer and everything seemed great.

In the last year, i dont know what happened but hes completely gone back to how he was.
My brother ended up not speaking to him and still isnt and my dad thinks its ""my business"" to fix it for him.
He constantly tells me ive remembered childhood events wrong and hes done ""nothing but look after us"" he tells me im over sensitive when i tell him hes upset me and cant apologise without a ""but"" at the end.
Hes begun to constantly bash my mum again, ive recently found out hes told his partner that him and my mother split because of her illness and tells me to my face that ""it was so hard leaving your mum but i had to make that decision"" when i was the one that helped her pack his bags!

I feel like ive gone insane with it, am i remembering my whole childhood wrong?

I mentioned that i was seeing a councillor and he told me that i should ""speak to her about how i take comments the wrong way""

But i dont get upset about what literally anyone else says to me so surely it cant be me right?

Ive recently found out hes publicly spoke about my depression on twitter and saif that he ""guides"" me through it but thats never been the case and im upset hes publicly done that when he knows i dont like talking about that on the internet (hence this being anonymous)

Im now really worried about it because i dont have a common last name and this is the last thing i need.
Hes even said that my depression is hereditary from my mother but i just dont think thats the whole thing....

I spoke to my counselor about this for a while the other day and she asked me if i knew what a narcissist was and it got me researching and theres multiple examples of him doing every point

Have i got this all wrong? Am i being harsh on him because im having a bad time right now?"
719,"I'm having a hard time coping with my emotions. I am currently doing CBT and it was going great but I feel as though I am going downhill emotionally and mentally. Is this normal? I don't feel like a normal human being. I ask myself ""How does everyone around me look so content, confidence and sure about themselves?"" ""why am I filled with all these strong emotions? like sadness, shame, guilt, grief?"" ""Where has my confidence gone!?"" ""Why cant remember the last time I was happy..."" It's the heavy beast that wont go away. It's like the more I try and force it, the stronger it gets! Can anyone relate? I have serious low self-esteem and I feel like there is no way out! Does anyone have any advice? Some kind words? Anything would be appreciated.

Sending my love to you all. I hope you are having a good day/night."
720,"I feel lost. I often feel as if life is just unfolding itself and I am an observer watching from a fixed perspective. It seems as if my actions, thoughts and everything around me already exist or rather already have happened. Everyone around me is busy living life, following their goals and while I manage to do everything the way I ""should"", nobody seems to notice how unhappy and lost I am. Everyday I am asking myself fundamental questions and I understand that this is not really productive - I understand that I won´t find answers to what time is and how consciousness can exist by just thinking about it... But I can´t help it. These thought follow me everywhere. I don´t even understand how me writing this can be real. Maybe someone can relate, but I feel like I am distancing myself more and more from my friends and that these thoughts affect everything in my life... I am smoking a lot of weed, everyday I know that the shit isn´t helping either but yeah. Anyone?"

i just wish she knew i was ok and being take care of"
724,"So, it's been a while since I introduced my self and my struggling in this post.

One year and 3 months after being dumped, and 1 year and 2 months after starting therapy I am feeling like the crappiest person alive.

I obviously didn't manage to move on and rip off my emotional link to my ex. Things that happen in her life with her new partner affect me in a way it shouldn't. I tried everything I could to let the past in the past, and that included try not to care anymore, something that I simply can't because the invasive thoughts are always hitting my head, so letting it behind just didn't happen.

After so much time in the medicines and therapy, appart from some mild periods of time, I am always sad and pessimist. And it goes to an extent that exceeds the menthal and goes to the physical matters. Like since sunday I am as sad as I was 1 year ago, and it makes me feel lightheaded, dizzy and with no energy nor will at all.
I've tried to socialize, let the past behind and find someone new, but things went not too good as well. I have the social skills of a chicken that runs on the bare sight of other creatures, and living along the most sociable people in the world doesn't happen. Here in Brazil you are just considered as an unlikeable person if you are not sociable. People utimately rejects who isn't always around at social events, and believe me, there is A LOT of it here. I am  also a totally social awkward person and I just can't improve: today I was at the funeral of my best friend, like really best, who I grew up with, and I didn't manage to talk to his sister and his wife (that happens to dislike me for a reason I don't have a clue what is) because I was too anxious and feeling shy.
Also my so called ""career"" is just stalled. I thought about getting another job but this scared me to death, because I just can't cope with even the minimum risk, and looking backwards it seems I've massively failed everytime I did so.
I have no confidence at all. My self esteem which never was too high righ now is as close to the ground as a tortoise's belly is.
Every single day is a battle to get out of bed. I am starting to feel hopless. I don't want to die, both because I have huge fear of dying and because I believe it is the ultimate sin. But I don't feel like living anymore. The way things are going I am realizing I'll end up as a lonely person, and it utterly hurts me, because I hate to be alone.
The worst of all is that I have an objectively ok life. My parents love me and give me all the support. My job is just ok. I am grateful that I have a ceiling over my head and food on my plate every day, but it also makes me hate myself a little because I shouldn't be this sad. I tried to suck it up and man up, stop complaining, but, again, things didn't go as expected.

So I really appreciate if you have reached this point of the reading, and I'm sorry it is so long, but it is like an outburst for me."
725,"Just a warning, reading this could be upsetting.
I don't want anything good anymore. I don't want to keep trying because I know it is me lying to myself. I will never be any better and this is why, because I don't want to be. I do actually want to be, but the reality is that those wants distract me from the fact that I will never feel like I deserve that happiness. I feel like the world is too big for me. I feel like I'm never enough and I never will be. I try to accept myself and it is impossible. I try so hard to get better and I just keep hitting the same roadblocks and never overcoming them. I hate going places even if I like those places, and I just go because people want me to. I am always reaching with one hand and pushing away with the other. I don't want to be this way because I don't want to disappoint everyone else by being sad and by hating myself and by going nowhere in life. I have passions but I can't make myself go further with them because it hurts so much because I am there. I am part of it and I hate me. I just hate everything about myself. I am so thankful for my opportunity to live, but so sad because I can't seem to take the opportunity. Everything I love feels wrong. And if I were to take the ""right"" path and be normal and give up everything I love, I wouldn't be able to live it because in my core I don't feel those things. I choose things for my core self and I just hate them because they are now attached to me. I love my friends so much but I never want to talk to them again because I hate that they know me. It hurts to think that people know me. I can't lie to myself. Sorry if this is really depressing, I'm just not doing well. Thank you a lot for reading, I hope this doesn't make anyone upset! It'll be okay"

731,"Hi all,

Its been this year 2020 -  That i really admitted to myself, family and work that I have been suffering with depression/anxiety. For a number of years I buried my head in the sand about the issue, I now want to sort the problem out, I cannot keep living like this! I exclaimed many times.

After years of suffering, it triggered in my brain - Action speaks louder than words , you need to do something about this! Looking at the exterior of a person does not tell you much if not anything about their mental health. You need to speak up, get help, and bring this to the fore - people cant guess your suffering. This is one of the best things I have ever done - I am still in the doldrums but speaking about it to people can be compared to emptying your thoughts out of a window - or turning a relief valve on when the pressure is to high. 

After contacting my General Practitioner and explaining my condition to him. It was suggested to start taking Antidepressants (SSRI's).The Antidepressant I very first started on was 20MG Citalopram. 
Citalopram: an antidepressant. 

What I understood about how the tablet worked from research before hand

Works by increasing Serotonin levels - (The happy hormone)
After two of three weeks, will be fully in your system should start to notice effects
Is a powdered mixture tablet which when took works with neurotransmitters in the brain to help mood

I had to take this tablet every day, I did this each morning before travelling to work. Initially - I would say after two weeks, I did start to notice positive effects from the tablets. I did start to feel..

Initially more Energy
Clearer mind
Calmer
Brighter more positive thoughts
Smiling more making jokes
More light hearted (less serious)
Less gloom
Less nervous - although still present
I could speak better

All these benefits was like a absolute breath of fresh air for me, even close family and friends around me started to notice. Constantly asking me why I seemed to be on such a high. To me inside though - I really didn't notice, but to people who see you everyday of course they will see this.

After I would say 3-4 months of taking these tablets however I did start to notice serious side effects..

Weakness
Sickness every morning
The worst stomach acid and heartburn
Physical morning sickness
Could not concentrate on things again
Headaches

I spoke to the doctors about this - stating that when I first started to take these I really did experience such a initial high like a breath of fresh air. He suggested to me that perhaps the drug has flatlined and my body may have got used to it and actually may have rejected it, hence the symptoms.

From that meeting it was decided to downgrade to 10MG from the 20 I was on. 

These was a slightly physically and dosage wise smaller tablet to take. Still one a day. I found these to be non effective - not strong enough for me maybe, I did get some positives from it although not as strong, but at least the physical side effects stopped. 

As I didn't feel the 10MG's was giving me the mental benefits that the 20MG's did I decided to change to a different type of Antidepressant. 20MG Fluoxetine aka Prozac.

I have only been on these for a week, two week period so too early to note any effects positive or negative from them. I will update in future the more I have took the more I will notice benefits, side effects etc. This is a personal Antidepressant experience journal and will be updated accordingly as I go on.

What is your experience with Antidepressants? 

What have you took?

How have you found them, has it changed anything for you?

Until the next journal update on these.

Kind Regards"
732,Why is it that people text and ask how you are then don’t text back when youtold them.I tell people only the minimum so they don’t feel uncomfortable. Still nothing comes back. Reach out people say.come to realise this is bollocks to a certain extend mainly so called friends. The only true person I can relie on is myself. Sad but true. ☹️
733,"I am so emotionless,faceless. I cant smile or laugh as dont have any reason too,I just want to be left alone and people say I dont care. I do but I am so emotionally exhausted,I dont have the energy to show it. I only have energy to cry,that's about it.
Thanks for listening"
734,"So far I’ve tried 
•Trintellix- on 25 mg right now which is 5mg above the highest FDA approved dose. 
•TMS therapy specifically for depression. 

Both methods worked for a while but then the trintellix stopped working about a couple months after raising the doses. TMS worked well too for about 2 weeks out of the 6 week treatment.
I’ve been on Wellbutrin for a couple weeks now and it’s working well but I am absolutely terrified that it’ll stop too. The last options I have is ketamine therapy and if that doesn’t work then shrooms- they’re approved for medical use in Oregon and many studies show they help with depression. If those three things stop working too then I’m straight out of options which would mean that my life would not be worth living. But right now I still have hope left. 
My theory is that the depression comes back becuase I have to admit- I’m an angry and even toxic person at times. I can’t get over what was done to me in the past thats’s why. I hear depression is repressed anger. Could this be the reason why treatment stops working?

Also, has anyone else been treatment resistant too but then found something that worked?"
735,"Hi, I'm new here, and honestly not sure if I'll be hanging around as an active member of the forum or not yet but I just need to vent, and idk, see if maybe anyone can tell me there's an end to this that doesn't involve me ending my own life because right now I can't see one.

Basically I'm 24, and have been in and out of the mental health system for almost 10 years now. I was first involved with it when I was 15, a few months after I started self-harming, and the experiences I've had have ranged from 12 session courses that have been fully completed but didn't help, to not even getting past the assessment stage before they discharge me. I feel like I have red tape over my name that says 'noncompliant' or 'attention seeker' or something. At this point I feel like they *want* me to kill myself. They make it so freaking hard to stay in the system and then send follow up letters giving the impression that leaving was my choice and that I'm not trying hard enough.

Last contact I had with any mental health services was late 2017. It came a few months after another overdose, and I saw a woman who's job title I don't know and who was offering 'a few sessions', and I declined because by that point I was sick and tired of being thrown around from pillar to post, getting attached to a new person just to be tossed out again. Ironically, since not being involved with mental health services I've been way more stable (it was suggested in early 2017 that I might have BPD which may or may not be true, but regardless, being involved with the services makes me the most unstable.) But, I've still been completely stuck. I've been unemployed since Spring 2016, and haven't been looking for work as I know I wouldn't be able to keep it up anyway, am completely supported by my parents who I still live with which I'm aware I'm lucky to have, but I do want to be independent, I don't want to be stuck being a burden financially and emotionally on them indefinitely. I shower literally like once every 2 months, I don't have any IRL friends anymore, it very much just feels like I'm waiting to die, whether by my own hand or time.

Which brings me to now. This year, before COVID even really took hold of the country (I'm in the UK, not sure if this forum is worldwide or not) I figured this is my last chance to take my life back. Figured maybe I could try for disability benefits to get some independence, so in January I went to Citizens Advice for... advice. I left still confused, but figured if I just get into both the mental health system again (which felt like a necessary evil in order to potentially qualify for disability), and get on Universal Credit, that maybe in future it'd be a possibility. I saw my GP in March who referred me for a mental health assessment (I assume?) and applied for benefits in May, which I've been receiving since June. Luckily they haven't been requiring me to look for a job because of the pandemic, so that's been pretty painless so far, although I'm getting the feeling that I'll have to come off it soon because when they *do* start pushing me to get a job, I won't be able to commit to that. As for the mental health assessment... I'm still waiting. When I was first referred, I recieved a letter saying that the waiting list is usually about 13 weeks, but they're anticipating 4-5 months because of the pandemic, and I'm still here 8 months later with no end in sight. They call every month or two, ask if anything's changed, and that's it basically. The last guy who called last week straight up asked if I still want to be on the waiting list or not. I am convinced they're trying to free up space and get people off the waiting list. And I'm sure that even if I do manage to get an assessment at some point, that it's going to be the same story, potentially even worse because of the pandemic, that they'll try to trip me up and get me out of the system at every corner again to free up space.

Sorry for the huge wall of text but I really don't know what else to do. I feel like I've tried everything. I never wanted to be on benefits, but this really was supposed to be my last chance at actually having a life and I can't even get past the first hurdle. I don't think I can handle much more time on this waiting list, and this is just for the assessment itself, let alone any more waiting lists for more meetings and potential treatment when like I said, they're trying to trip me up at every turn. At this point I feel like my only option is just to give up on it all and end it."
736,Ever since being depressed my libido has decreased tremendously and it’s been something which I feel has made me and my partner less close to each other. Are there any tips for this because I really want to feel normal again
737,"Im depressed, dysthymia is what my therapist has recent called it.
A mild but long-term form of depression.
Dysthymia is defined as a low mood occurring for at least two years, along with at least two other symptoms of depression.
Although it doesn't always feel mild but my everyday it like it just on this mild repeat. I started seeing a therapistearlier this year to really try to make progress as I have been dealing with this and anxiety since I was pretty young. 
  My actual question being do other people feel their mood changing? Do you feel the mood drop coming? I do, sometimes the drops are worse than others and sometimes I can fight them off. Other time its like I sense the tidal wave coming and there nothing I can really do about it but wait it out."
738,"I've been having a really tough time recently. Everything just feels overwhelming and like I should be handling it better.

My spouse also suffers with depression and anxiety and also seems to be having a 'flare up'. I guess the difference is that they express themselves, at least to some extent to me. They have outbursts and tell me what they're feeling. All of which I understand, support and know is needed for them to say.

The problem is that I don't feel I can do the same. I feel like it would burden their already struggling mind. They're suffering so much and I don't want to make it worse. But now I'm stuck feeling all of these emotions with no outlet whatsoever. I've been crushing up high doses of diazepam and taking Co-codamol to try and dull the feelings. I know I've been taking way too much but it's the only thing that gives me any relief right now.

I don't have anyone in my life I can talk to.

I've also resorted to self harm again. A few injuries are more severe than others. I've been trying to hide them and my spouse doesn't seem to have noticed.

I feel like I need help but I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm teetering on the edge. I don't have anyone else I can reach out to. I just feel alone while also feeling like I have to make sure the person I love doesn't feel like that themselves.

I would appreciate any advice anyone has to offer. Thank you."

740,"I hadn't much thought about this before. Surely how you feel about yourself is massive. If you're depressed or otherwise ill, it is often harder to like yourself.

I'm not sure what it means to like oneself. To be OK with what you are. I may want a better life, but that is not me, that's circumstances I can only do so much about.

Yeah, I like myself most of the time."
741,"Tired of always being an outsider and feeling like I don't belong.
I can go days without speaking to my kids if I'm really low.
My husband's so tired and stressed, we barely speak.
I know it's not easy, I've lived with a mother and husband with depression.
I've never felt good enough, it's like being picked last for the school sports team but mine was my family and me and my sister weren't chosen. 
I find it so difficult to actually talk to people,  colleagues and family members. I overthink, pull it apart, worry about saying the wrong thing and looking stupid, so I say nothing and people think I don't care. But I care too much.
There is so much more going on in my head but thats why I'm having therapy.
On my next good day I will try to go for a walk as I've not been out of the house for a few weeks.

742,"Hello, I just really want to end my life due to a mistake that I made a few years ago where I let someone take advantage of me sexually. It was my first sexual experience and I feel horrified. I feel like I am not allowed a normal relationship.

I'm a 26 year old female."
743,"I usually get depressed in the winter time, but with this year being the absolute shit show that it has, it's no surprise that this is the worst I've been yet. 
I suffer with anxiety which has been next-level bad recently too, so adding depression to the mix just makes things all the more difficult. The anxiety still definitely outweighs the depression, so at least I've not completely succumbed to the apathy quite yet, I must still care if I feel anxious, right?. I have no hope for the future, no career goals, no motivation or will to live. I barely eat. The overwhelming anxiety just makes me feel even more miserable, and being depressed makes me anxious that I'm going to ruin my life and relationships and end up jobless because I can't physically bring myself to get up most days. 

Despite all this, which sounds pretty troubling, I still have this awful habit of trying to convince myself and everyone else that I'm fine. I'll laugh at a meme on my phone and instantly tell myself ""well clearly you're not depressed then"", but then later that day start crying my eyes out because I dropped a spoon on the floor.  
My family are pretty reserved emotionally and not very physically affectionate either; my dad's autistic and he's super uncomfortable talking about feelings - something that definitely passed onto me. I shy away from affection, though I crave it so badly I have no idea how to navigate it. I struggle to be sincere and use humour as a coping mechanism, taking the piss out of my own suffering so it seems less serious. But there's only so long you can keep this up for before it starts to eat you away from the inside. I fear I'm becoming so severely depressed that I can't even see the funny side anymore. I'm so sad and so lost, I want to be able to talk about it with my friends and family without feeling like a total downer and wanting to crawl out of my skin and disappear. I'm so scared people will think I'm too damaged to be worth being friends with and won't want to put up with my issues, so I even when they ask ""dude are you okay?"", of course I tell them ""yeah I'm fine"". 

 I just want a fucking hug, man."

745,"Hi guys,

Long story short:

My partner tried to commit suicide about two months ago and was on the way to recovery until I found out from her brother-in-law that she just tried it again and he has taken her to hospital.

What are the things I can do/say to her to help her?  I feel like I have done everything possible to help her the first time around, but I guess it just wasn't enough.  The first time the hospital discharged her and they said she was fine.  I really hope the hospital gives her the treatment and support she needs because clearly nothing is working.

If someone can give advice on anything similar to this situation it would be greatly appreciated, thank you."
746,Anyone free to talk?
747,"It’s been a while now that I feel as if all my depression, anxiety etc are all in my head and they are something I have created because I want attention and I want to pity myself. There are times where these thoughts get so bad I start to question everything.

Can anyone help out/share similar experiences?"

749,"Hello, I do suffer with depression and I have for sometime now. I know that if I have a goal to reach for then that occupies my mind, in other words a distraction. I find that helps me. I did attempt suicide in June and since then my number one focus is to get away from my current location and just start new. That's been the goal I have been working towards so I started an English as a foreign language course so I could teach English abroad, I have nearly finished it but due to covid there are no jobs available. After finding out that it probably would be a few years until I could actually do that job abroad well it did get me down and that made me get myself worked up, stressed out and I just isolated myself so I could just evaluate my whole life. I know it sounds extreme but I was banking on that to be my way out and a new path to happiness. Well after a couple of days I found a new plan and that was to move further up north and flat share and get a job or even an apprenticeship. That has given me a new goal to reach and just the will to carry on with my life. The question I want to ask is that if I carry on banking my hopes on goals or targets then would it be a good thing or a bad thing or are there other methods to cope. It may just be that once I get to a place where I find inner happiness then I wont need 'new goals' to chase. Thanks for reading."

i often ask myself as well.
what is it about myself that causes my constant pain.
my relentless disembodiment with the courage to persist in life.
my tendency to look up at the sky and fall
and fall
and fall.

and i’ll always fall farther than before.
i’ll always push the boundaries.
and as i catch myself and crawl back to surface level each and every time,
i will wonder about those boundaries.
where are they?
when will i reach them?
what will happen when i fall so far that i could not possibly fall any further?
what will i hit?

will it be over then?
how close am i right now?
how close am i to the end?

can this be cured?
will i ever be okay?

that word always makes me cry.
“okay”
it’s so foreign to me. 
even when i do feel okay, i can’t help but doubt it.
am i really okay when i’m okay?

i don’t know.
i don’t seem to know a lot of things lately.

752,"My depression has been under control for a while now and I have been feeling good and positive and enjoying life. For this I am very grateful. However, I have a problem in that hearing of suicides - particularly those where it is someone of a similar demographic to me with maybe similar interests or whatever, I get obsessed and just can’t stop thinking about them. I think about how they did it, I look at photos of them, I read what their loved ones have written about them. One of these for example was Caroline Flack earlier this year, I was not a big fan, didn’t know much about her at all until she died. More recently, a friend of someone I went to school with, but wasn’t really close with, who was my age, had similar interests but to me had a ‘better’ life than me ( I know this is wrong, and mental illness can happen to anyone) 

I just can’t stop thinking of her and why she did it and how she was feeling. Looking at her photos which all she looks happy and that she has an amazing life and lots of friends. Wondering about her final moments. I feel like I am going crazy and cannot focus or think of anything else. And I don’t know how to stop. I have tried deleting social mediaapps so I can’t look but I just redownload them. Why is this happening and how can I ensure it doesn’t happen every time a woman around my age dies by suicide? I’m scared that thinking of it so much will make me feel suicidal again myself."
753,"Every month, i feel so much worse, the very day, i spend in bed. I feel so tired and sometimes have strong thoughts of suicide which i find very frightening. I never normally have them. 

I feel heavy, extremely sad, i could stay in bed all day, go back to bed, and nothing happy in me, not possible to think of anything but the worst of everything. I managed to get in the bath to break the chain of thought, and it did get me up, but i still feel the same. 

I hope this does not last too long. The older i get, the less i can stand it. I dread it, depression, dread it."

755,"I (28) was dating this gorgeous girl (27) for 4 months, but ended things because It was killing me on the insider.

We met at a bar (of course not a great place) and really hit it off, but as we kept seeing each other I started to realize how much she took forever to text me and would leave me on read. Sometimes it would be hours, a day or at most 3 days. 

We also only saw each other once a week, but always met on the days she was only free. Especially with the whole corona virus she had a lot of time, me on the other hand had to go to work everyday. She was great in person, but at the same time once she leaves it feels like she’s a totally different person than in person. I always initiated texting and also called but she never picks up (not constantly calling just like once in a while).

On our fourth day she uttered out that she loves me, but that put us both in shock cause she said she didn’t mean to say that.  Then I told her what my intentions were, which was looking for an exclusive relationship, but to her she was telling me how a relationship is like practicing for marriage and wanted to take it slow.

Few weeks pass by and confused as to what we were and devastated, I asked her where this was going and if we were serious or casual and she told me it was casual cause she was thinking of marriage and kids and didn’t want to miss the opportunity to meet that someone and apologized for being selfish. 

That killed me on the inside and I spent 2 day’s prepared to break it off and saw her in person assuming she would accept the fact that things wouldn’t work and end, but her reaction threw me off and she told me she wanted things to work and we spent 2 hours talking and she wanted time to think of either being committed or being casual. Cause I told her if we were casual I wouldn’t want to try as hard and not put her as a priority just like she hasn’t been to me which I guess made her very sad or pretending? She also said meeting once a week was enough for her and texting doesn’t define a relationship. This is coming from a girl that always talked about other guys and taking her phone into the bathroom when she’s spending time at my place. This was how bad I started overthinking.

Anyways, she texted me saying her she has a lot of time off cause of corona and can fit into my schedule, but I just couldn’t handle it cause I was confident and ready to end it. I texted her saying that I am worth more than just being an option and I would like to give her time to think, but I don’t see this working and these 4 months were fun, but I need to walk away from this.

She texted me 3 hours later saying how she didn’t want us to break up and how she felt very comfortable being around me and “confide in”. She understands what I am hoping, but at this moment she can’t give me what I want immediately and apologized for being selfish.

That’s when I left her on read, blocked her, deleted her. This was 3 months ago. 4 months seem short but I just fell deep.

Ive been trying dating apps but never get matched, I’m not the type who just approaches girls and being in Japan and knowing only 3 people here I just feel so lonely. The weekends hit me the hardest cause I realize I’m at home all alone no one calling or texting me. I just don’t know what to do anymore and she won’t get out of my head, I just want to let go of her. I don’t miss her, I’m not as angry anymore, but I just don’t know how to let it go and I’m scared I’ll be stuck in this rabbits hole."
756,"Is there any worse trigger for depression than loving someone who doesn't return the feelings?

It's even more complicated because the person is also a friend and a work colleague so I can't even walk away and move on. Even worse is that she is like one of those people where the stars align and everything that you ever wanted is there... except not. 

Initially, I thought that maybe there was something. There was some light flirty banter and we chatted and joked all the time. She would tell me about girls she was talking to that she was interested in. I realised that she was telling me a few white lies (either wasn't talking to them or they were just friends) and maybe she was trying to make me jealous. But in the next breath she was encouraging me to go on dating apps. She even asked me if she'd confused the situation between us and had I developed feelings for her. I told her no. I just didn't want to make things awkward for her or me.

The other day she told me that she had just joined a dating app and couldn't wait for the lockdown to be over as she had a date she'd been putting off (surprising as she'd just joined). She sent me a screen capture of her dating admin page. Not sure why. I tried not to seem interested. Now she doesn't seem to want to chat anymore. When I start a conversation I get short one-word answers. 

Jealousy is consuming me and really making me down. I interact with her everyday with work so I can't just walk away. How the heck do I change my feelings for her."
757,"I am 69 years old  and have been feeling depressed lately. It is hard to explain what is wrong without sounding like I am whining.  What is depressing me is seeing all the young guys with all these awesome cute young ladies with awesome asses and realizing my time is over.  I will never again be that young or have that opportunity.  My time is over.

I look back at all the mistakes I have made and all the opportunities I blew.  Back when I was in my early 20's I met a girl who was 16, she was super cute, super sexy and we got married when she was 17.   10 years later she weighed 400+ pounds and I couldn't stand to look at her so I divorced her.  What depresses me is I dumped two really beautiful girls for her.  If I had stayed with one of them, I would still be married to either since I have seen both and they are still beautiful even in their 60's.  I met a super hot 19 year old when I was 42 and we had a relationship but she left me to go to New Orleans and be a fortune teller.  Another woman I met was the love of my life, I was 43 and she was 34.  She OD'd.  Nothing like waking up next to a still corpse.  I went though a few other women, none good looking or that sexy and finally got tired of being alone and found a woman online.  She was average, not really pretty, not really sexy, but we hit it off, we are a lot alike, her birthday is two days before mine so we got married between our birthdays.  I found out later that she started having sex at 14 and by 18 had 50 lovers and by 50 figured she had around 150 sex partners.  Now she says she is tired of sex and not really into it anymore.  So once again my luck bites me in the ass and I am left looking at all the sexy women out there with awesome asses that I cannot ever get near.  That is what is depressing.  I should have just stayed single and bought one of those sex dolls that look like real women...."
758,"Hi there. 
I would love some advice. I am on Lithium and Mirtazipine / Remeron. 
I am sleeping well on these meds but absolutely hate Lithium as it robs me of passion and libido. However, I am afraid to remove it IF it is the factor in helping me sleep. 
Does anyone feel it is helpful for sleep?
Or perhaps it is the Remeron which is helping me. 
Would love some opinions / advice as I'm not due to see my doc for another month and I'm tempted to consider stopping Lithium. Not Bi Polar by the way."

I'm studying. I currently don't have any friends because of a move but I have accepted this fact and that I will soon have friends again. Still, I can't seem to get any better. I can't seem to find my way back to my hobbies, can't seem to actually be here. I just do everyday as I am supposed to. I study, I text my boyfriend, I eat, I watch some youtube, I stare into a wall, do my skincare, go to bed. But I'm not really doing anything. I feel like a grey blob with no emotions but anger. I feel angry all the time. I feel angry at myself, at my family and the universe, at my boyfriend.

Yesterday I was laying in bed and started crying. It felt really good to let some emotion out. But then after 1 minute the crying stopped and I didn't feel anything. I couldn't even remember why I cried. So I got angry at myself. I started harming myself and punching the pillows in hope to feel anything other than anger and sadness. I don't understand why I am like this. Why my emotions keep disappearing and why I keep getting angry at everyone. I can't seem to be myself. I am always in the bubble of fucking grey and nothing is fun. It's so fucking annoying. Has anyone else felt this way? Being angry all the time? It's like me not being able to do anything because of the depression is making me angry. I don't want to live like this anymore."

761,"Trigger. Mentions of murder and molestation.

Christmas use to be my favorite holiday growing up and despite everything my mom tried to make it special every year and she succeeded but

I hate Christmas now days for many reason. First because of my siblings and their in laws makes me feel like total shit and they already do that enough on my birthday which I refused to celebrate this year and they refuse to buy me even a dollar gift.

Last year was by far the worst christmas and the year before thst was almost as bad and it makes me fear for this one. Last year, my sister went and blew the present money for the kids on weed instead of what my mom asked her to buy. Last year my brother in law verbally abused my niece so bad she hates him now. The year before that there was so much unspoken resentment and my other niece was acting out so bad, it was scary.

TRIGGER.

Christmas is bad because in 2010 my nephew  was murdered on December 1st and my mom and brother almost died while driving down to his funeral. He was one years old and my older nephew was left in an abusive foster home for another year and a half.  My nephew from 2012-2016 and somewhat now acts out badly during the holiday because he witnessed his brothers murder and it scared him. My nieces were molested for years and then abandoned by their mother on Christmas day, so they act out terribly on Christmas as well. 

It's feels like such a curse. How can one of my happiest childhood memories be such a big fear of mine now? I seriously dread this holiday and I KNOW its gonna suck this year but I'm the only one who seems keen on cancelling the holiday. We could lie to the little kids and tell them Santa can't come this year because of covid but they wont listen

And I doubt MY kid will get any Christmas presents compared to the others. Bullshit. I have no spare money for Christmas and that's depressing me too. My kid behaves better than most of their yet he is gonna think he's been naughty because all the other kids will be getting more.

100% done"
762,"I wish I was pretty enough 
I hate it when someone tells my friend sitting next to me that she is so pretty, that she has a beautiful jacket, that she loves everything she wears. 
I feel so ugly and disgusting everytime I hate it so much I wish I could get out.
I don't care about the ""we are all beautiful"" because it doesn't change how I feel, I want to feel nice for once, I wish I could dress myself good enough, and when i do i wish someone could say that it looks nice i wish people would stop ignoring me....or not I don't know :(
I want to disappear, I don't want to be seen everything is so bad ;;; there is nothing good about me, I fail everything lately"
763,"I keep catastrophising thinking something dreadful is going to happen to me in the next few days, weeks or months, with anxiety going into the stratosphere.  I have had this feeling for many years, I'm still here but I cannot get rid of the feeling."
764,"My Wife has depression and anxiety disorder.
A common theme is as follows, which happened today.

We have a young child, who follows a very erratic routine, most days are different. Probably not too unusual in itself...

Him not sleeping is a known trigger for my wife’s depression / anxiety. We have talked about it at length. She’s also recently had CBT.

I was working at my desk, a few feet from where our son sleeps. It was nap time, so my wife put him down to sleep. Within a few minutes, it was clear that he wasn’t going to sleep. I suggested that my wife potters about and if he cries too much I’ll sort him out.

She did for a bit, but soon came back to his door. The baby was already screaming wildly at this point, a really attention grabbing shriek. I’m already a bit anxious myself, as things can spiral quickly for my wife, plus I find the screams distressing.

She seemed ok to start with. There were short conversation about how it messes up the day, maybe we should just leave him to cry it out etc?

I’m trying to say the right thing, suggest he sleeps in a Pram downstairs, or has a nap later in the day etc. Most of these things are met with objections and I begin to irritate her.

Within what seems like 5 minutes my wife seems to be full of frustration and what feels like anger towards me. And it escalates.

My wife is telling me that, as usual I’ve not done the right thing given the situation. I’m being yelled at, or at least talked to very sternly.

Her issue is now with me. I’m told I’ve not recognised her trigger early enough. My wife has told me many times before that all she needs is for me to give her a hug and tell her it’ll be ok. But if I don’t do that quick enough, the trigger is pulled and it’s too late. She wants to take her own life. It’s my fault for not emotionally supporting her and I’m too lazy to try. Any attempts of comfort are entirely out of the question now. I’m told I’ll never change and I’ll never give her what she asks for.

So the obvious answer here is, just give her a hug! The problem is, I can’t always recognise when she needs one. I feel like I’ve tried in the past to say ‘it’ll be ok’ and hug her, but just been told it won’t be and pushed away. And sometimes I recognise it and it diffuses the situation. How can I improve my judgement on this?

Also, I feel that it’s unfair that I should get the blame. Can one persons emotional state be blamed on another? I don’t ignore things, I’m attentive, I try and say the right things at the right time, and hug when I think it’s needed. I guess I’m just terrible at judging it and saying and doing the right thing.

This is one example. We argue a lot about various things.

I’m on edge a lot of the time, knowing that if I don’t handle situations properly, or worse if I get angry or frustrated myself, things spiral beyond control. Once the control is lost, we can argue for days, especially if my anger or frustration appears. I do find it almost impossible to not feel like that, after a while I can’t take anymore and I snap.

I’ve taken to removing myself from the situation a lot of the time to self harm in an effort to vent some anger and frustration. Or I will slam doors and shout. Often I will cry to myself, or in front of my Wife. Sometimes my Wife tells me I pretend to cry to manipulate her. I really don’t, it’s despair and desperation. I can literally be in my knees begging for us not to argue, but that has no affect. I’m told I’m either ‘talking at her’ or I’m a ‘robot’ that doesn’t care. I feel like she’s very aggressive towards me, and that upsets me.

My mental health is clearly suffering as a result of all this, and the general COVID situation I guess. I just don’t know what to think of what to do.

When we’re not arguing, we do get on very well."
765,"my depression is getting worse to the point where i can't sleep anymore or concentrait, and i'm always feeling dizzy, and i think i'm hearing things and i'm scared but every time i get any ounce of sleep even if its for a couple hours during the day because i'm awake until 12:00 pm then i get a couple of hours of sleep when i do sleep i have nightmares i don't know why what if its a premonition that this stuff is happening to me, that my life is about to be over."
766,"Hi everyone,
I just joined this forum because I think it can help me so much.
I just want to talk about my case because I really need to know if this is a depression because I think it can be and I'm afraid.
I've been like this since 2018, i will sumarize this brievly: when I was a child I could see colors, lights, shadows... for society I've been always blind but that I could see helped me a lot. But I had a problem on my right eye, the only one who could see, and I lost that.
My memories of that first months aren't clear, I only wanted to cry sleep, cry, sleep... you know? I didn't want to live, I felt sad every day, every time...
Suddenly I felt better, i wanted to live again, I felt good!
But from some months ago to now I feel again the dark, and now is my family who hurts, concrectly my mom, she said me that I'm fat because I don't want to go to walk and that I'll get ill. But what happens to me is that I only have forces to go from my bed to my desk to follow my online classes, I feel tired, sad, I can't sleep well...
Please I'm afraid as I said at the begining of this post and I need help, if you think is not depresion but you can say me what's it I would be vvery grateful."
767,"Hi :)

my question is stated above. Feeling really down because of corona and not being able to see much of my friends at the moment. What cheers you up?"
768,"I know I am depressed. That's not a question. I just don't know how things got this bad. I really want to give up. I'm not going to but want to. Outside of feeling depressed I feel like i have lost my emotions, motivation, ability to feel pleasure. Basically everything that made me human. I also have brainfog. feels like i had a lobotomy. can't recall words or keep up with conversation. i spend all my time alone if i can help it.

I spend my days killing the time online until I can sleep again. This is ridiculous. But i can't chage it. I literally cannot feel joy anymore. I can't feel connection with loved ones i have cared for all my life.

Can depression cause all this?  I have a script for wellbutrin i have yet to feel. If i do fill it im not sure how i will afford to maintain it,

Anyway, i was hoping someone could let me know if they have felt this way and it got better?

Feeling utterly hopeless right now
thanks for reading"
769,"I'm tired of living every single day like this.

770,"I was doing ok for a week or so... and now I’m right back down again. Nothing really changed in my life... nothing got great or got worse, but I just find myself sinking again.
I feel like I put so much effort in trying to be there for other people that I neglect myself. I am always trying to be support for others when their upset or need to talk... family, friends, co-workers... it’s exhausting. I’m exhausted. I’ve spent so much time trying to live a life for others that I feel I’ve accomplished nothing for myself. I also see that those others I’ve been there to support move on with their lives and I’m just here alone, uncared for... like there’s such a big void in my spirit... in my heart.

772,"I’ve been dating a guy for 3 months. In the beginning we would talk every day, see each other in person at least once or twice a week. Things were going great until about a month ago. He started a new job ( he hasn’t been working when I met him because of the pandemic). At first we’d still talk every day, but he would tell me that he was really tired from work. The job is really physical and hard on his body. He also has epilepsy, and one day he told me that he felt like he was going to have an episode (a seizure was coming). After this I didn’t hear from him for 4 days. When he finally answered me, he said that he had been working a lot and really tired. He also told me that he “ goes ghost” when he gets tired and stressed. He explained that he does it to his friends and others also. After that we were talking normally again for a week or so. Then he started talking to me every other day or so, and he’d tell me that he’s tired from work and he sounded kind of down when he talked. It’s been two weeks since I’ve heard from him now. I’ve sent him three messages and he doesn’t answer them, so I haven’t sent any more. I don’t want to bother him.I know he also has elderly family members that he lives with and takes care of. He’s told me before that they stress him sometimes. I don’t know for sure if he has depression, but on his social media almost all of his posts mention depression or imply struggling to find happiness or something like that. He hasn’t posted anything, but he has been on a couple of times and liked a picture or two. I don’t know if I did or said something wrong to him. I want to be compassionate and supportive, but I don’t want him to feel like I’m going over a boundary or something. How can I show him that without being pushy and reaching out too much?"
773,"ughh i was gunna write some fancy eloquent shit here like usual (to make myself feel less guilty about not writing my film studies essay oops hehe) but i cba i just wanna vent.

So, thanks to lockdown 2.0, my best mate who i houseshare with (along with a couple others) has gone home way early for xmas, leaving me with the other two hermits in our household. One of whom is in our little friend squad, but his girlfriend is staying over currently so i have to listen to them shagging all night and giggling together in the kitchen while im sat in my room feeling lonely and irrelevant cos my only friend left. 

I do sometimes talk to them in the kitchen when i go down to make food but theyre mostly just preoccupied with eachother and conversations dont rly go anywhere, i'll be friendly, make convo etc but usually theyll just take over and I wont be part of it anymore. Cant get in the way of young love i guess lol. 
I'll be honest, i cant say i'm that arsed about lockdown but idk man i feel kinda iffy about these two blatantly ignoring it. (probably just because i'm jealous like).

I'm just sad cos ive nobody to talk to face to face anymore. I just wanna stay in bed all day curled up with the curtains drawn and do nothing, think nothing, be nothing. I dont even feel like i exist anymore. Trynna find a purpose but i'm coming up empty."
774,"Sunday was an ok day and I went to bed at 2am, which is good for me. I had set 2 alarms, which I decided to turn off and ignore as I was so tired and my whole body ached. I continued to nap, my daughter came in saying dads on his way home. I usually feel guilty if I'm still in bed and get up but I physically couldn't and mentally didn't care. I felt nothing apart from heavyness and pain in my body.
It became dark so an hour or so later I thought I'd better make an effort. I locked at the time and it was 19.30hrs. I had not been up for anything all day. 
I messaged my husband to come help me out of bed, he helped wash and dress me.
My brain is numb, had no feelings (until a minute ago when I read a bereaved teens post).
Therapy is going too slow, I want my life back. I want me back.
I read or listen to positive things and think ""great I'll try that"" and then instantly forget.
I also keep asking for a different antidepressant as this isn't working but all they keep saying is we're waiting for the psychiatrist, but it seems to be taking ages."
775,"So as far as I’m concerned my life is going pretty well. I have a good job, financially stable, on track to getting a good degree (in my final year) and into the career i really want soon after. I have close friends and good family. My depression has been under control and I have been happy. Yet every couple of weeks, sometimes more, I feel like I just get hit with the deepest depression again and it feels like someone is sat on my chest, heavy, just the lowest I can get and sometimes suicidal thoughts. I don’t think I’ll do it, because I’ve thought about it so often and haven’t, and I know deep down I will come out of this. But I want to stop it, I don’t want this feeling every couple of weeks. I know we all get bad days but this is way more than that and I am sat here thinking nothing is wrong, everything is going so well, why do I feel this crush of depression?

I don’t know how to get out of it either, as I’m already doing all the things that usually make me happy - exercise, talking to friends, eating well, working, relaxing etc. So how can I pull myself out of this darkness when it comes? And how can I avoid it happening again?"
776,"I am in a relationship with my partner who I love deeply. However, we went through the most horrible time earlier this year due to her mental health and it emotionally and physically destroyed me. I gave everything to it and lost myself in the process. We worked through things and are in a better place, but she expects me to just move on and not bring it up as she ‘was going through a ‘breakdown’. She says things like ‘why did you listen to that person, I wasn’t me, and she was crazy’.  But that doesn’t make what she said and did any less hurtful. I myself suffer with depression and find that when we argue, which isn’t often, and is largely to do with me trying to say how I’m feeling and her telling me what I said is insulting to her, that afterwards I feel a wave of ‘not wanting to be here’ thoughts.  Why does the suicidal thoughts always come about when I’m upset or when we have fallen out that it triggers me?  It makes me feel like I’m not good enough, and I want it to stop, I want life to stop sometimes"
777,"Hi everyone, new here.

I was wondering if anyone found any of Dr Amen's books or supplements helpful in treating depression?"
778,"I started ""working"" about two weeks ago - since I just graduated, I wanted to observe some appointments and see other doctors work before I could schedule my own appointments. I thought that observing first would be not only wise, but also would make it easier for me after I started working with patients.

Last week I saw a new doctor on the clinic, she just graduated too, so I found it weird and went to talk with the director of the clinic, asking him if I could start to schedule my own appointments, and he agreed.
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday - no patients. I thought today, after the weekend, I would finally have my own patients and appointments, but nothing. I have spent 8 hours a day standing up leaning my back for 2 weeks, I have observed enough. The other ""new doctor"" never observed a single appointment, she just simply came and has about 6 patients a day - they scheduled all of them in a matter of literally a day (?). 

I have asked the secretary if there is any problem, why do I still have no appointments scheduled and she simply said ""give time to time"" - this makes no sense to me, the director of the clinic always said they needed someone with urgency because there were a lot of patients trying to schedule appointments.

The director of the clinic has already mocked me about how introvert and reserved I am - but I've tried to change it, I've tried to be more communicative. The fact that I don't speak loud and have a shy posture does not mean I am bad at what I do. Today I left home so happy and cheerful, thinking about how my work day would be. When I asked the assistants if I had any appointments, they said no. When I asked ""how about tomorrow?"" - they just shrugged. I felt like crying. I learn a lot by observing appointments, but I spend the whole day up, without sitting down (except for lunch), at the end of the day I feel tired physically and mentally. For what?

I trully feel like they don't like me. I always say ""Good morning"" or ""Have a nice day"" - the secretaries never answer me. I feel like they don't like me. I'm not as extroverted and easy going as the ""new doctor"", but that doesn't mean I would do a worse job.

I feel like they don't want me there. That they just ""hired"" me because I was the first to go there, and we agreed I would observe first and work after. The other girl was hired on a friday and had patients on a tuesday.

I want to quit. I felt happy, but my depression will probably get worse if I go trough this every day."
779,"Hello. I’m a girl living in Indonesia and I’m currently 20 years old. I’ve just realized 2 years ago that the term of “toxic parents” exists. All this time I just thought that my parents are stubborn and selfish. So, I live in a house with my mom, dad, and 2 brothers. I’m their only daughter. They give me a lot of chores, but I can’t always do that because right now I’m in university and I’m studying architecture, which has a lot of assignments. They never really give appreciation for what I’ve done. Once I got the 1st place in an architecture competition but they didn’t even congratulate me. They always say that I’m not enough, I’m not like the other kids (always comparing me to their friend’s children). I’m not the type of person that get sad that easily. But right now, I’m starting to get depressed by them.

You guys know because of this Covid-19 situation, school and university is closed and we’re doing an “online school” thing. Then, of course I’m going to be on my laptop a lot. But, my mom just said to me that I’m on my laptop all day and I don’t help her with the chores. Then, I have this hobby of doing digital drawing and she said to me “you’re doing useless thing”. I was so hurt when she said that because that’s my hobby and you said that’s useless. She’s saying it just as if doing my hobby is useless and i should’ve just do the chores. 

I usually just make the school (or university) as my runaway, because there I don’t meet my parents, I have my friends and my classes that just kinda make me forget about this “toxic parents” problem. But now because or the covid-19 situation we can’t go to school and we can’t go anywhere else either.

They never ask about our (me my brothers) feelings. They always talk about their feelings, how they’re so tired, how their feet hurt from going up and down the stairs so much (we live in a 3 level house). They literally never asked how we’re doing, what we’re doing. 

I don’t know what should I do because I can’t move out until I get married and that might still be about 3-4 years from now. I don’t think I can handle it for that long. Sometimes I think the best way is to cry about that because it makes me feel relieved, but I can’t do that now because my parents sleep in my room because their room’s AC is broken. I can’t even express my sadness. Please tell me how to deal with this situation."
780,"Hi, 

Some backstory. My now ex (f23)and I (m24) broke up about 6 weeks ago , after dating for a year and 7 months. Overall it was a fantastic relationship, one where I and her were genuinely happy and in love. We're both very individual people with strong personalities that clicked, same humour, a crossover in interests, hobbies and taste that felt almost a little scary at how similar it was, physically very compatible, similar goals and ideas for the future. Everything was there and I was and am still deeply in love with her.

We had both dated other people in the past, both seriously and not. This was the first relationship that I had been in where I would have been happy if it never ended, whereas she had been in serious (but almost all were toxic, manipulative and trauma filled from her own descriptions of them) relationships before me. This was basically the first relationship that she had been in that was a good thing for her. 

She has fought severe depression her whole life, it coming and going over the course of her teenage years/early twenties. She has been in and out of therapy and has been medicated before. When we met, it was good, and as the relationship went on, it got worse. She was not medicated or going to therapy for the duration of our relationship, but I'll get to that later. I want to preface that I was fully aware of her condition early on in the relationship, and it was never a problem for me. I offered as much support as I could and was accepting of it, knowing that there was going to be times where it would be hard for her. There were times that I didn't recognise situations as symptoms of the condition and it led to small arguments or conflicts, but they were always resolved quickly and with love from both sides after we both had a chance to talk about the problem. I have my own issues, namely intense (and disproportionate) emotional reactions to perceived rejection and some insecurities about the relationship (I was in disbelief that this girl was into me, the whole time), which lead to her feeling like she had to walk on eggshells around me sometimes, but again, we spoke about it and it was always resolved with love. 

Things were going absolutely perfectly for the first 8 or so months, having left the whole honeymoon phase and still being super into everything about the other person. Around this time, because of a past traumatic experience that I did not know about at the time, led to a slowdown in our physical relationship, and her mental health began to decline. We continued to be very active in each others lives, and while she admitted that things were getting to her, she continued largely as normal, suppressing the issue and not letting on (either because she didn't fully comprehend it, or trying to minimise it for the people around her). She had just moved into a new house with a bunch of people who are all very intense, chaotic (in a good way) and full of energy. She can be like this, but is largely reserved and quiet. They all get along very well, and are pretty much a family at this point. We all clicked, and I felt at home there too in a way that i had never felt at home around people before. Again, things were going great. They knew she was depressed, but she never let on to them and still hasn't really, about how bad it actually is. They could never tell, because she's brilliantly good at hiding it and pretending around them. I got to see it first hand, because she was comfortable enough around me to show it. 

Then we were struck with Covid lockdowns.

Naturally, things became a little more tense with nothing to do and monotony in abundance, but we continued to do the best with what we had. We both study, so we were doing online uni, and life was still happening as much as it could. As the lockdowns went on, she began to withdraw from me and those around her pretty intensely (Red flag, I know), and I tried to get her to talk about it. Generally the response was that it's difficult to talk about, and that bringing it up would only make it worse. I respected it, but gently tried to get her to speak about it infrequently as a sort of check in but would usually get the same response. It continued to decline, and it felt like we were drifting apart. This was a cause for frustration on my end, because as I mentioned earlier, she was able to pretend around her friends. I got the silent treatment, while the friends got the abundant and full of life version of her. It started to wear on me, as I felt like I was doing something wrong, and as a result, we ended up drifting a little bit. It was this, and my not really knowing how to interact with her because she stopped letting me in. She said she couldn't really feel anything, not positivity or negativity. There was an event that caused the breakup, but I could see her decline happening in real time and it felt like it was coming. It sucked all the more because I know that lockdown played a massive roll in her mental decline. 

We broke up, had a very civil breakup conversation about what went wrong etc. And I learned more about her mental health and trauma history that day than I did over the course of the relationship. A lot of things made a whole heap more sense, and I told her that I wished she had told me when we were dating. I told her that I didn't judge her at all, and that I understand (as much as I could) why she had to make the decision to breakup. She needed to get a hold of her mental health before it got any worse (like it had at a point in her teenage years.) I gave her a letter, outlining my feelings. Saying basically that I don't regret any of our relationship, that I don't view her as any less because of her history and that if she felt ready, I would absolutely try again but I will always be there for her if she needs it, regardless of if we were friends or as a couple. She put an emphasis on staying friends, but commented when asked about the future, saying 'if it happens it happens. We can't force it'. We stayed in contact for a few days, checking in on each other to see if the other was doing okay. I was very raw and hurting, because I loved her and did not want to break up, so I cut her off. We didn't speak for a month, and it was one of the hardest thing i've ever had to do. It felt wrong to cut someone who had not deserved it out.

Two weeks ago, we started to speak again over instagram. It was guarded but friendly at first, but as time has gone on, the conversations have become much more relaxed and, as strange as it sounds, 'normal'. I learned that she not only wasn't lying about her need to get a hold of her mental health, but it had declined even further. She is currently trying a new round of anti-depressants (which she was vehemently anti due to horrible past experiences), and is looking for a psych. The new medication however, was rocking her, and she tried to call me after taking too much of a prescribed med to counteract the side effects. I was asleep at the time, but we spoke the next day on the phone for the first time since we broke up. The sound of her voice melted me, confirmed the fact that I still very much loved this girl. She was having a really hard time, and her support system had basically fallen apart. They had become standoffish towards each other emotionally (due to the incident surrounding the breakup), and her friends didn't really know how to help. She had resorted to self harming, which is something that had not happened since she was a young teenager. I offered an ear for her to talk and she appreciated it. The conversation lasted for a few hours, and we went back to the topic of the breakup. Basically saying that she needed to be alone, and she needed me as a friend. ""you can't love somebody until you love yourself. I thought it was cheesy, but I kind of get it"". I of course am going to be that for her, but I made it vocal that I still loved her and did not want to give up on the relationship, because I thought she was worth it. 

Fast forward a few days, and we get coffee. We sat in the park talking to each other for literally 5 hours, and it felt like we had never broken up. It was so easy. I let her speak about what was going on without judgement, and without trying to offer solutions. Just trying to be an understanding friend. Of course this was difficult for me, because I don't want this to be the situation. We spoke about her friends, how life had been. Laughed a heap, learned that we had both bought a bunch of the same stuff in the month previous (like the same novelty lighter from some random guy on ebay, tote bag etc). Coffee ends, and she sends me a message a few hours later saying how much she genuinely appreciated me listening and being non-judgemental. She's trying her best, and that hopefully she comes out the other side of this new and improved (sprinkled throughout jokes and other parts of the conversation), and that she's basically blaming herself for not getting help earlier and that 'some things could have been avoided'. We've spoken every day since, at least once a day, like we did when we were together and the conversation feels so similar to when we were together that sometimes I forget we aren't. We're getting coffee again in two days, a week to the day from the first coffee (her idea). I've tried to tell her, in a supportive way, to forgive herself for what happened, she's beaten this before and that she's not alone. I made sure she knew that I was always a phone-call or message away, in no uncertain terms. 

I want this girl back more than just about anything, and I understand that mental illness is unpredictable and feeling better may not have an end date, but I genuinely would be willing to wait for her and she knows this. I was hoping to get some guidance as to whether or not this is realistic. If when she gets to the other side of this major depressive period, that she will realise that what we had was a good thing and her feeling for me will return from under the fog of depression. I understand no one can know for certain, and there's always a chance that it won't happen, but I really do love this girl more than just about anything.

I'm beginning to therapy soon to sort out my own issues, and am actively trying to better myself in the meantime, but this has really fucked my whole world up. 


tl'dr: unresolved trauma and depression caused our relationship to end, but aside from that, we had a really good thing. I still love her, and want her back if she ever feels capable, don't know if it's possible but can't read the signs clearly with depression in the mix."
781,"I've been putting it off for over a year. Yesterday and today I gutted my room (not my closet though..... one battle at a time) and cleaned the hell out of it. Took out all furniture, vacuumed, dusted, all that stuff. (Although sadly, with just one little bit of the room to vacuum, it has died... Rest In Peace Vacuum 😫) 

I've been putting it off for months and months, over a year total. Did I sleep in the living room last night, and will again tonight, just to make sure I got it all clean and don't give up because it's easy??? YES I DID.

Now all I have to do is clean the closet.... this weekend. not today... or tomorrow. i need a break lol

i feel like this is a big win for me, my depression was so bad I thought I would never get my place cleaned."
782,"Cold turkey is an expression used for when a person quits heroin, stop using the drug, and spend days trying to beat the addiction.

With depression, now is really hitting me. What can I do ? Nothing. I just have to suck it up. Just wait, with the heavy weight on my mind, until goes away.

Been long time since didnt feel so bad. I was doing prettt good this year. Feel devastated now.

And nothing helps. And the loneliness is too big. I almost can feel phisically shaking of the amount of stress I have in my mind.

Just know the only thing I can do is feel like nothing is happening, its overwhelming. 

Loneliness strikes hard. Feel so alone."
783,I want to know your experiances of depression how it effects you in every day life.
784,"Hi Everyone,
Im new to the forum.
I’m 32 years old. I’ve been on Zoloft for two years now and it has been such a life changer for me. First time ever agreeing to treat my mental health with medication as I was scared to take anything.
I suffer from 
- extreme social phobia 
- GAD
- some depression 
- bad mood swings
- I believe anger issues, agitated 

Zoloft has changed my life and have been so happy I decided to start it.

However, I’ve gained 30 pounds since starting it two years ago. I’ve always been skinny and trying to put weight on prior to starting Zoloft. Now I’m overweight at 161 lbs. I keep gaining. I saw my doctor a couple weeks ago and told her about this. She said I should switch antidepressants. (She also checked my thyroid, diabetes and lots of other blood work. All normal)

she has switched me to prozac.
i was taking 125 mg of Zoloft which she had me taper down over a weeks time to 50mg then switch to prozac and take 10 mg for7 days then up it to 20mg. Today is day 4 of being on prozac 10mg.
It is awful. Couple days of starting it I got really agitated. Depressed. No patience. Tired as hell. Could not stay awake yesterday and did not leave my bed. I had two naps. I’m blah and emotionless. Extremely unhappy. I have kids and they are noticing my mood and asking what’s wrong. My head is heavy and feels weird. 

I don’t know what to do and if this is normal switching and lowering my dose of Zoloft to nothing basically then switching to another antidepressant that’s a low dose right now...
I wonder if this is expected?
I really don’t want this extra weight on but I think I’d rather it and be on Zoloft and be happy. I don’t even know if switching to prozac from Zoloft will help the weight but my doctor seems to think it may.
Bottom line: is this normal to be feeling like this right now?
Im currently trying to decide if I’m going to take prozac is this morning or stop it and take my Zoloft."
785,"I'm in the middle of a love triangle and it keeps hurting me more and more, i have severe depression, i have a secret relationship with my therapist, i love her so much, i want to be with her but she has a husband and 2 kids, for days now i feel like crying continuously and throwing up, everything is so blurry"
786,"I'm just thinking about how nobody in this world even treats you good. Everyone is so intolerant. Like to be liked/loved there's many conditions. The one person I sort of trusted keeps making me feel like they don't even care about me. Especially with this election I'm seeing a lot of tribalism with people. Like I try to like people no matter what political views they have, but for me its not the same way. It's not only that though. It's basic beliefs and boundaries that I can't have. Then it's the same thing with religion, or what you believe, or who you are. And I can't get out of my situation for years. Then even if I leave it physically I can't have the mental tools to make sure I can believe what I want. I'm so unassertive. Also my best friend who I trust and I have talked only with a text here aand there over like a year. We rarely talk. I have no friends other than that. I know people don't really care about me. I think I'm just going to end it. I'm going to find a way because I feel so miserable. I was excited 9 months ago when I almost had a shot to leave this house and that failed and i'm so angry and sad about it. I'm miserable everyday, and i've been treated really bad my whole life. Even on the internet confiding in someone I've been called pathetic and a man child too. Everyone says don't die for other people, but time and time again other people show they don't care. So I just think my best bet is ending my life"
787,"First thought that came to my mind is ""wow, you picked the right title to grab attention.""
Second thought that went is ""wow, you managed to act as if you are a self aware person.""

So this is my first time sharing this online. 

The only thing that is getting me by at the moment is trying not to think too much, but not in the sense of letting myself do whatever I want, cause that requires strength I don't have, but in the sense of not diving into the scary oceans of my mind.

From a young age I started practising violence against my emotions. I did not give them much time. Instead, I internalised the voices of my parents, religion, and what the world evidently demonstrated: that the heart, alone, leads you to dark places, and it is your mind, rationality, and control over yourself is the way to go.

I rationalized, intellectualized, and used every trick in the book.

My being  queer, religious, and the only child to an emotionally dependant parent did not help.

I assumed the mantle of a wise man, a loving and understanding son, an A+ student even when I hated studying, and a role model. It wasn't an act; it was true. These became inseparable from my identity.

Years later, after getting into a ride downhill that is still going on, I decided to seek a therapist. Evidently, my mechanisms were failing. Something was terribly wrong.

It has been two years since that spiral started and one year since I started getting help. I learned a lot about myself, I am less afraid of my emotions, but I am at the worst place I have ever been.

I immerse myself in work which, due to multiple events including Covid, has burnt me out. Yet when the weekend arrives, instead of celebrating some time off, I feel utterly empty at best, and suicidal at worst.

I have lost the sense of joy and meaning.

Creating art doesn't work anymore. Neither do music, friends, writing, alone time, watching movies, or long walks.

I lost all the energy to mask.
Being closeted, in a country that prosecutes queer people, isn't helping.
Trying to make sense of my complex sexuality in such situation isn't helping.
Trying to be responsible when it comes to Covid, in a country that doesn't give a damn, isn't helping.
Noticing how people don't know how to handle my negativity isn't helping.
Hating how I am not able to be good enough for my family, or the world, isn't helping.
My existential dilemma on religion vs my needs, and what that means for my core beliefs about what life means, what happens, or not, after, and where should I try to head isn't helping.
Getting ignored by new people I try to get along with but fail out of being too complex for them or too much of a ""good boy"" isn't helping.
The clash between what I think, feel, and believe isn't helping.
My anxieties aren't helping.
My being limited in financial resources and mobility isn't helping.
Having a shattered support system isn't helping.
Being as diligent and responsible at work, with loads of stress, as ever isn't helping.
Trying to plan for my future and dealing with rejections meanwhile isn't helping.
Being unsure whether it is worth it at all isn't helping. 

I have been told to just let go.
That I am too harsh on myself.
But I can't help but see it as an eternal paradox.
An endless struggle against myself, where I have to destroy myself to build myself anew, and even then, I might eventually end up in hell or something, be it on earth or, if it exists at all, in after life.

I know this all looks like words in the air.
That it is all, somehow, in my head.
Well some of it has to be for sure.
Although I swear it doesn't feel like it, there must be a way out.
The question is.. is this way out one where I remain intact?
is it worth getting out at all."
788,"hi all, i've been going through a particularly rough patch but still found the time to find amusement in recent happenings. I cried so hard I've given myself sinusitis hahaha! It's been a week and I hope it clears up soon. I just had to share it with someone, my dark sense of humour wouldn't let me keep it to myself :)"
789,"Just woken up and first I feel happy that I slept in my bed, that is then instantly overtaken by self loathing of ""how could you sleep for so long? Lazy"" and feel guilt and shame again.
On top of that my body aches, from legs to a pain under my rib - where I'm convinced my liver has turned to mush. My ears are also buzzing. 
Plan to try to take the dog for a walk, if I can get out of the house. I know that will make me feel better but it's fighting the negatively that I don't always win."
790,"Hi, one good method to forget about anxiety, which I was told, is reading. And I've been doing just that during the 1st lockdown in my country. I found a book that I just went through called ""Anxiety & Depression Workbook for Dummies."" For those who've never read anything from the ""for Dummies"" series, don't be fooled by the title. It's not for dummies, it's just very detailed. Personally, I've found a few tips which were helpful for me. If anyone has read or wants to read it, I'm all ears if you want to discuss it. And if you have any book suggestions, I'm all ears too."
791,"2 years ago, i met my best friend and we accepted each others and had mang beautiful moments together. He have a GF and i accepted it, he was giving me all of his time because she was so far from him. 6 months ago, he started to give all of his attention to her and when i asked him about that surprised thing, he said that she is worth for his attention than me!!! Why?? I always gives him attention, care and i always treats him while she is not!!!. And finally he chose her? . He changed 180 degree from me!.. i feel now like i build a beautiful home and suddenly the earthquake take it off."
792,"i'm starting to feel like everything's falling apart around me. i end up acting impulsively bc i keep thinking that it doesn't matter bc i'll be gone soon. rationally, i know that suicide isn't the solution but i still can't stop myself from thinking about all the ways in which i could k**l myself. rn the only thing stopping me from doing anything is that i'm still living with my parents but i'm moving out in a few months and i'm scared. i've been struggling with my mental health for as long as i can remember so i know that it's not just magically going to get better but i still can't bring myself to get actual professional help. at this point i'm not  even sure i know what my ""major symptoms"" are bc it's all so normalised to me now, so if i were to go what would i even say? when i was younger i used to think that surely there'd be a point where i'd know that i was ill ""enough"" to need help but the goalposts keep moving and it's ridiculous, but these days i find myself arguing that bc i'm alive it's alright which is scary as hell."
793,"My depression is now so bad that every thought or memory brings me pain. It doesn't matter what I think about, watch or hear, everything is painful. I wake at 1.00 and the horrible memories come crowding into my head as I remember where I am. I don't dare have a daytime nap because waking up is so horrible. Between waking and getting up I listen to podcasts on BBC Sounds but even they depress me. 

How much of this can a human mind take before something drastic happens?"

795,"Hiyas good folks

I hope that everyone on here is doing really good.  I just can't take it anymore.  I wish that I was dead.

I am really struggling right now to even figure out if I have a purpose in this life, cause I don't feel like I do.

I have been crying all morning...that's what I am doing right now.  I can't do anything right and I hate it.

I hate the way that I look.  I don't want to be fat but I can't seem to get up and exercise.  I sometimes will buy a bunch of health food and just let it sit and spoil.

I fucking hate my bitch of a landlord.  This idiot will not fix anything at all and has left me in a jam more times than I can dare to tell you.  This bitch will yammer on and on about how she cares about me but if she sees me on the street, she won't even acknowledge me.   This idiot will come into my apartment and see that it is beyond clean and still yammer about a little dirt in a corner.

I hate my job.  My boss does not pay me nearly enough money to even function.  I am a phone sex operator.  Do you have any idea about the disgusting things that I have to hear on a daily basis?   If I tell her that I want more money, she just tells me to stop complaining.

I can't wash my clothes on a monthly basis and people talk about it.  I take a bath everyday but I can maybe wash my clothes once every couple of months.   I am so sick of motherfuckers yammering about my clothes but won't offer me $5 or even come over and see if I am alive.

I am a diabetic.  I have been one for maybe about 5 years now.  I take the pills on occasion but I am not touching the insulin.   At one point, the doctors say that I am fine but apparently everything in my body is close to falling apart.   My sugar is like through the roof and part of me doesn't even care.

I went to the hospital last march for something called DKA and ever since then, the fear of death has been looming over me.   I keep having these constant dreams of either stepping out of my body or having my subscious sit by me in the dark or floating out of my body or screaming in my dreams the words ""I am not alive, I am not alive anymore""!

The last time that I went to the doctor, she said that one of the solutions to lowering my blood sugar would be to go on a pill that would cause me to gain more weight.  I am 221 lbs....why the fuck would I want to gain more weight?  Isn't diabetes supposed to go into remission by doing exercise and diet?

I miss my mother.  I miss having stability.  I hate this time of year cause I lost my mother on Christmas day.  I miss hugs and love and feeling like I had a home.  I miss having people around me who actually gave a damn.  I am surrounded by so many fake people that it is crazy.

When it comes to my dreams, they are like a portal for my family members.  You just never know who is going to pop up in them, on any given night.   My mother is my most frequent visitor,  she doesn't visit my dreams very often but its definitely memorable when she does.

I had a dream about a year after my mother passed away and I asked her to take me with her and she wouldn't do it.  I don't know why she wouldn't do it, cause I don't want to be on earth without her.   My life is nothing without my mother, she kept everything together and she was a good person and a far better person than I will ever be.

I am kind to everyone.  I go out of my way to be good to people and that kindness is almost never reciprocated.  My home is always open.  My fridge and my pantry are open to everyone.  Do you think that same kindness is shown back to me?  IT NEVER IS!

I am not even supposed to reveal how nice I am because that makes me seem like an asshole but I am really nice.  Like super triple mega mocha nice with sprinkles.

I have someone who is actively trying to brainwash me and make me think that she is my only friend.   This person might be a lesbian.   This person keeps taking me to drug houses, when she knows that I don't believe in that AT ALL.   This person once tried to ambush me into getting renter's insurance, when I keep telling her profusely that I don't want it.

I want so badly to be with my mother.  I want to be with my family.   I almost took a drink today, because I am so depressed.  I was at meijer this morning and I almost brought a bottle of wine and I just couldn't do it.  I wanted so badly just to drink and then I realized that when the bottle is empty, my problems will still be there.  I can't become an alcoholic, that will just make things worse.

I just want to close out the world.  I just want to become a hermit.  I am so tired of being sad.  I have done a lot of weird things in my life but even I don't deserve to be this unhappy.    I don't know how to fix this mess!  I just wish that I did not exist anymore.  I don't know if I have a purpose.  I am just so tired of being around stupid people!"
796,"The one weekend that my wife and I hang out with her gay friends from work was canceled because of Covid.  Today while cleaning I noticed a small flat package on the shelf. It was some pride items I got for the both of us.  I wasn't going to wear what I wore last year.  Seeing that today really pissed me off.  I didn't get to do what I wanted. My best friend got a boyfriend and she left early this year. We went hiking together and other outdoor outings. My wife is built like a linebacker so she doesn't do any of that with me.

A few weeks ago she came home and was all hyper. Some guy got crazy at the hospital and nurses was trying to get him pinned down while security got there. She went and helped take him and then pinned him. She wanted to show me the move, I wasn't in the mood to be flipped over her shoulder and pinned as we're some WWE wrestlers.  My luck she would break my bones.

Before Covid I decided to use tinder to find a guy for a workout friend and nothing more. I had to turn off the notifications because just friends must be a code for something else. Maybe they didn't read what I wrote and swiped on the picture.  So I went with the least douchebag guy I could find. We hit the trails at one of the biggest parks in my city.  Then he invited me to lunch, ok friends do that. Next weekend we did the same thing but I had to go to the library to turn in the books on neuroscience that was due that day. So we hung out at the library no big deal.  

I use to be very busy before covid and I worked near to where he lived. He invited me for dinner but I declined and now we have known each other for 3 weeks almost 4. He kept calling me high maintenance because most of my clothes are dry cleaned weekly. I blew it off because joking around is what you do. I invited him to go shopping.  I guess I was overdressed because he kept saying it and why would I wear a gucci belt and designer clothes. I'm annoyed now and I said because my wife spoils me.  I don't even own jeans. 

After 3 months he's now bitching to me about why I need such a nice car. BMW is overrated. So he's saying I'm just boujee AF.  I'm trying to be nice and think maybe it's normal to be insulting instead of giving compliments.  We were having lunch and I told him I needed to do laundry and to have a nice day. He told me that he could wash my clothes for me. I told him it's just my workout clothes and underwear and everything else I took to the dry cleaners. He said he would wash that. So I know that's not a friend thing to do. Creepy.

Next weekend, after our jog we finish close to where we parked. I was doing my after jog stretches like I always do and I didn't notice that he was behind me.  He said I look tense and started to massage my shoulders and neck.  I didn't ask him and he didn't ask me. Still behind me he then hugs me, he got to close and that was inappropriate.  He still was hugging me and I'm now about to pass out. Everything got super bright and I was light headed. There was a couple guys sitting on the grass 20ft away. I started moving forward to leave and told him I gotta go. He didn't let go and I was going to yell ""let go of me now""! loud enough those guys could hear me. I moved forward again then he let go.  I walked to my car and looked back.  He couldn't walk to his car at the moment but sat down on the grass. That was it for me. Friends don't do that. I had to wait about a min to recover enough to start driving and probably should have waited longer but I had to go.

Afterwards I thought about so many things I should have done.  But I did nothing. Froze and actually almost passed out, that's what I did. I've been thinking about this lately. Has my meds made me weak? Maybe I'm a badass only when there's people that can save me when go against someone double my size.. My anxiety seems to just keep getting worse and worse. I'm just going to do stuff with my dogs.  People are scared of them. 

I got a message.  ""You traditor"" 
Synonyms:betrayer, double-crosser, double-dealer, two-timerTypes:Judas
someone who betrays under the guise of friendship
Type of:beguiler, cheat, cheater, deceiver, slicker, trickster
someone who leads you to believe something that is not true

I never messaged back and never heard from him again. I wonder if I'm doing something wrong and don't know it.  Also I don't know why the hell I'm a traditor... I should have said something back.  

Since covid i have no idea how I need to act and I question everything.  Covid is a double edge sword, I feel like I'm losing it.  Going to tell my psych I need something. If I get worse this month, I'm not going to make it to christmas."
797,"I'm making this on behalf of teaching other people about a lesser known psoriasis. Plenty of myths surround this autoimmune disease from it being the cause of uncleanliness to it only being a surface issue, this is all wrong. Psoriasis is a genetic disorder that can cause array of issues such as psoriatic arthritis and lymphoma. It can also perpetuate obesity which can turn into diabetes and cancer. Psoriasis is a lifelong battle that deals with the self and can take you on a journey that not many get to go on. When I was diagnosed with this disease, my life changed immediately soon after. As a grown woman, I feel like I carry a different perspective on beauty than most. I feel like having psoriasis has shaped my thinking for the better, especially surrounding my experience as a woman. Strangely, there's something empowering about being a young woman with a skin disorder and mostly because it reminds me to stay true to myself. There's nothing I need to hide when it's out of my control and what if someone needs someone to look up to as well? It isn't aesthetically pleasing but it's a part of me, so what's there to be ashamed of?

My body is what carries my soul through this life, so I must respect it regardless of its limitations. I've recently researched the metaphysical causes of psoriasis and in Chinese medicine they believe the person ""weeps through their skin"" due suppressed emotions. The journey in this life is to accept oneself and the skin attacking itself can be a metaphor for self-hatred. There are plenty of skin disorders besides psoriasis but inverse psoriasis doesn't get enough attention. What makes inverse different from other forms of psoriasis is because it ruins ones ability to be intimate. When hiding inverse psoriasis, in a way, it makes it worse. I had no idea I was weeping through my skin and now I can see why being open about it saved my life. Although, I still experience depression, being able to discuss it has improved my ability to cope.

Psoriasis isn't the end, but a new beginning to get to know yourself. It'll teach you how to take back your power and use it for good. It's a lesson in true love and acceptance, be grateful that it was chosen for you."
798,"I don't have the seasonal type of depression, just some low moods, maybe they're regular ups and downs these days. We're getting wintry here already, lots of snow for this early. It's four or even five solid months here for winter. I'll still do my walks and shopping. I even began looking for work overseas in China, found a decent website today with loads of teaching jobs. Not sure what the situation is though, if foreigners are heading there much these days. Saw one job post that mentioned the two week quarantine upon entry. Would be nice to get back to work again after several idle years.

Trying to be positive and take steps to improve things, but it isn't easy. Not looking forward to another idle winter with the same dull routine, could be a drag. I've been keeping to myself the past couple months, more so than usual. Could use a change in situation, something to be hopeful about, or to be productive again. I'm getting old, and need something good to happen."
799,"Does anyone have any tips on how to start looking forward rather than being constantly obsessed about things that have gone wrong in the past? I have this ridiculous memory for everything that's gone wrong in the past and these memories can be triggered by the most seemingly inconsequential things, things that weren't even central to whatever the problem was but just happened to be there at the time so my brain has logged them as something associated with a negative. It's that extreme. They're not even big, significant events. Quite often they're just little embarrassments or irritations too. I know in theory it should be easy to say forget about these things, you're wasting your time, there's nothing you can do about them etc but I just can't seem to shake this thing about dwelling on every little negative that's ever happened. Any tips?"
800,"I've been randomly scrolling through Instagram, searching tags linked with current events in my country and saw photo of a girl, I went to her profile and scrolled through it and found out she is disabled. Scrolled through few more photos and saw one of her posts saying that when she was younger she felt alone and excluded, but when started studying it changed.

Lucky her, my life would never be like that. I'm disabled too, but she at least has pretty face unlike me. I'm that girl who was always mocked by classmates in middle school. I'm not that girl who's laughed at by kids outside, who say to each other sarcastically ""hey, it's your girlfriend"" - it's obvious they do this to annoy their friends, because who would like to have ugly girlfriend? I'm that girl, who was abandoned by her only real friend after meeting her personally. Because I'm ugly, not attractive and not worthy. 

I'm getting mad at these pretty girls who say they're ugly. What can I say? People doesn't even realize how lucky they are. Not everyone is."

I feel lonely I get told by friends stop taking things to heart, I’m to emotional, I don’t say how I feel which I feel like I try but I’m not great at expressing how I feel I guess
I’m terrible at keeping friends, I fall out with mostly all of them. 
I cut them off sometimes because I feel like a burden or I’m not connecting with them.

802,"I'm devastated at the moment and can't stop crying. We are friends with a couple and have always gotten on excellently. My husband has been mates with the bloke almost 40 years, his partner and I were like sisters & best friends, they were people I felt truly comfortable with. They know my mental health issues and were always so supportive. Then 2 today's ago my husband got a text from the bloke who said that they couldn't have us in their social circle anymore due to the way I treat him (he didn't expand on this) He said he'd discussed it with other people who all agreed it was best to cut me out of his life. We went away with them 3 weeks ago and had a wonderful time and have been texting each other since so this was totally out of the blue. He ended his text by saying we weren't to get in touch with either of them. I did text his partner expressing my concern that I'd somehow done something that'd hurt him, but she's not replied. All my life, I've never felt good enough and only have a small circle of very trusted friends due to this. I have never felt so hurt and confused and don't know what to do. It's not long until the 1st anniversary of losing my mum and I just can't cope with anymore. I've lost one of the best friends I've ever had, the people I turned to when my mum died. I've barely slept since the message, going over every conversation and event in my head. The self hate is coming back stronger than ever and I'm worried what will happen if I don't sort my head out.

When I was 13 my parents divorced, since then I was never the same. I stopped doing what I like (sports, drawing, playing instruments ), my grades were getting pretty bad and I didn't have the will to go out anymore. My dad moved to another place and I stayed with my mom. She would verbally and physically abuse me every day. She dragged me across the floor, she would constantly hurt me in the head and face . She would tell me that I'm worthless, that I will never achieve anything in life and she once said she wished she aborted me. High-school started and I had suicidal thoughts almost every day. I attempted suicide 3 times by overdosing . One day before school I took another overdose and I started feeling dizzy, my vision was blurry and I couldn't hear very well. I was scared and told my mom that I needed help she told me to get over it and she went back to sleep, I went to school in a very bad condition I still don't know how I made it to the next day. Last year college started, she forced me to attend the college I didn't want to go to. Since she was so pushy and I was scared of her I gathered all my papers and applied and got accepted. Of course I didn't do well, I had no will to study all I could put my focus on was ending my life. I told her multiple times that I'm depressed and she would always tell me "" get over it"" or ""you're not depressed, quit making things up"". After she saw that college wasn't going to well for me she decided to kick me out. I then stayed with my dad. He was the only one who was always by my side and took really good care of me while I was with him. But my depression and suicidal thoughts were still there. I attempted suicide once again this time in resulting me getting hospitalized. After going to the hospital they sent me to a psychiatrist and as expected I was diagnosed with depression, they gave me the antidepressants which made me very numb. My mother at that time didn't even call me to check up on me, to see if I'm even alive, she just didn't care. 4 months after staying with my dad she constantly called me saying how much she missed me, that she is sorry and I should come back. 1 month after that I came back to live with her. Today Wednesday November 4, she started verbally abusing me again, I packed my stuff and tomorrow I'm going away for good. I am so destroyed, I can't trust anyone anymore, I can't accept someone giving me affection and love, my self esteem is very low. I feel like I'm the biggest loser and a burden to all of my family and friends. I'm trying to stay away from suicidal thoughts but it's so hard to do. I'm so mad at myself, I am 19 and should be building my future but yet my depression and my past is holding me back. I feel like I'm stupid to finish college, I'm not able to do my future job correctly all I think I'm meant for is erasing myself from this earth. If somebody has some advice how to overcome all of this and how to start fresh I would be so thankful because I'm very lost. If you've come this far in reading, thank you. 💗"
804,"I'm a member of Generation Z and because of that, our lives were changed dramatically, especially when it comes to bullying or stereotyping in social settings. People hide behind computers to say nasty things and the only thing you can do to stop them is a comment, which is basically useless. I saw a post on TikTok the other day that made a harmless joke about how the account owner's wife couldn't drive. He inserted a hilarious video. There was nothing wrong with this post because he said nothing about including all women into this stereotype of women being bad drivers. Just posting a funny bad driving video is hilarious to me. But the comments took it too far. One boy said that ""there are stereotypes for a reason"". I responded harshly and just said ""Nah f you"" because I was upset. This comment got many responses, some agreeing with me, and some making fun of me. One person said that my Black Lives Matter profile picture was stereotypical of a ""Sarah"". I don't really understand that insult but multiple people said it. One person even said that all they had to do was look at my account to see how idiotic I was. I just post funny videos, some of which I know I don't look good in, but why does that matter anyway? Aside from that, I was hurt that my physical appearance and views were being attacked harshly and I got insecure. Another video on TikTok was a woman saying, ""120+ pound girls say that they are going to their boyfriend's house"". She then proceeded to correct those so-called ""overweight"" women and said, ""Don't you mean the donut shop?"". I personally am 160 lbs. and I just couldn't take it anymore. When do the stereotypes stop and do I believe and adhere to them, or ignore them? Are stereotypes made for a reason?"
805,"the zoloft it helps me very little. theres no stimulation in my brain i feel deeply depressed day in and out and im stuck in a rut. im a loner i never use to be but i have been the past 8 years. if im going for walks, at home, its always just me and i dont want any company. part of wants to get a job and do normal things in life but i cant mentally the thought of doing anythign involved with people or the work to get a job depresses me and theres no will or urgency. im 35 and i dont care about work, dont care about starting a family, id like to talk to my mother or family members more but i never do i dont know im just disfunctional. i dont HATE everyone but i am a loner i really am. and i see friends out playing basketball with each other or a father and son shooting basketball i cant understand how they are happy. there smiling chatting shooting basketball and there calm and normal as normal can be. i try to shoot basketball and exercise and i see some people there and they wave or say hey and ill just nod to them. my demeanor is just really troubled and negative. i want to be the opposite i want to get out of this depression but i cant fake it. my brain is just stuck in flight or flight and im exhausted and always on edge while being a blank with depression and hating my myself and life. maybe theres just a certain gene where people i programmed for depression. every day is dread..."
806,"Usually when I wake up in the morning I lay in bed and my mind thinks about everything I think is wrong with me, my life, my past, my present and my future.

807,"A couple off weeks ago we had to take my partners cat to the vet as he was constipated.Vet done some tests and found he has a tumour in his colon I think it is.The vet gave him something to shrink the tumour.And gave steroids for him to get each day.We were told he could have weeks or he could have days.He is very underweight.Tablets seemed to help a bit for a few days.Partner had to encourage him to take his tablet in some tasty food.And encourage him

808,"Hi
I have been struggling mentally on and off for probably 25 plus years following the onset of my medical problems but over the last few years my medical condition has got more difficult to manage which has had a significant knock on effect on my mental health. I have been seeing a different psychologist since last Autumn but has been paused during covid and I have only just received information about it starting back up but yet to receive a date.
The problem I have just now is with work specifically and the threat of redundancy. I have been able to work from home for the last few years as part of a reasonable adjustment, so lockdown wasn't really a change for me and working for a local authority has also offered some protection during the period. I won't bore anyone with the problems at work but the threat of losing my job is real and I feel it would be almost impossible to get a job anywhere else due to my disability and my now deteriorating mental health.
The strange thing is, I feel my anxiety and depression are reaching new levels and I have seriously thought about ending my life but I dont feel worthless or anything or hate myself but I do feel despair and I know that my family will be devastated if I did anything but I can't see any other way to relieve the anxiety/depression. I would much rather simply die just now than take my own life but only to lessen the pain of my family, they are keeping me from doing anything at the moment due to birthdays coming up and it would be unfair to attach my death to near the occasions but yesterday and today I have thought about taking my own life and the strange thing is, it doesn't upset me and I am almost looking forward to doing it.
I recognise that these feelings are weird and not how I thought I would be feeling."
809,I feel completely powerless and helpless. Im useless and a parasite. A waste of human life. Why should I live? To make others happy while I feel like shit everyday? One day they will be gone and I will be alone in my misery. Why not end it now and spare myself unavoidable pain?
810,Struggling today with the thought of what I’ve lost. Breakdown of relationship. Big depression episode. Suicidal thoughts come and go. Really sinking down a black hole.suffered before with depression but now double whammy of depression and relationship breakdown. All alone no one to speak to and lockdown looming. Don’t think a can do this.
811,My psychiatrist upped my dose because he saw I was struggling but that felt like a step back. I can't fight the internalized stigma about antidepressants. Meanwhile I'm repeating the last year of high school and feel like a complete failure.
812,"I'll attempt to make this short and to the point. Its been a rough year, lost someone close to me, had financial stressors, etc. I developed health anxiety pretty bad too. My mental health has just been getting worse for the past few months. I'm at the point now where I swear I think I have dementia or something coming on. Im awaiting an appointment with a psychiatrist soon, hopefully I'll find some relief from that. 

My question to everyone that experiences depression and anxiety...

Do you have REALLY bad concentration, memory, processing issues? 

Im talking like forgetting your boss's/coworkers names, mispronouncing words, not being able to think of the correct words you're looking for when talking, feeling like it takes you twice as long to process things, not remembering something you literally just did, unable to take things in when reading something or watching a movie.....basically feeling like you can't think and your brain is not functioning. All of these things are constant for me, theres no periods of relief whatsoever, and its definitely worse when I'm going to bed or just waking up. Very similar to the feeling when you first wake up and you're all groggy and having a hard time getting your brain going. 

Im 28, healthy, and all my labwork always comes back good."
813,"I dont see myself anymore when I look in the mirror. I just see a being. Its like I'm unrecognizable to myself but everyone still sees me. Everytime I think I'm one step closer to managing my mental health, I always fall 5 steps back. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm tired. I know I have a reason to live (but don't know what yet). I thought I was full of self love, I thought I was on the right track forward, but I wokeup one day and all of the self-help, healing, changing and doing better for myself mentally went all away. I just saw no hope, a wallowing of pain. I guess I just pushed my pain and hurt so deep that eventually it popped back up. People say share with your friends and family, they'll make you not feel alone. But I feel so alone, lonely. Loneliness is not able to share your thoughts and how you feel. I just feel like you don't get it, but then it frustrates me of why I cant be like ""them"". Why don't I see the positive in things, why cant I get over things like ""them"". Why can't I be normal like ""them""? I'm glad that I'm different, but when you cant express your individuality, it questions me if I should."
814,"Please, does anybody have absolute tiredness during  autumn / winter? I can't do my job because I feel that my legs and arms just filled with strong tiredness and it grow up more and more with every next step! Please advice me some medical pills or I heard about electrostimulation of muscles - do that work? Any experience are welcome!"
815,i have depression
816,"I have friends but they are always busy because I am the second-best friend and it makes me feel so alone, which is then befriended by my depression and anxiety. I end up feeling numb. Physically, I cannot feel anything nor move much without extreme exhaustion. Emotionally, my mind tells me that feeling nothing is better than this pain, so I stay alone and numb. My friends, when they aren't too busy to respond to me, say that they are there for me and that I'm not alone, but I see no evidence to support that statement. Some days I am depressed for only an hour or two but today, I haven't felt any emotions in over 48 hours. Can someone please give me tips on how to get out of this funk and feel less alone, when the normal ""making friends"" solution is not possible? Or can someone just be a friend to me on this forum? I just need someone to understand and care, even if it is a stranger on a computer... Also, I know this may seem small but I have been clinically diagnosed with both depression and anxiety and this feels worse than it may seem as written here."
817,Anyone else feel strangely guilty when they feel 'ok'? I feel  deserve to feel the way I feel and deserve pain and it's so strange to not experience horrible feelings for a few hours when you've been so used to feeling them. I know it doesn't make sense. Sorry  folks! x
818,"I have had inverse psoriasis since I can remember, in fact, it was unexpected. I was 9 years old fooling around in the bathroom mirror when I found pink blobs under my arms. I screamed for my mom thinking I was dying until a dermatologist confirmed it was probably eczema, but it would be years until I got a proper diagnosis. He prescribed me a white topical cream that had a consistency of cream cheese that me smell like a walking medicine cabinet. I had a difficult time enjoying activities, especially sports growing up because everyone thought I was contagious. At 14, I decided to join an all girls volleyball team but that was short-lived because I felt like a three headed monster amongst the other girls. I became fed up and remember staying in my bedroom for the rest of the summer. Those were probably one of the worst periods of my life. I eventually got a proper biopsy where they took a sample of my skin and found out I had inverse psoriasis. It's a type of psoriasis that forms in the folds of the skin, basically joint areas of the body. I have also been diagnosed with depression and BPD, which probably stem from my childhood. Although, I do know that both psoriasis and depression do run in my family, unfortunately. This is has also led me to believe that I have body dysmorphia due to having a skin condition but it has yet to be discussed and treated.

Another reason why living with psoriasis is difficult is because it makes you feel stale. Sometimes I feel like I can't have any fun without worrying about when my next break out will be. I do use a topical cream that helps put my psoriasis in remission and absorbs into my skin, plus it has pleasant smell. I've come along way but there's still a lot of trauma from dealing with poor mental health at an young age. I have even dealt with chronic pain due to having depression, especially in my shoulders and back. I joke with my mother and sometimes by saying that I guess I really am too sensitive for this world."
819,"Hi all, life can be hard when you don't know who you are. I have been there and I know what it's like and now I'm not suffering anymore.. I'm free and I want to help free others so if anyone reads this and gets a good vibe which I'm putting out.. I will be here for you."
820,"I'm at a point where I'm feeling 100% drained all the time and that nothing interests me. Normally, things play out in one of two ways: My wife asks if I'm okay and if there's anything she can do to help. On both occasions, I cannot even answer her. In my mind, it's a scenario that's played out so many times before, I just cannot be bothered to give an answer. I don't see the point and I hate myself for it especially when it creates tension afterwards. During one heated argument, she told me she feels like a single parent with everything she does around the place. If she can't understand me, what hope do I have?

I've got no escape. I can't ""unplug"" because I also have a young child and anyone with kids knows it's hard to find me time. I feel very alone and despite having family to call on, I very rarely do as we do not keep regular contact and to be honest, they just wouldn't get understand (more so because of covid restrictions). Everyone is under the illusion that I'm a happy parent but it's all a lie. I've also lost my job which just piles onto the mountain of self hatred I'm experiencing.  

I should also clarify that my wife and family (for the most part) do not get along. Last summer was messy and things were said which bit not only me, but her as well. 18 months later and my wife still has not spoken to my dad or my sisters. It's a shit situation and I'm tired of being the middle man."

822,"Hey Everyone! 
I've recently posted here, asked you to share your experience with online therapy because me and my girlfriend was considering OT.
So, after much research and looking through internet, we signed up on two different online therapy platforms to see which ones better and I wrote a blog about it on my website that I just started!
Can I share my blog link in here? Isn't it against this forums rules? 
Thank you all anyway❤️"
823,"I've done so many horrible things in the past... I think about what I've done 24/7 7/7. I can't really get away from it. I've been forgiven by the people I hurt but there are some things that I've done that can't be forgiven by anyone. I feel like life really isn't worth living anymore. Everyone thinks I'm such a great person but I'm really not. I don't know what to do. I want to help people. I want to make people happy but I feel like it doesn't count or I'm being fake because I've been bad in the past. I've so many things on my plate. I'm gonna explode. 
I'm distancing myself from everyone again. I can't talk to them. I feel like I need to be completely isolated from everyone so no one finds out how evil I am. My paranoia tells me to do so. What if people can read my mind and run to tell everyone I'm evil? I need to stay away from people."
824,Please delete my account thanks!
825,"Hi all . Thought I’d post on this after the latest announcement from the government. This forum will play such an important part during the latest lockdown. I’m not forcing anyone, but as I have stated on many occasions this forum is full of people who are here for one and other and is a place full of help. No matter how you’re feeling there are always people out there to help you. Wishing everyone all the best. It’s always important to talk. =]"
826,"I'm used to insomnia; another night spent on the sofa trying to calm down, using meditation and music.
Finally fed up with trying, I thought seriously about an overdose.
The only thing stopping me now is my daughter in the house. I couldn't do that to her.
I have already spoken to my CPN about it, this week, she says not to worry as lots of people have those thoughts.
I just can't see the point in anything, existing, for what?
This used to make me cry, writing words down, but I am numb and lost hope.
I dont know what I think telling you guys will achieve but its a bit like writing in a diary but the diary writes back x"
827,Hi I just broke up with my partner of 24 years. I had been suffering depression for a few months and used alcohol as a crutch which ended in me abusing it to the point of where I had to get out of my mind to escape the depression. Now I am left with nothing. No partner / kids. Spend most of my day. Walking thinking of ways of suicide. I thing the end is very near for me. Can’t do this anymore.
828,"Lately, I have felt more down than usual. I am at university now and I thought that once I left home my parents would calm down, but they are still as obsessive. They do everything for me and never leave me alone. Even though i'm here now they expect me to come home a lot, do things for me and they are suffocating me. I have that much food that I can't fit it in the kitchen so I have had to stash some under my bed. What I mean is, they are just doing things for me all of the time. I have no independence whatsoever. I like that now I can leave my apartment and not have to consult anyone else, I can just go. But, that doesn't mean much when they're still wanting me to be there all of the time.They are acting like I can't do things for myself, like I have something wrong with me. When I say I need space they get offended and ask if something is wrong. My dad keeps saying 'whats wrong' 'we're only trying to help' and I try and explain that i'm not telling them to leave me alone completely, I just mean loosen the leash a little.
This seems harsh but they infuriate me, my childhood was awful and they say im lucky because we have a good amount of money. But all I wanted was for them to treat me right, there's so much I could say about my childhood but in short I was petrified of them due to their actions. I just hate them, I really do. I wish they would just go away forever. I know that sounds horrible but they have made my life a misery, insulting me, calling me names, forcing me to be someone i'm not, saying they don't like my friends, threatening me, hitting me. I have no friends due to my underbite and my dad said that I push people around and that's why I have no friends. But, I don't push people around because im too scared to talk to people as I was bullied.
I have always liked sleeping, but lately I wake up wanting to sleep again. I create some sort of alternate reality (unsure if those are the right words.) I imagine what I wish my life was, completely free and I could do whatever I wanted. For a moment I feel like I am in that world and everything is perfect. It sounds so bizarre and I know that I can't change things and live in a perfect world. But I wish that I could. That place in my head makes me feel calm and I don't want to come back to reality. I want to dream forever."
829,"I don’t think there has ever been a starting point to the way I feel, but certain things trigger a more dark and depressive state of mind. There is a point where you don’t know what to do so much that you think the only option you have left is to just end it all. Its the easy way out, your family and friends don’t have to watch you struggle with your own demons and you can let everything go. But is that the best ending to your story.....
Its starts with this feeling of anxiety and self hate where you wake up everyday thinking your not good enough for anyone and then over think every little scenario in your head, over and over and over again until you get to the point of wanting to smash your head into a wall until the thinking stops. Certain people will tell you to ‘Man Up’ and ‘Just get on with it’ but for someone like me, and so many more people around the world, it just isn’t that simple. You can’t just switch off your thoughts because they creep up on you when you least expect it. When your trying to sleep, trying to enjoy things in life, and then the thoughts slowly catch up to you. They hit you where it really hurts and the weird thing about it is that its you hurting yourself. No one else is saying these things except that quiet voice inside your head that gets louder and louder every time you try and bury it. Its always there, and its always waiting.
Some people feel ashamed of admitting there problems, I know I did. I have been told to ‘Man up’ when was in a vulnerable place, all I wanted to do was talk and she clearly wasn’t interested in listening. That was the moment I knew she never cared. She was willing to put someone down so much with two very simple words because the conversation wasn’t about her. But you know what, in relationships and friendships, the person is meant to be there for you know matter what and vice versa. And I would of helped her through anything but she didn’t care. I know that now. In a mental perspective the little voice inside your head tells you that you weren’t good enough and that its all your fault. When in reality it was her, she wasn’t good enough. But your thoughts will still keep telling you that it is your fault.
Now friendships. Well there are certain things that can happen to completely destroy a friendship and the opinion you had on that person. I’m not going to say specifics but when you cross the line between a friend and his ex then there is no going back. When a friend does that to you it means they have and have never had any respect for you. They never really cared, they just wanted you out of the picture so they could sweep in and take what they used you for. Now people might think that there isn’t a problem with a “friend” having relations with your ex. But for me its a no go, you can’t trust someone if they have no boundaries, they clearly don’t care how anyone else feels except them self. That friendship meant nothing to him and now I have to understand that he was never a true friend. When something like this happens you need to go through the people you classed as friends and say ‘who are my true friends, who will be there if I’m at my lowest point in life and I need advice, who can I trust with anything’. When you figure who your true friends are, block the others out and don’t let them back in. They will never be there for you. They will act like they care, might reply to text every so often, but they are doing that to cover there tracks, to take you away from what they are doing in reality, which is stabbing you in the back.
Those two scenarios have been my triggers, but if I am honest, my mind has been this way for a long, long time. Burying it is not an option for anyone going through these feelings. It really does make things worse, but you have to find the right person to talk to, someone who is caring and even if they don’t understand, they will at least try to understand. When you find the right person, they will listen to every word you say, without judgement. No one should judge someone else when they have no idea what is going on in there head, and if someone is not supportive then you need to say two very important words to them, ‘Fuck Off’. You don’t need people like that in your life. Stay strong, and don’t forget how important you are."
830,"I think I'm depressed. Unless one can be suicidal and disinterested in their future for ten years without being depressed. I've been through a lot and I honestly can pick and choose which trauma I want to go over each day. The current episode is almost a month-long and caused by my mother, of course. On some site, I left a message about this and people advised me to seek help. How, though? In those ten bloody years, I had the following experience:

A psychologist wanted me to look him in the eyes when we talked. He went to the psychiatrist next door to get me a prescription for antidepressants. When I went there to get a new prescription, that psychiatrist, a person who had never met me before, said angrily that no pill would be good enough for me, all would be too strong or too weak. I gave her no reason to talk to me like that.

Another psychologist, this time from an online forum for sexually abused ppl, saw me mention sth super vague about life having no meaning and threatened to call the cops on me. Other people tried to convince her not to, but she was stubborn. I was so worried. The next thing nothing happened, I wrote to her and she said she has no time for my problems bc she has to focus on her nails (she was getting married). Huh. To make it funnier, she would mention how she travelled across the country to comfort another girl from the forum. That one deserved sympathy, I didn't.

A psychiatrist who admitted me to psych ward after my second attempt, asked me almost amused: 'What, were you beaten as a child?' I said yes, he asked 'How hard?', then chuckled and my abusive mother laughed with him. Then he said, after a short conversation, that I'm a narcissist who wants everyone to know about her pain. Case closed, no more treatment, I was suicidal and for the following 8 days I spent there, I got only a personality test.

A social worker, who knew nothing about me, said she had it much worse and if I knew what she had been through, I would never complain. Huh. Then she advised me to clean my room, as if that could cure depression or was evenpossible when you're depressed.

Another psychiatrist was puzzlingly angry with me for no goddamn reason. I referred to myself as my parents' daughter and she snapped: 'You're not a child, grow up!' And then she diagnosed me with histrionic personality disorder, me, the person who willingly didn't have a phone for a couple of years in my twenties, have never been on any social media and couldn't be any less sexually provocative.

A psychologist took the side of my brother, who sexually abused me as a child. She said he needed help and my parents should've focused on getting him such help. Me? I'm not important, even during my own session. 

What's more, I've never met a mental health professional who would not take my abusive parents' side. They all just love abusive parents. When my mother said in front of 2 psychologists that I faked not being mentally ill, deceived 3 professionals and that she knows for sure I'm delusional, no one said a thing. Sure, great, that sounds perfectly fine.

I'm struggling so hard now. I have no reason to live. I don't have friends, my family want me to die. They wouldn't even notice if I I disappeared, I'm talking from experience. Last spring and summer I started cleaning my room again after a very long time, I almost got rid of all the clutter and rubbish, but then my mother had to act out again and I physically cannot clean my room. What's the point? It's hard enough to do the laundry. On my way to work, the first 3,5 km is far from people, so today I rode my bike and cried the whole time. 

For me, there are 2 kinds of things: things people who want to live do and things a failure like me does. Like using lip balm. All autumn and winter I scare people with my chapped lips, but looking nice is for the normal people. I've been hit by a car and needless to say, my family helped me with absolutely nothing and I'm too suicidal to try and better my life. One doctor suspected my jaw was broken, it still hurts, but for the diagnosis, I'd have to have the scan or sth, an expensive one and what's even the point? I didn't get proper compensation, I'm missing 1,5 front tooth, which is great for my low self-esteem and confidence. Great that it happened last year when I was the only one hiding my face with a scarf, this year this would've been normal.

Plus, this whole Covid thing, I was stupid enough to choose a profession that's unimportant during a pandemic.

My mother once said to me I could be depressed only if I miscarried twice, like her. Two years ago, when I was feeling really bad, I told her I was suicidal and she asked angrily: 'Why? Bc you have a bad mother?' Why, yes, but also bc of other stuff. 

Anyway, sorry for the long post. I have a long history. Also, in case anyone is wondering, there's no help for people like me and nothing ever gets better, only progressively worse. Besides, I'm dead inside since that thing wth my brither, I was six then, now 32 and suicide would be only a formality."
831,"Sometimes I feel like I am viewing my life from a 3rd person perspective (through a looking glass).

And no matter how hard you try to steer it in the right direction of positivity and happiness you have a proverbial magnet pulling you back down to the depths again.

Mental Health is something that needs management and ongoing maintenance to maintain - I am not naive to think the problems will vanish. Its just I wish the feeling would go away - sometimes I feel empty.

Anyone else experience this persistent feeling?"
832,"I have been feeling just numb for over a year now. I haven't been really happy or sad during that time. Though sometimes I really despise myself for being bad with people (I haven't been able to build a good friendship with anyone, I do have friends, but they know me only on the surface level, and I them), all my insecurities about what people think about me. 

I was following a degree in college, I was never overly passionate about the subject, but I wanted to do well. But now I just don't care what happens, I'm skipping assignments, exams and all. At times, I feel all this is just because I'm weak and that I don't really want to correct my flaws but just complain. 

But I'm really worried about this numbness. Sometimes I watch sad movies, read sad books, or listen to sad songs just feel something, even pain. Watching football was something that used to make me happy, but now I'm just indifferent to even that.

I've thought about meeting a therapist but haven't acted on it yet. Because every time I try to I feel like I don't have real problems but I'm trying to find excuses to not do things and justify not being good enough. 

I don't have anyone to talk about these things. I'm not close to my parents and I don't think my friends will understand if I talk about these with them. Also it's awkward to initiate a conversation like that with them because, like I said, I don't talk only the surface stuff with them. 

Hope you can give me some advice on what to do."
833,"new to the forum, I recently went through something that caused me to take stock of my life and made me realise what an awful person I have been, I have made some terrible terrible mistakes and had some awful, unforgivable thoughts during my life. I don’t know why I did the things I did or thought and I am so ashamed that I don’t think I can live or deserve to live anymore. On top of this I am causing my wife and family to suffer with they way I am now as I am severely depressed and they don’t deserve this suffering even though I do. Will it be enough to try and be a better person moving forward? I don’t think I can redeem myself but is it worth trying? I have so many regrets and I also regret that I never realised earlier and changed my ways before this. I am haunted by it all and just feel like I can’t move on or deserve to move on. I just want to erase it all. I feel like no matter how much medication or therapy I do this will never go away. I just want someone to tell me what to do."

I’ve lost everything that made me me and I’ve turned into this emotional leech that drains others just so I can feel something. 

I’m now facing a criminal charge for stalking because I couldn’t leave my ex alone, not because of love, although I do care for her, but because I was terrified of myself and the voices in my head telling me I’m not good enough etc. I guess I was papering over the cracks but her love helped stop those voices and make me feel okay. 

Now she hates me and wants nothing to do with me, her friends think I’m a creep and a weirdo, I think I’m a creep and a weirdo, and on top of that I might even end up in jail.

And to make things worse I was released on bail with the condition of not contacting her. I sent her a suicide note today. 

I don’t know why I bothered because she thinks I’m manipulative and will probably think this is just another manipulation tactic. 

It’s not though, I don’t know what else to do. I’ve tried talking to me parents but all I get is “I understand what you’re going through, heartbreak is tough.” Heartbreak? You obviously don’t understand what I’m going through because heartbreak is the last thing on my mind at the moment."

We both made mistakes in the marriage but at the end we drifted but we always loved each other. He got the wrong end of the stick with something and left. I got remarried 4 months later to someone he useto work with. He did not have an affair with her when we were married but worked together.

Anyway, I begged him to stay. He didn't. We've always been on friendly terms since the divorce him more than me because I got too emotional. As he was married he once told me he did miss me and that I still have that special place in his heart and always will. I got with someone else and found it was a rebound and that I still love my ex husband. 

Since that guy left my ex hasn't spoken much etc but yesterday he came around and he hugged me numerous times and showed me some affection. I did hug him back and he said to me: I still care about you and I know u care about me too even tho we can't be together.

He always tells me he's happy. He says I'll find someone who I'll fall in love with again and that someone special. Prior to this...the last two months he's not reached out or anything been very quiet hardly seen the kids and I've really trying hard to be okay.

840,"Hey, new user here, I have a question that's been on my mind since yesterday.
Feel free to go straight to an answer after reading the title, but if you don't mind reading the total backstory, I've written it below. I apologize if it seems too long-winded.

Backstory: I have never told any friends before about my depression. My mom knows -- she too had battled with depression and has tried to help me as best she can. But aside from that, I have always been too embarrassed to be frank about my disorder even in front of doctors. I have often canceled (or simply didn't show up to) meetings, meet-ups, dates, etc., because of depression; I've ghosted people I otherwise liked because of it; and all of it makes me feel guilty and hate myself, because I know I've passed on many extremely valuable chances in life as a result. I've lost friends, job opportunities, potential dates... 
Slowly, I've been building a social network of friends. It started with two BFF's (I'll call them my girl-BFF and my guy-BFF), whom I've met IRL and who I've been texting on a daily basis for the past 2+ years. After finishing my bachelor's thesis and receiving my graduation documents, I felt depression-free for once, and didn't have any episodes for at least 2-3 months. I became brave enough to ask to hang out with my BFF's in real life (after having declined their invitations in the years prior time and time again), and we started to meet up (mostly over video/voice chat) and play games on practically a daily basis now. I met their friends, they became my friends, I made friends online, and I had a big enough, close-knit friend circle that we had our own Discord groups and message board (some of which I organized).

The problem that started it all: Yesterday I started to finalize plans for a covid-safe Halloween party (with a remote version as back-up just in case). I probably became triggered by the thought that nobody except my girl-BFF and I would bother to participate, and that I was foolish to think that anybody would want to hang out with me just because we game and swap memes together. My depressive episode came on very suddenly and hit immediately; during our gaming session, I was extraordinarily quiet, irritable and unfocused. I was obviously spoiling the conversation and the mood, and I should have gone offline, but stupidly I stuck around. The others wondered if I was sick or just being a weird douche. At the time I was dimly aware that I was in an episode but I didn't have the strength to voice what my problem was. I went to bed crying, I had suicidal thoughts, I woke up crying, but while still in my episode I recalled doctors' advice and tried to follow it (so: don't neglect self-care; distract yourself from destructive thoughts through creative and eco-therapy and by doing house chores; take supplements; avoid bad foods; and journal). Writing is my favorite and most effective therapy.

My problem: I still felt embarrassed about the way I had behaved yesterday. I feel like a jerk. I also think that I could've saved myself in the past by being more open about my disorder. After all, when you're physically ill, you aren't afraid to tell people about it (usually). So I think I owe my friends, at the very least my two BFFs an apology.

I've told my two BFFs already. I'm wondering if I should tell the others that I gamed with that evening. My girl-BFF, whom I've known the longest out of my friends and to whom I'm also the closest, was very supportive and understanding, and treats mental health issues like physical issues. She's happy that I've apologized but also promises to be non-judgmental and supportive in the future, in case it happens again. I can also trust that she won't tell others about it because she isn't a gossip. So I'm happy with how that turned out. We're already back on good terms.

My guy-BFF didn't know what to do with my apology, was confused that there was anything to apologize about, and hasn't responded to me since I've sent him an explanation of what RBD is (he has definitely seen my message long ago). I know that he's fought with depression himself and has a habit of ignoring questions or topics that he thinks are awkward or that he doesn't want to answer. I'm afraid that I might've messed up by telling him this and that he probably thinks it was TMI. I'll update with his response, if he responds. He's more of a gossip than my girl-BFF, so I wonder if he's going to tell our mutual friends about my disorder. I think he's suspected it for a long time already, because we'd frequently swap self-deprecatory ""depression"" memes, which I think is a coping mechanism for many young people suffering from depression and anxiety.

To reiterate my question, I wonder what you think about telling people that you frequently game or chat with that you have depression. The one simple question snowballs into many others: Do you think it's TMI, and none of their business? Do you think only close friends should be told? When you're in the middle of an episode, should you tell them what's going on, or would that be an unfair burden to them? Would it be off-putting to them if they know you have RBD? Would they be less likely to hang out with you IRL or even online after finding that out?"
841,I'm trying to decide between different ways of ending my life.... please h
842,"Hello.  Just seeing if anyone feels the same way that I do.  I am just wondering , is it even worth it trying to help people like me ?  And let me clarify what I mean by ""people like me"" ... I mean the people who don't even want to help themselves anymore.  The people who don't even care what happens in their life and could care less if they die.  The people that have no skills , and therefore can't really provide anything to the world.  The people who are disrespectful towards everybody and have zero friends.  The people who absolutely nobody cares about , other than family members who happen to still be alive and have a good heart.  The people who can't hold a job and just fail at everything they try. The people who are just autistic  that are convinced that they don't even deserve help , or to even be alive.  The people ... oh wait , its not ""the people"", its just me.  Through writing this I have realized that I am the only person in the world with the above listed qualities.  I'm really just wondering , is it even worth helping me , when I don't even want to help myself ?  Should my potential therapist just cancel my session , and spend their time and resources helping someone else who actually wants to live , who will actually do something for this world , who is actually loved by other human beings ?  Should the doctor just save that medication for someone else ?  I have been wrestling with this for quite a while now , and every time I think about it I'm inclined to say no , that I'm not worth being helped.  I just wanted to see if anybody else felt this way about themselves , or if I am indeed alone in this sinking boat."
843,"The main reason I joined to this (and other forums) is to meet people who also deal with loneliness, but there isnt a specific place to talk about this.

844,How do I deal with my loss of interest in things? I feel like that's one of the worst parts of my condition.
845,"Hey, might be a little long, sorry, its difficult to get this out so gonna try and dump it all at once. 
Like the title says not really sure what I'm doing. 
Been on different meds for depression and anxiety for a few years, tried different counselling. Nothing seems to work. Self harming since early teens, generally without the intention of suicide, saw it more to punish myself for things I've done.
My mother has been ill most of my life, with M.E, father and mother spilt when I was young, my mother moved me and my older brother and sister to Wales and her health decreased. I was the last one to live with her, to care for her. Last year she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and passed a few months later.
The weird thing is I've been numb for years, apathetic, emotionally distant from everyone. I cried once when she past, and was back in work the next day. Since then I know I haven't been myself. More than normal. I was always afraid to take medication because of the horror stories about feeling like this. And no matter what they give me or the strength I feel the same. I have no drive to anything, everything just seems pointless, I've had no sex drive in over a year, which my new partner, while she is understanding, is obviously affected. There's not much of a relationship there for her. She's been with me through everything with my mother and I feel like I can't give her what she needs. I stopped drinking, stopped using drugs when I got with her because when I did I would crash, self harm. But the only time I feel any emotion is when I'm drunk or high. Can sometimes feel it under the surface, just when it feels like it's about the break through it disappears and I'm numb again.
Gueas that's it for now, thanks for reading if you did, never been good at the emotional things."

847,"That is about all i can manage today.  

It is something. I am starting to feel less dizzy after eating my dinner. 

I am starting to feel more awake.

Tomorrow though, it will be the same pattern, morning to evening, feeling worse at a certain time, better at a certain time, sleeping at a certain time, awake in the evening. 

20:34 and finally i feel better. So, i have to wait until this time tomorrow. Although, clocks went back, meds and hour earlier or later, no idea, so that is going to do who knows what to my brain. 

I have never been able to figure the time change and medication so i gave up and decided to carry on regardless."

849,"I really can’t take it anymore. I know I said this a million times before, but I really want to end it.

I’m really tired of living with my dad whose controlling, negative and doesn’t care. for example, he’s religious and would hate me if I wasn’t. He’d probably kick me out if he knew how I feel. he’s done a lot to put me down in my life, and I barely talk to him. And his reaction to that is to tell everyone that I don’t care about him, and that I don’t give a shit about anyone. He tells me that my brother cares about him, and I don’t care at all. He tries to make me feel really bad about it. But I don’t talk to him because I’ve noticed him do so much bad stuff. Even to my mom.
I love my mom but she thinks suicide is a sin, and the one time 5 years ago that I told her that I wanted to die she got mad at me. My sister was like the one person I could go to, but we had this argument over political shit, and she said she wouldn’t talk to me based on who I wanted to vote for. I had to retract and say no I’m not voting for that person just so I could keep the peace cuz I didn’t want anyone else knowing. And then I was also close with my cousin year ago. He lives down stairs, he was the worst. He blamed me for depression and was very toxic. And also my brother told me to kill myself once and I’m not over it. So yep, I’ve been thru a lot. I been bullied in school too. I’ve been bullied since a kid. I have a lot of issues there. I just feel like literally everyone has treated me like shit in my life. BUT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT YOU they say. Nope they only care once you’re dead.

my only other option is to become homeless when I telL my dad my true feelings. But idk, I don't want to be homeless at all! So I think I’m going to end it all soon..... idc how much it hurts. Just would be better than existing.

and not to discourage any of the comments on his thread but I’m super annoyed with the internet Too. Ppl just tell you life is meaning if you give it, and that Suicide isn't worth it. But really? Suicide is worth it.Why do I have to circle around in meaninglessness for nothing? Just because it’ll make people feel bad? People who don’t even care about me?"

851,"I have long struggled with depression and an eating disorder. My fiance also struggles with depression. We confide in each other in that subject. Although I try to downplay how often my ED (eating disorder) is affecting/effecting (I am still not sure how to use those) me daily. My fiance has been struggling with it more, it seems. I have dealt with my depression differently than he has, since I take it out on my body. But, lately he is having more trouble with it. He works and goes to school, which he didn't have the confidence to do so after we started dating. He has also started seeking help, before COVID, and began taking medication for it. But after COVID, seeking help and refills on meds is becoming difficult. 
With my issues, I tend to talk it out and reason myself into functioning day by day. But the other day, he mentioned suicidal thoughts about not wanting to be alive. He says it helps talking to me about it and having someone listen to him so he doesn't feel so isolated with these thoughts and feelings. Yet, the other day when he told me about it, I was set in a tailspin. I maintained my composure and bit down on my feelings of helplessness and how I eventually resorted to ED behaviors. 
I am fearful that he may fall deeper into these kinds of thoughts, and I am unable to do or say anything comforting to him. He has not proactively done anything to act on these feelings so far, and I try not to alienate him or feel guilty over them. I am still struggling with how to act and respond in a way that is not callous, bossy and all-knowing about his own feelings. I am constantly questioning whether I am saying the right things or acting the right way when he comes to me with these feelings. I just feel like I am not enough to help him, since I can't even comfort myself when I feel hopeless.

854,"Hello, Im new here and I want to share my experience since I don't have anyone to listen to. I want to ask questions and learn. I'm a 25 years old male.
I have been feeling like this for years now.
The symptoms have gotten worse over the years but now it is unbearable for me:

-I can't feel anything, everything is dull and bland: smells, colors, sex, nature, social interaction, emotions, love, food. Exercise does not feel good. I can't enjoy playing videogames. I can't enjoy being productive.

-I can't sleep properly anymore. It is extremely hard for me to fall asleep early and once I get up, even though I'm sleepy, I can't fall asleep again.

-I always lose weight just to regain it all back again.

-I'm irritable/angry all the time. Sometimes intrusive thoughts about rape/beating people or murdering animals come to my mind and, honestly, they feel relaxing and I can't help it. I do my best to contain myself but sometimes I lash out at people near me and I can't help it.

-I can't concentrate or remember stuff very well. Grades are always affected. It didn't use to be like that.

-I have restless legs and Im anxious all the time about the future. Everything seems hopeless and helpless and I accepted it as reality now. No matter what I do, nothing will make me feel better.

-Unbearable back pain. Sometimes I have diarrhea out of nowhere. Terrible posture. Frequent urination.

-Chronic fatigue. Everything is difficult. Feel old and weak.

-Im extremely antisocial and I find it very hard to relate with people.

-Being overly orderly. Cant feel good if something is not in its place correctly.

This is normal for me and, believe it or not, I'm now realizing how bad it is as I'm typing this. I do not care if you think I'm a snowflake, that I need to grow up, etc and I do not care anymore about my condition either since it is incurable. This is just how I feel every day.

I tried: therapy, drugs, etc. Tried to kill me two times. I come from what would be considered an upper-middle-class family in my country and If it was not for it, I would be dead in the street since Im utterly useless for everything. Im a porn addict and, I believe I, sublimate my repressed impulses through it. I know some people have it worse but I don't feel any better thinking about it.

I don't want to sound edgy but today society makes people very powerless and helpless and neither do I want to blame all of it for my condition, I recognize I could have made better decisions and worked harder. But I can't help to think something is wrong with modern life. Humans did not evolve or were created to live a life full of uncontrollability and unpredictability, full of materialism and hedonism. We are just mere cogs in the machine."
855,"I don’t know how I feel anymore
Sometimes I feel happy and good with life. Today I had a bad day. I had a morning struggling with things I need to do, feeling like I wasn’t smart enough to write my essay, thinking what’s the point anyway? Feeling like my life is so dull and pointless and I add nothing for anyone or myself. Driving to work I was seriously thinking about killing myself as soon as I could successfully do so (when home alone for a long period). I felt like it was a good option. I got to work and something cheered me up a little, can’t remember what. Now I’m sat at work thinking, again, what is the point? I’m working and studying my final year for a career I don’t know for sure will happen and I have no back up if it doesn’t. I am single and am rubbish at meeting people. I have friends but they Are busy or far away and have their own lives. I don’t have fun anymore. I miss having really fun days where you just laugh and laugh. I feel like I am just a pain in the butt for people like my family who have to deal with me when I am frustrated or upset and I don’t want to tell them how bad things are. I know they would be hurt if I did this but I don’t want to be this negative person in everyone’s lives anymore.

when I feel good, I feel really good, content, happy,grateful for my life, I know I am lucky in a lot of ways.

but when I feel bad or stressed it’s really bad.
And at the moment I think of suicide daily. Even on good days it’s there at some point."
856,"I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be alive anymore. I don’t have any suicidal thoughts, but I do go to sleep every night fantasizing about never waking up.

I am halfway through a really stressful program studying something that will guarantee me a good-paying and stable job once I graduate, but more and more I feel that it isn’t the right choice for me and it’s a career that I’m not going to enjoy or be naturally good at. But I’ve invested so much in making it this far and it would be really embarrassing to quit now and look like a failure to friends and family. I know that quitting isn’t the same as failing, but that’s how it would look to many.

I am married and my husband is working full-time at a job he doesn’t like to put me through school and pay our bills. I am so afraid of how he would react if I told him I wanted to quit school, and I’m honestly not even sure that that’s what I want. I just know that right now it’s giving me so much stress and anxiety I don’t know if I’ll be able to pass my classes this term.

I love my husband very much. He has always taken care of me and he has sacrificed so much for me but we are on totally different wavelengths, and as time goes on I realize more and more how little we have in common except for the shared experiences we’ve had living together for a decade. We have totally different values, interests, and tastes, and as a result we don’t communicate much even when we’re in the same room. He knows that school is stressful for me, but he has no idea the extent of my anxiety and I don’t know if he’d respond well if I told him. He is having his own struggles with depression and stress related to his career and I don’t want to add to that, especially since he’s sacrificed so much for me to make it this far.

On top of this, COVID has made me realize how lonely and alone I am. Before COVID, I had a few local friends I would hang out with from time to time, but ever since the pandemic started I haven’t been seeing anyone. I know this is not abnormal due to social distancing and quarantine, but I’ve barely been in touch with any of my friends and I think this whole thing has just revealed to me that most of my relationships are not very deep.

My mom died suddenly just a couple years ago and ever since then I have had very little joy in my life. I was close to her, and aside from my husband she was one of the few people who called me regularly and really cared about what was happening in my life, the other people being my sisters.

I feel like a failure and I feel like everything is getting worse – my marriage, my anxiety, my performance in school, and thanks to COVID (and other crises going on), the whole world around me.

I am trying to remain hopeful that things will get better once I finish school and the pandemic goes away, but it’s so hard to see beyond all the more immediate things that I’m dreading, including waking up every morning and facing the day.

I don’t know why I’m putting this out there – I guess I need to hear some encouraging words as I have no one to talk to about this. Or to know that I’m not alone."
857,"Hey everyone 🌸

I’m so exhausted right now, I have a few friends at uni that will ask questions when they need help or just want to talk. But the day before when I was supposed to help a friend, I just got more and more irritated. 

Which is totally not like myself but I’m so exhausted and my social aniexty totally don’t help keeping up the front. I don’t want to snap on anyone or act disinterested to the people around me, only because I’m feeling more and more tired. 

Do any of you have any tips on how to handle it?"
858,"As the title suggests, does anybody know of any relaxation techniques that help them when feeling depressed / anxious? I've had one of those days where everything is getting to me, to the point I just want to shout. I can't seem to let go and I just feel constant frustration."
859,"The time for complaining needs to end, for myself on a personal level. To accept the realities not only of the current global situation but personal realities one has to accept in order to be able to improve. I cannot help that I'm as beta ad they come, fraught with all the insecurities, the lack of confidence and physical stature, the mental health dilemmas. But dammit if theres anybody that could take it to a better level of confidence without oozing toxic manpower, I'm sure I can follow the trail. It is not enough to speak of vulnerability and pain. One needs to act and observe how it can be changed from an ever increasing downward spiral of hate and self-hatred. In the age of social distancing it certainly doesnt help an already completely isolated human being. Pain becomes as boring as a drug. I'd rather feel the adrenaline rush of an oncoming car crash than the passive depression I've had the luck to experience if I can put it that way. If one needs to work out a bit more, put more green in the diet, get new clothes or whatever, then by all means, it might help the growing dissatisfaction. In this time, theres literally nothing but time for self-improvement. Rumination of past trauma and pain only aggravates it like an infected wound. My wound is a flesh eating bacteria at this point so it is time to choose life or death. I have figured life to be a better choice in the sense that theres plenty of fight left in me and wounds can be healed, all departure of good things forgiven. It can happen to the best of us in the worst of circumstances. It is possible to survive this psychic war. Battles lost but learned from. One learns to appreciate the little things as well as happiness. The less things are taken for granted, the more one would be willing to work things out. The best I can do is learn from my past mistakes and hurt and push it to erect a better future even amidst the complications, covid or our political future. There lies something beyond the horizon, the sun can be chased and your will be done for good. No more self-aggrandizing, no more devaluing the self."

So after much effort I finally found a good psychiatrist, even though it took me about 5 hours to travel to her office, have an appointment, and return home.  We had established a reasonable rapport and I felt like diagnosis and treatment were on the right track.  It is hellish trying to find psychiatrists who will accept my insurance.
    Then COVID-19 struck and she shut down in-person visits, or they were now at such unmanageable hours for long travel, I stopped going. She offered phone visits with the downloading of 3 different apps and a page with so many directions for doing so, I gave up.  Part of my mental illness is difficulty processing new tasks and a high level of anxiety.  So now my primary care doctor is nice enough to prescribe re-fills for the psych meds I already take.  But she is clear that if I need a different dose or different med or am ""having trouble"" she won't be able to help me.  Psychiatry is not her specialty.
    I feel trapped in this no-man's land.  Just the difficulty of making appointments I can manage is overwhelming.  So I try to manage on my own with the medication my psychiatrist had already prescribed.  Some days my mood plummets and I feel totally lost, so I do what I can to stabilize.  Now the COVID-19 surge is on again and it looks like it will be months if not another year before I can get back on track.  Therapy is also virtual only, so out of the question for me.  I walk through the streets and can't even see a friendly face because masks cover all but people's eyes.  It is so strange.  I feel like an alien in my own city."
861,Yesterday was not good I was very depressed. I had planned on going shopping but just couldn't make myself do it. I was crying  later I managed to get a shower but that's all I accomplished. I hope today will be better right now I'm trying to get myself to bed. I feel like I just want to eat and eat but it's after 12 midnight. Guess I will try to sleep honestly I dread another day.😔
862,So I recently got denied mental health services which means no therapist no psychiatrist and no group meetings. I’m diagnosed shizo/effective biploar. And been drained mentally. My conscience doesn’t let me be at peace. Depression got me up at night lost hoping God will answer my prayers and ease my burden. I just feel worthless and I been dealing with this for 10+years. I just want to talk to people who can relate and give me answers I so desperately Need!I got a son I got to fight for and that’s what kills me the most 😔
863,"I feel alone and refuse to talk to people i know about it, anyone else feel same?"
864,"Yesterday, I went to the park with my brother so he could practice running for cross country. I let him do his run while I wandered and explored the place. It was a peaceful Saturday afternoon and there weren't many people there either. I was innocently standing by a creek by a nearby bridge just standing quietly thinking to myself. Then all of the sudden, I saw a female jogger running above me from where I was standing. I was crossing my arms but I swear to god that I wasn't thinking any negative thoughts this time, I was honestly feeling relaxed. She stops her jog to tell me if I'm okay. I took offense to this because this was one of those rare occasions where there was actually nothing wrong. I wanted to literally yell at her for assuming I was upset, but instead I simply said that I was fine and just enjoying the view.

After that incident, I felt extremely annoyed. How come when I need someone's help, nobody can makes themselves useful but when I'm alone and peaceful, people start showing up out of the blue? I honestly don't get it but it makes feel like utter crap. Is that the feeling people pick up on when they're around me or do I just look super pathetic?"
865,I am happy I found this forum and everyone has been kind with your caring and advice. I have to be realistic though I can write about my problems but I have to do what I need to in the end. No one on this forum can come here and help me in reality. I can't help myself and as I said no one can do it for me. Everyday is painful I wake up have no energy just sit here thinking about the things I need to do but don't feel like doing. So I put off and off and off until I finally do what I need to do. No one knows what I really go through how I feel what my life is really like. My point is I can get all the advice and nice words but in the end it's up to ME to change and I can't. I don't mean to offend anyone I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
866,"I literally cannot bear to watch television or any type of media without feeling bitter about something. I don't have a favorite show or movie I watch and lately most of the music I listen to is either instrumental or my own personal favorites. I feel threatened by people everyday, to the point where watching them on television is impossible. I have a delusion that makes me feel threatened by both authority and strangers alike. There's this disregard for mainstream politics because they make me feel extremely paranoid. I get agitated quickly if I'm not left alone and in rare cases, completely isolate myself for days. There's tendency to be jealous of others who seem to be well off emotionally. They just make me feel incompetent and afraid they might to take advantage of me. Everyone with some sort of public reputation cannot be trusted. Ever!"
867,"I've been at uni 4 weeks or so and I've already missed handing in nearly all of the assignments I have been given. It takes me several hours to even do a single question and then I just give up. Part of me thinks uni isn't for me and I'm done with it but I just don't have any energy in me and maybe if I got it back I'd be able to cope. But I've just been really depressed and unable to do much at all. I've struggled with depression for years already and I've never had the strength to do anything about it, I've seriously thought about ending my life just to stop the suffering. I can never commit to anything to better myself or just any task in general. I also get panic attacks and bad anxiety. I don't know what I can do any more. I don't even know how to explain fully what is wrong with me... there's so much that I'm not even mentioning here."

I will text again later before I go promise. 😇😇"

Thank you that person.
Thank you for the turning to vodka and drugs and thank you for the mental pain that I cannot take anymore. My life has come off the tracks once more on nothing but rumours. This is not the life I want.... Its too much now. I don't understand why people do this to someone's else's life"

I have, after a long time, a job, not a bad one, I'm involved with my favorite things in the world,  cars,  and while working on them, I'm not going on my head over my suicidal thoughts.  Problem is,  those moments are too short, or at least they feel like they are short. Lots of stress at work, as every job everywhere,  but kinda material stress, if you know what I mean, not stress for a people's life or rings like that, more like a money stress which I'm kinda used to my whole life. So normal. 
I can't have a free day, cause I loose myself to my head, and without anything to take me out of my head I'm losing the battle up there. It won't matter if I have a job, good or bad, every time I lost more and more control over myself. 
I'm very repetitive,  I apologize if I'm missing my point here, just wanted to write here, without getting a classic, "" it's on you to stop having those thoughts ""

875,"I don't understand much so I was wonder if I was depressed or had anxiety or just  was not ok.

So at night I would stay up thinking about what I could have changed that day. What I could have said different. How people might how felt when I said something.

Also at night I would start talking to my crush and pretend he was there. So I would start doing something and start having a convosation with them.

At night I would possibly start writing something or reading or drawing or colouring and I would just think about how my family treats me like the 5th wheel (fam has 5 ppl including me) and I would just start crying and crying. 

I talk to my parents about it but no one would listen they'd tell my I'm fine or overeating and tell me to go do something else.

879,"Hi folks. 

I am finding it so hard to cope in the modern world. There is a constant stream of reminders to the weak that they are not wanted. Worse still, they are weak because they chose to be weak. They remain weak because despite being apparently of equal ability, they insist on pretending they were not born weak, they chose it. 

Assuming this narrative is true, personal responsibility is real, then I wish i could remember choosing the life of a loser. I just cant remember choosing it. I am told i must have. Genetics, luck, inherited privilidge meam nothing. We are all equal and make a choice to win or not. We all had identical chances and identical opportunity. So why cant I remember all my bad choices? Were they all pre birth? Did i choose the wrong parents? Did I choose them to be poor? Yes, i must have. Did i choose to be physically repulsive? Yes, i had to have because we are all equal. I just can't remember. 

All I know is, it is all my fault. I just can't remember what I did wrong. Can someone remind me please?"

883,"Hello,

I have posted on this forum back in 2016 but thought that I would share some thoughts of how I'm now feeling. Sometimes I’m not able to discuss how I feel as my other half finds it very difficult to comprehend my thoughts and emotions and often blames herself for the way I feel, which is not in most cases the reason why I feel the way I feel.

I was diagnosed with depression back in 2006 when I started to think about the way I was feeling, I questioned why I was feeling this way. I started a course of antidepressants which I continue to take to the present day, Beit not the same medication as I change if I feel the meds are having a less of an effect. I can now see back past 2006 when I was suffering from this illness and can now use it as a flag as to how I should not be feeling.

Fast forward to 2020, I can say that most of the time I feel good, however I do have relapses. Just recently I had a break planned in the north of Scotland with my wife. It started out with a long drive then a feeling of being very tired due to the long drive, and then a wave of negativity, then a wave of fog. The negativity feeds on it’s self as I’m unable to think positive or even logically because of the fog. I continue to feel tired, not able to think of any positive things other than gloom, then after three to four days the fog lifts and the tiredness subsides, and mood levels get better. These episodes happen every so often, sometimes due to a change in environment i.e. dark evenings, poor weather or just out of the blue like a wave of negativity passing over me.

Fortunately, I’m able to use my past events of depression as an indicator to say to myself that this is not right and soon the fog will clear. I use a time window of three days for the fog to clear, normally it does but on occasions it can take a week or more at it’s worst. Fortunately, the medication provides me with a safety net which stops me from being sucked ever deeper into the black hole then eventually I climb out and gain some kind of normality with positive thoughts.

My question, does this sound familiar to anyone? If it does, what do you do to clear the fog so you can regain focus on the positive things in life?"
884,"Two things helped me: advice from Magnuss Myss ebook (probably still available on Kindle) and books by Thomas Bernhard and Emil Cioran. The first of these things compensated for my biochemistry, possibly disturbed by junk food or a genetic defect, and the second thing, the books of these mentioned authors, showed me the world, life and reality from a different side, which helped me enormously, because I come from a family of people almost morbidly ambitious, oversensitive and closely observing and listening to what and who is talking about them."

886,"Today I had my first psychiatry appointment since April. I’ve been feeling terrible, and I couldn’t schedule an appointment because my psychiatrists agenda was full due to covid - I basically had to beg her.

I didn’t really like it this time. She didn’t understand what I was trying to say and gave me really weird advice (such as not being so close to my pets because if I want to move abroad I probably can’t take my dog with me - which is not true, I’ve searched about travelling with pets in the EU. Probably the most difficult thing is finding a house that accepts a dog, but it is not something that would make me leave my beloved dog here).

Anyways, she didn’t lower my clonazepam dose (2mg), and she changed my anti depressant (agomelatine) to fluoxetine - is any one taking it or has ever taken fluoxetine?

I usually took agomelatine before going to bed. Fluoxetine is to take after breakfast. Will it give me an energy boost? I feel sad and tired all day and it is really interfering with studies and work.."

The feeling of dont have scape, really destroys me. Its not that things can get better for me soon, a year or two, dont know when Im going to be able to be money independment, have an own place, buy things I likez etc, a thing that takes time to happen, not from a day to another (please dont give me advices about this, Im not looking for advices).

So i had been finally getting over a really tough patch in my life. Was having obsessive thoughts about reality, etc. Anyway, i started socializing with my friends again online alot and meeting new friends and stuff. Suddenly though, i started feeling annoyed, insecure and feel like my jokes are stupid and stuff. Ive had feelings like this before but only when i crushed on someone. This is a little uncharacteristic of me. But thats only the tip of the iceberg. Because i started feeling so awful, i started shutting down again and have been plagued with thoughts like ""what is happiness and emotions in general?"" ""why do i even want to feel happy?"" and stuff like that. Its these thoughts that are really bothering me now because i honestly dont understand emotions or why we have them. Im having a hard time wanting anything, i dont even want to feel happy, it all feels so pointless right now. Guess im not done thinking about weird aspects of reality."

I have depression and anxiety but I've been unable to function normally for over 8 months. I have panic attacks, insomnia and get suicidal. 
I have not been working as it involves interacting with people and this scares me; even seeing colleagues. 
This is not covid related, as on a good day I can go to the supermarket with my husband, but there aren't many of those. 
I have a CPN and started CBT about 4 months ago, I find it difficult as I don't feel, I'm either straight into panic or numb. 
I take sertraline 150mg but have felt a nothingness for much of my life.
I have a history of childhood trauma and sexual assault.
I can feel things are slipping again, I'll find myself over the pills thinking how easy it would be to take too many, and struggling to get up as life is just not worth doing any more.
I like meditation and try to do it and I feel good immediately after, but then the negative thoughts creep back.

897,"Hello. So im new to this, and I myself have Depression as well as Body Dysmorphia. However, this isnt about me. My brother (19) this past week has been breaking glass, and throwing stuff around his room. My parents made me sleep downstairs that night as they were afraid as what he was going to do. Ive never been close to my brother, and a lot of the time he avoids me. Our family isnt close knit, there isnt a lot of love here. I sleep across from him, and heard glass breaking, and other things falling. My parents dont want me to share whats happening, but im genuinely worried.He shaved his head last night as well. He has grabbed the steering wheel of the car as a kid, and has done other worrying things. Should I be concerned?"
898,"I'm beyond depressed. I feel empty inside. I see nothing but darkness in this life. This may be because I'm always that nice quiet kid in the room. I've come to the realization that I've wasted 15+ years of my life on living how other people/complete strangers wanted/expected me to live. I'm a fake. A phony. An empty shell without a real, genuine personality. This ""social anxiety"", this ""fakeness"" came from a PTSD event that occurred when I moved to a new country and switched schools. I was 10 years old at the time. The whole experience petrified me. I felt all alone. I couldn't communicate with the other kids because I didn't know the language. I was being made fun of. People would often stare at my big nose, big ears. I didn't even have the courage to say anything to anybody. Experiencing this made me feel like I was some ugly human. 

One day a teacher asked this girl who was originally from the same country as me to show me around the school. Even she made me feel like an outsider. I remember her running past all the other classes just to not be seen with me. I felt like I just didn't belong. Like I've disconnected. Like I've lost everybody, had nobody. I was crying on the inside of my mind nearly every single day for a very long time. During this time I became a fake, a phony. I became a people pleaser. I nearly became agoraphobic from this never-growing events of social anxiety.

Now that I'm older I feel I can better see the bigger picture. And it's terrifying. I've completely wasted my perfect teen, youth, young-adult years due to feeling like a nobody. I recently scrolled through some of my older selfies. It felt like staring at some complete stranger. I realized to myself that I actually look pretty damn good. I never really realized this before. It's as if every time I look myself in the mirror, my eyes look through a filter first. My family would tell me I look good, beautiful even on a semi-regular basis, but I'd always ignore them because I was sure I looked hideouts and they're just trying to make me feel better about myself. I've wasted the majority of the best years of my entire life worrying about what other people think, complete strangers. FUCKING THING ABOUT THAT! I've wasted years of my life not listening to my closest family. After analyzing my past, I'm mainly pissed off for living like a pathetic coward. This story wasn't meant to be mine.  Every time that I look back on my life's experiences It feels like I'm literally activating and making more connections to the depression centers of my brain. I feel all alone in this world. I haven't made any decent relationships as an adult because of the constant need for positive approval from others. My brain didn't want long-term relationships. My brain wanted instant positive approval and on to the next person for their positive approval, and so on. 

I've had one true love in this life. Senior year of high school. We would hang out, talk on the phone nearly all day for some months. Until one day at the school I turned around and saw her tonguing one of my friends. I don't blame her for moving on. The social anxiety has made me into a bitch. I couldn't even tell her how much she truly meant to me. That was my one and the only ""true"" relationship where I felt genuine love. This was almost a decade ago. 

I want to make myself proud. I want to make my parents proud. They for sure deserve a better son."
899,"So I have this plan to move to another country next year - I have already started learning the language and it has been pretty intensive (about 15h/week + studying and homework).

But I still need to work because I just graduated and want to get some experience. I got offered a job working everyday (Mornings and Afternoons) and Afternoons only the days I had lessons. I would have little free time, and the one I had would to study.

My question is - isn’t it too much to handle? I don’t get many job offers of part time, and some of them are for only 1 day a week (which doesn’t give me the enough experience or money). In the last month I have felt the more free time I have, the more I overthink things. So filling the whole time with work could be a solution.
Also - I have never worked. I don’t know if I can handle it properly or if I’ll get too tired.

903,"HI everyone,
I have really been struggling with thoughts of suicide recently.  I actually thought of ways that I would want to go that wouldn't hurt my loved ones that badly.  I have been pushing away my boyfriend (who I live with and frequently talk about the future with) but I have been pushing him away and I am not sure if it is to make it easier for me to circulate these thoughts, or if I am somehow trying to make it easier for him if I can't beat the thoughts that I am having.  I have thought about doing it in ways that seem like an accident like getting hit by a car or something of a similar nature.  I know that I need to overcome these thoughts and regularly attend therapy, I just can't seem to shake this feeling right now.  It has been growing for a few months and it has gradually picked up in severity as time has gone on.  I just feel so alone and I know that my thoughts are too overwhelming for myself so they're going to be for everyone who is important to me as well.  I was hoping I could get some help from someone on here about personally experiences and how you have handled them. 
Thank you so much for your time!"
904,"Hi everyone, so I’m just feeling like I’m really in a dark place right now. I have this coworker at work, and honestly having her at work makes everything, and most importantly makes me really happy. I know that one thing you should never do is depend your happiness on someone else. Because once they are not around anymore it can kill you. Which is true and is what I’m going through right now unfortunately. It’s not something that I usually do, relying my happiness on someone else, but my life right now is just basically at rock bottom and there’s nothing that I could do to change anything, so while in a depressing trance like this my coworker is like a magical little happy pill for me. But like I said unfortunately she chose to quit last week due to personal reasons and I feel like I just can’t get over it. I don’t mean to sound and act like a 5th grader but it just hit me really hard. I mean I do get well with other coworkers and they’re all nice but I just don’t have a connection with any of them, and some I don’t even really like all that much. I know work is work, we are all here for a paycheck and that’s it. It’s obviously not a place to make friends but that’s not why I’m sad. It’s just that I have unintentionally put my mental dependency on her, like she is someone that makes me happy and I like to be around with. Like she’s just such a breeze to be around with at work. Not mentioning that now she’s left we are really short handed and that means I have to makeup for all her work because everybody is lazy here. But this is not the biggest reason. I just feel really empty right now, like going to work is kinda depressing even though I really do love my job. But you know, this is just like a drug addiction withdrawal,I just feel really horrible with her being gone. And I know maybe the next person that’s here to replace her will be even better, but that doesn’t really help me much right now. Now I go to work feeling down and unmotivated. And I hate feeling like this. I wish I could talk myself out of this and just be mature, because no one is here to stay forever but I guess my life just sucks so much right now it’s got such a drastic effect on me. And one thing I really hate is that since she’s gone, I’m feeling really feisty and I get irritated so easily. I really wanna at least get along with everybody at work, even the ones I don’t like. But It’s a little hard to control my emotions in a situation like this. Before with her here it felt like nothing is really a big deal, but now I feel like every little small thing is triggering me and testing my limits......

I mean if she never existed then everything would be fine the way it is, I’ll go on my days. But you know what sucks is when you have someone or something and then end up losing them. That’s when it gets painful....

Can anyone give me some advice? Because I’m feeling like I’m absolutely stuck in this black hole this time. And it sucks. It really sucks. I can’t see the bright side. Really feeling like a loser right now. Having her around just makes everything so much better."
905,"Hi guys, 

I know you guys can't give me a 100% diagnosis but would be nice to hear from others who have different kinds of issues that may relate to some of my symptoms. I can explain issue but might take some writing and about of rambling so bare with me please :) 

My problems seemed to start when I was younger, as a kid I never had many friends and when I left school the majority of them moved on went to college, got gf's and are now settled so I got left behind.  Due to personal issue at the time college was out of the question along with work. Fast track to now 11 years has gone I'm still friendless, still never had a gf or been with a girl and still jobless.  My day has basically been the same wasting hours away with no where to go and no one to meet since I was a kid, I always wanted the things normal people have such as a nice girlfriend, days out with the Mrs making memories, some days kids ect but nothing fell in place for me to get these things... You need friends to make more friends and that's how you meet women, but I had no friends and had no where to go in order to make friends and because this continued for years I'm no longer the person I was.  My bubbly jokester personality is now gone I'm serious and blunt, whenever people speak to me even my family I just hum to acknowledge that I hear or a ""yeah"". I dont know how to engage in meaningful conversation or to make it look like I actually want to talk or that I'm interested. I also don't look forward to anything anymore, I dont laugh, I rarely ever smile, I have no hobbies, no interest.  The only thing I actually do care about is settling down with a gf and before I'm to old.  Every night for the past 7 years I've gone to bed thinking about being this way forever, being stuck in this loop I go over it in my head how to break it. I wake up in hot sweats my heart racing. To make matters worse my hair is now thinning due to age which has knocked any remaining confidence I have left. 


 I always have a grate sense of urgency when i think my issues  to the point of feeling sick with panic/fear.  This is why I can't enjoy anything because it's there on my mind all the time.  I went for a day out with my family to Blackpool and I remember seeing lots of young couples and nice looking women which made me feel miserable all day I didn't want to be there always something reminding me of all the precious time I lost, my youth is now gone and now all I have left is the boring, ugly aging stage.  In my mind if I get to old then there's no longer any point anymore as I missed my window of opportunity."
906,"Hi all, I don't have anywhere else to go with this so I have joined here and I'm hoping to get some catharsis from talking about it. I think my attachment to my boyfriend is unhealthy. I tend to latch onto people or ideas and just project myself onto them. My entire being revolves around someone else and my emotions depend on it. I get so scared if I feel like he could potentially be upset with me. I'm at my happiest when I'm with him but as soon as he leaves I feel drained and numb. I hate the thought that he feels responsible for me, I hate the idea that I am a nuisance or a burden to him. I don't know what to do. Recently he expressed to me for the first time that he feels overly responsible in some way for my depression getting worse because he's somehow enabling me. He says he's scared that he doesn't know how to respond and my heart hurts so badly to know that he has felt this way for so long and didn't feel like he could tell me. Maybe he was scared I would hurt myself. I'm clean for several months now and he was the one who helped me get to that point but I can tell he is still afraid that I will relapse and I don't know what to do. I want to be less codependent but when I don't tell him how I'm doing he just worries more. He has told me before that he can't be my only source of happiness and he's right but if he's the only thing that makes me happy anymore where does that leave me. No one will probably respond to this but I just. wanted to get it off my chest somewhere. I think this place will be good for that. Maybe I will update and say how things are going later. 
I don't want to break up with him. I can't and I won't. I truly think he is the love of my life. But I can't keep doing this to him and I don't know how to fix it. Anyone have any thoughts? Please weigh in. Hope you are all well and safe."
907,"I took 20mg of Citalopram and about 4 hours later I suddenly became extremely nauseous, became very dizzy like the entire room was spinning around me, rapid heart rate, severe abdominal pain, restlessness and shivering so much my teeth were chattering and my jaw is still sore from this! The teeth chatter lasted over 24 hours. It's a weekend and I can't see my doctor until tomorrow just wondering if anyone has experience anything like this before. I was scared something was seriously wrong."
908,"Hi,  a few weeks ago I had a chat with my GP as I was really struggling... with everything! He suggested I take 2 x 20mg Fluoxetine instead of 1 but ever since then I've gone down hill rapidly. I spoke to another GP on Friday through floods of tears and she suggested taking 3 tablets if 2 weren't working. I told her I wasn't happy with that so we agreed i should stick to 2 for now. Has anyone else had problems when their dose has been upped and if so how did you solve it? I can't go on like this as very weepy and argumentative. Thanks"
909,Sorry I was looking at the categories and trying to find where to post this for women but I guess men can join in too. It's all comes down to our feelings. But I was wondering if any other women feel pretty sick on there period? Today I was just extremely exhausted.. Didn't help I get woken up a bunch of times. My body is sore and I felt very queasy. Thought eating would help but it didn't. Now im just feeling depressed and thought I would just stay in bed. My fiance is in the living room watching the game with his friend and he told me to let him know if I need anything. I can't get upset with him I know he's not doing anything but I hate when you dont feel good and your just in bed kind of lonely and depressed. I don't know if I'm getting sick with something or its all fron my .
910,"I don’t know why I’m writing this, maybe for reassurance or just a vent. My depression has gotten so much worse in the last few months. What sucks about it is the pain I feel feels exactly like my heart has been broken. Actual chest pain from the sadness. I’m not happy most of the time, I sleep sometimes to avoid the pain.

A lot of the time I don’t wanna wake up because I will face it again. I’m going to increase my meds tomorrow but I’m starting to fear that my depression is maybe treatment resistant. It seems meds take the edge off anxiety but the depression is only stable for a few years.
I’ve been on about 5 meds now. I don’t know if I should count one because I never got to see if it worked.

I had a bad reaction.
I’m losing hope that I will never be myself again. I’m in therapy and try really hard to switch my thinking. I can do it for the anxiety but I can’t for the depression. I’m just stuck like this for life.

I tell myself my life could be worse, I could have a life threatening illness or be homeless. Instead, I am just sad, and I feel like I shouldn’t complain."
911,"I’m kind of all over the place at the moment. I have been feeling really content, started a new job, money worries gone, in my last year of university and not stressing too much about the work load, enjoying a lot of it. Feel positive about the future, starting a new More permanent ‘proper’ job when I finish uni And moving into my own place. But just occasionally getting these moments of feeling down, or maybe not even down, just a bit empty.. just thinking a lot about life and relationships and although I’m happily single now I don’t know if I’m going to be ok if that ends up being forever. I’m home alone tonight and I love time to myself but I just feel A bit odd tonight about the prospect of living alone and spending most evenings like this (I have been really focused and looking forward to living alone, having done lots of house shares and currently living with my parents). 

Although not feeling depressed and having the dark days I have had in the past.. I have been having some signs of those darker thoughts and moments. Thinking lots about suicide due to hearing about it a lot in the news or through social media (people I vaguely know losing people to suicide). I don’t WANT to do it and I don’t feel like I want it all to end but the thought just crossed my mind sometimes, like I’m curious about it now, and it scares me a little. I’m almost convinced that’s the way I’m going to go.
Just wanted to rant and didn’t want to talk about it with people I know friends or family as like I said I’ve been so content! This morning I woke up feeling very sad and glum and then by the afternoon I was super happy again! Feeling really positive. Now.. I feel weird and a bit down again.

anyway, it would be nice to hear some thoughts on this, if anyone else have felt the same, any ideas of how to stabilise my mood a little? Can’t really cope with this up and down"
912,"Does anyone have any advice on how to talk to dental professionals?
I have spent the past year or so recovering from a really bad stretch with my depression that landed me in the hospital. Although my mental health is getting much better with therapy I am having to deal with repercussions from staying in bed for like 10 months doing nothing to take care of myself. I am having dental problems and I feel so embarrassed going into a dentist because these problems were so preventable if I had done basic stuff like brush my teeth but I just couldn't for a bit there. 

I keep feeling like I need to explain myself because I feel like they will be judging me but I am also just embarrassed that I couldn't even manage to brush my teeth and don't want to admit to it. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated."
913,So recently I've just not felt close to people. I didn't even notice it until someone called me the second closest person in their life and it just hit that I have felt emotionally muted for a while and I don't know how to fix that? Like I know I care about people but it's all muted and feels so distant I just don't know how to fix it.
914,"I was only on a small dose of Celexa for 3 weeks and it gave me severe depression/ suicidal ideation so I came off of it. 10 days off of it and I’m still not able to sleep, I have trouble eating, and my anxiety is the highest it’s been in years. I feel SO paranoid that people are out to get me and that the government is going to come after me. I’m so depressed that I keep thinking about ways to hurt myself and I have intrusive thoughts on different methods which puts my mood off even more. Does anyone know how to snap out of this madness? I’m trying to stay busy but it only goes so far."
915,I am feeling so very low. Can't accurately describe in words how bad I feel.  It feels though that it is my fate to die. Soon. It feels inevitable now.
916,"I struggle a lot with not being able to think clearly.But it doesn't help I never get proper peace or privacy to really relax my mind to think.The guy I stay with always wonders why I'm on my phone.He has his problems too and gets depressed.So can't really relax just now.Earlier I wrote a message for bpd2020 but it would not send.Took me ages.I went over it and couldn't see anything wrong with it.Maybe it was too long.So feeling so drained and disheartened it didn't go through.I just don't understand.I just want everyone who has contacted me to know how grateful I am for your very kind words and words off advice.I just feel so stupid that I can't figure things out.Thanks again to everyone and forgive me for      Not being able to figure out the ins and outs of forum.So to speak.Thats story of my life,always confused, always making mistakes."
917,"ive been battling this for 3 years now prior to this i was a very fit and succesful man,  i did use cocaine and steroids in my younger days but did not seem to effect my lifestyle ,  im 26 years old now the first 2 and a bit years was really intense disconnection, racing thoughts and a feeling of being stuck in my own head i could never be present within myself and feels like i am there but im not 'there'  i would have periods of extreme highs and energy and i would be in the shower for example stairing at the wall so  deep in my thoughts and scenarios i would almost forget where i was for a second, 



i have had some periods( 3 months or so) where i feel completly present and in tune with my mind where i feel like i connect with people and have good energy, but the past 3 months has been so hard i feel like everything has intesified i feel like my energy and emotjons are all over the place i wake up extrmely down and anxious (thoughts about my parnter leaving me wich isnt true and nothing to go off, or just going to work n dreading it) i have woken up at 3 am and been so wired staring at the ceiling woth my mind feeling like its going so fast but i couldnt tell you what i was thinking of,  i feel so disconnected from my self there is a feeling in my head i cant even describe but it is like i just cant feel and think clearly, racing mind (not of a percific thought just all over the place)  i can be so anxious and down in the morning but i could be extremely energetic in the afternoon then back down again but the feeling in the mind never goes away,



i seeked proffesinal help they said they havent heard of anything with all these symptoms i am on sodium valproate 1000mg a day (been on for 2 week) i feel like it hasnt helped at all (early days i know) ive also taken 'valdoxan' it seem to make me feel better about a year and a half ago but i stopped for 6 months  tried to take it 3 months ago but had to stop after a week because it made me extemely manic as they say"
918,"As of typing this, I feel extremely fatigued. I had a breakdown last Saturday and now I feel empty. I've taken nothing but long, hot showers but it doesn't seem to help. I've been having frequent headaches and sleep in until noon. All I can say is that I feel lifeless, like why do I breathe? Nobody in my household understands what's happening to me and I honestly don't expect them to. I'm dealing with this on my own and it's overwhelming to say the least. There's nothing that excites me anymore because trying to what I used to enjoy only breaks my heart. Why bother being alive if you're basically living within someone else's dream but not your own? I don't know what I'm trying to say because it only makes sense when I tell it to myself."
919,"Just listening to Barabara Marciniak now on one of my bought workshop tapes & she' talking about how prozac works ... by creating nanaobots with the physical body / system

She's says don't freak out about that info. ... just you should know this fact

they wanted to give my daughter prozac at 14yrs. old & i said 'NO' she is not going on them drugs !!!!

years later i went with her to doctors & isaid she was old enough to decide herself what she wanted,, we came back from docs. that day with 'NO' financial help, we she / we needed a box of prozac & a loss of faith n the system / docs.


My doctor who had helped me get through my pregnancies... turned around this day and said to us 'well what would you like me to do about it ? !' !!!!!!!   W.T.F. /!!!!!   needless to say my daughter was 'pissed' & i was 'stunned' .......
... basically 'ere's yer pills now f00k -off'"
920,"I do. Ive been cravig for this since long time
 I never had a love relationship, Im 28 old. Always wanted a steady partner, never liked the idea of 1 night stands, or things like that. Dont have a relationship really drains me, be alone, just alone, dont feel joy being alone."
921,"Hey everyone, as you can see from the title I'm 21 about to turn 22 in a few months and I'm still a virgin. I never had a girlfriend, never kissed, or did anything intimate. unfortunately I've been made fun of by people i know, some girls I told when they ask about my history, and even my family members. I realize that there's a lot of people who's in the same situation as I am and that some reading this may think that this is stupid to be upset about. Its so hard not to feel terrible and lonely sometimes . You know I've tried everything whether it be online dating, meeting people through hobbies but nothing seems to work. I feel like nothing is gonna change and that it'll be like this for the foreseeable future."
922,"I used kratom as an anti-depressant for a couple years.  Absolutely horrible idea.  Coming off that was one of the most difficult things I have ever done in my life.  Not going to get into the details, but that leads me into my current predicament...

I stopped the kratom about seven months ago now, yet still deal with PAWS quite a bit because of it.  After months of feeling like I am just drowning, both my psychologist and I thought taking an anti-depressant, at least for a while, would be a good idea until I get more back to normal.

I am taking Citalopram. Took it in the past and it did help. Problem is, I guess because my body is more sensitive to everything now (thanks to the kratom and my brain having to re-wire itself), I am having pretty bad side-effects with the Citalopram. A little over three weeks into it now, and I have had really bad insomnia the last two weeks. It wasn't like this the first time I took it. 

The insomnia is making it both more difficult to fall asleep as well as to stay asleep. Depending on the night, it can keep me up for an hour or two later than I should be up. The most annoying part is I wake up anywhere from 1.5-2.5hrs before I need to actually be awake for work and can't get back to sleep. My brain is just running a million miles a minute about everything I need to do, or sometimes just random racing thoughts. I can't shut my brain off at that point and have been getting an average of about 4hrs of sleep a night when I typically need 8.

I don't have health insurance, so another medication isn't financially feasible, especially with the insomnia causing me to miss work some days. Just so exhausted I can't do it.

I was considering supplements that might help, like melatonin, magnesium, or really open to anything that's affordable on the local grocery shelves that might help. I can't take diphenhydramine because it leaves me way too groggy the next day. My body has always been extremely sensitive to that, so that isn't an option, but open to any other suggestions anyone might have. 

Also, any idea how much longer I might expect to continue having this insomnia and anxiety? I see stuff on the internet where this can typically last the first 3-4 weeks, but I'm going into the 4th week now and if anything, it's getting worse, not better. Just really frustrated and feeling hopeless here at this point. Open to any suggestions anyone has."
923,"I am still living with my parents. I come from a culture where it's common, but honestly I don't have any 'relationship' with my parents. I hate my parents so much. The pain they've put me through is unparalleled by anything else except my chronic depression as a kid/teen and my current ocd.

SO many things have happened. But today after asking my mum to please stop with her passive-aggressive abuse (worded civilly) she then did what she always does after these convos and proceeds to harass me more. I put up with her body/fat-shaming me (thank you mood stabilisers), ""You need to see a doctor. Are you pregnant? Is there an insect growing inside that belly?"" Yea, whatever. Then nitpicking and b*ching about anything else wrong about me.

I just wish I could grow some wings and fly out of here.

Also, my bipolar is driving me nuts. I get obsessive when I am hypomanic and I can't stop it. Got off the helpline from the counsellor encouraging me to read into all the signs the universe was telling me. I wanted to take this volunteer role because it seems a small stepping stone to paid work, but I'm not sure because it seems pretty inspired by my hypomania."
924,"I work for a small family run business; my boss who is also the CEO has been giving me a hard time for the last 5 months. I’m a (relatively) young female (32) and I’ve worked hard to get to where I am. I work hard and the things I do I put in a lot of effort towards. But nothing I do is ever enough. I get nothing but criticism, when he gets frustrated, he phones me shouting down the phone, not allowing me to talk (my partner once overheard a convo and was appalled at how he was talking to me). He asks for one thing, I provide it, he tells me that’s not what he wanted.

If I ask for a brief/something in writing to confirm something, he laughs and says what he tells me to do is so simply it doesn’t call for confirmation. He asks for implications to things, when I find them and tell him, he tells me I’m only ‘throwing obstacles in the way’. He tells me he’s disappointed and that he prints off my emails and shows my colleagues to clarify he isn’t over reacting and I am in fact what he says I am. He talks about me to my colleagues, it’s awful. I’ve had nothing but great reviews, promotions etc in all my places of work. I am nowhere near what he makes me out to be.

My depression is terrible right now, I fight on a daily basis to keep myself afloat, but this is crippling me. I do everything right at work, I document things, I hit all my deadlines. I am at a loss right now, I need my job to pay my bills. But I live daily thinking he is going to just sack me. It’s affecting everything, I don’t eat much, I rarely sleep, I’m down,I have no interest in things, my partner is telling me I’m distant. I feel right now it would just be easier if I sent here, I hate the sinking feeling in my stomach"

927,"I haven’t had a good appetite in months. Weed helped with that, but because I’m looking for a job now, I’m not smoking for a while. I’m going to see my doctor soon about it, but I’d appreciate any tips on how to increase it in the meantime. I googled, but...nothing really gave me good ideas I felt would actually help.

Also, my depression is getting worse it seems. It’s hard to function when I’m not focused on anything, but hard to focus on anything when everything sounds unappealing. All I want to do is lie down. I’m always tired. Doesn’t help that I haven’t been eating enough for a while. I want to see if I can get some meds for depression, as well, when I see my doc. Any tips on how to decrease body pain/discomfort in the meantime? It’s not like headaches or anything. More of a vague ache/discomfort all over my body."

I have always battled with depression but I am at an all time low right now. I'm having a hard time finding the purpose of life and often think about ending it all. I haven't laughed or smiled since she died, when she left she took me with her too. I keep asking why, why did this happen? I'm living in a real life nightmare that I won't ever wake up from."
931,"Tired of all this pain. In the past decade or so I have lost all my pets, my friend, my mom , dad, I moved out of the city I loved so much, I can't go to church because of covid facism. I just want the pain to end. In a way the pains of my life drain me in my daily life. What's going on? Am I emotionally burnt out? I just want to be dead and be in some happy afterlife. I spend most of my days angry and cynical at how cruel life has been to me. We all know life is cruel but their are times where I can't take at how cruel life can be.  At times I think too. What is the point. We spend most of our time working our butt off for money which pays for all this stuff and only for us to sleep in a house only for us to go back to work next mourning. Maybe I might have to someday. Just wishing God would take me soon I just can't take it at times even me having no life sucks even more, no one to hang out with worst of all. Just waiting for it to end. I feel like life is torture sometimes."
932,"Hey, there is something I realized over the years of relapse and recovery of depressive episodes. 
I had depressive symptoms pretty early in my childhood(age 7 or even before that) and I never went a year without at least one episode of depression(worseing over time, mostly in winter seasons). 
After every relapse I feel like there is something missing. As if the depression had taken something with it.

Like it takes your liveliness bit by bit everytime. And afterwards or left with less than you had before.

My facial expressions have lessend over the years. At least my therapist seem to notice a lack thereof.
I also feel less alive. Like turning more and more into an empty shell or a stone. I don't have depressed thoughts but I also dont feel as alive as I should. 

Most of the time I act like being happy or annyoed or anything emotional at all. I can't really feel good emotions to a high level anymore which is why usally fake them so that people dont think I am boring, empty or wierd. It wasnt always like this but it has become worse since my 16th birthday.

Should I be worried that I will turn more and more dead inside? Is this going to be me from now on?empty and hollow?"

934,"Hello everyone , i sincerely hope you are all ok. Just wondered if anyone Has had a similar experience say for instance in a pub situation where people you once knew and who sat at your table and shared drinks and laughs with you now ignore you or are not friendly at all towards you anymore?. This happens to me and i am constantly trying to work out why and i'll be honest it hurts , i wish it wouldn't but it does. I say hello and get ignored , or i say hello and i just get a can't be bothered response. I wonder to myself is it me?. And it drives me crazy trying to work it out , i just wish i could make it not hurt and just ignore them next time. I can think about the experience/s for days and it gets me so upset and drives me crazy. Does anyone go through the same thing?. And how do you cope with it please :) Thank you."
935,"I'm a quiet person who can only ever feel comfort in complete solitude. I can get along with another person for a bit but I always feel a need to escape after a short time no matter how well we get along. Friends and family sometimes try to force themselves in stating that It's dangerous for a person to live like this. I understand that this is most likely true in many cases but the closer they get, the more panicky I become and more likely I am to do something drastic (i.e. self harm or go into hiding).

For the last few years I've been helping my brother who has his own problems with addiction and the like. Honestly It's been hell for me because I love my brother too much to throw him out but having someone around me so much drives me out of my mind. More than a few times I've spent nights on the street or in places where no one can find me just to be alone for a while. 

I've bailed my brother out of jail 10 times in the last 2 years for various things and I found out today he's back in for possession. I can't bring myself to help him this time and I don't know If this is just my wanting to be left alone or me giving up on him but I honestly feel both free and disgusted with myself. I'm at a terrible low right now and can't really talk to anyone I know about this because I don't think I could handle it. Any advice? Random words? or similar stories?"
936,"I'm not even sure how to start this. I guess describing the situation would be best. I'm in a group of friends made up of 8 me included and it seems that every single one of them has been dealing/has dealt with a very difficult situation, one that has impacted them mentally on the long run or at least is impacting them right now. While not all of them have mental disorders as a result of it, I can't help but compare my own life to them. It's not that I haven't been through difficulties and have issues I need to work on with managing my emotions and the way I perceive myself and the world and ig its one of the things impacting my reaction now. I have known them for almost a year now and have been doing my very best to help them and give them proper support and it's not like they're all dumping everything on me. I just feel guilt for not having it as bad if that makes sense. That along with the stress of this difficult year, school, personal issues I haven't resolved yet have finally led me to break and I've been either really sad, really stressed or both for almost a whole month now not to mention I've sunk back into old bad habits like SH. I lost my appetite and my motivation to do anything at all to the point where getting out of bed is a chore now and that makes me feel even more guilt. I guess the bigger part of it is a friend I'm particularly close to and they have gone through a lot. Everytime they have an anxiety attack or a panic attack I feel angry for them, for what they've been through, I feel angry at the world for letting this happen and then I feel angry at myself which makes the least sense yet is taking the most toll on me. I want to stop feeling this guilt that's slowly eating away at me. I can't tell them this because it's not fair to them and I know it so I came here. This is more of a vent I guess. I have no idea how to manage my emotions and I want to be present for them because they mean a lot to me and I hate seeing them suffer so much. I haven't been professionally diagnosed with anything and while I'd love to talk to a professional to figure out if something's truly wrong I can't help but feel like even if there was I can manage just fine on my own and there's no need to take away a seat from someone else who needs it more, so I just hope this is the right forum to post this on because it's the closest thing I could relate this situation to. Thank you to anyone who bothered with reading this and if I'm doing anything wrong in this situation then please correct me. I don't want to accidentally cause more damage."
937,"Today was so long, the hours dragged, feels like I've been up for 30 hours. Must get sleep later, had bad hangover. It feels pathetic to complain about feeling lousy when I put myself in this state. 

Can't stop dwelling on my brother's email message. ""I'm done with you."" Not pleasant at all. Pretty sure it was because he visited here at the house not long ago, but I didn't see him. I've got social phobia pretty bad these days, can't relate to anyone at all. So I just stayed in my room. He was obviously upset when he got back to his province. 

I don't expect anybody to comprehend this. It's got me concerned that it's getting worse these days. I'll just see if there's any improvement later this week. If not I might try to see a doctor. Right now I could use an Ativan. The anxiety is tough today."
938,"I have been nauseas for 16 days now, since my last dose of topiramate and 16 days+ a week since my last dose of Celexa. (Both were the last reduced doses after tapering.)

The first week I had a TON of horrifying side effects, but now I’m still left with the nausea. Sometimes it’s just queasiness, other times (like atm) it’s full on pain, at the point of dry retching, stomach twisted in knots-level nausea. But regardless, 16 days non stop. I’m in hell.

I tapered off of these two meds with a plan from my phsyciatrist. Last week, I went to a gp because I couldn’t take it anymore. She prescribed me anti nausea pills, but they barely work to lesson the tumult. (But have given me indescribable side effects in and of itself!) Nothing otc has worked and I’ve switched to a bland diet also- no help. I can’t feel hunger or thirst anyway, though both eating and drinking make it worse. Everything smells and tastes weird.

I don’t care about the mood stuff. I don’t care about literally anything else (even other physical stuff) at this point except making the nausea STOP.

I even broke down at one point and took a quarter dose of topiramate, which did NOTHING. Does that mean it’s more likely the Celexa that is causing this? I had been on 20mg for four years. It never did a thing for my depression. But I switched docs at one point and he decided to leave it be. I’ve been on topiramate for two to three years, in conjunction with Wellbutrin for weight loss. It had lost its effectiveness quite a while ago. I was up to 300mg of that a day. I’m still on the Wellbutrin (Idk why), plus a host of other crap.

Im afraid to take a Celexa again because I don’t want to start over this process. I also don’t really know if it’s the Celexa or topiramate causing the problem. All I know is, every single night I fantasize about going to the ER. Or just sleeping until it stops. Or sleeping forever.

I’ve read about antidepressant withdrawal syndrome. I’ve read about Celexa specifically, and topiramate. But I also know I cannot and will not stand two more weeks up to a YEAR more of this. And I cannot keep going to my doctors just to get ineffective meds that treat the symptom and not the problem. (AND DONT EVEN TREAT THE SYMPTOM ALL THAT WELL EITHER.)

How do I make the nausea stop?!? HOWHOWHOWHOW"
939,I cannot force myself off of this couch. I don't take care of myself or house. I usually read or watch TV all day and night. Only leave the house when I'm hungry. Usually I leave when it's dark so I don't have to shower or brush teeth. I wish I was productive but seems like I can't be. I worked my whole life. Was married for 5 years but been divorced for 30 years. Had good job. My child is now 37 and successful. I just don't know how I had all the energy back then and now after retiring I can't force myself off this couch. I take Zoloft but it doesn't work. I was on medicine for ADHD but can't take it now due to blood pressure. Help.
940,"I really believe that two years completely alone has the ability to shorten a person's life span. There comes a point when just going to the grocery store and checking the mail at 3am, repeatedly, over the course of two years, starts making a person feel as if they are insubstantial. 

I have always felt like an entirely complete and normal person when I have ever had a person to think about all of the time and to have experiences with often. There is something about the softness of a female that changes reality for a man in ways that brings a lot of happiness to a person. If two peoples love languages match together perfectly there can be this kind of rhythm together that really heals a person at the core of their being. 

I am trying to find videos on youtube that explain how to manage emotional pain and that is kind of my goal this week. It seems that pain happens in durations of 90 second bursts, the same as birthing contractions. Sometimes I can find things to take my mind away from the fact that a pathological level of loneliness is being experienced by my body and mind currently. 

There must be some way to reframe the idea that pain is totally all bad, and to try to find thoughts that make emotional pain a kind of friend or teacher, or something to see in a different light. Its just I have not found those kind of thoughts yet. Tomorrow I will ask my therapist about ""inner child healing"" kind of therapy, and if there is a possibility to start in that direction together."
941,"Hello everyone, since been changed to 100mg of sertraline a day I've noticed I've been clenching my jaw a lot and kind of 'sucking' on my tongue a lot, has anyone found this to be a side effect? I know it can be a well known side effect of called bruxism, where you may grind your teeth but I am clenching my jaw and constantly sucking on my inner cheeks and tongue and it's leaving my mouth quite sore. I am suffering quite a few mouth ulcers too as a result"
942,"I'm great at superficial discussion, but I've started telling people that there's no point getting through this if there's nothing beautiful left at the end of it. 
I've got a bizarre thing going on about my sister, which wouldn't matter except mum's 80th birthday is on the 20th and, although she has more disposable cash than me she says she can't contribute.
I'm in Tier 2, it will be 3 by mum's birthday. 
I'm trying to buy presents, arrange a home cream tea ( breaking the rules as they will be, but with a totally isolated woman whose husband is in a home for dementia like my dad), but there is something not right.
She's about £50000 in debt with legitimate companies. I have no idea how much she owes pay day companies and the car has had windows smashed in at the front of mum's house.
She is basically homeless, but claims mum couldn't cope without her. Which may be true, but my 79 yr old mum pays her to clean, but does floors on her hands and knees herself. To be fair, I do keep suggesting mop type stuff is available. But my sister sees nothing wrong with this.
My sister does have her own health problems.
Dad has had dementia for 15 years. But obviously we can't visit. There has been C19 in the home. To my shame once dad became comatose I couldn't see my dad anymore, but not being able to hold his hand has meant mum won't go anymore.
Everything is such a mess. I'm trying to stay asleep as much as I can, but it isn't really helping."
943,"Didn't get up till one today... and I have done nothing all day... now its 7:30pm and I'm already thinking of bed.. 

another day in my life just wasted...... I feel out of control... I'm suicidal and scared of dying at the same time.. Although that's not exactly right... I'm scared of dying a painful death... I just want to go to sleep and never wake up... 

suicide is such a first world problem.. Think of all the millions of people in the third world who are starving to death and doing anything they can to hang on to life... and here I am living in the lap of luxury... and I'm so ungrateful... thinking like that just makes me feel worse... what right do I have to complain

My life is pointless... the world is dangerously over populated.. So why am I here ? It would be so much better for the world if I wasn't... I serve no useful purpose.. I'm just taking up space... 

I guess that leaves me futilely grasping for the meaning of life... or a life with some meaning... I don't fancy my chances



sorry I was going to post about something else..... guess I'm more depressed than I realized"
944,"Anyone else hate or fear the aging process? It's coming up to my 50th and I absolutely hate it and find it depressing. What makes it worse is other people saying it's some great thing that must be celebrated. Why? For me there's nothing good about getting old, especially when I feel like I've spent a lot of my life unhappy. I hate even little things like looking in mirrors because I can't stand what I see staring back at me."
945,"I think I just sent a message to the autism forum by mistake when I meant it for depression forum.Im so hopeless and pathetic.Now I can't be bothered saying it all again.I just don't want to be here in this shitty life anymore.So alone and longing for a human connection.Im so sorry, I muck everything up."
946,"I feel such a void sometimes. I try to cope fantasizing the life I would like to have, I imagine the things I would like to do or have.

I try to do things to keep me motivated, and not in a hole.

But sometimes theres no more juice. I get just tired to dont have anything.

And cant have a way to scape. Facing the void.

To me is loneliness such a problem. 

I was watching a video (fun video) about random people talking about their partners and life in general, all people have a social life, interesting topics to talk about, fun, a life, and then me just at my home consuming."

948,"Hi, 
So, for many years, I have suffered with severe anxiety, panic disorder and depression. I have been on many AD’s and I found that Fluoxetine 20mg eased me. I was always busy and could live my life with ‘fewer’ worries. 4 weeks ago, I felt I’d completely lost my head! Massive brain fog, panic attacks every 10 minutes, zero sleep, sweating all day, huge feelings of dread and ALOT of unwanted negative thoughts- which completely took over! I have a partner and 2 small children with a massive support network and nothing was helping me/taking my mind off things. I decided to start taking 40mg Fluoxetine, as previously discussed this with my doctor. Some parts of the day, I can feel ok and then bam! Back to feeling awful with negative thoughts!! I have been on 40mg for 3 weeks now and was wondering if anyone had been through this situation and how long it takes for the upped dosage to start working? Thank you in advance xx"
949,"Hi guys,
I am currently having some severe struggles that make my life hard. Since I have strong social anxieties, I can't go out so I am spending most of the time in my room. This is where my problem starts: I am highly afraid of seeing triggers and spend a lot of my time ruminating about my past.

I have been bullied for like 10 years, it improved during my time as a student, which was about 2 years ago. However, I once started thinking about my bullies and strangers who insulted me. Those thoughts became stronger and the more time went by, the more thoughts came up until the point where it started to seriously interfere my daily life.

I have been diagnosed with depression and ADHD, however, I think I might have PTSD or some kind of trauma.

I have the following symptoms:
- Intrusive, never ending thoughts
- A lot of nightmares about my bullies
- I avoid a lot of things that remind me of my past
- I get anger outbursts when I get reminded of my past (I hate certain people so much if I even hear their names I ger very mad.)
- Insomnia
- I feel emotional numb (Yesterday I looked for things that used to frighten me a lot. And I barely felt anything. I am more afraid of triggers than of creepy stuff. I hardly feel joy and apart from anger and sadness I don't have any real emotions.)

My counselor said I don't have PTSD, but when reading online articles, I see how I fulfill most criteria. I know that it's controversial if school bullying leads to PTSD or not, but I am suffering a lot from my unwanted thoughts and my fear of triggers. Is there a possibility to be mentally free again? How long would my recovery take? Am I right or am I having somerhing else? If so, how is that phenomen called?

Thanks for your replies."
950,"This world is starting to drive me crazy, it's turning into a dystopia. Our freedom of speech is invaded by our social media accounts with certain things being censored. They know everything we do on the net. Their was a time where if you wanted to hold a completely anonymous identity as an activist all you needed was a fake e mail account but now they track your account by cell number. I just find the world is getting worse and worse and I see God  doing nothing. I feel like their is no more hope. Every time I see the alternate news things are getting worse. I just want to be dead at this point. Someone who's not in the common pathway in society will be eliminated sooner or later. Maybe I mind as well be dead anyways , I live in a lonely world because my lifestyle is way too unconventional. Being a philosopher is like being on a crucifix lonely on the top of a hill.

952,"So, my cat went missing on the 28th September - I’ve been struggling and my depression got a lot worse.

In the beginning of the week I got a call from a private number of a woman asking if I was the person looking for a cat, and to describe the cat. They then said they had found it and they hung up the phone.
I was really distressed and angry. But then I sort of forgot it, because they were probably from people frustrated with life and I don’t have the energy to give it much importance right now.

Well...I just got another call (from a private number). All they said was “We killed your cat”.
I’m just so furious. I called my operator and they told me to go to the police. That’s exactly what I will do. I will not give up until I find these disgusting bullies, and I really want them to pay for it.

Probably they don’t know me. Probably they don’t know what I’m going through, but they are adults. And they know I am a desperate person looking for my furry friend.

Has any one had an experience like this? I have suffered bullying when I was younger. I will not accept it now. Specially now."
953,"I need someone to tell I will be okay. Everything is going wrong with me.

I try not to drink but I always screw up and feel terribly depressed the next day. I have quit alcohol for years and sadly that wasn't the cause of depression but it can't be helping. I'm trying to clean up my diet to see if my anxiety and depression goes away but Im finding it nearly immpossable to stop eating junk, pop and beer.

956,"I’ve been with my partner for 5 years and we thought we were perfect for eachother. He has had depression for over 20 years, some days he cannot get out of bed. We’ve always worked through it though. Until now. During lockdown, he was out of work for 6 months (he’s freelance) so there were money worries, worries about health (we lost a family member to
Covid) and worries generally about him being able to keep busy during lockdown. Normally he plays sport to keep his mind active but a lot of sport was closed because of lockdown. I didn’t know until recently but my partner also stopped taking his anti depressants. He was quite erratic too in hindsight.
Then August came and my partner got a job for 5 weeks. He was thrilled but had to isolate in a hotel with the work bubble for 5 weeks. The day after he came home after the 5 weeks he told me he didn’t know how he felt about me anymore and had been feeling this way for a few weeks. He said he thought he loved me but wasn’t in love with me. I was devastated but he wanted to try and make it work. 
two weeks later I found out that whilst he was away, he had grown close with a colleague and slept with her. He was devastated when he told me and I didn’t even recognise him. Since then he has been away and come home and he is desperate to make it work. He still says he loves me, he knows he does, but can’t feel it at the moment. He’s not even enjoying his sport hobbies anymore or time with his friends. He’s started taking his medication again now though. 
I wondered if anyone else had been through this and had any advice. He says he’s in love and is trying to feel it again but doesn’t yet. When he’s in a normal mood, he says well he able to work it out and his feelings will come back But that it’s his depression telling him to self sabotage, but when he’s in a depressed state he worries it might not be his depression and he might just not love me. I know many will tell me I deserve better and to leave him, but prior lockdown he was my dream man, and I love him terribly. I miss our old life. Im grieving for it. Can people fall back in love? He said he really wants to discover his old love for me. He has had so any opportunities to leave but he wants to make it work. Could it be his depression?"
957,"I often feel like I'm not good enough as not many people care about me and I'm not getting the emotional support that I need. The logical side of my brain can tell that the few friends I have do care, even if they don't often express it with words, but I'm still unhappy and expecting more. I feel obsessed with the need to be cared for, partly because I didn't get any affection during my childhood and had bad experiences with the kids in school, partly because I just don't feel worthy and I don't think good things about myself, so I'm hoping that others will do it for me. 
This plays a major part in why I feel so miserable every day, I feel like I don't matter if people don't love me. I know that I should be more grateful for what I do have and not expect so much. 
Is there any way to get over seeking affection and validation from other people and be self sufficient? I tried to make my self esteem better before but it always makes me feel worse, as I feel like I'm lying to myself and I don't like it."
958,I’ve been feeling very lonely and isolated since March when my college switched to online do to the pandemic. School was where I got nearly all social interaction. I really don’t have any meaningful conversations with anyone but family. I don’t have any friends to interact with. I’ve tried online things but I just end up getting frustrated because I feel no connection to anyone. I talked to a few guys since my college closed the campus. I haven’t talked to a girl since god knows when. I didn’t talk a lot in class but even sitting in silence by myself on campus was better than the past 6 months. I’m so frustrated because it’s pretty much keep trying stuff online or give up entirely. Anyone with any ideas feel free to comment thanks.
959,"I have been doing ok during the day. Struggling, but still able to cope.

However, when the days starts to darken, it seems like my thoughts are all negative.

960,"Hello, I call for help again in this wonderful forum for a really ridiculous and trivial ""problem"" that suffocates me.


I don't know where to start ..
I quickly get attached to fictional characters, whether they come from a movie, a book, a manga or a musical.
I am alone, and I enjoy it but I don't feel lonely, I have some really nice friends, someone with who I can maybe have a relationship soon, and sometimes my parent's support.

But I get very too attached, especially to this character from a book I read recently.
He is my first thought when I wake up and when I sleep, I assimilate music, poems to him and each reference to him in a film, when I study etc I see it as ""destiny"" call, just his presence makes me so happy, I feel alive again and want to carry on.
But each time, after this happy period with the work, where I speak with this character in my mind as if he makes all my worries disappear, and that I imagine him supporting me in the daily trials of my life.. well my happy thoughts turn against myself, but right now I gave too much importance to this character and I can't take it anymore.
He is not there and he will never be there, never.
And I knew it from the start and I hate myself, to be so useless to be so stupid to imagine that, to imagine myself to be a heroine like him and for him, his presence disappears and I question everything in my life."
961,"Hi, 
Sounds negative ‘one last go’ but I’m tired of the constant battle of my mind. April this year everything come to a head and I had a breakdown, all I wanted to do was go to sleep and not wake up. I was self harming and riddled with anxiety. I got medication from the doctor (still I have not physically seen a doctor with The covid Situation) and after a good few weeks of pure hell they began to help. I was on furlough at the time which looking back now was quiet convenient - though I wouldn’t have been furloughed if it wasn’t for my mental state. I went from the top of my game to the bottom in days: it hurt. I have had some pretty traumatic times of harassment which have all contributed to where my mind is at , though I am a firm believer that I will not be shaped by these events. Maybe though I just tried to be strong for to long. I am the only child to two Unwell parents who I have to care for along with work and other responsibilities/animals. There is a huge issue and background behind that last sentence but I would just been here all day explaining the mental juggling I have to go through everyday just to be in the same house as them. Even though they are the only family I have I don’t believe they are good for me. Just last week I slipped a disk in my back and honestly it has took the biggest impact on my mental health as a pose to physical. I realised how vulnerable we are as a family if I’m not able to do things. It’s illustrated how alone I am. I have friends but I don’t feel that they do for me what I would/ and do for them. I’m worried about work, everyone comes back of a holiday refreshed not suicidal. I feel like they are going to get fed up of me. I can’t afford to loose my job, my parents are slightly financially dependant  on me and I have massively got myself into debt when I decided I was going and you can’t take your money with you. I don’t know where else to turn but I thought that sharing my problems with other people in similar situations might help. To be honest i could just be wallowing in my own self pitty, feel free to tell me, it might make me snap out of it. Obviously this is scraping the tip of the iceberg I could go more in depth but you’d get sick of reading 🤣 any advise is appreciated. Thanks"
962,"Hi there, I'm new on here, I'm struggling to cope and could really do with other people who understand and don't get frustrated at me. Support and understanding"
963,"Today I had my 2nd visit to the psychologist - I never really knew how it worked, at first I thought she would explore my past, see where things started to go wrong, help me understand what happened and that is happening - that sort of happened in the 1st session. 

Today I did a little test -he basic questions: do I feel like crying all the time? Do I feel more tired? Have I lost weight? Do I want to kill myself? Do I feel suffocated? etc. After that she asked me what happened in the last week, I told her that some days I feel good, others I feel like crying and not getting out of bed (the usual). She asked me what was bothering me the most. I don't want to tell her it is the cat - because I don't think anyone other than me understands how much I miss my cat and how much I feel like curling up and cry because of my loved cat.

So we spent the rest of the session discussing whether I should stay in my home town or move to the biggest city in my Country to work. In my home town I have my mom and my home, which right now feels like a saf haven.
In the city, I have my sister and my friends. It's also an important career factor - finding a good job in the capital is like finding the golden ticket. I left there without any improvement, just feeling more anxious because she really didn't help me much about how I feel.

Anyway, tomorrow I will have my first job interview ever (in my home town). Monday I'll have one in the Capital. I still don't know what to do - I feel safe here, but I guess I'm just scared, and having no friends here would be a problem in a long term."
964,"Watching the TV thinking of how nice the last year has been without depression. I had depression years ago. So this was a nice treat. Concerned I'll fall back in during the coming months. Pretty distressed over it. I've been writing short stories and quotes again. I'd love to post more but lack the energy. I think I'll write about my neighbor. He's been coming over to hang out. He's young and injured. Pretty badly to. I hope this doesn't ad to my depression symptoms. 

Does depression hurt you mentally and physically? I feel this way."
965,"Hey everyone. I’m new here. Was thinking about something I’m feeling, wondering if others ever felt the same, and google brought me to this forum.

When I have exciting things coming up, I always count down the days. For example, I went away last week with my boyfriend. It was the thing that had been keeping me going for ages, having something to look forward to and think, just make it a few more days and you’ll have such a great time. Which I did. But now I’m home, and have nothing to look forward to, I’ve fallen back in to the depressed hole. I can’t just keep booking myself holidays in order to constantly have something to keep going for, but equally, I feel so down when I don’t have anything. I don’t feel suicidal but I sort of think to myself, like what’s the point. Is my life gonna be like this forever. Constantly being down unless something excitings coming up.

i don’t know what to do, and wondering if I’m the only one that feels this?
:) xx"
966,"Really? Why do I alwaya struggle when in the end nothing ever works out for me?
My life so far was just one bullshit situation after another.

There was never a time in my life where things were good. My earliest memories are about my parents fighting all the time and then getting a divorce. A father who never wanted children and he never missed a chance to show it.

Then later on bullying and other shit. Like until I found drugs everything was just stress and sorrow. Social anxiety did not really help at school or anywhere else either.
My first job experience also ended in me being left alone with what was also supposed to be their work. Always talking behind my back. Very nice...

And now University doesn't pay out. I failed every fucking exam. One I barely made. And one I failed twice even.
But I can't switch subjects anymore because thats what I have been doing for 2 years already.Time is running out for me.

I struggle and struggle, go from one painful experience to the next, fail again and again, being treated like shit at every new place by, being rejected over and over again,and for what? I don't have love.I don't look good and I am not smart. I got fucking nothing. Except social anxiety that makes everything a lot harder than it needs to be.


I struggle in no direction. It is just pointless pain. There is not one thing that makes it worth it. That's all my life has been. I wish I would have killed myself when I was 10. It isn't even worth having stayed alive for what came after that... it would have spared me all the pain and stress"
967,Getting sick of not having a counselor to talk to. It's immoral that they cut down on psyche services due to the pandemic. Guess if anyone kill themselves as a result of this it didn't matter to doctors in the psyche community. Scary that the dollar might fall. Not dwelling on it but it's still a worry for all of us. That's what happens when the corrupt politicians and the corrupt elite rob America of its wealth. We're living in scary times. It's hard having my friends up in North Cali am together when I'm down in South Cali all alone. I don't know what I would do if my aunt and uncle passed away. Guess save up some money to get back up north but that's a task in itself.
968,"I am going through a very hard time right now~ I don't want to move at all, sleep more than usual, don't eat much at all, cry every day.  I just don't know what to do"
969,"No idea how
How much I did wrong
Said wrong
The future
I can't afford to worry
I'm doing my best
I could cry
What a tough one"
970,"And that's about it really.. I also feel physically ill.. I think I've eaten to many cheeseburgers.. 

its been a hell of a day... I'm about ready for my bed.........."
971,I was carrying school dinners back and accidentally spilt yoghurt on school playground and left it as had no idea what to do when I walked out they was redirecting children because of the yogurt :(
972,I feel terrible again. I can't take it. I been looking at methods and they seem much better than being alive. Plus my family keeps hurting my feelings. This is a nightmare. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm strongly considering actually ending my life
973,"Don't know what to say other than what I always say. Hopeless, terrible home life. I know this is pointless. Even writing this, but whatever. I want to end it all soon. Before the years up I should. I really cant take it. I don't want to get into the exacts, but someone I trusted kinda broke that for me. I also live with my narcissistic father, and you know. I've been embarrassed a lot in my life. Family, in school, or whatever. I'm just tired of being misled also. My best friend, I havent talked to in like a year. I almost got out of my toxic house too. But that was never followed up. I'm in so much pain, and I cant keep going. I feel like it's my fault anyways. I want a to end it all so bad. I feel alone, and people always break me. I've been todl to kill myself. Told a lot of shit. Idk. I doubt it matters. But I will be dead. hopefully. Try not to leave terrible advice like ""JUST SUCK IT UP"" basically. Thanks. Or if u want to do that to make it worse for me i guess i cant stop u. But I know there's idiotic comments all the time."
974,"No sleep because my head hates me. So the hours that I slept I had a  created a migraine. Wake up way to late. Drop my phone and it's in 1000 pieces. My hair is ruined.. because the dye didn't work to well and had to do it again bij I just had no energy.

Than fk covid that probably will end my therapy sessions in a week and I will be back home. All alone this is not going to be okay and idk how to ask for help...

I really don't know anymore"
975,"i am plagued with negative sad worrying thoughts, im to depressed to function and i feel confused and my memory seems to be worse. my brain is very foggy and depressed i have no joy. my question is what medication combo or suppliments or anything that did a 180 turn around for you and made you feel better or releif?"
976,"This seems abrupt and I don't want to seem like there's always something wrong, but hear me out. I've been experiencing overwhelming sadness out of nowhere and have no one to talk to about it. I don't feel comfortable telling my parents or my brother because I don't want to worry them. I just feel like everything's out of my control and I want to live my life without feeling like something bad is going to happen. I feel emotionally drained."
977,"Is it part of my depression to be constantly tired? Most of the time, esp when I have days off from work (I work part-time) I can/will sleep the entire day away. I lack motivation to do anything. I feel overwhelmed doing the simplest tasks. Im always feeling unfulfilled."
978,"No matter what I do, I can't feel good unless I'm tipsy. I try to find fun things to do, but it just doesn't work. I want to feel happy and excited about life, I just feel dull most of the time and it sucks. I want to find reasons to value life and be happy that I'm alive, but I really can't find them. I don't feel enthusiastic about anything. The best part of the day for me is when night comes so that I can go to sleep. I feel like I'm surviving, not living.
Is there any trick to help myself feel good and excited about life without using alcohol? (Even feeling drunk isn't helping that much anymore) Would talking to a doctor and getting a prescription work? I thought that I could make myself happy without relying on medication but I think my brain chemistry is just messed up. I'm also scared that medication wouldn't help much and that I'll still end up feeling stuck and empty like this"
979,"im so scared for her and i know this is so selfish but im scared for me too
there is a long history of breast cancer in our family and my mummy had it twice

i have been waiting for the day one of us found a lump

i have to cope with this and my cat and aunt being ill too
i just wonder when it will all end"

981,"So I’ve suffered from pretty bad anxiety and depression for over half my life now, but over the last few months the depression has got worse and worse to the point where I just do not want to be here anymore. It all started when my parents decided to move house and I’ve been forced to go with them. I now have a much smaller bedroom, I’m so much further away from all of my friends and am constantly cold. There are so many other inconveniences that I could talk about but honestly the list would go on forever.  Because it’s a much more expensive house, I’ve been forced to pay more money towards it, which I’ve agreed to, but now my parents have literally decided to buy my brother a car and give my parking space on the drive to him.  Baring in mind that 1) he hasn’t even passed his test yet 2) they already bought him a motorbike that he never used 3) I paid for my car 100% by myself and have never relied on them for it and 4) I’m paying towards the house so surely the least they could do is allow me to keep my parking space.  I feel as though they always place my brother above me and hand him everything on a silver platter, while I have to pour my blood sweat and tears into everything I do and still struggle afterwards.  They made me get a job, but he somehow doesn’t need one, they made me pay for my own car, yet they’ve bought him one simply because he asked, they expect me to “do a bit of give and take” yet honestly it feels like I’m doing all the giving and they’re doing all the taking. They’ve taken me away from my home, my friends, my neighbourhood, and now they’re trying to take away my parking space.  I hate to use the word favouritism but honestly I’ve always felt as though they prefer my brother over me. He’s always been their golden child and yet I’m seen as an emotional and financial burden.  It doesn’t help that the man I love broke my heart recently, so that’s just added to the constant depression. I’m spending a large majority of my time in my room with the curtains shut, I’m not eating properly and I’m finding any excuse not to go to work.  I’m on anti depressants but I don’t even think they’re doing anything at this point.  I’ve been thinking about ending it all a lot more frequently because nothing in my life seems to be going right and everything just gets taken from me until there’s nothing left.  I’m sorry this was all a big rant, I just really needed to get it off my chest."
982,"Today was hard. I found out he cheated yesterday, the girl messaged me on Instagram laughing saying that she’s been fucking him since January. I wasn’t shocked when I saw this ... but my heart dropped and all of a sudden I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I had one of the worst anxiety attacks I’ve ever had in a long time. I confronted him, he didn’t deny it and instead tried to make himself seem like the victim, saying that I never loved him or cared.
I can’t explain the pain I feel ... I’ve devoted 4 years to a man that has been basically having another relationship with another woman for 5 months now and I had no clue. He’s manipulative and a psychological liar, he’s ruined every part of me. I can’t get the image out of my head of him sleeping with her, holding her, loving her. It’s insane to me how someone can tell you they love you and then go do exactly what they told you they wouldn’t. Sometimes I wish i was never even born in this life. The pain I feel everyday is unbearable. I’m not physically here. All I do is stare and think in my head how he’s probably fucking her and loving her. I cried so hard I threw up. I absolutely hate my life. I’m 22 years old and I genuinely feel like I’ll never love anyone again. I hate my life. If your reading this, thank you for listening and I hope you are all staying safe..."
983,My sister hasnt had a shower for a month now or more. She has daily obsessive rituals and zero social life. I feel like she lives in her own world. A world caused by mental abuse from my family.

986,"I'm just wondering how everyone else is dealing with this. My college has suspended face to face classes, so I'm just remaining home, but I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to deal with this. Looking for any tips, tricks, or advice. Thanks!"
987,"I can't lie to you all and say that today's a happy day. 
I dwell on all the years wasted due to the severe social anxiety. 
When I tell doctors, physicians, psychologists about it, none of them understand just how severe this condition can become. Most think it's a walk in the park to manage, that it's not a big deal and that I should just take a few breaths.

I honestly didn't want to live this long like this. Wasting most of my time sitting in front of a computer screen, in my little comfort bubble of delusion. It's pathetic. I should be working on my social skills instead. But how can I work on my social skills? how can I make friends when I'm this old? I'm in my mid-late twenties today, where the hell do I go to meet people? Aside from meeting people I also don't want to act or sound like a child, because yes, my social intelligence is that low. I fear of being judged, rejected, saying stupid shit. I think this is the result of being alone for so long, not having a relationship, a partner who you can talk to, share your life with. I've had one true relationship back in high school that ended with the girl of my dreams tonguing one of my friends from school one day. I don't even blame her for this. We were going out nearly every single day for months! and I didn't even make any moves on her. The PTSD from the social anxiety has made me feel like a nobody, like I don't fit in with anybody. I still feel this way. Like I'm just not good enough. Nowadays I don't even try to get into any sort of relationships. I gave up on trying to meet people. I feel like a bother to all of them. I don't want to live to be 60 and bitch about living like this. Thinking of what could've been. We only get one life. The fact that I'm a fit, healthy human-being should be enough to get my life back on track, and yet I still feel like I don't want to exist. Too much time has passed. Too many opportunities were wasted.

I feel and truly believe that I'm mainly still here on this earth exclusively to help and support my parents, as they've never stopped caring and loving me. They don't deserve to find out their child committed suicide. I could never do this to them. I could never justify them having to identify my body. They are the reason I'm still here and breathing. But I lost my overall spark, my happiness because I feel like I've achieved nothing that's important in life, other than passing the academics. I'm also unemployed, have zero relationships, have ridiculously low self-esteem and self worth. Every time I try to meet, get to know a person, I get this vibe that they think I'm better than them or that I seem uninterested in what they're saying, or that I'm mad or that I hate them because my neutral face expression may seem a bit sad/angry at times. 

I'm seeing a therapist to fix this thinking. But talking to a therapist is like talking to a wall. I just don't know what else to do at this stage of my life. I was contemplating leaving everything behind, moving to India and become a Buddhist monk. I love to meditate, I have nothing but peace to most people as well as the world. The problem is that I feel like nobody else can see this in me, and this in turn bothers me greatly because I want people to like my presence and see that I'm standing for the good in life. I've spent great amounts of days trying to be liked by people. Being fake. Acting like a clown just to be liked and fit in with whatever group of people I was trying to impress. I just recently realized that this was the most toxic, most cancerous behavior and thinking possible. By doing this, I was slowly killing my own true self. 

I guess this is just a rant."
988,"I wanted to ask , does some of u have massive fear of any interraction . Im kinda depressed and im terrified of any interraction cause im terrified of making fool out of myself and making mistakes cause from young age i was called kinda disabled which iam not because i couldnt do anything right .

990,"Hello everyone, I hope you are all well. I'll start off by saying that last December I fell into a deep depression, one I had experienced almost exactly a year prior. The depression was caused by persisitant, intrusive thoughts of my early high school years where I had a horrible time socially and I hung around a few bad apples that constantly criticised virtually everything about me. When these aforementioned thoughts persist I feel every bit of myself is compromised and I can't seem to find enjoyment or escape in anything. I don't understand why it all bothers me so much as it was all six years ago. 
At the moment, Im having these thoughts though I haven't fallen into that depression, however I fear that I'm on the verge of it. And the worst part is, a game I've waited years for is coming out in June 19th, I've pre-ordered it and I'm so excited for it and I'm so scared my mental health won't allow me to enjoy it :( 
When I'm in this state, I can't barely move and I'm just so heartbroken all the time... I just want to be permanently free of this pain, I want my memory of those times to be erased..."
991,"Suddenly feel very dumb
Can't think
Forget a lot
Can't concentrate 
Need to be alone in the same time I feel lonely
Feel nausea and suffocation from this strong feeling of nothingness"
992,"Tell me, what is your biggest fear?"
993,"Despite being actively depressed and you know what, I feel pretty good.

Go see your friends more guys (but don't break quarantine rules)"
994,"Hi,

I'm not in a good place. I feel so unhappy and anxious.. all of the time. It's Friday and I'm already dreading Monday. I'm dreading another night of nightmares, and feeling exhausted for the precious 2 days I have off a week.

I'm 34, I live alone. I have a long term boyfriend who lives abroad and isn't allowed to enter the UK without a Visa. We hope to attempt this but we dont meet all of the criteria and this could take up to 6 months, esp after Covid, and will cost all of my boyfriends inheritance. The criteria I do meet is salary, long-term employment and having my own property. The problem is I despise my job. It's a small open plan office, a third of which are related to the boss and can speak and behave however they please. The other non relative whispers and cackles away with them, everybody fighting to speak about themselves. I've been told to f off and go home,  that I'm not needed along with regular subtle digs. I'm not confrontational and I'm constantly on edge, to the point that I now barely speak. I dont even recognize myself, the things I awkwardly say, how depressive I am. I feel zero connection. The job was a stop gap, I got it after returning from abroad, just as lockdown began because I have to pay a mortgage etc. Its a brain numbing admin role, 8 hours of answering the phone  emailing and scanning, being asked by my 'peers' how to spell basic words and yet being degraded with paper being simple dumped on the floor for me to pick up and shred for them. I'm pretty switched on, I'm highly creative and have a colourful cv. There are no jobs near me of any creative interest, all admin, support work and factory jobs. I have a side art business which I'm proud of, but little energy or time to really push it forwards.

I feel trapped as I need this job to ever have any chance of my boyf being here. I feel too depressed to sell myself in an interview. My family don't play an active role in my life and I've always felt belittled by them. My friends all have their own lives, you g families.. Nobody around me understands what it's like to have no support whatsoever, to be completely self sufficient and completely alone. I have zero purpose and I'm struggling to see any light.

I love nature, I love travel and the outdoors and I love art. But I  need somewhere to live and most of my weeks hours are simply devoted to  paying to keep my head above water. What is the point? 

I'm really open to alternatives ideas. This life is not working for me and I'm struggling to get perspective right now."
995,Hi I went out for lunch and think I saw my work boss so decided to leave without buying anything as felt so awkward only the exit was was walking past them and now so I walked past pretending to not look at them now I'm so scared about going in tommorow maybe I should phone in sick
996,"I'm finding it hard. I have learnt that the best things to have in the cupboard are plain crackers, like the multigrain ones that you can eat dry like you would crisps or biscuits.

Also i always have Actimel in the fridge.

They stop me feeling ill when i cannot make a meal yet or am not hungry but need to eat. 

Anything else?"
997,"Not coping very well with no meds.I have a choice between Lamotrigine and Fluoxetine but i seem incapable of making a decision.

998,"I'm experiencing some anxiety, depression and negative thoughts at work. I've keep thinking my superiors are judgmental of me, that they don't like me, that I will be fired l, even though there's no indication whatsoever that my superiors are not satisfied with my work. I read too much on what they say, in their expressions, I keep thinking I'm not doing a good job myself, that I'm not good enough, and that I should start looking for a new job in fears of being let go. The occasional compliment makes me absurdly emotional.

I have 4 children ages 4-13. They always ask me to play with them but I have no desire, because I have no energy. I'm a little overweight so I've been feeling tired. Not being able to play with my kids brings me sadness, irritation, frustration...

I've been married for 16 years and I'm madly in love with my wife. For the most part it has been heaven, but we have our share of problems.  I'm am very affectionate. I kiss, I hug, I hold hands, touch, physical contact is so important to me. I say I love you constantly...she is my world. I have a problem because, she does not reciprocate the way I act...she likes watching TV with me, to go out with me...she likes my company. I know for sure she loves me, she only doesn't show the same way I do...I get that...but I have such a hard time with it. I interpret it as being rejected, constantly shut down... constantly. It brings me much sadness, I get down, I get easily triggered by my kids. I become passive-aggressive, she becomes passive-agreessive... and days or weeks can go bay like that before me, yes, always me, raise the white flag. It's hard...after 16 years it hasn't gotten easier.

95% of the time I have to initiate intimacy. 80% of the time I'm told to get it done quickly. This hurts me. Intimacy is huge for me. I often say that I don't want to just have sex, I want to make love...to be one, to connect, to be together in this intimate state...it's something so sublime for me, I long for it. Sometimes I fell offended when all that's offered by my spouse is a ""quick release""... she doesn't get it. Most often, however, I'm rejected. It's been like this for 16 years. It makes me extremely sad, brings me down, and it lowers my self esteem... I feel worthless. Makes me think things like ""Maybe if I lost some weight she would be more into me"", other things as well like working out, doing a nose job, showing confidence and pretending her lack of affection does not bother me, like I'm above it... anything and everything to make she react more. 

She has told me several times, however, that she loves me for who I am...making me think that no matter what I changed...that's who she is, that's her way of being, she is not like me and I can't change that...I just need to accept and deal with my frustrations...and that's what I've been trying to do...for 16 years that's what I've been trying to do. 

I just think lately this has had a much deeper impact in my self-esteem than I ever realized. Days can go by without any expression of affection if I'm not actively seeking it. I think that affects my days at work, my insecurities, my fears are exacerbated, I'm almost constantly feeling down, depressed,  my relationship with my kid is not so great because I'm short on patience, I have mood swings...

Is there a cure for this??? Please tell me there is...can I take something so I don't feel…or so I can feel happy or indifferent when I'm rejected or no affection is shown towards me? How can I move on and just brush off these feelings? Is there something that can replace it? What, where do I find it??? Please where can I find it? How can I get my self esteem back?

I often feel like I'm a failure."
999,"my puppy is driving me crazy ,she has this new thing whenever bf hermit leaves the room she barks after him

this might not sound like much but its making me ill x"
1000,I might actually go ahead and attempt one of the suicide methods that I am constantly idealising in my thoughts and then all of this would finally be over and maybe there would be some peace at last.
1001,"I don't even know why I keep posting on this forum because it never helps me, but I just have nowhere else to turn.

I've realized that in order for something good to exist, there needs to be something bad in that same category.

This leads to the statement that, since some people have good lives, some people will inevitably just have bad lives, and I am fully convinced that I am one of these people.

I just don't know what to do with this information.  I have already given up hope on most facets of life, and yet I still seem to be giving up more and more every day.  Everyone always tells me useful, helpful information on how to get better, but at this point I don't even have the motivation to even want to ""get better"" (whatever that even means).  I have just given up on trying at this point.

I am not exactly sure what the point of this post is, however being a loner, this is the only place I can think of to turn to.  Any response is appreciated, and thanks for anyone who took the time out of their day to read this."
1002,"Hi this is my first time on these forums. I have been dating my boyfriend for close to 7 years. We are both in our late 20s. He has been suffering from depression for quite some time - possibly his whole life, but definitely worsening over the past few years. He goes through cycles every 6-8 months or so when he gets really low for about 1-2 months. He is a very functional person. He has a great job, owns his own home, has a good group of friends, supportive family (although he complains about them annoying him a lot and does not particularly enjoy seeing them for any family events). He has been placed on antidepressent medication over this past year/year and a half. I think this has helped a bit to keep him in a neutral mood. He tried speaking with a few different psychologists, all of which he claimed did not help him at all and he honestly hated the experience and felt he was worse off after. He is currently in one of his low states and recently reported that he thinks about death daily. To my knowledge he has not attempted suicide. But overall, he feels like he does not have any motivation to keep going in life or to do anything. He says that he doesn't see a purpose in life and that he cannot envision wanting anything else in his future as everything seems pointless. 

Overall, a very bubbly person and try to keep things light, both for him and myself. We are very good to each other and have a great relationship. We have navigated most of our 20s together, including undergrad/grad school and home ownership. We are very fair to each other and ultimately provide the support that we need. The one thing that probably suffers a bit is our sexual relationship - we do not engage as much as previous - maybe once every few weeks - and there have even been a few months at a time where we didn't engage at all. This has been improving lately, but still not back to normal. All that being said, it seems he keeps getting ""stuck"" with proceeding to the next part of life (marriage, kids, etc.). We have had the discussion and he knows these are my goals. I want to be there to support him and I love him endlessly, but I also get concerned about my ""biologic time clock"". I am in no rush for kids, but I do worry if he keeps going through these cycles, it will just keep delaying everything to the point where it is no longer possible/feasible to have kids. It also frustrates me that he hasn't been able to commit further with proposal/marriage. It is hard to tell if he is just waiting because of ""regular life reasons"" or if his depression is truly getting in the way. If that's the case, will it ever not get in the way? 

In general, I think I have handled his depression decently - never blaming him, always encouraging, recommended getting help with both medication and therapy, and letting him cry on my shoulder if needed. I am a health care provider (not in psychology) but know a bit about what to say and what not to say during depressive episodes. I am not exactly sure what I am even looking for in this post/forum - maybe some reassurance, maybe some advice. I reached out to a psychologist at the hospital I work at to see if I can get a consult just to talk about some of this stuff and see if there is any professional advice they can lend me (went to voicemail, waiting for a call back). I would also be interested in joining an online support group possibly for partners of people with depression. If anyone has any recommendations on one's they've liked, please feel free to share with me.   

Thank you for listening."
1003,"Okay so in my other posts I have mentioned my sexual abuse and how I struggle with intimacy but theres this guy and I'm going to his on the weekend.

Nothing has been said on what's going to happen but I am staying there and well most situations like that lead to things only actually having sex for me is a problem not cause I dont want to but because I'm afraid to disappoint. It's to do with the fact that my abuser laughed at me once while being in that position. 

I'm so afraid of being laughed at again its stopping me from trying and even though I know that if it doesn't go to that the weekend then it's no harm done but a big part of me wishes I could feel that closeness to another person. 

Anyway has anyone got any advice? Should I just not make any expectations or should I try and see if this time it works,?

Love star x"
1004,"Hi everyone, 
I'm not sure if this is the right section for this post but I'm becoming more depressed and more drained everyday from my marriage and it's beginning to take a toll.  People will tell me to leave but in all reality I keep telling myself things would change and things could get better when it actually doesn't. I want my son to have a family with two parents as I didnt growing up but it seems like his mother is slowly fading away from this. I'm really truly tired. My husband is very negative, very angry, and no matter how I try to help it doesn't make things better. Nothing works. No amount of talking works. No amount of fights work. 
I don't know what I would get out of this post but I'm just tired of it all. I have no emotional support from anyone. 
Thank you for listening"
1005,Does it ever get better? Do the thoughts that make your stomach twist in knots ever go away? Does the lack of love from your parents ever diminish? When does the feeling of being judged every single day of your life ever end? I know only one way and you do to. a friend of mine never sought help and finished his career here on earth but I am trying but the thoughts above never go away no matter how much medicine I take. Is it really worth the fight?
1006,"Im not sure if this stems from anxiety or not. But i have been constantly angry, easily offended by little things that arnt even that bad and only realize it after the fact and just generally cant do anything. I have been sitting here on my bed doing absolutely nothing because i cant even bring myself to do something easy and enjoyable like playing a video game or watch something. It all feels completely empty and its making me very upset. I feel bored yet cant do anything. Doing something productive is already really hard but now i cant do literally anything unless i force myself too. Im constantly feeling upset, depressed, unattractive and annoyed. I feel like no matter what i do, im stuck down in a hole of negativity."
1007,"Hello.

I have been experiencing permanent depression/anxiety for 4/5 years now, in that time I have lived with most off, if not all the symptoms of this terrible condition. In that time, I have developed a visual/emotional representation of what..

A - it looks like.
B - it feels like.
C - how it affects me daily, as well as working etc.

What my depression/anxiety looks like - A grey and foggy dull cloud full of self dampening words and thoughts  suppressing every emotion and feeling, to where you cant even think straight or talk properly. A grey, paralysing, poisonous smoke which when given the opportunity to worsen my state, creeps in like a rat, asserting itself by seeping into every joint, hole and crevice of my whole being. It carries with it a mind and body crushing, implement which likes to strike at every function of me - giving no respite. Nor capacity to allow normal brain thoughts outside its realm of despair. Once its clung onto me in a bad moment and seized its chance, Im on a on-going carousel of misery and suppression warped and caught inside its unforgiving clutches.

It's hard to visually describe it, but this is an accurate depiction of what it LOOKS like for me. I have described it in this detail for my own and other people to hopefully relate too. Tell me how you experience it?

Therapist has challenge me to see if I can change how I see it visually, and see it as just a thorn in my side which I need to work with. Rather than the latter, a zombie overtaking my whole being. I am going to try this.

What my depression/anxiety feels like

It feels like a constant and scary feeling of downplayed emotion. It is like your seeing everything through Ash grey tinted spectacles. A seemingly endless flow of negative feelings and emotions in a stream arriving at your conscious being of thought, a roundabout you cant get off, , made to suffer, made to overthink, made to not experience any joy. Feels like impending doom is just around the corner.


Feel like suicide (even though you know you wont!)
Feeling hopelessness
Feeling of constant low mood
Makes me feel tired
Shaking-trembling
Slurred speech
Panic
Sweating profusely
Jelly legs
Itchy skin
High blood pressure
Heart racing
In constant fight or flight mode
Constantly questioning yourself and ability, am I good enough?! 
Concentration problems (problem at work especially! - making mistakes).
Over eating (in my case).
Difficulty sleeping
Racing mind (e.g -ping pong ball)
Social anxiety

  All in all, it is crippling.

How it affects me daily

Starting off first thing (Morning) - as soon as I open my eyes, it kicks in. I feel my A/D working its way around my body to my hands, feet, and mouth. Shaking and trembling is generally first thing I notice physically, worry and fear next, as well as no positive emotions, just a blockade of grey cloud of negativity, worry and self doubt.

Speaking to people (work role is quite sociable) - Often lose my train of thought as I am not focused on job, am focused on my anxiety depression and how it could look to other person. Im so depressed and anxious inside I cant possibly concentrate on anything. I have too much fight or flight anxious adrenaline I need to run a mile to exert it, the A/D comes out in my voice as I stutter and can be indecisive.

Forgetting things and making mistakes - Forgetting important bits of information at work (general) because Im too caught up in how I am feeling to focus on anything else, even though I try to! 

Anxiety/depression - causes me to have a voice in my head saying ""Are you sure?"", ""Better check that again"", ""I would ask someone about that"" even though I may have done a particular task 50 times correct!

Articulating ideas and thoughts to friends - Because of A/D my mind is not clear enough to talk about myself clearly without stuttering or just forgetting a fact or a piece of information for what I am talking about. Its easier to just keep quiet and listen to others.

When its a bad day its a terrible day - one small thing can happen which starts a never stopping onslaught of other things to kick in like my bad anxiety/depression - seizes its moment.

Anxiety/Depression never leave.

Coping mechanism's/ Self help advice I have found and use

Splash your face with cold water - for me, I always used this as a temperature thing. I have found though, it actually helps to reset you - physically, the cold water gives me a calming effect, cools me down, allows me to think clearer.

Chamomile Tea - I drink a cup in the morning and at night, its known for its calming effect. It reduces my morning anxiety and at night it sends me to sleep. Reduces my trembling. Double whammy positive:)

Early morning exercise and in general - If i did hard exercise before work I find it helps to funnel the A/D energy into a positive thing. Leaves me feeling more focused, positive and clear headed from the workout.

Talk to people (getting a therapist) - Has allowed me to seek professional help from someone with expertise in the field and is able to really help you, they have the techniques too.


Still in the well but hoping to see some light soon

Fighting this everyday to overcome it. Trying to think positive and help myself, there is no magic cure. Willing to put in all effort to beat this thing.

Anybody like to contact me regarding my experience? Feel free.

Also, if you have any other coping techniques please share.

Kind regards, Thanks for reading"
1008,i am on antipsychotics and i might be going on wellbutrin. i want to lose weight.
1009,"Aside from the obvious:    see your doctor for a medication discussion

HAVE A BATH! the warm water feels so nice. You will not regret it.

Eat a good meal. If you cannot cook, muesli and cold milk is amazing. 

Go for a short walk in the morning. Coat on, hood up, get some air. 

If you feel better, play some music quietly in the evening. Maybe even a small glass of wine. 

Get a cat, they really help. 

But Have that bath! Clean nightclothes

Clean pillowcase if you can"
1010,"Mourning without a cause

While I briskly open my eyes I start to feel the heaviness of life weighing down on me. The sudden, transient experience of being lifted into reality always leaves me wondering why the contrast has to be so tremendous. In dreams I often soar through the sky effortlessly, observing quietly as new scenes unfold in front of my mind’s eye. Whenever a problem arises there is always a way out. In the real world my head feels continuously clouded by a dark presence. As if the will to move forward is extracted from my being at some point. My depression feels leaden. It seeps through my bones and permeates straight into the darkest corners of my soul. I am shrouded in darkness. As if a Dementor is permanently following my every move. At least I can still forget my sorrows now and then by dozing off. If only I could escape to the past, where days are brighter.

     How can there be so much pain and misery in life? I am still existing, but all that remains is a shell. I am dead inside. And only a faint shimmer of hope remains. I am a lost soul, a wanderer, an island which slowly drowns in a continuously rising ocean. Only my silhouette remains. Somehow I’d wish that was an understatement.

    I always try to stay positive but lately its getting harder and harder to find reasons to stay alive. I am living in a world devoid of meaning, a world without light, a world without mercy. Can I stop existing now? I’ve got the weight of the world on my shoulders here. Am I doomed to a life not worth living?

    Every day is a struggle. A concatenation of empty moments. Trapped in my own body. The people around me ostensibly have it easy. They have no problems with killing time. For me it’s been three years since I last enjoyed anything. Now activities seamlessly coalesce while the same oppressive, disheartened feeling lingers in the stillness which conceals the depths of my being. Why can’t I care more about things? Everything seems so pointless and unengaging… Sometimes I’d rather lay in bed with my eyes closed just letting my mind roam freely, pondering over whatever thoughts pop up into my head. But then again even that gets a bit tiresome after a while. Now my future looks bleak, especially from my perspective. What remains of life if you can’t enjoy anything? What is it that you’re then still living for? To preserve the untainted memories? That’s a cruel thought. I wonder if I can still recognize what it is like to feel happy.  

    The only thing that drowns out my feelings of anhedonia are periods of extreme fatigue. At such moments I feel as though I have just ran a marathon. A feeling which paralyzes me to the bone. But most of all it makes me feel empty. And it makes me wonder how long this sufferfest will last. This world sucks! There is literally nothing worth getting out of bed for. All satisfaction is gone. The little things that used to bring me joy are now worthless. Nothing makes me happy. I am living in my own private section of hell fighting an enemy which seemingly has no weaknesses.  

      My life wasn’t always like this. The good memories I carry along with me are painful though. Due to the contrast with my current state they make me even more aware of the inescapable misery which surrounds me. I am still not able to use these reflections from the past as a source of hope. Only a brief longing wells up within me when I tread in the past. A sudden, vivid realization that life was once beautiful. Usually the little things, the tiny fleeting moments which barely can be captured are what comes to mind. Exploring the narrow irrigation channels of the numerous banana tree plantations on the Canary Islands with my dad, as a kid. Legs dangling from the chairlift at the start of a long mountain walk in Switzerland. Or the choice between a Solero and a Magnum on a sunny beach day.   

    My loved ones do not know what it is like to be depressed. They do not understand the feeling. That nagging, heavy, dreadful barrage of darkness. It is as if your mind is shrouded in a miasmic fog. Depression is like water. At first, in all its stillness, many would fail to recognize its unrelenting abrasive nature. In my darker moments I tend to compare my situation with getting pulled under water just long enough to be able to gasp for air again, in a continuous loop. It is somehow impossible to stay afloat. Depression is as if you are stuck in a dark tunnel, not knowing whether there is light at the end. This feeling lingers, it chips away at your mind, slowly, unrelenting. The dread clouds your brain like fog. It makes it impossible to think happy thoughts.

    The road to recovery is tough when you are treatment-resistant. ‘Long’ structured days, a lot of exercise, mindfulness and managing your social network. Thus far it seems that whatever I do it’s just not enough. An intense workout regimen of lifting weights four times per week while eating healthy did just about as much in lifting my depression as Trump did for containing Corona during the start of this pandemic. At the moment I love to oversleep in order to avoid the suffering which the day brings. Also my dreams are the only place where I feel comfortable. Strangely enough, in this illusory world, I can still enjoy activities which in real life I wouldn’t give a second glance. I just don’t want to move on anymore. I wonder how long I will meander before I end it all. Will I be able to make something of this life? I guess only time can tell."

1012,"Hi, so Im 22 and Im in a rough path right now. I stopped uni this year because I didn't got in. Im kinfa lost right now and don't know what to do. 
But worst is that I feel like a burden for everyone, my family, my few friends, fuck even people that I dont know and don't know me.
I struggled everyday to fight the urge to self harm, but I honestly think everyone would be so so much better without me, like a weight off. I feel like I shouldn't exist ... and I don't know how to get better because it seems to get darker and darker"
1013,"Hi folks,

I was in a long term relationship with a girl but I was in a bad place so unfortunately broke up with her. We’ve since rekindled things and have been dating again for a few months.

She suffers from depression and has recently upped her antidepressant dosage. Last week she told me that she doesn’t love me and doesn’t think she is ready for a relationship with anyone, but enjoys being around me so wants to remain friends.

I’m struggling, I keep telling myself that it’s the antidepressants speaking but I don’t know what else to do. I want to support her and if being friends is what she needs then I will do that. 

Is it common for antidepressants to prevent people from having feelings for a significant other?"
1014,"To all that deal with depression, what advice or tips do you recommend? I know the key is to force yourself, it seems I can force myself to do one or two things, but then I’m done.
I’m in therapy and on medication. I do a lot of self talk and use a checklist. It’s so tough to push against. I feel I’m doing all I can to take care of myself and being completely open with my therapist about it all, but it’s so so hard to be motivated. It’s like it’s there for maybe one day and then I may as well kiss the rest of the week goodbye. I work out and try to eat fairly healthy. Why doesn’t it pay off that I at least try to do good for myself?

I don’t want to live this way forever. My mom has bad depression and it has really affected her life. There’s stuff I wanna do with my life, I’m just lacking the motivation. I’m tired and feeling weighed down, despite me seeming like I’m somewhat positive. I can bring others up but not myself.

sorry for the long post"
1015,Sometimes I wish I could forget my past. Its so painful to remember. I don’t know if anyone else has felt like they carry a burden because of the things that happened in their past .. when Im trying to have fun or do other things the memories just come and kind of ruin my moments sometimes. It makes me feel so empty and alone that i find myself with a tear running down my face.
1016,"A bad day for me, didn't sleep well last night. So much unhappy thinking today, just frustrated with life. Pretty bored too, and having a hard time focusing on anything. Hope for a good sleep tonight."
1017,"Yesterday I slept at 6AM and today I woke up at 8PM today. Therefore I have decided to try and reset my sleeping schedule once more. I decided to try to play some games I used to enjoy before my depression (Call of Duty and Fortnite) but it couldn't entertain me for long. Now I have pretty much nothing to do (3:30AM) and I'm getting a bit anxious because of it. Now I am pacing around the house and I might try to find something to do on my computer (Youtube, Twitch or do some writing). But I have to say it's very hard to keep occupied. In the mean time I'm feeling pretty awful as usual. From tomorrow onwards I'll be starting a ketogenic diet in hopes that it will slightly benefit my mood. Not sure what to do now."
1018,I've been struggling with depression on and off for most of my life one of the triggers for me is getting romantically rejected that might seem stupid but I can't help it I have a deeply settled belief at the back of my head that no one will ever love me and as soon as someone rejects me I go into thinking that it's true and start drowning in a pool of depression. I am fed up with myself I haven't felt okay in so long and it's exhausting I know life isn't supposed to be great all the time but it shouldn't hurt this bad either. I am seeing my psychiatrist every 3 weeks and am taking mood stabilizers and antidepressants as I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder which my psychiatrist isn't so sure about anymore because he hasn't seen me experience mania or hypomania but how does he expect me to experience it when I'm taking my medication. It's weird but I miss hypomania a lot it used to feel magical everything felt brighter food tasted better and music sounded better life was at its full colors and now it's just so plain and dull. I've been having trouble waking up recently and been feeling like sleeping all day I don't see a meaning to my life anymore.
1019,"The pain is too deep.

1020,"it was such a beautiful day
but she knew it had to end
it was time for her to leave
nothing lasts forever

she got lost along the way
somehow, somewhere it all went wrong
she didn't have the strength to fight anymore
she was tired, damaged from life

in the end why fight?
maybe the real strength was in admitting defeat
she heard the most beautiful music
sang along to it 
her soul and spirit was there in the music

alive
strong
vibrant
she sang loud and full of life
she loved music, music is life
music makes a dreary world come alive

sing sing sing
in the end what else matters?
we all turn to dust no matter
sing, feel alive, feel happy for that one short moment

everything is temporary
sing, feel the sun, the air
listen to the birds
walk in the woods

it was serene
she felt at peace only for a little while
she knew it could not last
but she sang and enjoyed the moment  

it was such a beautiful day
but she knew it had to end
it was time for her to leave
nothing lasts forever"
1021,"Any body who wants to do mutual coping ?

Who wants to chat sometimes ?

Im not looking for someone who just tell me nice words and that everything gonna be alright, but yes someone to talk a little, just to find some relief. 

Sometimes Im pretty stressed about things going to have to do the next day or days and the only thing I can do is wait, talk with someone to pass the time would help me. Not really about my actual problems, just chat. Im 28 old.

1023,"I have been suffering with depression and ADD since I was 4 years old and now I’m 47. Nothing traumatic happened to me to cause it.

I had a hard time in school with paying attention.. i wasn’t hyper, just easily distracted and lacked initiative. Stimulants help somewhat with the ADD but nothing helps my depression. Over 20 plus years I’ve tried every antidepressant plus ECT and Ketamine treatments. My depression is so debilitating that I receive Social Security Disability for it. I’ve been to several doctors and no one seems to be able to help. Some doctors say it’s a chemical or physiological problem or my depression is treatment resistant but if either of these are the case how do I find relief from my symptoms."
1024,"A lot has been on my mind recently. Writing things out here seems to help a little bit, so I’ll share my story. If you end up reading this...sorry. 
I’ve struggled for most of my life I guess. I realized I was hurting in the seventh grade. Unfortunately, I didn’t know how to cope with my feelings back then...if I’m being honest I still don’t. But, back then my solution was self harm. I craved to feel something, even if it was pain, I just wanted to feel something. I slipped up one day and the nurse saw my arm. I had never felt more ashamed of myself. I begged her not tell my parents, but there was nothing I could do. It was out of my control. Later that day, I got yelled at by my parents. I remember my mom screaming at me in the grocery store parking lot as I was hysterically crying. “Why can’t my daughter be normal, like every other girl” she would scream. I just sat there and cried, I didn’t know how to respond. I asked to seek therapy, but my parents flat out refused. They don’t believe in that “stuff”. 
My parents also never allowed me to have romantic relationships with anyone. I kept a lot of things a secret from them. They still don’t know who I actually am. They don’t know my interests or what kind of music I like. They don’t even know what I want out of life. The funny thing is though... I don’t know what I want out of life. I thought I did, but I don’t. I honestly didn’t plan on living past 16, and now I’m 22. 
I’m just an empty shell at this point. I hate myself. I have no motivation to get through my school work. I spend my days staring at the ceiling, crying for no reason. I feel anxious because I know I need to study, but my body won’t let me. I can’t concentrate for more than a couple minutes before my mind wanders. I also can’t hold romantic relationships at all. I turn everyone away. I always assume that they deserve someone better. Someone prettier. Someone who isn’t broken.
     I’ve also noticed I can’t keep food down anymore, and I’ve lost four pounds in two days. My hands shake, and I can’t control my body. 
     I guess you’re wondering why I haven’t seemed help yet? The good news is I have my first therapy appointment next week, but I’m scared to tell my parents. They don’t believe in mental health. They think it’s all made up, a way to grab attention. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I decided that the fear I get from confronting my family is far less scary then the sadness they’ll feel from losing a child. So... I’m taking the steps that I feel will benefit me. I just want to be happy."
1025,"I was doing quite well 3 or 2 weeks ago, I was quite optimistic.

Now I feel devastated as I havent felt in long time.

I just dont have any real joy, all I do is to scape from my reallity, make things to feel good when actually, theres nothing I can do to feel good.

Not because I dont find joy in things, just because I cant do the things I want to do. Meaning: no money at all.

I really dont like to talk about bad things like this, because talk about this doesnt changes anything, and its like to reafirm how bad my things are right now, cant believe I fell into this problem again. 

Im so tired of this. How I ruined my life. So tired to have nothing."
1026,I just wanna die i ask god to take me why doesent he let me
1027,"Before posting here, of course I’ve done a little research about some of the symptoms on the internet. I found out I fit almost all of the psychological symptoms…..but can the internet be trusted? I once jokingly said to my sister that I might have depression, but she said I don’t, because people who really have depression won’t even want to get out of bed (I found out later that this only refers to people with very serious depression).

I don’t have any problem with my sleep as well as appetite, but often times I feel quite sluggish (which I blamed it on the hot weather), lazy, and nothing seems to interest or motivate me. I feel unhappy most of the time. I can’t decide or make a decision on anything, I feel hopeless and worthless most of the time because I often forget or not do anything right, and I mean VERY often (I’m not even joking, I feel like I’ve become stupid or something). For example, my mom and sister would give me simple instructions to do something, and I always seem to forget or my brain seems to automatically delete part of the instruction on its own. My mom and sister would scold me harshly every time that happens, saying I have such bad logic thinking, bad communication skills, or that I’m such an idiot, and that I couldn’t go out to work with such bad logic (I’m a recent graduate actually). I feel like I’ve really become stupid! I didn’t use to think that way, but some time during part of my teenage years I felt like I’ve become stupid...... . Whenever I got scolded, I feel even more worthless, and thought it might be better if I didn’t exist: my mom would have less of a worry, and that my existence seems only to cause trouble and worry. I often have suicidal thoughts, ever since high school actually, and also especially this year (I was quite happy when I was in college). I actually searched online for ways of suicide and their success rates."
1028,"Having been in work continuously since I was 14, I have now been unemployed for a year. I'm increasingly distracted by negative thoughts, which is obviously not fun, but not qualitatively different from transient sadness in the way I have heard depression described.

Recently I have come to realize that not only do I feel frequently negative, but I don't feel that I want to fix it. That seems new. Is that depression?"
1029,"Im invisible



To say im invisible is an understatement. I mean not in the literal sense hut it might aswell be. 

Don’t get me wrong, im very greatful for my life. Its come leaps and bounds from where I’ve been and I couldn’t imagine i’d be so secure when I was 18.
But im alone. I dont mean single. I mean lonely. I have no friends. I have no one outside of nan that cares about me. Day in day out no one will call, text anything. Never. Not even on my birthday. You know people usually have an influx of superficial love on the birthday... not me. 
In 2015 People told me, dont worry you’ll make long lasting friends at uni. Nope. In 2018 dont worry you’ll make likeminded friends once youre in your career. Nope. Now were in 2020 and theres no change. Its not like I’m not friendly or that I’m not approachable because people talk to me, but it never goes beyond that. You might think youre friends with someone but then you realise they dont think the same. 
I literally long to be wanted. In some capacity. Not sexually cos i couldn’t care less about that but socially maybe? See I’m the common denominator here, there must be something wrong with me. I really try! I try to improve on my flaws, i try to include myself in things, i give out positivity to everyone while I’m crumbling inside. But I dont get the same back. 

My self hatred is so deep inside of me that maybe people can see that. But i have this positive persona that I thought hid everything well... maybe not. That confident mask comes on whenever I’m talking to anyone, regardless of how I feel and comes straight off the second I’m alone. 

Why do people make me feel so insignificant and unimportant? Am i hypersensitive or do they do it on purpose? Whenever I start to feel something positive about myself someone comes along and knocks that away. Then I’m back to square 1. Hating everything about myself. Scowling when i look in the mirror. How can someone hate themselves so much? I dunno. 
Maybe I am just a disgusting person that doesn’t deserve to have friends. Every day i try to be happy. I try to find joy  but it doesn’t come. Maybe happiness for a short tome but never for long and never joy. What is joy? I have no clue. Never had it. Well i have days where I’m super UP, I’m on cloud 9 and i can take over the world. But majority if the time I’m just sad, i see nothing worthwhile in myself. 

I have a job that i love! But as soon as im in that car heading home, I’m invisible again. Why am I like this? I just wanna feel normal like everyone else. Not counting down the minutes til 10.30 when i can go bed because I just want the day to end. Tired of being alone. Tired of talking only to myself. When will I cross someones mind? When will someone check on me like I do them? I pour into people from an empty cup! How is that possible?! SERIAL KILLERS HAVE FRIENDS! Real horrible mean people have people that wanna be around them. So are you telling me Being around me is  worse than that? 
Anyway, I’m just gonna continue going about my day to day. Even if no one remembers i exist."
1030,"Hi all. This is my first time posting on such a forum.

I've been incredibly depressed for the past week or so and I can't snap out of it. I've been trying but it feels pointless.

The main problem I have is that I've been feeling very insecure about myself because of my boyfriend's ex. It's a very long story but the point is that I know for a fact that he used to be obsessed with her and loved her very much, then they broke up and he sort of replaced her with me. I never got the feeling that he's into me as much as he was into her. I tried to get over it but lately I've just been comparing myself to her over and over and I think I'm getting a bit obsessed. This really isn't the sort of rabbit hole I'd like to fall down into. I'm trying hard to lift myself up but there are so many other things stressing me out: I lost my job due to the corona outbreak and can't find another one, I have to find another place to live and rent is very expensive in the city that I live in etc etc.

Long story short I'm feeling very worthless, ugly, stupid and lonely. Don't know what to do. Does anyone else have experience with having a boyfriend who used to be obsessed with another girl? Can someone relate to this and give me some advice? By the way he's a very good guy and has always treated me with love and respect, it's just that I genuinely think he was way more attracted to her than he is to me. When they broke up he tried really hard to get her back. When I was on the verge of breaking up with him he just sort of accepted it.

I don't hold it against him. You can't choose who you're attracted to. I'm just really sad."
1031,"I hope my thread won't be sensitive or controversial. But I need to vent. Besides the fact I fear of going to hell, I have this on my mind. I felt this way for years but now things are getting worse in 2020 now thanks to the media, government, and bullies. I'm feeling more ashamed and less proud of my heritage (Italian). It literally hurts me when people call them racists, mafias, bringing up what Columbus did, what Mussolini did, the Italian invasion of Somalia, Libya, and Eritrea, what the Roman Empire did, and that the Romans crucified Jesus. I'm starting to wish that I was a different nationality. Now I'm afraid to tell people what my background is bc I fear they will judge me. Does anyone here feel the same way? Or had felt the same way? Again I don't mean to have this topic come as offensive. If so, I will ask the MOD to remove it"
1032,"Looking to see if anybody can relate to the title, or anything that I am about to say here.  I just feel like almost every single aspect of my life has declined greatly over the past 2 years, and at this point it is so bad that I don't even really feel like trying any more.  I don't have the motivation to keep looking for jobs, because I have never been able to find a good one.  I don't want to keep trying to improve my romantic life, because I have been rejected to many times.  I don't want to go to therapy any more, because so many of my therapy sessions have failed to help me.  I could go on and on with each aspect of my life, but overall I just feel like its not even worth it any more.  I have just tried so much and nothing has come to fruition, in fact it seems like things have gotten worse from my trying.  I don't think any advice will help at this point, just seeing if anybody can maybe relate, because knowing that I am the only one who feels like this would change some things.  Thanks to anyone who took their time to read all of this, it means a lot."
1033,"For the fist time in many years I feel better not perfect but better, the drug seems to have no side effects up till now  and at least I can function on my quite days, It's been 13.5 years scince I have felt like this."

1037,"I think I started reading books about ""personality"" sometime back in the 1970's, and then over the years, numerous books on depression and its treatment. I think that the most informative single book I've read would be Andrew Solomon's ""The Noon-Day Demon; An Atlas of Depression"". I think that a large number of the books I started to read were...""Unimpressive"", the term ""pot boiler"" springs to mind."

I'm new here so forgive me if I have posted this in the wrong place (please tell me where to go if this is the case). I was diagnosed last year with depression and I have been on antidepressants since then and have had some CBT sessions which have now, sadly, ended. The CBT was invaluable for me and has definitely helped me with my thoughts and how I perceive myself and other situations. There is one thing, however, that has been bothering me for a while. 

I notice that I get angry, like really angry, at the silliest things and very quickly. This manifests most with the people who are closest to me (family and partner). Like, something will happen that annoys me and I have this urge to get back...but I end up saying the most hurtful things that a) I don't mean and b) leave me feeling so guilt-ridden and asking myself how on earth could I even have done that. It's like I see red and I just become this other person. I've kinda shrugged it off in the past as me just having built this defense mechanism from all the bullying I went through and this was how I had to adapt to get through it and stick up for myself...but I'm not being bullied anymore and yet still I get so angry. I start hashing things up from the past that the other person has done to make them feel bad and sometimes it has manifested physically. 

I can't tell if this is something related to my mental health and my depression (or something that hasn't been diagnosed) or if I'm just an awful person. All I know is that it is causing me a lot of pain and pain for the ones I love. I don't know why I do it and I never see it coming. It's like a switch that I can't turn off. I'm wondering if this is some sort of personality disorder perhaps? or maybe I'm just horrible, idk. I'm going to try and get a doctor's appointment and talk about it but I can't get an appointment for at least the next three weeks! Have any of you guys had any experience with this and some tips, perhaps, of how to cope when this happens?

Thank you!"
1039,"Hi, I’m new here so I apologize if this is in the incorrect place, I’m a little flustered today.

I’m not sure where to even begin... my girlfriend experiences fluctuating depression. Most times it’s not too bad but when it flares up it can get bad. We’ve known each other as friends for nearly 9 years now and have been dating since March of this year.

We had stayed the weekend together last weekend and the Monday after she told me her depression was flaring up. I told her if there was anything she needed to please let me know, like I always tell her. Fast forward to last night and she’s told me she’s not feeling it anymore. That I’m “too good to her and she isn’t ready for that just yet” and she was feeling overwhelmed with everything in her life and needed  break. She said “it’s not a loss of interest, I think I just need a break and I just need to organize my thoughts” and went on to say “I want you to know that no matter what happens with everything, even if we don’t work out, you’re still stuck with me”. I told her I would be there with her through it and like she said, she wasn’t ready just yet but she’s will be eventually and she’s went on to say “I also need you to realize that may take a while” and I told her I was serious about being there for her and everything she needs.

Until we had this conversation she was still calling me baby, love and telling me she loved me. Sometimes she struggles. I can ask her how she’s been feeling and she’ll just say “I feel really meh today”. I asked her this morning and she said she was struggling with everything in her head.

Relationship aside, how can I help her? Is it enough to just know someone has your back or when you go down that path is there not really anything you can do besides be with your own thoughts?

What does the break really mean? She says she’s hasn’t lost interest, she just isn’t ready yet. Would a flare up in depression cause her to “not feel it anymore” as she’s put it? At the end of the day I’m still her close friend and have been for years. I want to help any way I possibly can."
1040,"Mental health wise, I'm lucky as I have a PA that takes me walks and a member of the crissis team, so I get out for a walk 3 times a week and I go to work 2 times a week.

1046,"I’m looking to end my life. I never had a job/ don’t have friends/ my home life is trash/ toxic parent. 

I want to shoot myself. 

I’ve been told to kill myself by someone in my family. I’ve been told it never gonna get better. I’ve been told a lot of things, and I can’t live here no more but I can’t escape with no job. I have a toxic dad who only cares about me if I’m religious and I don’t believe in it so I hide it. But I want to be free from that. I’ve been bullied in my life, also my mom doesn’t get it when I told her and she only got mad. 

I know you guys probably will just tell me something generic like suicide will hurt others, but that advice is weak and never helps. Lol. So yeah I don’t know if there’s a point to posting this but here goes nothing"
1047,"I’ve been back and forth wanting to kill myself for years, sometimes on upswings where I want to live and am striving to improve, and then the instantaneous relapse into self-hate and suicidal thinking. Basically all my adult life, but more severely since age 20 to now. I’ll be 30 my next birthday.
I’m of the mindset that if you don’t naturally cut the mustard, then there’s no need to keep on trying. You just need to get gone. That’s what I think about myself.
I’ve never cut the mustard. I’m pathetic in most ways. I cannot accomplish basic things despite consciously trying. I notice that the way I’m treated by others points to me being unlikable and undesirable. There is a lack of cordiality, and a prominent obtuseness to how people treat me that seems to be distinctly reserved for me. They don’t treat others the same I very much notice.
I also see that undesirability in myself. It’s not something I look for. It’s just impossible not to see. I’m definitely not of good genetic quality. 
I have developed a very strong emotional dislike of women over the years. I’ve never been able to attract a girl, or to get a girlfriend. I’m also a virgin. I’ve been treated with nothing but coldness from women. The resentment has built up to the point of not even being attracted to them anymore. It’s kind of like a movie you really love, but you find out some fact about it that makes you hate it, but you still want to love it, but you can’t get over that fact about it. It ruins it for you. That’s basically how it is for me with women. I’m still physically attracted to them (I guess), but it is countered by a much stronger emotional resentment that completely shuts down/cancels out my desire for them. I could not imagine myself having sex with one of them now, or doing anything with them. I’d almost rather swallow sewage, and I’m not exaggerating or being comical. That is the truth. I resent and detest them. I really don’t want women to like me now. I don’t want what they have to offer, and I’m not pouting. I’ve legitimately developed a strong hatred for them. I would rather die than be involved with a woman to any capacity, and I mean that with all my heart. Don’t want them, and never will. 

My issues aren’t just with women though. I just hate who I am all around. I’m a loser, and a nobody, and never will be somebody. I’ve got no energy whatsoever. I can’t accomplish anything, and I don’t really want to anymore. If you make it to 29 still in my position, it’s time to pack it up. You just genetically don’t have it. It’s not going to pan out for you, nor should it."
1048,So I know I'm probably not the only one that's like this but I'm tired. I literally do everything cleaning cooking tidying school runs washing.. I feel so worn down I'm tired. I was looking forward to having some routine back from having my 2 kids home for 5 months but I'm exhausted.. My husband works very long hours 5 days a week I don't have family or friends to ask its literally just me.. What can I do!! I feel like I'm completely alone I'm so tired......
1049,"I'm sorry for all the wrongs I've caused to other people. I'm sorry for myself and the useless pity and hatred I caused for myself. I'm sorry for the names I've spewed out, all the lashing out, all the inappropriate fucked up crap that comes out of my mouth like word vomit. This is to the big G in the clouds somewhere. This for all the people that read my complaints. I haven't done enough for myself like I should and that's what I need to do. So that's what I will. Dont worry I'm not suicidal or nothing like that. And the story's too long to tell. I've never felt so small and puny all my life. To realize how pathetic my lashing out really is. I cant tell you how sorry I am for the people that knew me and rightfully threw me away. Too much pain and sorrow for one little body. Certainly not to invalidate other people who went thru far worse things, real abuse and such. I'm sorry for them too. You all in the reply section have given me some essential advice and they will be followed gratefully. Thank you for those who replied from the innermost core of my being who give more of afuck than most of the people around me to try to give well rounded or just to try to relate. I feel I dont deserve it but that may be just an illusion from my pain. I'm very grateful even if i dont act like it and I don't want to let myself or anyone else down. You all can make of this what you will I suppose. I may not be exactly sure what I'm trying to get across except basically it's time to rectify my wrongs and get away from where I'm at despite the world going to hell. I'm not afraid anymore of the fight."
1050,"I am deeply saddened by where I find myself in my life. I see bleakness and pointlessness at every turn. I am so deeply bitter and resentful. I begrudge almost everyone's success and happiness especially those I should celebrate the most. I have managed to make those I know have suffered into a target of my envy which is wicked beyond belief.

I envy friends who have died before their time and somehow have negated the pain of those they have left into something less than my own. 

I have always diminished supposed achievements by me and now, in my heart at least diminish those of people I should celebrate the most, including blood. 

I negate the feelings of others, ""pushing them away"" to use the cliche, never accepting their emotions and diminishing any meaning in mine and their lives. 

My measure of success has narrowed to an extent which precludes myself and my loved ones from ever being a success in my eyes. 

I have no vitality at all and constantly wish to be snuffed out. I see no meaning because I don't want there to be meanimg. A meaning would suggest a purpose and as a failure I dread being judged by peers and the dreadful idea of a God. 

I cannot accept belonging, i disgust myself and am disgusted by those who show me any regard at all. I cannot accept my place here. I am not equal to anyone. 

I have slipped so far below the expectations of my former self if I ever met me as a child they would break down in tears at the disappointment they have become. My utter lack of creativity and originality of thought would repel my former self beyond belief. 

I am, by any measure simply appalling. Sadly, i suspect my intelligence is enough just to grasp that I am meant to feel this way and that shame is a force of nature to keep me in my place."
1051,"I have never heard of a form of depression that really sounds like what I experience. I wonder if maybe I have depression caused by another disorder, as I have other issues that have been persistent throughout my life just like my depression. Often time I wonder if those things were treated, I would get better in areas of depression. But then again, I shouldn't assume the cause of it if I'm just not sure. So my depression has affected me nearly every day for the past 10 years or more. I can't really remember a day that I didn't have some piece of it affected by depression, but there may have been some that I just can't recall. I'm not exaggerating either, I really can't imagine a day since I was really young that I haven't felt at least a small portion of the day I was hopeless or scared of my existence. It is really persistent. I'm very sure that I don't have Seasonal Affective Disorder because I actually experience so much depression in spring and summer as well. I know that I haven't had more than 2 weeks where I had no depression. My other mental health struggles that I know of include sensory processing disorder, some form of anxiety, and dysphoria. These things are persistent and have barely received treatment due to my current and past life situations. I feel intense guilt, very low self-esteem, and I struggle to feel that anything I do has a purpose. It's so hard to be positive anymore even though I really try to be. I think that many people would see me as high functioning in depression because many people are barely aware I have it, or if they have been made aware in the past, likely never saw signs or continue to not see them. The only time anyone seemed to recognize that something was wrong was years ago when my depression was at its worst and I couldn't go to school at all or do anything. And I wonder if maybe it is my fault for not communicating until asked. But there are reasons that I don't. I still haven't gotten much better. I am logically more hopeful but I still feel the same hopelessness. I have worked on getting better but I haven't much, and I still don't feel better. I just have a few coping mechanisms that keep me as functional as I can be. I feel like I am nothing inside, and that I don't really have a life of my own but that I chose that path in the first place. I am the one who feels I have no choice but to be alone, I am the one who decides to isolate and not speak about my struggles, I am the one who chooses to only help others and barely have enough energy for my own life goals. I feel like overall I am a really positive person at heart, always seeing the beauty in things and I don't spread hatred towards anyone. I just feel that there is also a deep negativity almost coexisting in the same moment as that positivity, where I just can't see any point in the good things in life or the bad things or anything. The only point I see is to help others and make them happy, but I have a really hard time being around people. I don't consider anything I do to be a success and I genuinely mean that, because everything I do even if it's good it's not really a goal I had because I feel so empty. And it's weird to say I am positive while I type all of this really sad and negative stuff, but I think it is important because I am still trying to understand and get better. Thank you so much if you read this I know it was long. I appreciate you and I'm sorry if this was not very uplifting! I'm just trying to get better :)"
1052,"Let me tell you about my life. I was a problem child. I cried a lot. Threw tantrums because of my horrific anxiety. I had fears. Fears of people stuck in wall and other bizarre terrors. If I went to restaurant, I wanted to go home and eat. I hated travelling, unlike now. I cried and threw a tantrum. That's why my aunt has some sort of hatred towards me. Like I said, I was a problem child. Although I grew out of it, my anxiety and rage was still pravalent. To tone down the storm, I took some pills. Took a lot of trial and error.

At the same time, my parents were controlling. My father was very demanding. He had zero tolerance of doing mistakes and was a people-pleaser. He groomed that into me. He told that I wasn't good enough... That status would require a lot of hard work. Quit doing what you like and spend countless days and nights on how to please people... No hobbies... Just waste time reading books about how these snobby intellectuals sacrificed their time to be sucessful... Which it wasn't my destiny.


Not only that, my mother was controlling. I can't go outside until I ask her permission. If she granted permission, I have to be home by midnight. That becomes difficult when I'm on vacations; I have to stay at my destination for days. I'm 29, and she treats me like a baby.


This stunted my mental growth, and hot damn, I try to understand myself. Of what's really going on. But my aunt undermines it and sat it's all my fault. Of how spoiled I was. How my father was trying to save me.

But his methods were unhealthy. He rarely congratulated me. He kept verbally abusing me, saying I wasn't capable of success. Success is survival... Which is bullcrap. There are lot of other ways to survive... And thrive.

Lots of Koreans pride themselves into this mantra. They were poor and starving. But they worked their pants off and got rich. If anyone has difficulties in their lives... Just starve themselves as punishment; you'll think of these earlier generations.

I am thankful that they succeeded. But these people got boastful, and hard work don't always guarentee success; if so, everyone is rich. Only 1 out of 1000 can acheive something like that.

Spoiled or not, so what? The biggest mistake I made was.... I came to Korea with my mother because I thought I couldn't get a job.

Lot of my friends were staying in because they can't get a job after my graduation. That needed skills which graduates can't acheive.

And besides, since I am bipolar, I can't juggle with school and work. Pay is measly. Medical insurance is expensive. I put a lot of my effort in studying, ans can't waste a single time doing other things. The stress will overcome me so fast that I have a mental breakdown. I get angry and have a tantrum. I could be arrested!

So, I complied with my parents to come to Korea and I'm suffering. Trying my ass to keep my schizophrenic mother together in one piece to barely get by.

Was that a mistake. Korea's no land of opportunity. Unemployment is worse than US."
1053,"So my anxiety has gone off the charts this year.  I’m so nervous it’s hard for me to go out and I also am nervous around my family. When I meet people, some people give me looks and stuff and I think people can tell that I’m really nervous.  My body language apparently is easy to read.  When I’m anxious around people some people start to pick up on my anxiety and start to bully me by making me feel more uncomfortable about myself.  I don’t know what to do sometimes.  It makes me so angry at times and I get paranoid easily.  How do I cope with bullies?  And why would someone try to bully me in the first place?  Thanks for your help"

1056,"By most people’s standards, I have a lot to be thankful for. A high paying job, a nice house and car, no debt beyond a mortgage and car loan, a loving and supportive family, close friends, and no major health problems.

But for some time, I’ve been feeling completely indifferent to life. I don’t have thoughts of suicide, I can still go to work, exercise, enjoy food, movies, hobbies, etc. But if my life were to end tomorrow, I wouldn’t be upset. My only concerns would be what affect it would have on my family and who would take care of my dog.

I feel like I have no purpose in life. My job, while it pays well, leaves me bored and I know it’s a career dead end. But I don’t feel especially motivated to look for a new job. In my personal life, I have no long term goals. I don’t want kids and I’m not even sure I want to get married. My last relationship ended when my ex-girlfriend moved back home to be with her family due to her own history with mental illness. I had hoped she would come back. But then she met someone else and decided to stay. Since then, I’ve tried to meet someone new. I’ve been on dates with some fun and attractive women, but nobody I really hit it off with. Seeing my friends, relatives, and even my ex all in relationships just reminds me of what I’m missing. All of this has contributed to a feeling of emptiness in my life. But as stated earlier, I don’t feel compelled to change any of it. I feel like I’m just living, passing the time until the end gets here.

At first, I thought I was just sad over seeing my ex with someone else. But now I realize that’s just one part of a much larger problem, which is a general unhappiness about my life but no willingness to improve it. Coupled with the feelings of emptiness is some anger. I’m angry that my ex didn’t come back and decided to be with someone else. But most of all, I’m angry at myself for not doing more with my life and filled with regret over the choices I made. Is this depression, is it normal to feel this way, and what can I do? I use exercise to improve my moods, but that only lasts so long and I don’t want to start taking drugs. Help."
1057,"i think my mother might be having suicidal thoughts and i’m so scared i don’t know what to do. lately she’s been saying that her life is worthless, that she’d like to be dead, that no one would miss her and that breaks my heart so much because she’s the person i love the most and i probably wouldn’t be able to get over something like that please help i’m so scared and i don’t know where i can seek help or how i can help her stop having those thoughts she’s all i have but i feel like she doesn’t know how important she is to me and everyone around her i want her to feel loved

1060,"I struggle a lot with living. Since I was small I would have these episodes of not wanting to be around people and pushing the ones I love away. Now, I feel like I have no one left. I am getting older and feel more broken. My broken pieces are impailing me and I feel like I am sufficating. I hate myself but I can't run away from myself. I have a lot of dreams and aspirations but live in so much self doubt. I can't hold in my hurt anymore and smile."
1061,"There definently is a surfeit of hell in this world. On the news every morning, all this excessive politicizing, a generally apathetic atmosphere. I will say in my life, theres been an excessive amount of flaky people that come and go as easily as leaves are blown in the wind. Depression has been a problem but mostly anger. Too much of it I say. And theres the saying that depression is anger turned inward or something of the sort. It's true in a sense. Anger is more corrosive. It could be used for positive direction or for vengeance. 
Theres the lack of a relationship that didnt help for sure but it's not just that, it's just not being around the right people. I was around a lot of girls that didnt treat me respectfully, were flaky or just selfish. I dont believe that's how they all are. But I've yet to discover anyone who's different. Theres tension in my merged family that my mother and stepfather stupidly made the mistake of doing. Now theres 8 people stirring in the heat here and no one wants to be here. Theres a lot of moving around, unresolved tension and the hormones that kicked in mixed with this screwed genetic pool I've had the disadvantage of relating to, it's a lot. 
As well as the fact that others went thru the same thing and continue to go thru the same thing whether its virgins in their 30s or 40s or just stuck in the same place basically. Theres some weird lesson to learn from all this and I understand one has to love oneself before you have to love others. But theres something cruel in going to school when i went and to see all the high school bullshit going on around and knowing you cant take a part in it and they dont care. The pleasure is all theirs. 
Theres a devil in me that wants to burst out sometimes like some spirit of vengeance. I feel for the people who went thru a lack of love their whole life because sometimes they only knew hate. There needs a balance somewhere on this planet for these sort of people. 
For myself, it doesnt really matter. I have still some years of youth left. I just hope they find what they're looking for instead of the same shit they always knew."
1062,"I am now 27 and I've never been in a relationship. I have never been a 'normal' girl, I still live with parents, and live with disabilities. I have some mental disorders which I struggle to get the right help for and I have given up on both my immediate family and finding any friends. The problem is all my peers are settling down & it is bothering me. My siblings have settled down too. Meanwhile I am as single and inexperienced as I was ten years ago.

I won't dwell on this, but my life has been lonely for so long. I desperately want human connection, especially familial love and soulmate-type love. My own parents don't love me, my extended family have always had their own lives.

I feel so touch-starved, I love hugs but I haven't had one in forever. I don't feel like I'll ever be able to date and be loved and be in a relationship, ever, and it makes me sad.

The only non-platonic experience I've ever had in my life has been sexual harassment and non consensual touch from classmates, healthcare workers/doctor, molestation and leering by strangers and uncomfortable behaviour from my family members.

I guess being a freak and homebody who is detached from the world prob doesn't help...

People constantly misunderstand me,no one likes me, no one cares about me and I don't blame them bc like you can't blame people for not liking you. That's your own fault and nothing to blame on others. Doesn't change the way I feel about it cause everything seems pointless when every day you realise that everyone thinks that you're the lowest scum on earth. I cant handle it anymore. I'm tired. I keep thinking some pretty dark things and Idk it's just not right. Whining has never helped anyone but loneliness fucks you up that's why I'm here"
1065,"I just want it to be over. I wish that I could drink something delicious that would painlessly stop my heart. I've tried to kill myself twice before, and both times ended up in a psych ward. Will not do that again. It's unreal to me that we aren't allowed to legally decide when we want our life to be over. It's all just drudgery. I cannot think of one thing that I'm looking forward to. I just want to be done with it all but I have to just wait for it to be over. It's like being forced to sit through a long, shitty play with bad actors, awful music and mediocre writing.

Sunlight can be a cruel thing. A bath feels impossible, i dread it. I need to get both every day, i have realised.

A good meal as soon as you can. I had a cheese and lettuce roll today and lots of cereal and toast. This is ok i think. I also opened a carton of juice and that means 2 of my 5-a-day. It isn't great, but good enough for now. 

Fresh out of the bath, i feel human again. Being smelly and dirty makes you feel worse. A clean nightdress and clean sheets are so nice. I don't change everything in one go, i do pillowcases one day, sheet another and duvet cover another. I think the pillow cases are the most important. 

I still feel :low: and :cry: and :sleepy2:.

Next month we have pumpkins and scared cat. Comfort food. I will bake a pumpkin pie. I might make hot apple cider. Jacket potatoes. Hot chocolate and marshmallows. 

Then fireworks, a twinkling light to remind you that there are some nice things in the world, a bit of something beautiful to make you glad you are alive. It breaks through the dark clouds. 

Then Christmas. Get the family stuff over fast and then enjoy all the things that are nice. The tree lights are soothing in the evenings.

1071,"Hello,

        My apologies if this is in the wrong section. I have a friend who suffers from depression and I try to support them as best as I can. It gets rather difficult though. I can say that their mood swings get pretty draining on me. I'm their only friend but when they go through a shift, so to speak, they completely shut me out. At this point, it has been a week since we talked, other than a little friendly message that I'll send and the reply is always short or just a happy face. It is so weird though, I mean, just a couple days prior, they were thanking me for how much I mean to their life (via a FB post as they are awkward with saying things directly) They also asked me if I thought they could have a pretty severe mood disorder, I answered as honestly as I could. 

           They are pretty suicidal (two attempts that they have told me about this year) and it seems lately they are down more than they are up. There is a lot of mental exhaustion on their part from different stresses in their life. Childhood trauma, rape, issues with their ex making parental responsibilities difficult, work, feels invisible, etc. In this particular instance, they had an argument with some people online, then decided they wanted to purposely dive into their past to see where things went wrong, then a conversation reminded them of how they never had any emotional support growing up. 

           A few weeks ago, my friend's sister sent me a screenshot of a comment that she wanted me to be aware of where my friend was saying that she wanted to unfriend me but didn't have the stones to actually tell me and there were a few minor lies as to the nature of our relationship. Basically they were planning to ghost me. Then all at once, my friend turned around and started messaging me and as mentioned above, the post about how much value I have in their life. A pretty drastic shift in how they feel. I'm not sure how relevant it is, or useful, but this person is also an ex of mine, which is one reason why we do have a close connection. So now in addition to the usual anxiety of being worried about them, there is now the anxiety of wondering if they are going to actually ghost me this time. 

            Unfortunately, they will not go into any sort of therapy as they believe having pills shoved at you is not helpful in the least. I can understand that, especially when it would be more efficient to really get to the root of issues to help heal. I can't even ask how they are doing for two reasons, the answer is always ""I'm fine"" and it agitates them to be asked."
1072,Hi everyone I don't know what to do and it's driving me crazy. I need some advice please help me. I am at an age where I should know what I want by now. I know what I would like to be and have but these things are not possiable so I don't know where to go from here. I can't take much more of sitting here with no hope and feeling like I'm going to lose my mind. I need something to keep me occupied but here is the problem. I get benefits if I find a job I'm afraid I will mess that up. I'm not sure if I can even hold down a job. I'm not too well and have a problem leaving my home. I have panick attacks anxiety and depression along with ocd. I need something to do but I don't know what. I have a hard time sticking to anything. I start something than lose interest in it. Please any ideas suggestions I will appreciate so much. Thanks!💓

1074,This is my first post.have had recurrent depression for past 25years. Going through a bad one at the moment.
1075,i wonder if my family would care if i went missing on this trip since they ignore me and seem to not listen or don't care about me i doubt they'll care if i went missing
1076,"I have struggled for the last 27 years with on and off depression, and have been medicated for this. My most recent episode has lasted about 3 years and is still ongoing, I am currently on 60mg of fluoexetine however my mood is terrible and I honestly don’t care if I live or die. I’m not actively suicidal but see no hope and find no joy in life. I don’t know if there is any medication that can be added to my current prescription to help. But I wonder if I have extreme depression due to the length of time I have lived with it. I wondered if it could be bipolar disorder, but rarely experience the highs so am unsure of a diagnosis. Has anyone any ideas or guidance. TIA"
1077,I am glad i am not a baby who has just been born. What a mess.
1078,Sometimes I really get bored of doing the same things week by week. Don't know. Is it my lack of interest in doing things? Is it just how things work? I just feel bored of life as a whole. I just don't know what I'm really experiencing.

1080,"Cutting off painful thoughts/emotions and the dimension of time

Time is a very powerful and huge concept. It's something to appreciate and be grateful for too. It's something to take advantage of and not abuse. But time also has huge benefits in regard to mental health, how so?

People who are depressed, financially anxious or for whatever reasons can run around for years and dwell in their problems and thoughts. But take a look at the world. Look at a huge stable, robust building operating an established business running like a well oiled machine.

Buildings and stable businesses have a lot of time in it. Time was taken to build it. Time was taken to learn the necessary knowledge to establish the business. Time, sweat, tears and whatever. Year by year the place is running well and people come every day for work or whatever. The place even shelters them from storms.

So how does this relate to painful thoughts/emotions/depression? No body likes to feel them...

Well, If my neighbor gave me a gift of some nice food last week, and I've been running around today looking for food, I'm hungry and I've got thousands of thoughts running through my head what would the smart thing to do be?

Answer: GO TO WHAT IS ESTABLISHED. Time and effort was taken to give me that gift. If I am grateful I will be nourished by that gift and my painful thoughts and emotions stop immediately. I didn't need to look elsewhere as what I needed was with me.

Gratitude is a big word. When we are grateful, burdens drop from our chests. The more you go to what is established, the quicker you come out of pain. Sometimes we get in our own way though and become our own enemies."
1081,I'm starting to get into the state where my hygiene is slipping. I'm starting to just not shave or brush my teeth on the weekends. When I have to work I'm pretty good but sometimes I forget. I'm starting to not even take my meds. Can anybody else relate?
1082,"I mean, do anyone feel like everything you say or do
Is a Problem to everyone? 
It don't have to be a problem but it still is.
I try to discuss something with my family, I'm a Problem 
I'm discussing something with my husband & tell him what I really meant if I explaining something 
I'm  ""justifying"" everything. Which gets me emotionally flustered because I'm tired of being told that over & Over. & that's never my intention. I feel effortless because when I'm on the ship with everyone tryna be the Happy Spirit nobody sees. But as soon I start to feel emotional it's a Big problem. How to deal with this? I'm struggling with my emotions TERRIBLY because I could've never expressed how I felt to my parents growing up. it affects me in everything. Everytime if I'm just tryna speak to my husband & he keeps telling me how I am when I'm not, it gets me teary eyed. I feel really FED up. Is like I cant control the urge to cry. Sometimes I feel like I don't even want to speak again. If I decide to Channel out my energy into pen & Paper my husband says I'm Childish & that pisses him off. Like I don't know how to feel anymore. I feel like I'm bound to listen to EVERYONE & not have a Independent view for myself.😪😪 it is always seen as ""I'm just a point prover"" when that is not/never,  Again, I'm saying it, my intentions. Anyone feels the same?😔"
1083,"Only time will tell. A caravan of masked pain and anguish. There is only so much isolation and the willful lack of contact one could take before you lose your whole reality to some sadist's dream. Some virgin pining for lost love or no reciprocation. It's not fun to bitch and complain anymore. Theres a point where it only goes lower and lower. Its not fun daydreaming about the things in life you dont have. Itsnot fun to fantasize about even the crudest and basic form of sexual imagery (repression?) Society spits us out if we dont follow the norm or the average.  The mediocrity of all souls heading towards death. In terror we flee towards Pleasure and Pain. And the hot wings of Eros beat against the tortured dawn. I've nothing to express other than the sheer depth of twisted emotions that runs deep like the dam that broke years ago. I'm sorry for all the lost souls, the ones that were cast away, forgotten, unforgiven. This pain is only a radio. You can defy your own strength with self-sabotage. You should never reach the depth of my nervous breakdown. You should never read the signs left on all the faces. Faves I cant remember anymore. Theres only vague scenes and pictures left. Is it fair to wander these dusty halls alone? Is it a wonder we are capable of such violence? Sex does not mean a thing anymore, just animalistic convulsions. Even the fact of depression doesnt seem to make me feel a thing. Not at all. A void of being. A black hole. All these things, illusions, semblances,the taste of love...they dont mean a goddamn thing anymore. I find I only have my spirit to console my inconsolable mind. Death greets me with a smile. A better life awaits elsewhere. Anywhere but in the stagnation of the present."
1084,The last few nights I slept well. Then I woke up feeling anxious and a low mood starts during the afternoon. I've tried everything over the last several months and I still struggle a lot. I haven't felt myself since this started. The next step is to go for help again soon. I didn't really get anywhere when I went before. Hopefully this time I can get some help.
1085,I am having a hard day feeling really depressed and sad. I was talking to  someone on the phone I wanted to tell her how I am feeling but I know what her answer would be. I love her but she says hurtful things about my depression anxiety etc. I think it a shame we can't talk to people we love about these subjects. She doesn't want to even educate herself about this she thinks I can snap out of it. Don't fight hard enough etc. Really sad.

I have had things said to me by people who I thought were close such as ‘ you are too ugly for a boyfriend
I got rejected by someone who I liked for a while and it may seem pathetic but it’s 8 months on and I’m not over it. I’ve struggled with jobs as I put my all in and then have a break down / get burnt out .
As of now I have no jobs , hardly any friends and no relationship . I’m scared to put myself out there because of past rejections. Can anyone relate or offer any advice?"
1087,I have been looking at another site that talked about the outstanding success of lithium orotate and was interested in others opinions on it....also what worked for them...possibly as natural as possible....i know we are all different and take this into consideration.
1088,"I have always tried to punch above my weight when it comes to hobbies and work.   I see something that is generally considered difficult to do.  Something in which I might have little natural ability and then try to do it.  For example, languages were far my worst subject at school, but yet over the last few years, I have been trying to learn German, which not a particularily easy language to learn.  I have got to an intermediate stage, but find it hard to be motivated beyond that.  I am interested in different ways of learning a language, but get very little enjoyment out the doing the learning.

I could list other things as well, but they are all things for which I have little or no natural ability and  do not enjoy doing.  In fact they can make me depressed.  Sometimes when I force myself to do them, tears of pain start to stream down my cheeks.

Has anybody had the same compulsion?  Most of the things I try such as learning a foreign language are considered something to be admired by most people and I suppose I get some fulfillment out of acheiving some progress with them, but sometimes I think it is just a waste of time and they are not doing my mood any good.  Any thoughts?"
1089,"Today #worldsuicidepreventionday is trending on social media. People are posting photos of them looking their best and then write a long caption about how they actually are struggling. 

Who is this day really for? 

This week I have had a very bad relapse in my mental health and have had suicidal thoughts that have incapacitated me more than in the past. I struggle to ask for help and I do not like opening up to the people around me. I feel disgusting having people know that I'm struggling. 

So I wanted to browse the hashtag and maybe find something there. There were mostly posts of what I mentioned before. Then something's urging people go reach out to their friends to check on them. A few about not losing hope to.

Who is this day directed at? People who don't know that suicide is an issue?"

I don't have anyone who I can tell. In fact most people close to me would hurt me in some way if I told them (call the police, tell me it's my fault for being sad, not want to be friends).

But I start to obsess over it in my head and I can't let these thoughts go. I just ruminate over being able to tell someone and hang on to them so I can't heal and move past it. It's a complete obsession and I'm looking for help on things I can do to get rid of it in my head."

1095,"I really don't know how to start writing this, one part out of shame and the other because it hurts (English is not my strong suit, a thousand apologies if it loses sense)
The reality is that I have been with my partner for more than a year and I can't take it anymore, I don't have the energy to continue. We argue once a week, everything is always my fault, he denigrates me in his jokes, we have sex even if he doesn't want to (because if I say no, it's to argue). No matter how he treats me, it is always my fault, and he believes that with material objects the wounds are fixed, he says that he loves me and then while I cry for something he said or did, he stares at the cell phone and tells me that I am playing the victim.
Obviously it has its good things, but those good things don't justify the bad ones, I don't have more energy.
I do not dare to leave the relationship, I fill my head with comments that I will not find anyone better and partly I am afraid because all my relationships were bad.
My family and friends don't want it. In fact, I left friends for him.
I know the answer is simple, and I should just quit, but for whatever reason, I can't.
I know there are worse problems and but I really don't know what else to do.
I live depressed, I live justifying it ...
Thanks to those who took the time to read it."
1096,"My boyfriend of almost 4 years broke up with me about 4 weeks ago. I did see it coming, he has done it a few months prior this break up, too. 

I know, for a fact, he suffers from a depression. A bad one, too. He has told me how unhappy he was, not just with me but in his life in general, how he does not want to socialise with people at all, how he cannot sleep at night and feels that nothing makes him happy anymore. He told me on a few occasions that the reason for our break up is that he simply cannot see a future with me anymore, and that he is done with us. He also started working like crazy to get distracted. 

Then he went on to say how the things he loved to do are just not as exciting anymore, he basically said he feels lifeless. He even considered running away from here and moving someplace else. When I said he looks like he is doing just fine, moving on and doesn't seem to care all that much, he went nuts and said he is really not doing well, that he feels empty and sad without me and that I cannot ever understand it because I think he doesn't care about me, which is absolutely not true. He says he wished to stop feeling guilty because that's how he feels all the time and that that's how I always make him feel. He declared how much he still loved me but that there was no chance of being together ever again. 

It sounds so tragic in my ears. He admits the negative feelings are just all within him but he refuses to believe it has anything to do with any mental illness. That is the hardest part. For me, our friends and family, it is picture perfect clear that he is going through a major depression, yet he will not admit it! He's also had a really rough childhood when both of his parents abandoned him, and then screwed him up many times throughout his life, to the point where he has not talked to one of them for many many years and feels nothing for them. He was a little closer to his dad, and it crushed him when he died about a year ago. Since then, things started changing for the worse.

After all the ""I still care, I love you, blah blah"" he went on to say how he gave up on me, that there was no chance we would get back together right now. Not in the future, because he of course doesn't know what is going to happen in the future. But for now, he really cannot see himself in a relationship with me. It isn't what he wants, and it doesn't make him happy. (But then I guess nothing does) He even said it isn't just me, that his old friends don't make him happy either. 

He repeatedly said he really gave up on us. I have never heard him say it like this before. I thought I would be strong enough to handle it but Baron, I am crushed and heartbroken and as much as I want to pretend to be okay, I am waaay to far from it. I cannot imagine losing this guy, I care about him so much it physically hurts. I just want to make all the bad things go away so that he is happy again. 

He also gave me all of my stuff back. And I don't mean just things like electronics and so on, I mean EVERYTHING. Even small things like toothbrush, used up conditioner, stuff that HE bought for me for his place, he gave me everything back. It is like to say : ""to hell with you, I decided I really really don't want you in my life anymore, in any way or any form, get out!"" and that's the most painful part. He just shut me out like never before. 


BUT then he said he would actually still like to have me in his life, but it was such a lifeless statement, I didn't know what to say. That we could meet every now and then. But he knows it isn't up to him to decide. He just wants us to be friends. When he actually doesnt feel like having friends.... so, ehm... what now?

I have tried everything with this guy. I would have gone to the moon and back for him to make him happier, or to stay with me and work through these things. Now I am left with not only losing my best friends, but losing my best friend in such a shitty fashion. 

I wanted to stay here and be his support, but I dont think I can anymore. It hurt me so much. I dont even know how I am ever going to look at him and pretend we are friends. We are not. You screwed up. Big time. 

Is this normal for somebody who is going through depression, or am I just looking for something that can ease my pain and make him look like a little bit less of a monster in my eyes after everything he has said to me??? 

If it indeed is a depression talking, what am I supposed to do? He wont get treatment because he will never admit he is depressed!!! I am so lost. I feel like I should just give up, too. I am slowly slipping into the dark place myself, I am tired and weary and this has exhausted me so much."
1097,"Hi.

Aye...it's deathly silent, again. The only sound is from my PC keyboard. Loneliness is a killer...I'm sure of it. Aloneness is supposed to strengthen us. I'm pretty certain that, when it changes to loneliness, we're on borrowed time. Well, I've been in this situation many hundreds of times in the last 45ish years. You'd imagine, easily, that...having such experience with it, I'd have a ready-to-run strategy, to combat it. I haven't.

- There are some people who are known to be as a group of pixels on my screen. That's nothing like as valuable to have somebody to call a friend and who talks on the phone, instead.

- There are some people who are known to me as pseudo-friends, who never phone me, or E Mail me.  They need a lesson in being alone to the same degree that I suffer from.

- There are family members who always wait for me to phone them...I've probably not lost anything by no longer phoning them.  I've no time for those with no time for me.

Sometimes, I think that Fate has something in mind for me, but, at my age, I have to say Fate is taking its sweet-a$$ time showing it to me.

Did you ever feel that Creation was making you alonely and lonely, for a reason?
If you did...did you ever find out, or encounter, the actual reason?

I've just had a 15 minutes chat, on the phone, with ""SilverLine"".  24 hours a day + no special qualifications needed for those speaking to you, it's 24-7, and it's (wait for it!) FREE!

I'm not joking, either!  

I only discovered them last year (or, the year before) in fact. UK, only, though. They prefer calls lasting 10 minutes. I was lucky, I suppose, because I got 15 minutes. I wish it was an hour per call and I wish it was the same person I speak to, every call.

It's nice, sometimes, to speak to ordinary people who just talk, and encourage, etc.. The problem is that, for me, I'd need around 10 calls a day and you get a different person to talk to, every time you call. That might not be your thing, I realise. I just want folks to know that they are there - I should've mentioned them to you last year, instead. I just didn't think. One problem is that, when I've dialled and I hear the person say ""Hello,"" I just freeze and forget how to start. Not much good, I think. I'll phone them a good few times and try to figure out whether or not they will continue to be a good idea. 

I look forward to sleep, to be frank...it's my only escape from loneliness! I wish you all well and that you never have to feel this loneliness. Shove some prayers my way, if you find the time and have the inclination...I could certainly use some prayers, at the moment.  Goodnight, and blessings! :)

1098,my x is finally sorting the divorce out we haven't been together for 5 yrs n we still talk but it's needed I was determined I wasn't doing it not because I wanted reconsilation but I was determined he has found new luv n I'm happy about that mayb this will be a turning point for me as well x

1100,"For as long as I can remember, I've been single, except for 1-2 relationships, in which I gave more than the other side... Until recently, I didn't pay much attention to this, because I always believed that I would find my soulmate. I look at the people around me and they all are in relationships except me. I'm very sad and afraid for myself since I feel that the loneliness and fear have shattered me. I'm afraid that I'm not the same calm and cheerful person anymore.. I attend sessions with a specialist, but it is crucial for me to hear your opinion on this issue and get advice from you, because I really need it...

I've always used my social media accounts primarily for fun and to keep in touch with my friends. However, unfortunately, I began comparing myself to the people who have relationships and the amount of followers/friends they have. I tell myself, ""How do you think you're going to find your Person when you don't have many friends on social media? If you have a lot of followers, only then, there is probably a chance for you to be noticed by someone."" I can't express how extremely exhausting and destructive on my mental health this is. Even though I know people who have met on social networks and yet don't have many followers....

Also, I've never been a party person and I didn't like big companies. I have some good friends, but no companies. I don't have boy friends who could become anything more. I'm not a shy or socially anxious person, there are just people who like to be among many people, but there are also those who don't like and I'm from the second one. Therefore, I constantly torture my mind with questions like ''Should I change myself completely? Should I start forcing and pushing myself among companies with more people, even though it will make me feel uncomfortable and not good? Is that the only solution and key for finding My Person?''

When it comes to dancing or social hobbies, unfortunately, the things I like to do aren't social and at the moment, there is nothing new I would like to try. Should that terrify me? Does this really mean that I'm doomed to never meet my partner in life? I am afraid that I live my life wrongly, dooming myself to loneliness and unhappiness. But do I really have to change who I am? Isn't it important to stay true to who you are? Should I start forcing myself to get a lot of followers, push myself into companies, and go to activities that aren't interesting to me, just because those are the ways to find a boyfriend? I really feel awful and desperate, as if I am in a huge black hole, from which there is no escape and no light ..."
1101,"I have been trying to think of what to say how to explain how I feel. I know everyone has problems I have heard all the answers but they don't work for me. Every day I feel so ashamed of myself of I hate the way I have ended up. I feel like I don't even deserve to be alive. I'm wasting my life away the sad part is I can't seem to change anything. How why did I come to this? I am not the person I used to be I have no friends don't even know if I want any. No education was bullied in school I dropped out big mistake. I have lost interest in trying to get my diploma. No job I did have a career in mind but didn't have the nerve to pursue it. I don't know if I can work now I'm older and not well. Have a difficult time going out anyway. I wish I had pursued my dream had children a home of my own a husband. Everyday I wake up to a lonely exinstance no hope no nothing. I fear the future, my life stinks. There is no answer nothing and no one can help me because I have to help myself and I can't."
1102,"I'm a 21 year old female who happens to have somatic forms of depression which I found are more common in men. I don't think I have any hormonal issues because it has been happening for years. I have tendency to act out and can be quick to anger. Is there validity to how I react to depression despite being pigeon holed to feel otherwise? I also have BPD traits so that can be way I have different symptoms. Plus, I do get chronic pain and frequent headaches during or after a depressive episode. Thoughts?"
1103,"Recently, I've stopped playing guitar completely. Last time I played it was last weekend and now I can't play it at all without putting it back down. I recently decided that I wanted to switch hands because I was tired of playing with my right instead of my left. I play air guitar with my left-hand so should I be playing that hand instead, it's my natural hand after all? I just can't play it without feeling depressed somehow, like I have no energy to play anymore. I don't know what it is but it's just knowing I sound like total crap and wishing I had that energetic spirit most guitar players have. Plus, I don't even feel connected to the instrument anymore and have recently thought of switching to bass guitar, but then I would need a left-handed bass if I decide to switch hands. Music has always been a passion of mine but after realizing I haven't been on the right path, now it's a pain in the neck. Now, I just don't play at all because it gives me anxiety. Same with singing, I feel like my emotional health has only made my voice worse due to yelling and screaming. I actually enjoy singing for the fun of it but now it's just fear inducing because I hate the way I sound. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this because I'm ready to just give up completely. I only have energy to sleep and cry, I honestly wish I was joking.

I also like to paint and draw but I can't seem sum up the courage to express myself without wanting to cry. I just can't do anything anymore without wanting to go back to sleep or cry. I'm done being creative because I'll just make a fool of myself and it won't even be as good as it was in my mind's eye. Don't try to do something creative, it'll only drive you crazy. I don't do anything creative anymore because all it does is make me anxious."
1104,"So, since at least high school, 99.9% of the time absolutely no plans, parties, events will take place or happen unless I text, make plans first. I am talking in regards to probably close to a hundred people and hundreds of cases. 

Throughout high school, I was the popular one.. always drinking, going to parties etc etc but back then it was just a free for all and everyone knew where everyone was going type thing. However, if I wanted to meet up with someone for a coffee, go to a movie..this would never ever happen unless I message first and then half the time I would get "" Oh, I will let you know"". 

This is even more prevalent now. I am mid 30s, and going on for at least since high school. I have a lot of friends, including a lot of close friends that confide in me etc etc and I have very good social skills (Yes, I am anxious as all hell in social situations but I have no trouble having conversations and getting on with ppl) Almost always, this is just a "" one off"" never do I actually ""make friends"" these days so the cycle continues...basically, I am just getting on with the ppl in the event/situation and that is the end of that when it is finished. 

I am talking about hundreds of cases and probably more than 50 people, including friends where they NEVER EVER message me first and then if i do, it is usually a "" will let you know"" or "" we will see"" or "" sure, give us a message closer to the time and I will see what I am doing"" (excuse me, what.. am I like the backup plan in case whatever else you might be doing falls through? why don't you say yes and that plan can be the back up plan?) I am talking hundreds of cases here. 

Ok, so i get it, I am at the age where people have kids, families etc etc but half these ppl I am talking about do not have any commitments. I am single, have no commitments and yes, my self esteem sucks but I am actually a really good communicator, makes sales at work (nerve wracking) and troubleshoot machines leaving the customer wanting to ""put in a good word to my manager"" type thing. I even overhear colleagues saying that "" xxx is a real superstar here, there is absolutely nothing to fault him for""

Bearing in mind, I do not like myself and crippled with nausea, depression, anxiety 24/7 and is not letting up, so I feel that is a great feat. NOW..here is the current situation.. I moved to another country 2 years ago to get out of the rut and move somewhere new, fresh and a new beginning as my depression and anxiety were at crippling levels and I had always wanted to travel..so i bit the bullet and left before I was too old for the Working Holiday Visa. Now.. ever since I am in the new country... the EXACT same thing is happening in terms of friends (WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME!) This includes a new girl that I met online prior and we hung out and did a lot of things for a year or so.. and I am not joking, i don't think there was one time where she messaged first. I even have an old school friend living here, he did acknowledge I was here but again, NEVER EVER messages me unless I do and now with the way I am feeling in terms of anxiety, depression.. I do not have the energy to make the plans ( but I probably would if someone actually asked me) 

That comment about me being a superstar at work, was here in a new country, I am able to continue everything even overseas so WHY THE HELL DO I HAVE NO FRIENDS HERE and basically any social interactions are with the cafe baristas, clients at work, work colleagues and wherever shop/business i may go to.. I an hear ppl say "" join a club"" or "" a gym"" etc etc.. well this is the same thing, a) I am super sick plus ya know COVID, also this issue has nothing to do with COVID but happening for at least 15 years) No-one ever actually starts a conversation with me, unless I do first and I am getting really depressed about all of this. 

The latest issue is slightly different, with that girl i mentioned, she is by far the most useless at messaging and just won't - despite us becoming the best of friends like a year ago.. yet I know she hangs out with other people and is often quite active.. This makes me feel like shit, been discarded and basically sets the course for all the other times over the years.. is this actually what has been happening over the years in all the hundreds of cases.. am i that horrid that noone wants to hang out with? I suspect not, but WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING WRONG. 

As you can probably tell this is troubling me and i apologise for the super long rant but I need to get this off my chest as this is actually getting rather crippling. I am kinda lonely in this city.. which to be fair I like being by myself but i need a good balance right.. but it appears I am not able to do so for whatever reason and this is only the tip of the iceberg right... hundreds of cases and possible reasons but there seems to be one common theme... ME."
1105,Can a severe depression cause someone to hear voices? Mine are just sleep related and I'm told it's normal by several mental health professionals. What concerns me is it's about every night. I don't think that's normal.
1106,"i don't know whats wrong with me, recently i've been thinking a lot of what i do want to do with my life in the future, which job i want to do, but nothing comes to my mind, most of time i spend the days in front of my computer
doing literally nothing and i have lack of motivation to do anything. i used to play games when i got home and now i don't even feel like it, a thing that i like to do, but no motivation to do it, its so annoying. i thought about getting a job as game developer, but i don't have motivation to start learning as well

unfortunately i can't afford a psychologist at the moment, i went to a pshychologist already but it was due to my social
anxiety, but now it seems that i'm getting into a depression, or at least feels like it.

is there something i can do at home? since i start to feel very anxious, i'm more comfortable at home"
1107,"I’m new to this forum but thought I’d give it a go as a desperately need some advice. To cut a very long story short, my husband left me in January due to severe depression where he was extremely suicidal. I was 3 weeks away from giving birth to our 6 child at this point. This came out of nowhere and I never had any clue in the slightest that he was suffering from depression and was going to leave. We have been together 10 years and what I thought and what he still says is that we always had a good marriage. When he left it was my suggestion that he take a break for the weekend at his family members house so he could have a break from all the kids. He never returned. He stated that he wanted to get better before our daughter was born so he could return home.
That never happened and he just went downhill to the point he was saying he doesn’t think he loves me or the kids anymore and he would go weeks without seeing me and the kids, ignore phone calls/texts, switch his phone off etc. One minute he ended us then he said no we are still together he just can’t see himself getting better.
 It was a real rollercoaster of emotions but after months of changes of medication, seeing counsellors/doctors etc, he is finally at at point where he constantly says he loves me and the kids and does want our family but he’s just still struggling as he just wants to be alone all the time. 
We made a plan that he would move back in this September when all the kids return to school and in the upcoming weeks to then he would start staying over occasionally and then just build it up to full time. So he has stuck to his word and when we are together it is really nice.
However, since he left I have struggling a lot. I had to raise our newborn alone as well as our 5 other children, came down with post natal depression due to the whole situation and then lockdown happened so I was just isolated with the children for months so my depression got so severe that I tried taking my own life but it failed. I just felt like everything was happening one thing after another and because it came so out of no where I have really struggling to understand how he could just leave me to deal with everything alone. We have spoke about all this and he does understand my thoughts on it all and has continuously apologised. Doesn’t stop me feeling hurt though and I do feel like I’m the one still holding us together and trying to do everything to make it easy for him when none of this has been easy for me. I just want my husband and my life back and I just feel like I’m in limbo. I have never wanted to leave my husband throughout this whole 7 months as I do know he struggling a lot. However, I do have a little resentment that when I was at my lowest point I still had to try and pick myself and look after my kids as much, as I wanted to run away I didn’t. 
I just really wondered if anyone has been in a similar situation or how they deal with depression in a marriage etc. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you."
1108,My rut causes depression
1109,Any one want to chat?. Just need someone to talk to been at home with 2 kids for 5 months now. My husband works all week as he's a front line worker. I'm just getting to the stage where I feel super lonely. I have friends but since this whole situation I hardly hear from them.. And I really don't want my depression to get the better of me again!!!
1110,"Hard to get going in the morning
Feel hot all the time
Need a glass of wine to ease the aches
No appetite - should i force myself to eat what i usually would eat?
Hard to get out in the morning, go anywhere, speak to anyone - but surely that is good?
Not spending all of my money straight away - that is good :)
Quiet
Cheer up love, it might never happen :curseyou: - looking like it did happen
Exercise and fresh air is good!
Not washed hair in days. Should do it now but i don't want to get my head wet or have wet hair.

1111,"The NHS agency 'NICE' has rejected the adoption of Esketamine for the second time, saying it is uncertain how effective it is considering the cost. The problem is that I don't know how they are ever going to get data on it unless they do some trials

I think it was first approved in the USA about 18 months ago; I don't know about the rest of Europe.

I have to admit that since it first became available in the USA, there hasn't been a great number of reports saying how good it is / is not. Strangely silent!

Of course, if you have lots of money, you can get it privately in the UK from NHS hospitals!!!

Depressing!"
1112,my therapist told me to txt her if things didn’t improve well they didn’t so I txted her that was 2 or 3 weeks ago. Tonight I want to txt her I’m not doing good and I’m having some thoughts but scared to txt her bc I don’t want to bother anyone?
1113,"... or maybe I'm just in a mood or tired. I've been doing pretty well for some months but I just got hit with this feeling of how boring and empty my life is. I really don't do much at all and haven't for years. I've just started replying to some jobs online, hoping that could help me out of my rut. 

I've been quite ill at times in the past, making this current experience almost trivial by comparison, but there is still something not right about it all. Too much free time probably. Hope I can get some work. Take the mind off moping."
1114,I want to not exist right now. Life is just super hard and I’m struggling to find the point.
1115,"One day where I feel grateful for waking up and being alive, one day where something in my brain doesn't suddenly go wrong in the middle of the day and ruins the rest of it for me, one day where I don't feel sad and I'm at peace with myself and my past. That's all I wish for at this point. Nothing else matters until I can find it in myself to smile and feel real happiness, or at least something positive about life. I'm so sick of feeling sad every day and I don't want to feel guilty for still being here. I want to be proud of myself for surviving until now and keep going without getting urges to punish myself. 
While I know that depression is mostly caused by chemical imbalances in the brain and genetics, I also think that not being able to come to terms with past suffering plays a major part in why I can't find some peace. I woke up a while ago feeling ready to forgive people who hurt me, intentionally or not, for things that I believed I wouldn't ever let go of. I still don't think that I'll ever forget them or that I won't feel sad remembering them. I just need those things not to be at the front of my mind every single day, I need to sort them far away so that I can focus on the good things, even if it feels impossible to see them. I need to forgive people, as I can't keep fighting anymore without finding some sort of closure. I want to forgive myself too, for letting myself get hurt and hurting people in turn, for abusing myself and never feeling good enough, for telling myself every day that I deserve suffering and that I shouldn't even think of healing and for all the self sabotage. I don't know how much forgiveness and true acceptance can help me to heal. If it gives me the slightest sense of peace, I'm ready to forgive everyone and really work on moving on. 
Even if I can't fully recover, I want to feel relief from the pain and I want to stop feeling like I don't deserve it. I want to wake up in the morning and be glad that I'm breathing instead of hating it. 
I'm sorry for venting, just needed to put all that out there to clear my head a little bit. Next step will be talking to the people I had problems with and I'm still in touch with. I need to actually make amends, not just pretend to be over it and wake up crying the next day. I hope forgiveness will help me get through one day without crying and not wanting to be here anymore. 
If anyone will actually read this annoyingly long post, thank you."
1116,"is it possible to be so deeply depressed you become paranoid, like something or someone is following you, or hearing and seeing things that aren't there?"
1117,"The last 4 years have been the worst of my life and everytime I think I can see a light, something else happens and knocks me back again. 
It started when my stepfather passed suddenly, followed the next day by my best friend, also suddenly. For 3 years I tried to hold down a full time job while caring for my disabled mum who lived 100 miles away. During this time, my family lost too many aunts, uncles and cousins. I also lost another very close friend. I had a breakdown January 2019 and then I lost my job of 23 years in the July. My biological father passed away and then my lovely mum in November. Thought I was getting it back together and covid came on the scene. My husband then got made redundant. Now, and it may seem minor to some, our closest friends have split up. I'm devastated for them, they've been together for 26 years and seemed ideal together, but I'm also, selfishly, gutted for my husband and I. As a foursome we did so much together and had so much fun. We could all talk to each other about anything and it feels like another bereavement. I feel lost yet again. I'll be there for both of them for whatever they need, but I just can't get over it feeling like another death/loss in my life and I've just had enough of bad news all the time. Not just in my life but also the outside world. It feels like we're going to hell in a hand cart here in the UK and all the lights are going out in my life. Sorry for the long post, I needed to get it off my chest."
1118,I know I'm depressed I have been feeling really down the last three days. I just am so unhappy every day is the same. Nothing to look forward to. I miss someone who I can't make love me. Únrequited love hurts bad. I'm tired but too depressed to brush my teeth and go to bed.
1119,The last couple days I didn't have any trouble sleeping. Tonight I felt tired and slept for a few hours. When I tried going back to sleep I started having really vivid dreams. Now I can't get back to sleep. 😔
1120,"Hi,

So basically I'm just gonna post my thoughts and feelings here when I've got no one else to talk to.

It's 1am atm and I don't have anyone up that I want to talk to about anything. I think I'm just a bit lonely yknow? At the moment I just feel a bit empty, almost like I'm on my own. I'm not sad as per say, just feel really lost and like I've got no emotion. The constant feeling of pressure won't go away in my chest and I just feel like it's never gonna end. I've lived with severe anxiety and OCD since I was 6, and it escalated to depression a few years ago.

It tends to come and go in waves, and people always say ""oh it'll get better"" and yeah sure, it does for maybe a few months or a year if I'm lucky, and then it comes back worse than before. And the cycle repeats. I've had therapy, it didn't work. Just kinda feels like I'm gonna be trapped in this constant cycle and it makes me think what's the point yknow?

Currently there's this girl... we've only been talking a couple of months and she's gone to France to work for a month. I like her a lot but I've convinced myself she doesn't give a shit about me. Every little message she sends I analyse and overthink, and then it affects my responses. She's starting to see how broken I am. This always happens, because when they realise whats under the cheerful exterior they just leave. I don't want it to happen this time. But it will. It always does 🤷🏻‍♂️.

There's something missing in my life and I don't know what it is. And I think that and feeling lonely is the driving force behind my anxiety and depression. But I have no way of knowing what it is that's missing and no way of finding out so I guess I'm stuck 🤷🏻‍♂️.

Anyways yeah, I don't expect anyone to read all that but there it is."
1121,"I was blocked with depression knowing I won't have what to eat. I oscilate between anger and depresion still because of how they talked to me. I fuchikg hate this depression
Than another things happened. I was reminded of a sexual assault I had.. and I found out this son of bitch taked shit about me to everyone around me.
Im done
I wanted to revenge on the entire world. Just fuck it"
1122,"is it normal for depression to make you act cold, distant, and try to push a loved one away?

To make a long story short, due to depression my girlfriend asked for us to take a break to pause our relationship. I gave her the space that she asked for, but she got angry over not hearing from me and said I made her feel alone. She asked that we continue to go on dates despite needing the break. 

During our first date since she asked for the break, although we had a good time, she was a bit distant and more quiet than usual. She called me ""babes"" twice and wants to go on another date. 

To continue to remain supportive, but at the same time give her some space, I still text her, but less than usual. Sometimes she responsive and very quick to text back, other times she's a bit distant and I feel like I have to carry the conversation."
1123,"I feel like I'm a terrible person. I hate this feeling, I have no motivation to change my life. I start something positive than lose interest. I feel bad because I have no education , am over weight, wasting my life away. I don't know why I can't seem to change things. I used to be active in my church I had friends went places . Now I'm a recluse hiding from the world. I have no desire to do anything  meds and therapy did not help. I'm afraid to go out I guess I have up on therapy and meds. I'm afraid I'm always going to be like this. I'm depressed and I wonder how I ended up like this."
1124,although I got a drink issue I'm back on meds n feeling ok which is a plus so glad to be back talkin to nice people who understand me
1125,I want to say thank you for this website. There are a lot of nice people here I feel like I have a place to go now. A place to be so thank you everyone.🦋♥️💚💜
1126,"Hello everyone, I wanted to share my story here, hoping that maybe someone will understand me. 

I am from Germany but in 2017 I went to Sydney to be an Au Pair for 6 months. On my last two days, I met my boyfriend. We've talked on the phone for a year until he came to visit me in 2018 and in 2019 I finally went back to Sydney to study there for two semesters. I have been back since may this year (earlier due to COVID) and I am really struggling with my mental health. I miss him and Sydney, I distanced myself a lot from my friends here and don't really see a purpose in my life at the moment. One huge challenge is that my parents don't know much about my life as I can't talk to them. They have Turkish roots and would not be okay with me dating someone with a different nationality, let alone be with someone that is not in the same country as me. I love Sydney and the big city feeling and it is my biggest dream to live there one day, but they would never understand and accept it. 

I am struggling to fall asleep, I wake up late, I eat one day a meal and spend most of my day in bed. In the past month, I maybe left the house 4-5 times. I feel very lonely and genuinely feel like I'm never going to be happy. 

My parents do realize that something is wrong with me and ask me if I'm okay but I can't talk to them anyway... 
I actually barely talk to them, because I am so angry to have this pressure on me on being 'good' child. It is so unfair that children in other families can make their own decisions and be their own person and others have to fight for it, while their family treats them like they are doing the worst thing ever...


At the moment I am looking for ways to make money online to be financially independent and hopefully move to Sydney with my parents as I know otherwise it's not going to work. 


I would love to hear your opinion, cause I really don't know what else to do."
1127,"i just want to end it i'm getting paranoid and my own family won't help me i feel like they are against me like my brother would hurt me but i know he wont even though he hates me, i can't take this anymore nothing is helping no amount of music, things that i felt gave me joy, relaxing baths that i can't enjoy anymore because i'm told i can't do it anymore, no walks, no medicine can help me because i just end up forgetting or they don't work, i'm lonely even if i live with my parents but they don't talk to me or they ignore me and forget i'm here, i'm never allowed to go anywhere by myself or stay home by myself even though im 24 i got to stay home once all by myself and it was almost tempting to do things or end my life but i didn't do it and i'm afraid thats what my life has become and i can't take it anymore i'm sad all the time i can't stay alive anymore or else i will go completely insane."
1128,"I'm feeling sad tonight and I'm not sure why that is, but I know there's no need to try and change it. It's not that unpleasant. It's something to stay with and pay attention to. 

Maybe you've seen the animated movie Inside Out. The main characters are emotions, and Sadness is misunderstood by the other emotions, and thought of as only a wet blanket. But in time it is shown how important Sadness was all along in helping us cope with loss and change and uncertainty. 

Sadness does not equal depression but is a prominent feature of it. I believe  sadness plays a big role in compassion, in empathy, in kindness and in love. Without this essential emotion, that we so often try to avoid feeling, our humanity takes a major step back. 

So I'm allowing myself to feel sad, even if I don't know the reason for feeling this way. It isn't self-pity. It isn't depression. I'm not sure what it is, but I'm glad it's there."
1129,"Hi, 
I'm just wondering if anyone's withdrawn off sertraline, and how they coped with it/side effects (what are the side effects I can expect?) etc...

Right now I feel like I'm on both ends of the scale, I can't sleep all day/night, but when I do doze off, I can sleep for 14 hours straight.

I've discussed this with the clinic I attend, I was on 150mg per day, I've decided to drop it to 100mg, it feels torturous with how I'm feeling at the moment.

Thanks"
1130,"I won’t go into detail. I’ve been in a toxic relationship for a while now, and while I was depressed when I initially met my boyfriend I got well - but I feel like he’s the cause now. We had a massive argument last night over me asking him to call me for five when I was upset over my fathers health, just for support.

I tried to talk to him about the way he was with me last night when I called him this morning, I was calm and considerate - no blaming. Told him how I felt and he told me I’d been talking too long (10 mins) on the phone and that he’d forgotten everything I’d said explaining my feelings and how we could go forward and also forgotten what he’d said last night - as his response. Is this just more manipulation? To get me calling, talking and trying to fix it to then just get told after ten mins he’s got nothing to say and doesn’t even remember what I said ten mins prior. Just makes me feel so upset, like what’s the point?
Is this toxic or am I just overreacting?"
1131,"Hey, I wonder how many of you who thinks that to overcome depression one has to work on many areas, not only on the mind (examples: nutrition, fresh air, gym, sleeping, social contacts and more). 


May be it can help the newly diagnosed with depression, to have broad perspective on depression? What do you think?"
1132,"This is my first time actively seeking out help so this is new to me. I just want a place where I can actually open up and don't feel pressured to put on a happy face. I know that people here probably have worse problems than I do, and I don't intend in any way to devalue other people's personal struggles here, but I just hate feeling so alone. 

I'm currently in school doing online classes and I just lose motivation the longer I sit there. I'm stuck in a really damaging cycle right now. I start off trying all these new strategies that are going to save me, but then I end up slowly quitting them and make up some excuse why I can't do it. I hate myself because I know that I can do it, but it's so much easier to put the blame on something else. After a while, I start looking up new strategies and start the cycle again. My grades slip and I hate myself even more because I know it's my own fault. I hate that I can hit a minor bump and I just lose all confidence in myself and fall further into the self-loathing.

I look at myself and I just see a failure already, I have this idea stuck in my head that I know I'm going to fail in life, so why try? I see myself in 20 years slowly dying in some desk job. I had a group of friends for a while that really helped me but slowly I cut myself off from each one of them and I'm too scared to try again. I know all of the issues I have could be solved if I just could gather some courage and ask for help, but I just can't get myself to do it. 

My parents are always pushing me to do better and have really high expectations of me. I'm too scared to ask them for help when I need it because I guess I don't want them to think less of me. Everything I've achieved feels empty because I feel like it wasn't my efforts that got me there, it was theirs. I just want so badly to accomplish something unique and meaningful for myself. 

I feel like I'm on a sinking island and I've burned all my bridges. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me vent."
1133,"Hey, im not entirely sure if this topic is best suited here but I thought id give it a shot :)

Me and my girlfriend have been together for a year and a half and there is nothing i wouldnt do for her I love her to bits and we are both uni students.
To put it bluntly without going into detail she has had the shittest deal in terms of shit happening to her in life that I have ever come across in person, from family to school to friends and financially it shocks me how she is still managing to sometimes have a smile on her face.
She was diagnosed with clinical depression in january this year and has been downhill ever since, she will cry every other night about how much she hates herself and self harms. She has had a change of drugs and they still don't seem to help much, she is very much trying to avoid getting therapy because she feels she wants to be on the right drugs before that happens but even then whenever i bring it up when it gets bad she refuses to talk to me about it.

She will breakdown and tell me how much I dont deserve to be in this situation and all but in my mind she has given me plenty of easy ways out if I felt it was going to be bringing me down but I love her and just want to be there for her.

It has gotten very bad in the last 2 weeks where she is getting really upset as she says she struggles to feel happy with me, she says she still loves me and ofc would hate to not be with me but cant seem to feel any happiness or love and it makes the relationship feel like its taking a toll on her which I hate of course.

It is made more tricky by the fact I am paying half of her rent and supporting her this way as she has gotten minimum loan and parents barely speak to her .

Honestly im not expecting anyone to be able to magically say something that will make this all sorted/better but I was just seeing if there was any advice you guys could give.
Thank you so much for reading !!"
1134,"hey peeps i seriously cant wait to die,
i look forward to it to see the hereafter to see if ve made it to heaven or hell

im looking forward to the whole journey

only thhing that scares me is if i end up in hell

anyone else looking forward to it?"
1135,"I feel like I'm suffocating. I have cruel voice in  my head that tells  me  I'm ugly, unloveable, weird, a freak, strange, not worth it. I don't know to keep surviving this. I messed up that thing with the girl so badly. My brain just tells me I'm a monster everyday and I should just be over this by now and that I am a clingy freak. it hurts so bad.  My life experience hurts already everything  that happened.And I know I am feeling sorry for myself and that i sound pathetic but that's how I feel. Everyone thinks I am a freak and should have gotten over it by now but I'm not. I'm not over it. I should   be. I  try to be  eeveerryday.  And god this hurts so  much. I really just want to die  and this is why.  I'm lonely really really lonely. it hurts so bad. I   am crying right now and  I  can't breathe.  I can't breathe.  rreally it hurts  so  much"
1136,"hey. so, latey, ive been noticing i dont really feel anything, but at the same time i can feel so sad or angry and overwhelmed. my emotions are all over the place and im not sure what i feel anymore, if i feel anything. i think that instead of accepting my emotions and actually allowing myself to feel, i just analyse and think about what and how i feel. if that makes sense, it might not, but i dont really know anymore. i can go from feeling nothing, to feeling like my whole life feel apart, then i go back to not really feeling anything except numb and sad. i try to tell my therapist, but i dont think she really understands what i try to say. maybe one of you might be able to help or tell me what might be happening. thank you for reading this though. <3"
1137,i can't seem to do this at the moment trying so hard to keep going I'm off work for a few days long bank holiday and thought it would help I've just spent practically 4 days pondering through my thoughts not done a thing I look a mess and feel a mess I had a call from my go this morning and I wasn't totally honest n could kick myself I'm trying not to fall to bits but I am struggling I know I need to find the good thoughts again but it feels so difficult n I then get mad at myself for having a pitty party I do have a counciling session this week on the phone but it's not the same but has to be at the moment
1138,"Heyy OK so since the whole virus I've been at home with my 2 kids and my depression has got bad. I'm literally slacking on everything. The problem is I have major OCD with my cleaning. And having both the kids home it just seems like a mammoth task now. My house isn't dirty things do get done but once a week I normally have a boost of energy and do a massive house clean just to freshen up everything, but since this I haven't had that at all and I'm stuck in a massive circle I get depressed cause there's mess but I don't have the energy to do anything so it gets left. Then back to square one again it makes me upset seeing all the crap.. So yesterday I had enough I actually wrote down a list of all the things I wanted to get done. And lo and behold today I am on it!! I feel pretty good today I'm taking breaks between cleaning each room and eating little but regular but it's getting done. I just thought id share this see if it helps anyone else!! It might or it might not.. However your feeling today I'm sending hugs and you can do this!! Together we are strong!!!!"
1139,I mentioned in another post I wrote that I have been feeling depressed. I have really been bothered lately about someone who went out of my life suddenly. I can cope with it sometimes. but sometimes I think about this person and I want to cry. Don't know what to do.🙄
1140,"So, hi - this might be a little long, but I’ll try to keep it short. Once again I’m sobbing, and I thought putting something online like this might reassure me others have had similar experiences or advice.

Long story short, I’ve known my current boyfriend for three years. At the start he was lovely, charming - so so caring, but slowly things started to change and go sour. I originally blamed myself as I had been in a depressive state three years ago and could have been difficult, perhaps I Irritated him and therefore deserved the way he was with me. He likes to remind me that others say he’s an amazing supporter so it’s just me with the problem. Largely, I am happy. But he gets himself in these awful moods... stubborn, nasty, impatient and uncaring at exactly the moments I need him the most. Always the same, I tell myself time and time again that I’ll leave him and I deserve better but I can’t. He tells me constantly that it’s my fault, that his behaviour to me is a reaction to me - even when I feel I haven’t done anything bad. He holds grudges for hours, nights - after the smallest disagreement. Everything is my fault and how I’ve worded something wrong or I’ve pissed him off.

Take tonight, I’m worried about my fathers health and while I wasn’t feeling up for going into it with him I told him I wasn’t feeling that great but I’d like to call him, he could cheer me up! Not expecting or asking for much, just five minutes to hear about anything - to feel like the man that is my boyfriend wants to support and comfort me. Yet, he repeatedly tells me “I have talked to you all day”, “I’m eating a sandwich, don’t know what to say to you, i can’t be arsed with this” and swears at me - all while I’m crying and just asking this man to spare me five minutes. It’s like he prioritises anything over me when I need him the most. But when things are on his terms he’s okay. If he’s in a good mood then we get on, if I don’t do things that he doesn’t like. For example, he told me he didn’t want a job or wasn’t bothered what he did as long as he got money so I suggested looking for jobs rather than doing a degree and getting into debt at the moment (he’s nearing 30) - that conversation got chucked at me and told to not talk about again. So, if I don’t - were okay. Even amidst me sobbing tonight about my father he tells me he’s “pissed off” now and doesn’t want to talk. I’m just so lost, it feels like constant emotional manipulation. I would never treat him this way. I’ve asked time and time again to work on communication yet he insists it’s me who’s the problem. I just don’t know what to do, I find myself apologising for nothing and letting his Bad behaviour toward me go all the time.

I know many will say to leave him, but respect that I’m not there yet. I’m just so unsure if I’m overreacting."
1141,"I hate every person and every thing around me. I have a loving family mostbeautiful kids but i just cant bear them  . i get frustrated by their constant care and contant want of attention .. I want to leave them and run away. I keep hurting them shouting at them.. I am just becoming horrible day after day.i think about ending my life so that they dont suffer.

I am depressed  every now and then. I feel like a loser. Like i have no brain or brawn. I get hurt very easily when people dont treat me the way i expect them to.

1148,"The last couple of days have been a dizzy blur.. Been sleeping allot, had some amazing dreams.. I love dreaming, they are more interesting than my reality.. My son came and went.. Didn't mention my arm.. Haven't been eating much.. I eat brown bread.. And sometimes a packet of chrisps.. My head has been full of fog.. Or cotton wool.. Just thick.. Like a bad head cold, only without all the snot.

Right now I'm feeling pretty well.. Normal.. Its the mornings that gets me.. I'm disturbed in the mornings.. But as the day goes by I feel better.. The last time I saw my shrink I told him all about it and he said anxiety doesn't work like that.. anxiety works the other way round apparently, so he didn't believe me and basically accused me of making shit up... but I've seen another thread in here about morning anxiety.....

Anyway I've been making it through the mornings by gobbling pills, and relaxing in the afternoons... my thoughts are running at a normal speed and I've been stuck in this reality.. So I've been doing real world things.. Tidying, going to the bank, the shop.. Couldn't find any bottles of Coke... not in much pain either.. So I guess I should be happy.. But I don't feel 'happy'.. I don't feel very much of anything.. I think its the medication I'm on....

I've been watching b-movies I download from the net.. All the 'A' movies are being withheld because of the virus.. I've watched some really crappy films.. I find movies help allot.. They gather up my thoughts and help me concentrate on something for a hour or two.. Without them I just drift................

I hate feeling like this.. Not particularly up or down.. Just flat.. Its so boring and uneventful... makes me wonder if this is what its like to be 'normal'... if so I hate it.. Sure I'm getting more done and I've even caught up with all the things I was neglecting.. But its like I'm just going through the motions..........

I'm like a unprogramed robot.. Just waiting around, waiting for somebody to tell me what to do.......

sorry if this post was tedious and boring... but that's where I'm at !   :shrug:"

1150,"I dont know how to start this - other than the facts. I am married with 3 kids - but they are all grown (between 25 and 17) and really dont need me anymore. I have been with my husband for 30 years and he is a good man who works hard. I dont work - was planning on re-training at college. For a while now I've felt really down and low - especially considering I've had some health issues this year which have caused me pain and am stuck because of this covid-19 ( the procedure I need under general anaesthetic cant be performed and I am in constant pain with no one helping me) - this has wore me down so much and put a huge strain on my husband who is also tired from working so hard. The dynamics have changed recently and so has he - we are so distant - I dont tell him how pained i am or how i feel - last time I did he blamed me for doing nothing about it. He gets tired and snaps and resents that I dont work - or I want to bother with him - and it ends up with him putting me down and making me feel to blame. The kids have their own lives and i have no other family- i have never felt so lonely, useless, stupid and defeated in my life. I considered taking an overdose the other week but just kept thinking about how it was my daughters birthday coming up and didnt want her birthday to be associated with that for the rest of her life as she would think I'm selfish (stupid I know) so decided to wait till after. I kind of feel like I have to write some stuff down first before I do it otherwise i would just be leaving confusion behind ( with regards to details about bills and money and when stuff needs doing ) because quite frankly I feel that's all I'm needed for right  now and they would be more annoyed about the inconvenience than anything else. I guess. I'm ranting I know - I guess I'm just asking has anyone else ever been in this situation- I just feel like there's no other option - I just dont want to be here anymore"

1155,"My anxiety wasn't bad for a few days. Yesterday afternoon I felt exhausted. Then this morning I woke up feeling anxious again. I still get a low feeling mood throughout the day. It's frustrating feeling up and down. On a positive note I'm eating well, keeping busy, getting rest, etc."
1156,"First of all, let me start by saying that I have no intention whatsoever to be insulting or hurting in any manner, I am purely here to ask question to try to get feel better about something that troubles me very much.

I have a fear/paranoia of islam, it is not always there and on my “good days” I have the sensation to be at ease with the world, but when it hits me it hits bad. I don’t know how it came to be, maybe it’s from my father who is a bit right leaning or just the way the recent past unraveled (I am French). I read the qu’ran, which did not make things better, even though I tried to dissociate myself from my bias.
Anyways, that is not really the point of this post, the past is past, I am rather seeking a way to get better, and if not change my point of view, at least accept thing the way they are.

I think it affects me for two main reasons that I will detail in a moment but first I feel like I should explain what thoughts are “triggering” me. First of all, when I think about ex-muslims/atheists living in muslim countries, it causes me pain. I am only aware of 2 muslim countries where leaving islam doesn’t have explicit legal repercussion, but even in those, leaving can lead to social stigmas. As an atheist, thinking that someone deserves to be jailed (or worse) for his/her lack of faith profoundly shocks me. Even in France, it seems that the amount of peer pressure that muslims are putting on each other is quite big, I have once seen a girl on the street being insulted for being a “bad muslim” since she wasn’t wearing the hijab. Trying to imagine what it is like living as a muslim and having to perform all the social obligations makes me uneasy, as it doesn’t very healthy psychologically speaking. Based on my very subjective limited experience, it looks like it’s not getting better since religiosity seem to be increasing (at least on a surface level) in muslim communities. So whenever I see a young woman fully covered I get sad because I think “why are you willingly doing that to yourself?”, also, it shows me that these beliefs are not going to “disappear thanks to the internet and education” as some are claiming.

Now that I have described some of my trigger thoughts, I want to try to explain why I think it makes me feel that way in general. The first one is easy to describe, the second one not so (but I will try).

When I think about islam related issues/questions, it makes me feel incredibly alone because I get the impression that I cannot talk about it with anybody since all my friends are very left leaning. I am afraid they would not understand or reject me if I really stated my concerns. I am very aware that this might completely a projection created by my fear of judgment (I often have problems stating what I want/think out of fear of being rejected). Even so, I am like paralyzed and cannot talk no matter how hard I try, which sometimes fills me with apathy or hatred towards the rest of the world.

The second point could be the most relevant because it is what is preventing me from taking a “step back” and telling myself that all this concerns don’t matter in the grand scheme of things. This paranoia of mine keeps telling that there is a slim but existent chance that islam takes over the world given a long enough time-scale. This has started by seeing demographic projections from the UN and PEW stating that it will be the 1st religion in the world by 50 years from now and seeing the shift in population in France supports this. I keep trying to tell myself “it doesn’t matter, I’ll be dead by then anyways” but it doesn’t work because of the kind of belief that I have of what comes after death. I don’t know how it could be called, memoryless-reincarnation or “circle of life” : you cease to be but life goes on so you cease to be you but the capacity of having consciousness still goes on as long as human exist. With this belief, whenever I have bad times, I can say “well my life sucks now, but the situation will get better eventually in X00 years for the next generations” which comforts me. But because of my islam paranoia I cannot say that anymore since there is a slim chance that the coming generations end up all brainwashed and psychologically abused. A religiousless world would encourage more research in the pursuit of happiness (once social inequalities are taken care of) which cannot be the case in a religious world since in this configuration, the meaning of life is already written and unquestionable.

I don’t know how to make sense of all of this and am wondering how to change this paradigm. Any suggestions ? Should I get look for help ?"
1157,Do you dislike people saying this to you? I hear it a lot why can't some people understand it is not easy to just forget certain things. What would you say to someone who said this to you? Thanks!
1158,"I went back to my GP today and I've given in, I'm going back on meds.  He's given me some lofepramine, one I've not tried before.  Anyone else had this one?  How did you find it?

1160,"Hello, guys . I'm Yacine . Im18. 
I think im like a very kind guy. I think that all my life i have made great effort to be respectful with everyone. Some of the people that i have to live with lie to me they dont keep their promises, and i cant even talkback. I hate them for lying and for being such assholes , i hate myself for being just the opposite of my principles .I'm so angry with everyone for being so much disrespectul, so much dishonest.Since a longtime,suicide seems to me like the best option. It would make suffer all  those who are lying to me purposefully and who want me to respect them. I want my death to make them suffer until their last breath."
1161,"Hi,

So I'm awake at stupid o'clock in the morning as usual, just thinking.

Do you ever just sit there and realise that every day is just the same thing over and over again? That the monotony of life is exhausting, and the prospect of anything exciting happening or having anything to look forward to is so slim?

It's a strange one because I dont find myself being particularly sad or empty, but instead just contemplating my existence. It sounds cringey, but that's the way it is.

The problem is I know I'm starting to spiral, and I know if I keep feeling this way and don't do anything about it that i will be sad and I will feel like shit by the time I go to sleep. And yet I don't want to do anything about it....almost like I want to be sad. And then I just sit there and feel guilty, because I feel like I'm doing it for attention. But I don't know if I am. I don't know what's going on.

To be honest with you I don't know what's going on in my head. A lot of the time my thoughts are so mixed up and jumbled that I can't make heads or tails of them, and I have absolutely no idea what makes me feel what, if that makes sense. I get different emotions mixed up and I misinterpret my own thoughts.

It's funny actually because sometimes my thoughts are going so fast and I struggle so much to see through the fog that I'll just randomly start stuttering mid sentence. I guess that's a good thing because my parents have learned now that when I stutter I'm clearly worried about something.

If you've made it this far through the post I want to let you know that you're not alone. People do understand, and most people want to help. So talk to someone, let them know what you're going through, start the healing process with little steps. It's going to be hard, I know that from personal experience. I'm nowhere near healed, but I'm making progress. You can do the same, just take each day at a time and take small steps. Sometimes you'll feel like you're taking one step forward and two steps back, but if you keep trying you'll get there eventually. It's a tough path, but it's worth it. 

Just thought I'd share some thoughts and feelings. Feel free to do the same."
1162,"How do you motivate yourself? Or function without the aforementioned?

I can do things, I can. I do care, it’s not that I don’t. I have some amount of clarity. I have some semblance of identity. But...

But I can’t hold myself together long enough to steer. The few strengths of I muster are too often like twigs; they fly off at the first winds.

I’m sure this sounds weak and lazy, but it’s a real problem. I see the world for what it is more than I ever have, but I’m not happy, and I don’t think I have valid reason to be unhappy about it, nor do I believe anywhere ai go or anything I surround myself with would really make me happy.

I lack the motivation to go through what I need to do in earnest; I just push through passively. I need to be here, though, I wish I were here.

I make some progression, I feel my situation change around me, and I get dizzy and overwhelmed just trying to reorient myself. It doesn’t really feel real; often, I don’t feel relief or hurry, I can’t process what to do next. My “me” is blank.

I often start small things and then leave them as small saplings in my self identity. I’m left no one, who doesn’t feel the imminence of anything, and cannot feel the “I” in the steps to achieving things."

What amazes me is how quickly my brain goes from just existing to making plans of suicide. It really exhausts me to just fight it and i wish i had no reasons to live.

I can't evenwn get a job as a bagboy.  I Left school in 04 been down hill ever since. I have no hopes or dreams. Im dead inside. I thought 2020 would be the year my life would change. I was taking steps to better myself getting my GED. (Always miss everything by 1 point been trying since 04 but. Nope I'm not good enough). My dad was right in useless.
I've given up. why keep trying to dig out of this hole when it seem life wants me here. All I can do is lay down cry."
1168,"So i'm 16 and in two years i'll have to graduate high school and become an dult (i'm a girl). When i was younger i insisted on getting into a certain school so i put a lot of pressure on myself to study and get good grades or whatever. After i got in i just found myself quitting everything, giving up on my dreams and passions just to stay in that school and carry its name and of course at age 12 i was diagnosed with depression which only got worse every day. Right now i have to get a life for myself and choose a career or something and move out of my parents' house like every normal human, not to mention my parents don't like me very much and i feel like when i turn 18 they'll kick me out of their house for sure. I actually gave up on pretty much everything that makes a person feel alive a long time ago,i also have social anxiety(on a monstrous level) and i completely withdrew from the society like 4/5 years ago and right now i literally can't do anything that involves talking to people or going outside etc but I don't expect much,i just want to make a life for myself and stop being a burden.



And so there's this math competition and i have like 5 months or less to prepare for this thing but everytime i try to study i just feel like i don't know anything and can't solve problems,i get easily discouraged and just give up,i like to blame it on my parents thinking ""this is how i was raised"" since i don't have a sense of self worth or confidence and feel absolutely worthless, i don't believe in myself-it's not that i don't want to it's just that i can't no matter how hard i try-and i don't think i can do anything at all. From an objective point of view i really can't tell if this whole competition is really hard or relatively easy because for me everything is hard and now that i'm not even trying, i like to blame it on the stats(this competition has had literally no female participants in its history whatsoever) and i like to think that surely there must be a reason why only boys win this competition every year and that makes perfect sense to my mind which forces me to hate and think lowly of myself. There's an age limit for this thing so this year is my last chance to try and but considering all the competitors and the syllabus i don't know if i can catch up but again i can't help but to think this is probably my last opportunity to turn things around and get a life for myself but i just feel like doing nothing, i'm really really unmotivated and discouraged ,although it's what i like i just feel empty and frustrated. whenever i try to study i feel like i know nothing and will never get better so i just escape reality and let days pass without doing anything. And also people that do well in the competition will have to move to another city to get educated on the subject and it's like a big city unlike where i was born and of course i need to interact with people and the outside world and i just feel like it'll probably never work out since the odds are all against me and the stakes are HIGH. I hate myself for not doing anything but i just don't know what it is that should be done and i haven't tried. Therapy and medication never worked for me and my parents don't care at all about my health so even if i tried they'd never help me reach out for professional help. I asked about this matter on different websites so many times that i've lost count already,none of them helped so i thought people here would be more understanding or idk helpful so......"
1169,"Oh my heavens , I'm really going through some times here. I've been very sick with pneumonia and influenza B. I was dragged out in an ambulance and admitted to the hospital. Turned out the reason I couldnt breath and the panic attack that ensued is because I was stricken with the flu. 

The doctor really made me feel like he listened to me. Havent had that kind of bed side manner in a long time Anyhow. I revealed to him that when the ambulance was on its way..... I had already resolved that I was dying and I just leaned over and waited for it to happen. It was soooooooooo awful. I feel like crying right now just thinking about it.  It was a couple of weeks ago.

The doc recommended I take an anti depressant .... plus I was on several other remedies for the flu and pneumonia. But I have so many things riding on my weak shoulders that I must be wearing it right on my forehead. :(

Then a couple of nights ago, I had another spell of atral fib and that escalated into panic and anothr ambulance trip. I felt so embarrassed and depressed because I am in such poor condition and cant walk right now. I had a fasciotomy (limb saving procedure) at the end of June and I am no where near walking yet. 

I Just needed to share this. thank you.   I'm very sad right now and have no outlet for this kind of message."
1170,"Hi all,

Apologies for the bleak introduction. I would just like to see if I could get some semblance of real support from this group, as it has been lacking at home, and with my psychologist. I know it is a typical experience for someone experiencing depression-like symptoms, but I assure you it is not this way. My home life has always like the necessary emotional support. I felt better when I was living on my own, and unfortunately, owing to a degree I am pursuing, I had to move back home.

That being said, what seems to nag me is that I live with someone who has the capacity to help, is aware of my trouble, yet chooses to ignore it. It seems the pain of discussing is too uncomfortable, at least that would be my presumption. My psychologist on the other hand, he, he does nothing. We sit, we philosophize, and then the session ends. I have been seeing him for years, and he is the only therapist I know.

Could this utter discouragement with him, perhaps, not be my fault? I always assumed that it must be me who is lacking in our professional relationship. I always assumed that I was the one that was not holding up his end of the stick, and thus this was why. Could it rather be that he does not have the tools to help me? Should I seek alternative help? Is this the best it gets? If so, should I seek help at all? Is there help?

I feel banished guys, banished in my mind. I am tired because of the drudgery of the day: The ceaseless drudgery, for what? For who? Why? Why do I continue to do things that seem to hold little weight? What am I doing with my life? For context: I am student, I do online content writing for 3 different companies, and only one pays me at the moment (COVID has caused certain issues).

Guys: Is this all there is to life? I've attempted to seek solace in religion, in Christianity. This was the religion of my youth: But, it too seems to fall flat.

Do I suffer from a neurological condition, as opposed to a matter of the heart, and a matter of cognitive restructuring? Am I doomed to feel this way? Does depression outside of my control exist?

My thoughts, my thoughts: These thoughts cause angst, creating whirlwinds of pain in my stomach. This too has become monotonous. I cannot continue to go on day-after-day-after-day with a ceaseless pain in my gut, and I know full well the pain is anxiety-provoked, but it is ceaseless! Day-in, day-out.

I reach out to guys, someone, please, help me in some way or other. Please: A kind word, a nugget of wisdom, a helping hand: Something, just something. :(

I know that many of you may wish to appeal to the hope variable: I ask you not to. The brightness of my future does not change the dullness of my feelings, and the ceaseless pain of this anxiety.  Also I ask you not to appeal to a comparison: ""It's not as bad as this person."" This too will not help. 

I am asking for help from those who have delved to these depths, and who have years on me that surpass my comprehension of the matter."
1171,"Hello,

I'm new here, so i will write down a quick intro on my problems. 

I'm 34 years old and am suffering from mild depressions the last few years. 
It started about three years ago when i came to know my current girlfriend. She didn't had something to do with it, but the fact that i had a new relationship opened up some scars from previous ones. 

At first i thought it was a burnout, because i wasn't able to concentrate/focus anymore, but later on i discovered it had nothing to do with my work. 

I've started with professional help, and that guided me to become somewhat prepared when the next thing arises.

I've had problems with alcohol, it was something that i did to forget my problems, and i've quit that two years ago now. 
Still glad i took that decision, i felt so much better at that point. 
But the problem is, i've replaced it with marihuana. Basically, i'm very sensitive to addictions. 

Now, i'm trying to quit with the marihuana. But i have the feeling that it leads me to a new depression. I was succesful for a month or two before i've relapsed. Note, my girlfriend is also addicted to marihuana, so it's difficult to quit because it's always in the house. 

But when i relapsed, it felt like something snapped inside my brain. And i'm a loose cannon ever since. 
I can have very high days where i feel i can conquer the world and everything around it, making myself promises that i'm going to live my life better. And on the other hand i can have really low days, like today, where i have the feeling i have nothing under control. This always leads into starting smoking or doing weed again. 

So it's a never-ending loophole. I'm doing meditation for the last two months now, and i have the feeling that this is helping me. If it weren't for the meditation, i think i would have fully relapsed by now. Now, i'm still fighting it. 

Today, i've decided to fight again. I'm not smoking for the rest of the day, but just do not know on how i can hold on. I would like to have these low days gone, but i can't really grasp on why they come. It's so random, i can go to sleep feeling really good and confident about myself, and i can wake up feeling completely the opposite. 

Today i felt like shit when i woke up, completely restless and the first thing i did today was smoke a cigarette. 
I think that the low day today is the consequence of a big breach in my daily routine. My son was admitted in the hospital so now my girlfriend and i are taking turns in the hospital. And i know that i can't handle change, it always leads to me doing stupid shit. Yesterday, i've smoked a joint, i just couldn't control myself when i came home from the hospital. It was like i wanted to do it because there was nobody around, nobody to control me, nobody to confront me with it.

And today there's the relapse from that, when i come to my sense and see that it's not the way to react to things. And then i promise myself to try again, to get on the right path again. To become stronger to resist the urges. But on the other hand, i did this like 3 times the last two weeks. So again, a loophole. 

To be honest, it feels good to right this down. It's hard to tell this to people, because nobody really sees it. And i'm quite introvert, so i'm not telling everybody about it. 

If you can relate to my story and could share how you are managing it, that would be highly appreciated. 

Thank you for reading this!

Kind Regards,

1172,I was fine up until about 10:30 am then all of a sudden I became confused and depressed then suddenly broke down in tears I still feel confused .I think it is because I havent been able to sleep.I am confused as to why I feel confused :low: :low:
1173,"Hello,
Due to some office politics I was in very bad bad situation . everybody was gossiping about me in office cause there were some rumor spread by my senior about me . It was a terrible situation for me . I was so humiliated that I was afraid and I felt panic attacks very frequently . Then I stopped talking to anybody in my office . I felt that whenever someone is talking they are gossiping about me but they are not . I was afraid of people . Due to covid-19 I'm working from home but if I start going to office I will feel same . I will get panic attacks . What should I do? Do I start practicing mindfulness meditation to overcome this ?? If so then how long and for how many days?"
1174,"A few days ago I didn't have as much anxiety, but felt tired. I was feeling ok yesterday until the evening. Then I felt more anxious last night and today I feel down. I still wonder about the voices/sounds falling asleep or waking up sometimes. I keep being told it's normal and not usually a mental health issue. I think that's what makes me feel worse."
1175,"Apparently this means 'too tired to give a shit' and that's exactly how I'm feeling today. I've managed to get through the summer, somehow, and now feel I cba to do anything at all. Don't ask me why cos I have no idea. Anyone else in this club with me?"
1176,"Hello, just wondering if anybody else has felt like this or if anyone can relate.  I just simply think that I'm too far gone to get help.  I've had depression for about 4 years now, and I am 3 years gone from learning that I have Asperger's Syndrome.  I have tried nearly everything that anybody has told me to do, to cope with the many problems that I have, and the results are just subpar.  Some of these things didn't work at all, some helped for a little bit, but none of them has really changed the suicidalness and deep self-hatred that I have for myself.  Its at the point where I don't know if there is anything that another human being can say/do to me that will really help me in the long run.  I feel like my life is just done.  It's over.  No point putting forth any more effort.  I just want to know if I'm the only one.  Because if I am, that just makes me more stupid than I already am.  But if I'm not, then that helps me to understand that there is in fact a point where there is no turning back, a point where you really are truly so lost that you can't be helped, because I feel like that is where I am right now.  Any response is appreciated, and I deeply thank anyone who took the time out of their day to read this post, it really does mean a lot to me."

1180,There is definitely a link for me at least. When my shoulder pain flares up it blocks me from doing various things that cheer me up. Anyone else got any thoughts on this topic? Btw I think of this forum as my spiritual home when I am suffering badly. Sending out love and hugs to anyone else affected with this monster.
1181,"Here is my dilemma. I want to commit suicide - I have the plan laid out, the date picked, transferred my assets to prepare.

I realize that by killing myself, I am just leaving all the stuff I can’t deal with to be a problem for someone else.

But I am so tired of crying every morning before I go to work; crying at work; and then come home and cry again and think all night about how easy it would be to just kill myself - how great it would be to not have to wake up again. 

So the dilemma is if I take care of all the shit before I die - and the shit that needs to get done is the reason that I want to die because I literally cannot do it because I am so paralyzed with depression and anxiety that all I do is cry (and hurt myself) - what’s my solution?"

1185,"My emotions are like a yo-yo. Today, I’m having an extremely difficult time with overcoming my emotions and being logical. The sadness is too strong to rationalize through. I feel so worthless, and I keep wondering why I’m even here? How do people overcome the loneliness and sadness when they know that there is not one person on earth who truly loves them? I’m one of those people, and I can’t seem to be able to put It off and not feel the sting of it. I know that people will read this and say that it’s just depression doing the talking. But if you spent time in my shoes, you would agree that it true. Plenty of people I know would protest and say that they love me. But it’s so shallow. No one calls me to ask me to come over for dinner or ask me out to go for a cup of coffee. People only say it to make themselves feel better. If I were to hold them accountable, they would not be able to prove it, though. I’m not suicidal. I don’t believe in it, nor do I have the courage to do it. But I can understand how loneliness would drive a person to give up. Life is so hard and many times the pain of it is not worth living through it. I wish at times that I had died as a child. Then I could have been given a free pass to heaven and would have never had to experience being alone and rejected. I have tried to make friends, but I am rejected time and again. I know this is a flaw in who I am. And I have no one to blame but myself. But I have given up on trying to find people to love me for who I am, flawed and all. I am not bubbly and funny. I’m quiet, reserved. Not intelligent. I’m not attractive. I did not get blessed with good genes, neither mentally or physically. It’s just the reality of it and there are plenty out there like me. I’ve been told to my face plenty of times that I’m ugly. More times than one person should have to hear. I don’t ask for people’s opinions. But for some reason, people feel the urge to let me know what they think. It’s like a vicious cycle. The longer life goes on, the more reserved I become because of individual experiences. And the more reserved I become, the harder it is to interact. The less I interact, the more lonely I feel. The more lonely I feel, the more I want to find friends. Then I try to find them and get rejected. Then the cycle begins again. So pathetic. I am worthless. I have nothing to give and nothing to get. I will live this life doing the same thing every single day. And then one day it will be over. Pathetic indeed."
1186,"Depression , anxiety, PTSD. For years I’ve mastered the art of hiding my feelings to get by . Untill just last week I hit a down hill spiral.

I crave alcohol non stop but I won’t drink it ( I blacked out last weekend. ) I have an appointment for meds Friday... what if it doesn’t work ?? Is it bad that I’m ok with death ?

1187,"I suffer from depression which is always accompanied by anxiety, which is a really terrible feeling and dificult to cope with.

Occasionally i take Xanax 0.5mg at night, to help me get to sleep, but it does nothing for my daily anxiety.

1194,"I don’t really know how to begin so I apologize in advance if this sounds rather scrambled. I’m a 21 year old male, and I’ve dealt with severe social/generalized anxiety & depression since I was a young child, not to mention multiple hospital visits as a teenager. I have accomplished next to nothing notable, I have a couple hobbies/passions but I’ve lost touch with them quite a bit over the years. I never finished high school, not even close. I’ve been unable to obtain employment that I could handle longer than a couple weeks. Last year, I endured a rough breakup with someone whom I was with for about 3 years. I treated her horribly, and I believe alcohol played a big role in that, along with my constant inability to make improvements within myself. I recently gave up drinking & smoking, in a desperate attempt to make any kind of change. I don’t have a car, just my beginners license. I don’t yet have enough experience to obtain my full license. I still live with my mother, and I’m dependant on her financially. My dad has never really been in the picture. For quite a while now, I’ve found myself in a robotic state. I don’t experience the gut wrenching, emotional turmoil depression that I experienced as a teenager; it’s manifested itself as a numbness, keeping me trapped in my comfort zone.. which isn’t very comfortable. I spend most days on my phone, going through socials, going for walks, swiping through Tinder, etc. I’ve also managed to develop a porn addiction, which eats away a good portion of my time too.
I find that I’m completely invisible to women, as if I’m the lowest of the low type of male. I’m not a bad looking guy, but I’m very skinny & can’t maintain a conversation with people I first meet. I have “Alpha” male friends who show women confidence, and bring them over like it’s nothing to them, but I’ve always been the introverted type. I tell myself that I need to work on other priorities before even thinking of women, but I don’t even know what my priorities are anymore. I don’t know where to start.
I feel so lost, and it seems as though everyone only comes around when they need something from me. Even the ones who have a job, and know that I don’t. I feel like it’s too late for me to go back to school, and even if I did, I’ll remember the countless times I’ve attempted & failed in the past because I had zero willpower."
1195,"I am no stranger to depression. I lived the majority of my years in Missouri,  affected by SAD and general apathy most of my life. Dont get me wrong,  I tried therapy,  have been on antidepressants for 30+ years, yet this emptiness stayed. I continued to Persevere tho, working as an ICU RN, raised 3 kids, with 2 college graduates, and my youngest taking a slower educational career path however just as effective.  So my husband decided roughly 4 months ago he was done with gloomy gray midwest days. So we arranged a visit to AZ , both recd job offers and relocated 1 month ago. Our new home is absolutely gorgeous,  the weather is hot, yes but nothing but sunshine.  However my kids are still in the midwest,  my work friends at my prior place of employment,  my LIFE 1700 miles away. I cry daily here, can hardly keep it together most days. I have no garden to plant, no kids to see, no career with friends.  I have only been to my new employer one shift, and what a different environment,  patient acuity is low, and lets face it, I am not known as an RN with 20+ years behind her. I feel I have made a huge mistake,  I want to go home so badly it hurts. Right now I don't care about my husband of only 4 years. I want my kids, the people who kept me going throughout every dark depressive hole I was intermittently in over the past 25 years. I dont know who I am anymore without them nearby.  I am so very unhappy, I don't want to go to that job full of people who have no idea how to work in a level 1 trauma center.  I dont believe I have ever felt so lost"
1196,"Let me start off by saying I have dealt with depression most my life. I went through several traumas as a child that is the root of my problems. Most of my life I have handled it well and it comes and goes like seasons every couple of months. I've always had the strength to shield those around me from its effects and find many healthy outlets to channel it into, writing, videogames, music"
1197,"I suffer with them all day, every day. It would be so easy to go ahead and do it, but I never have after all these years, and probably never will. So why am I thinking about it constantly? The more I think about it, the less sense it makes. Is there any kind of explanation be it evolutionary, social, logical etc? Is it all just self pity? Some kind of curse or parasite in my brain?"
1198,I thinking of re visiting is it a good idea
1199,"I try so hard to battle my depression (and anhedonia), but it's just to the point where I feel like no matter how hard I try, I just can't get out of this rut I am in.  I'm caught in a really bad cycle and don't know how to fix it.

I have battled depression all my life. Currently, I am working hard to try to fix my credit so I can get a home. I have limited time with my children, which makes my depression MUCH worse, and having a home of my own would give me a huge advantage in getting more time. However, I have HUGE financial obstacles to overcome.

I work as hard as I can. One of the top producers in my company actually. However, my depression sometimes gets the best of me. I wake up some days so depressed and anxious about having to work that I simply can't do it. But then, missing work makes me feel even worse, as I feel it just sets me back that much more as far as accomplishing my goals and getting more time with my kids.

So, I miss work at times because of my depression, then the loss of income makes the depression worse, rinse and repeat. And trust me, I fight my hardest to work through it. There are some days where I'm literally crying while working, just to push through it for my kids. Some days though, I just can't do it.

I don't know how to break a cycle like this? I don't feel like medication will help, as I tried an anti-depressant years back. It helped for about six months or so, then my body just got used to (and dependent) on it. When I came off the anti-depressant a year later, I had depression for about 2-3mos that was FAR worse than when I started. So, I know a pill is only a temporary fix.

I have tried tons of other things. A list of things to be grateful for, a list of goals, exercise, eating right, trying to have a regular sleep routine (although the depression sometimes throws off my sleep), but nothing seems to help much. No matter what I do, I miss work here and there, and then it makes me feel even worse. I beat myself up over it, as I feel like a failure that can't just get through life like a normal human being does.

After trying everything I have found on all the websites for fighting depression, I am just running out of things to try. I don't know what else to do."

Id just like to know that Im not the only one feeling this way."
1204,"Hi all, I'm not sure if anyone will be able to help me, but either way, I guess I just need to vent a bit. 

I live in a country of Central America. We've been in a complete lockdown (curfew) since mid-March due to corona. You can only go out when it's your turn to do so (based on the last number of your ID. Each day a single digit can go out, it includes weekends so you can only go out once every 10 days). 

Either way, my girlfriend lives in a different city, although it's just a 40 minutes drive from mine. We spent about 4 months without seeing each other because of this, from March to July. In the 5 years we've been together, we've never spent this much time without seeing each other. 

So when this all began we were good. We had plans to move in together in September. But she started to feel mentally unwell in about May. She had corona in April so she was just recovering from it. I tried to be there for her, but everything was just going downhill from there. In about June I started to notice that she was doubting if we would be able to move in together because of the crisis. And she just started feeling worse and worse. 

She broke up with me on early July. She told me she wasn't enough for me and that she doesn't want to drag me into her depression. She asked for some time so I gave it to her, we spent a few days without talking and then she called me, and we've been casually talking ever since. I've been to her city a few times after this, and while she says she doesn't want to be with me anymore, she still acts like she wants to (she kisses me, she tells that she loves me, she rests her head in my shoulder while I'm driving, she caress my head, etc).

I've always told her that I'm always going to be here for her, but she says that I won't. She says that I will become tired of her and will just leave. Last time I saw her was last Friday, and she told me that she was feeling a bit overwhelmed and that we should only talk once a week, so she told me that she would call me on Saturday. Haven't spoken with her since that day. I'm not sure if it was a good call, I just hope it makes her feel better and think a bit more rationally. 

It's been tough for me, but I read that I must find a balance between her mental health and my own. The anxiety has been a bit tiring for me but I've started doing cardio and have been feeling better. I want to be with her but I've been learning that there's really not much I can do at this point. Is it really all depending from her? 

I've told her that I don't want our relationship to end because of this crisis (I feel like this depression is coming from the complete lockdown, she was fine before this), I've paid and taken her to a psychiatrist and she has been feeling better. 

I don't want to lose her, I really don't want her to feel all alone, but I feel like she's pushing me away. I've always respected her decisions whenever she feels like she needs time, I understand I can't put pressure on her for this. But I'm not entirely sure if this time is beneficial or not. 

She told me something very intriguing last time, she said that she wants to break up with me, then get better, and in 1-2 years hope that I am still single and try again in that time. I've been thinking about this, is it an indicative that she's just unsure about what she wants? I don't think she knows if she wants to be with me or not. I think she just wants to disconnect from everything. 

Are there any suggestions for how I should treat this? I'm honestly not sure what to do anymore. I just try to be there for her, to go take her out once in a while but not sure if it will work long term. Thank you for your suggestions."
1205,"Most days I consider how unfair life is and I struggle to find anything to be happy about. A lot of the time my happiness revolves around a single person. And when that person walks out my life then I just spiral back down again. I give them my heart and I give them everything I've got, and I get barely anything in return. I get ignored. And it makes you think what's the point? Why should I keep opening my heart up to people for them to just take what they need and then leave?

It's my own stupid fault for being so caring. It's also my own stupid fault for getting attached so quickly. It makes you ask yourself where you went wrong and why you're not good enough."

I feel 100% alone with my problems and I wish i had someone to talk to whod understand. I guess theres not much point typing details unless this proves not to be a waste of time.. But as i said in the title, I feel like i had everything. I was happy. And now what i had I cant get back. Ever. And i feel like nothing will ever make me happy again. ive done things id always wanted to do, Pass my driving test for example. I dont enjoy driving its just empty like everything else i try to enjoy. Im stuck in a situation i dont wanna be in. I live in a dump, I have debt and my heads too bad right now to get off my ass and work, im too scared of the social implications. Im gaining weight and have even low confidence than i already did in part because im too scared to go anywhere without my car as an escape route. the main problem revolving around the past that i cant go back too is one of the biggest causes of how i feel and i really wish i had someone whod listen and understand. Im completely lost :( Im not suicidal, but i do question what the point is anymore. I just feel like im doomed to an empty lonely existence where my dreams have came and been lost and theres nothing ahead of me but time and I can feel myself becoming more and more of a shell of the person i use to be daily..

1209,"I'm brand new here. Years ago I was suddenly forced to have a legal guardian and payee by a judge and my daughter and her husband. I've been fighting it ever since. I was an avid motorcycle rider for over 50 years. A photo restoration and manipulation artist, a website designer and commercial artist among other things. I was bullied so badly in Jr. high that my dad moved us to another state. Before that, I was a popular guy at school, on the student council, going to school dances etc. After I missed so many days of school it's a wonder that I graduated high school in 2 1/4 years.  I  was married for 35 years, then a devastating divorce where I lost everything. I've been on Disability for anxiety and depression since 1988. I've been forced to live on foster homes, assisted living places for years. I'm 65 years old. I'm absolutely worn out to hopelessness now and just hope to pass on every night. I'm only happy on my dreams. I think about my past to try to be happy all the time. Can anyone help me with all this?"
1210,"Hi guys,

Just after some advice, when the low mood hits what do you find a good coping strategy?"
1211,"The doctor said must be activating, energising but i have the reverse effect with it. I started venlafaxine 20 days ago. After how much time starts working peoperly?"
1212,"I hear it all the time. Everything happens for a reason. You're shitty childhood - it happened for a reason --} made you into who you are now. And all I can think is I'm not happy with who I am now. I don't even know who that is anymore. I am still trying to figure out the reason why I went through these two agonizing years. I don't really see a reason for it. 
And they also say see the good in the bad. I don't know what good came out of those two years. It was all very very bad. 
I experienced the worst rejection I've ever faced. I've experienced heart break, sadness, depression, the realisation that all my worst fears had finally come true. All of them had finally come true.
So yeah I don't know what the f#@k they're on about when they say that.
It was a waste of a life in my opinion and I hated every minute of being alive. It was pure misery. 

Thanks life for providing what can only be described as an experiment gone wrong. And to only experience happiness one time in the span of 25 years and to experience it for two months, that's a tease not an experience, so thanks life once again.


Now that no one at all cares about me and it's proven, I don't care about myself either. I really don't care about anything anymore. I have it a chance and tried what the psychiatrist said and the therapist. And I never met anyone. Anyone at all. I was always alone. I pityself out there the way they suggested and once again I was rejected. Everything happens for a reason. The reason seems clear to me. Experience true joy with a beautiful girl then lose it and realise that nothing good will ever happen and really you should have never been born because life isn't worth living. And whoever tells you life is beautiful must be on some really heavy strong narcotics"
1213,Finally took them down. I even opened my windows too for the first time all year. It feels good :)
1214,"Hello! Depressed human here, in need of the most basic of human interactions.

Sounds like a bunch of us are lonely here, so there’s the deal: I’ll be your friend if you’ll be mine. I’ll reply as much as I can, as long as I feel engaged, and so should you. I’ll engage the conversation one day, and you can pick the next day. Or we can keep ourselves busy for just the hour, that’s fine too.

I don’t know how many people need this, or how big this will get, but if it does expand, grab a buddy, or join a buddy group. Be a good internet-stranger friend. Hello, how are you-back. Spend time on small talk, or share your experiences with depression.:hug: Remember that there’s more people And personalities in the world than you can ever wholly meet irl."
1215,"i'm not even sure if this is the right part of the forum to post this as i'm not sure i would necessarily say i have depression now (i have in the past though) because now i feel like i can't even be bothered to be depressed because i don't care enough to be depressed. i've given up on life, i don't care about anything anymore. At times this feels oddly peaceful and calm but other times it feels empty and lonely and i just feel bored and i sometimes feel nothing at all, just emptiness. Sometimes i feel anxiety but that's only when i have to go out and face the world, i prefer to stay away from other people as much as i can now. I don't really find interest or enjoyment in anything anymore, i don't like reading, watching tv or movies. i still like listening to music but even that gets tiresome at times, i still enjoy food but then i always had an unhealthy relationship with food anyway, sometimes its the main thing i think about all day! When i get drunk i don't feel drunk in the same way i used to, i guess i have a very high tolerance for alcohol now.i'm not interested in Material things at all, they don't make me happy. Even as i write this i am feeling nothing much at all, i don't even know why i'm writing it, i know nothing will change how i feel now."
1216,people think im just not a happy fun person to be around with i believe that im just a worthless lost cause people laugh at me for being myself people where i live around make me feel like i am worthless and that i should go and end my life and not exist i feel like i just have no reason to live.
1217,ive reached a point where self talk and motivational speeches dont cut it. all day i feel terrible with fear and depression. please post what was the turning point for you? weather it was diet or a certain medication that turned the lights on for you. i am seeing a doctor now im just curious about what your resolution was??
1218,"When I reach my goals, I lose interest quickly. All I really want to do is eat, sleep, and watch TV. I can't afford to do that as I have to work to support myself. I am just so disinterested in life. What can I do? I just try to hide my depression at work and I do the bare minimum."
1219,"My prostate cancer pills are reactin with my MH pills causing me to black out
I can't stop taking my MH pills cause they are the only ones that work for me,
same as the cancer pills, I can't keep blacking out cause I will hurt myself one day, I'v been lucky so far, I'm sort of between the devil and a hard rock unless there are some other options to keep my bood pressuer up."
1220,"Hello, this is my first post on anything like this. So I might ramble. Forgive me. I just wanted to share with people who don't have a vested interest in my life I guess.

TL;DR: I just wish not wanting anything for myself was okay. I wish everyone would stop wanting things for me. But they just won't stop and I wonder if they ever will.

I am a very lucky person. I am currently at the end of my degree which was paid for by my parents. This degree is computing and it opens to the door to so many fantastic job opportunities that I can't count them. I'm in a relationship with a wonderful partner, and I am in a tip-top physical condition as far as I can tell.

But at the same time, I'm about to fail my re-take of my dissertation, meaning I will have had to stay 2 years past when my degree should have ended, and my highest possible grade is a 2.2. I don't know how to tell my parents this as I come from a family of high achievers and academics. I do not enjoy my degree (which I picked because none of my schools offered music GCSEs or A levels and my parents would have thrown a fit), and as a result am very bad at computing, as anyone who does computing will know, most people that do it, love it and are therefore amazing at it. I feel like I have failed my family at every step in my education. The only good grades I've gotten were for my GCSE's, during which our teachers did some weird shit that I'm pretty sure was cheating, which I never told anyone and feel like a fraud for.

My mum has repeatedly shared her distaste for people who work in non-degree grade jobs. I, unfortunately, am very 'happy' being a barista currently (although COVID has made me redundant). Happy in inverted commas as I, unfortunately, base my self worth on others opinions.

I'm also in a relationship and there are expectations to want things in life that I just don't. I need to want to save up for things and having a low paying job isn't going to cut it. And I do want to get things like a house but I want to take my time. So I feel like I'm destroying someone else's life by not wanting more for my own.

During all this, I have become depressed. I do not speak to people about my feelings which can't help. I either can't sleep or can't stop sleeping. My default response to most things seems to be anger. I crave solitude most of the time. I feel an intense need to push away everyone. I do not respond to messages and as a result, have effectively cut off several of my best friends. Would not clean or wash if I didn't live with someone else. I repeatedly harm myself to deal with difficult or intense emotions which is fucking weird. At my worst, I frequently think about killing myself but am too afraid of death to ever go through with it.

But at the same time, I'm totally fine with it. It feels awful but I don't care to change anything. And that's a problem because that's like the one condition for getting better: Wanting to get better. And I don't. But everyone else want's me to get better, either because they care about me and I wish they didn't like an asshole, or because my shit is directly affecting their shit. But I'm just so unmotivated to change. I actually really want this. I want to feel shit and barely function and I feel twisted and awful even more because of it. Is wanting this another symptom of wanting to be alone and cut people off? I don't know. I just feel like I'm standing on a ledge where I'm about to catastrophically disappoint my family and also destroy my relationship, and I don't want to do anything about it. I can see future me hating current me. But I just don't care. And that sucks."
1221,I just need a hug please.
1222,"Last week I was keeping busy and sleeping well. Then over the weekend I started to feel really down again. Then the low mood, fatigue started with some trouble concentrating. I was really tired last night got a few hours sleep and woke up restless this morning. I'm just sick of feeling a little better and then down again."
1223,Has someone left you because of your mh problems?
1224,Im 39 years old now  and have been dealing with problems since i was a kid..  Abuse etc bla bla and seen my mother kill her self etc etc.  Id llike to help anyone i can. An ear or a shoulder
1225,"Hi everyone. I would like to keep this as short as possible so as not to ramble on. I have suffered with depression my entire life, and no amount of medication has helped other than opiates. I lost my job in September and have had no luck since then and feel like it’s rejection after rejection. I basically have no friends now, and nothing to live for. I keep thinking about wanting to die daily, and hoping it will happen soon. Anyone ever felt this way? I just feel like nobody would care if I died other than my husband. Any response is appreciated. Also I was just diagnosed with adhd and started medication today. I just hope it doesn’t make it worse."
1226,"Hi, I’m a male who has been struggling with what I have diagnosed myself as hocd for the past year. It first occurred in the summer when I accidentally came across a homosexual scene in a tv show and was absolutely repulsed. I thought “am I like that” and experienced severe anxiety. This struggles caused me to become sick for the next few days and since then I have avoided all homosexual media and people. Since I was little i have always been aroused by girls and women and have never thought about men. I still feel disgusted by it and try to avoid homosexual ideas and thoughts. Sometimes a get a random erection and I direct it towards me possibly being gay and I become horrified and experience anxiety and perform compulsions to constantly check whether I am or not. Furthermore I think I have depression because of this which does not help. I read that depression releases cortisol from the amygdala changing hormones and other things. I have a reduced sec drive and desire, it feels somewhat harder to get an erection but I still only get erections from girls. I experience memory loss and forget a lot of stuff, I feel stupider and stupider everyday, I am uninterested by things I used to enjoy, I don’t feel emotions to the extent I used to. For example if I see a crime on tv or something to that extent I don’t feel remorse. I slowly feel that I’m losing the ability to love my friends and family and that is eating away at me. I also only feel sad es and I don’t feel happiness to the extent I used to. When I was in school and I interacted more socially and exercised more, I felt a lot better. I know I’m not homosexual but trivial thing happen sometimes and I attribute that to being homosexual and I check to make sure I’m not homosexual by getting aroused by women and actions to that extent. Recently, I have become so used to these compulsive actions that I don’t even feel disgusted by homosexual things anymore which makes me feel horrible. Not only have I not felt disgusted but this, but I have also lost my ability to be disgusted by almost everything. Crimes, horrible things, etc. I have only had relationships with women and I only will have relationships with women in the future. But this what if drama is holding me back from my potential and I can’t deal with it. Furthermore, I always have difficulty concentrating, I always feel bad about myself, I am extremely irritable, I always feel tired, I feel hopeless, unmotivated, and I have put on a bit of weight. These thought have been occurring for a year and I haven’t told anyone. I want to solve this by myself and I want to know that there are other people like me and that I am not the only one experiencing these issues. Thanks for hearing me out and I would appreciate help."
1227,"my angel is being neutered on friday

1228,"Hi there- I totally get you're not doctors. Don't worry I WILL go to my doctor but I was just wondering-which meds work on the part of the brain affected by trauma which causes hypervigilance? I had citalopram for 2 years but really didn't enjoy it :(
I'm not asking you to prescribe a med, I know youre not a doctor but which types work on this issue?
Thank you!"
1229,"I thought about this last night when I watched a TV personality talking about how emotional he still gets over the death of his father, who he described as 'his hero', around 20 years ago. The fact that my parents are both in their 70s, an age when you tend to think about someone's mortality, has meant that I've been thinking a lot about our relationship, or lack of it, recently and the realisation that when they're gone there'll be nothing happy to look back on is deeply depressing. Dad had drinking issues when I was growing up and even though those issues are gone now we never built a close relationship at the time we should have... in my formative years. Mum has always been a smothering, OCD type of personality who never gave me any space or a moment of peace when I needed it... to the extent that my main reason for leaving home was to get away from her. The fact that they are chalk and cheese and argued constantly when I was growing up strained any potential relationship even further. As an adult I've always been jealous when I see things like grown ups still wanting to go on holidays and do other things with their parents because it's something that's always been missing from my life. It's not a case of repairing the relationship either... there's just nothing there. It sounds harsh but it's like if they weren't my parents would I bother seeing them at all? That realisation that I won't have all those great memories to look back on when they're gone has been playing on my mind a lot recently. I couldn't call my dad my hero, inspiration or anything like that. It's not even close. Like I said, it's all very depressing."
1230,"I just need to vent a little...
Broke a tooth during lockdown, couldn't be saved so I had to have it extracted.

I know that it broke because I have been avoiding the dentist for 6 years.
When my depression was really bad I didn't take care of myself and neglected my teeth especially. 

Now I'm 25 and lost a tooth permenantly, I wish I could go back in time and save myself this grief.
I can't afford a replacement/fake so it looks like I'm just gonna be missing one forever. Thankfully it's towards the back.

I haven't even had my other teeth examined yet. 😥 What an idiot."
1231,"My depression has become so bad, that I can't sleep in my bedroom. It makes me feel isolated and cut off. So I've been sleeping in the living room. Anyone else have this problem? How can I get over it? I miss my room."
1232,"Hi, I don't know where to post this, I guess I just really need a place to open up

I had met a guy through reddit on a covidpositive sub, I have a friend in real life who had been fighting the virus so I posted there for some support and that is where I met this person who was also fighting it

We talked every couple of days and bonded pretty quickly, it was just casual conversation and keeping each other up to date with how he was managing and also how my friend was doing

Throughout May is when his messages got very dark and every week he told me couldn't stand the pain any longer and wanted a way out, I tried to give hopeful and encouraging words every time
He would tell me how his GP was completely useless and sometimes didn't believe how much he was struggling, plus his family also weren't very supportive he told me
Around the start of June his girlfriend of 5 years broke up with him and he told me he had a plan, again I tried to beg him not too, but I felt so helpless, I didn't know his real name, only his age and county he lived in

15th June I messaged him ""hey how have you been"" no response

21st June I messaged him again ""are you alright?"" no response

From then on I had a feeling, but didn't want to believe it and kept convincing myself he either was in hospital or just wasn't in the mood to chat

Then yesterday morning I got a message from his account claiming to be from his mum ""hi I'm ___, my son ____ took his life on 15th June""

At first I was in denial, but then I used his name, age, and area he lived and did a little google, there were 2 articles on his death, I also used facebook and found his friends and family posting their condolences

All day I was crying, I feel like I should have done more or said more, I have to live with the fact someone ended up taking their life and I knew about it days before hoping they wouldn't 

I feel like if I tell anyone then they'll also judge me for not doing more, I also feel like I can't ""grieve"" because I didn't know him that well, he was just a username on a forum that I'd occasionally chat to

That was someone's son, brother, friend, lover, I feel terrible for them"
1233,"i have two children 
lj hes 2 (3 in January and srr she turned 1 in june

i had lj at 22 an srr at 23 
my now ex has my kids atm because of my mental health and adhd 
ive basically been told its unlikely ill ever get them back because mental health wont improve in the time frame that they want 
we are under ss (social services )
has anyone had similar issues depression lost their kids and then got better and got the kids back
i dont normally post on these things as people judge so much but thought id try as im all alone atm no friends e.g 
i need to know there's light at the end of the tunnel cause im loosing hope tbh 
im on meds and im having therapy but we still dont know why im so depressed or suicidal"
1234,"I've never posted on a forum before so I don't really know why I am now. I first became very ill in my last year of university. I managed to pull myself out of it and have never been as unwell as that since (essentially stopped functioning - couldn't eat, sleep, enjoy anything, was having OCD type obsessive thoughts and vomited throughout the day due to anxiety symptoms). Since then, this has settled into an ebb and flow of depression/anxiety/suicidal ideation over the past few years, that waxes and wanes but never to the point where I completely stop functioning. For that I am grateful. Although it has set a rather high threshold for illness. In other words, I fall into the idea that if I am not that ill ^^^ then it can't be that bad. 

I am not really a religious person. Sometimes I feel though that I was put on earth by accident and that I am not really meant to be here. Other times I feel like I am already dead and that I am just living on earth as a ghost; present but not really part of the world. I don't mean this literally. I often just wish I would disappear or die quietly in my sleep. People wouldn't know that I feel this way. They may even see me as self-assured. I have become quite skilled at this facade. 

I can't kill myself because it would destroy my family. I am a very lucky person in that I have a caring and supportive family network, with two parents who always showed me that I was loved. I think that is what makes me feel so guilty about feeling so bad. I don't have a bad life - I have a good life even. Kind partner, supportive family, good job, emigrated to a new country, enough income to live a good quality of life. If I didn't have anyone around though, I wonder whether I would have tried to kill myself. I can't escape the feeling that I am just waiting until my life ends. Sometimes when I feel very low, I can see an image of myself as an old woman in my bed just about to die. And all I will say to myself is 'thank god, it's over now'. Like everyone in life, I have my had my share of adversity. But people face true hardship everyday so I always feel extremely guilty about the way I feel. 

Just felt like leaving my thoughts somewhere."

I feel like I need a bath but I dont because I just washed.it is on my arms.I do feel a wee bit better that I called my doctor.Still I just dont understand why this happens out of the blue from nowhere the anxieties and depression comes.I cannnot seem to have anxieties anymore without having depression and now i am seeing black things like shadows they disappear after a few seconds  yes I was told that was anxieties.I cannot even go outside because it is just way to hot and humid out there .This itching all started after I got a sunburn.I am sure it will stop.

this is fucking pointless !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1239,"Hi,
I'm 52 and just can't take anymore.
I can't even bring myself to write my story in full.
I have nothing.
I've just lost my girlfriend, job and need somewhere to live .
I just can't face another new start, I don't know where to start.
Without money I'll end up in a house share and the ones by me are vile especially the ones that's accept DSS.
My anxiety is sky high, my depression won't go and living in one of these will definitely send me over the edge.
In the last few years I have tried and tried.
I cared for a friend for ten years while working.
I then cared for my mom for 5 while working two part time jobs.
I cared for her through a heart condition, Alzheimers and cancer.
My family refused to help but when my mom got cancer they kicked me out and tried to care for her knowing she wouldn't have long and feeling guilty.
I can't begin to even start to tell you what they had done before all that and since. Some of the most horrible stuff you could do to someone.
It culminated in them stealing my inheritance off me 40/50k.
I haven't got anything and these people own their own houses and have plenty of money.
I rented a nice house last year and needed a lodger so I let a friend move in.
It lasted 9 months, he ended up ripping me off for my last £1500 and ended up putting me in debt as he stopped paying his rent and I had to find it.
Also used my credit card behind my back.
I then moved in with an old friend but it's run its course.
She doesn't want me here.
I'm quiet, clean & tidy and pay my rent on time but she'll always find something to have a go at me .
It's draining, I hate being here.
I lost my job last week and she says I can't claim benefits here so I have to get out.
And as I said the only option horrifies me because of my health.
My girlfriend finished with me 10 days ago and won't speak to me.
Apparently I'm an amazing person, I couldn't have done more for her , I made her feel special everyday and she loves me.
And the week before she finished with me she wanted me to move in with her.
Then all of a sudden a week later she can't be in a relationship using the it's not me it's you line.
I could accept this as she has a lot going on and has not been very well herself.
But the exact same thing happened with my girlfriend before her. She took me to see a surprise house the week before she used the line.
So, to me, it's obvious, it's me not them.
Spent so many years on my own, so much pain and heartache.
Doesn't matter how hard I try it all ends up in a mess and me feeling like this.
Over and over , it's the one true constant in my life.
I try to be a good person and I'm have a lot of friends and I am well liked.
Having friends or not though, they can't ultimately save me even with their support, they have their own families to think about.
Ultimately I'm on my own.
Spent most of my life feeling/being alone.
The little confidence I have is shot.
So, I'm looking at living in a hmo, having to take a minimum wage factory job if I'm lucky.
While facing life alone again.
My fight has gone after years and years of pain and things going wrong.
I'm so close to using my credit cards, getting a train somewhere but with the intention of not coming home.
Plans I've had in my head for years and add a bit every time I hit a low.
I only ever hit lows when the situation goes wrong but unfortunately my life has been littered with disappointment and sadness, I'm not a lucky person.
I know there are people worse off but you can only walk in your own shoes.
I've never really wanted to die even when I've thought about things in the past but my fight has gone and I don't really care anymore.
I can't face the pain and loneliness ahead , I'm lost, helpless and hopeless."
1240,"Hello all, I've been suffering anxiety and low moods/mood swings for the last 4 weeks really intensely.
Its just not going away. I wake up in a panic and my mood is very low.
Pretty certain I have classic depression with anxiety thrown in too.

Started on citalopram 3 weeks ago, well, I got to day 5 and felt like I couldn't go out, I was literally a complete mess, nausea was overbearing and the anxiety spiked really high so I came off them. I have been on citalopram 6 months ago and was never this bad getting on it, as we know first 2 weeks are tough. 
I've been prescribed fluoxetine now and scared to death of trying it. I just don't know what to do , it's so hard taking a pill that makes you that sick. 

Is there anyone else out there like this? Intolerant and ultra sensitive to the meds? 

What do you do?

I feel so helpless and hopeless. I know I need meds but its like a war zone going through the transition. 

Many thanks"
1241,"So, I've gained about 26lb from being on meds over the past 2.5 years. I had finally started exercising again and attempting different food restrictions over the past year, and 2 weeks ago, started intermittent fasting. BUT...

Turns outo, my intermittent fasting is all for naught if I don't get fat adapted first. And that means keto  diet, for up to 21 days claims one YouTuber. So, I'm probably not burning any fat and that makes me very discouraged! My breakfasts are half carbs and half fats (Dr, third carbs, third fat and third protein). At any rate, cutting carbs completely just seems impossible to me! :/"
1242,"I have been diagnosed with major depression for several years now. In recent years, therapists have dug deeper and claimed there are serious signs of anxiety, social anxiety, codependent relationships with my parents, enmeshment with my mother, and possible childhood trauma (that I cannot name).. and possible PTSD as a result. It is all too much. I just want simple depression. 

My simplified and summed up response to 'what's wrong with you' has always been simply 'depression.' It's just always been depression. I am 24 now and my quality of life is deteriorating more and more as time goes on. I am down, then I feel hopeless about the smallest things like cooking dinner, then I am suicidal at the thought of not even being able to successfully make myself a meal. I cry to a God I do not even believe in, begging for my mind to stop and for my life to stop. Then I am okay. I am happy to do my laundry, cook myself dinner, be with my cat. Then it falls again. And I believe deeply that it will always be this way. That I will never be okay for long enough. On my recent bad days, I do not care what happens to me. 

Tonight I realized I have no sense of self. I went to create an Instagram. Yes, I know how stupid you must think I am about to sound.. Please keep reading. I was overwhelmingly sad. I was nauseous even. I do not know who I am honestly. I have likes and dislikes, but in all, they are very contradictory. I went to search for people I used to know. I felt fear and anxiety. I cannot fathom creating an online presence and having the freedom to allow it to reflect who I am.. my thoughts, feelings, passions.. I truly do not know who I am. I feel I have been numb for all my life. I did not give in and try to have relationships and friendships growing up. I was terrified. My therapist tells me this has to do with some sort of childhood trauma. I was not myself. I was not myself even with myself. As I type that I then question, who even is 'myself?' I do not know. 

Do I have a border personality disorder? Do I have bipolar disorder? Do I have mere depression and just think too much? Am I alone too much and led to think all of these thoughts? Please someone give me some sort of response and help me to see things from a farther perspective. I just need peace."

1246,"I don't even know if I would be considered to have mild, moderate or severe depression. Haven't seen a psychiatrist only a family doctor who prescribed me zoloft. I started 25mg for 1 week than up to 50mg for another 3 weeks than up to 75mg for about a week and a half. I had a period on the 50mg where it felt like it was working, than it went flat than 75mg again a period where it felt like it was working than went flat again and even seemed like I went backwards. 

For me I go up and down with my mood. Psychologist and family doctor both believe it's a clinical depression issue. Zoloft worked wonders twice before in the past, but I guess because the two times in the past I was so depressed I couldn't really notice the negative effects of taking an anti-depressant where you sometimes feel worse before getting better. This time around I'm noticing the worse, however I do still have good days on the 75mg. 

I sometimes have moments in the morning, during the day, and in the evening where it seems like I just snap out of it. When I say snap out of it I mean out of my head. I have this issue where I I'm overly focused on my inner feelings in my gut and mind. I will often connect everything to depression and anxiety. Even a cold and sinus pressure has my mind linking it to depression and anxiety. Instead of just seeing it for what it is. If I'm doing something very distracting where I'm not living inside my head I actually feel normal for that moment. I even feel the normal when I meditate. But I keep on going back inside my head.  

Is it normal to still not have full effect of zoloft after almost 6 weeks on 75mg? I feel like if I didn't have the brain fog I would go inside my head. But the brain fog comes first and than I start analyzing it to death to the point where I get stuck. I've had brain fog my whole life I believe but just now I'm stuck linking it to depression and anxiety so it doesn't just stop at awareness anymore."
1247,"It’s my birthday tomorrow I’ll be 36. Ive done nothing with my life or more accurately I’ve failed at everything I’ve ever tried. The truth is I gave up a long time ago. I have no expectation of anything good ever happening to me ever again, my future is bleak which seems doubly cruel as I had a really happy childhood but my childhood memories now seem like a cruel joke.

I hate being around people and yet I hate being alone, what a horrible combination. I can’t handle stress, I just collapse under pressure and I need to rely on my family to look after me which doesn’t help my self confidence. I guess its a premature mid-life crisis, but it’s a genuine crisis, I just don't know what to do with my life. It took me till I was 30 to move out of my parental home and even then I was working for my dad and now I’m 36 back home. Broke and getting fatter and uglier every day.

The most troubling of all is the seemingly unfixable nature to my source issue, my inability to socialise effectively. If you can’t get along with people then you can’t work, it’s that simple. I can’t make friends I’ve never been good at it. I used to have friends in school but it’s easy when you’re young, I mean if you put a bunch of kids together they’ll eventually seperate themselves into appropriate little groups. Thats what it was like for me anyway. Maybe I’v never been good at making friends, maybe I was just able to fly under the radar when I was younger. I’ve often wondered what it would be like to speak with my old school friends and ask them honestly what they thought of me. Maybe I was the weird kid but never realised it at the time. I certainly feel like the weird guy now.

I can’t have casual conversations, my mind goes blank and I create awkward silences and people make their excuses to leave. This has happened so often that I don’t even feel awkward anymore, the silence comes as a relief. Nobody wants to be the weird guy at work but thats who I am. I try to avoid people as much as I possibly can and it’s obvious they try to avoid me. This has obviously left me isolated, depressed and anxious. I also feel like my parents are ashamed of me. I mean why wouldn't they be ashamed. I’ve no friends, no social life, no career, not even a job, no girl friend or wife and no chance of grand children. I have only sisters so the family name dies with me.

The term “Failure to Launch” seems to define me. I just about got through my childhood, adulthood on the other hand as been an absolute disaster. I left school at 16, worked dead end jobs for a few years, tried to join the army, failed; tried to be a truck driver, failed; got a useless degree and failed to find employment because the interviews stressed me out to much. I’d say for the past 10 years I’v been functionally depressed. It does make me think about what the future holds for me. I’m embarrassed to leave the house just in case people see me and I need to tell them I’m unemployed and still live with my parents. Thank god it’s socially unacceptable to ask about one’s sex life as I’ve never had a serious relationship. I know theres more to life than sex but I do wonder if it will ever happen again.

I’m living a truly pathetic life and I don’t know how to change."
1248,"I am so lost right now. I don’t know what to do. I’ve posted on here before but I have nowhere else to go. My fiancé has incontinence issues along with lots of pain, and he also has depression and severe anxiety. These issues mean he can’t work a normal job. He’s been to see the doctor but the doctor has said that all of his physical health issues are caused by his anxiety and they just gave him an extra box of his antidepressants and left him to deal with it. Because of all this, he’s adamant nothing can be done to help him. His mother has offered to pay for private treatment which I believe would help him so much but he refuses (he doesn’t know I know about his mother’s offer). We are going to his mother’s house in a few days and I know she’s going to mention it again and I’m terrified because he gets so angry when anyone (especially his mum) tries to offer him help. But I can’t let him refuse this. I am terrified that he is going to hurt himself, or worse. Getting this help could change everything. It’s gotten to the point where he gets so anxious that he can’t fall asleep properly so I stay up until he falls asleep so he knows he’s not alone. The other night we stayed up all night and we were awake over 24 hours because he was stressing so much. I’m scared to leave him by himself, I don’t have a job right now and neither does he but I don’t feel like I can look for a job because I don’t feel comfortable leaving him alone. Right now we live with his father, so we’re lucky we don’t have bills to pay other than food shopping. But I don’t want to live in this room forever and never get any sleep, I love him so much and I know it’s not his fault and I try to support him as much as I can. I just want him to be happy because right now we are not living, we stay inside all day. I think maybe he might have agoraphobia too. I don’t know what to do, he won’t accept any help and he gets so angry every time anyone tries to help. I don’t know what to do. If he doesn’t get any help I am absolutely terrified of what’s going to happen. I am so sorry to post here but I am at my wits end right now. It’s affecting me so much too but I never let him see me get upset when he falls asleep most nights because it would make him feel awful if he knew it was upsetting me. I haven’t got any friends so I can’t talk to anyone about this so that’s why I’m posting here. I hope someone can maybe give some sort of advice because I just don’t know how I can get him to agree to help but if I don’t get him to agree I don’t know what’s going to happen"
1249,"My reason to write it down here is because maybe someone will understand what i do not understand. This is probably going to be a very long text.
Maybe it will help someone else in his/her life. Maybe someone even find the right words to help me even though this has never happened before.
Right now, i am a 25 year old guy, living in a apartement with my dog Lea.

Im dead inside. I dont feel anything towards anyone i know. I dont feel anything about myself. I dont love me, but i also dont hate me. I may have depression and i am just so used to it i dont really notice it anymore. However, before long talking, lets just begin sharing all the different moments and situations that may led to this.

It all started in first class. InKindergarten, i was a child like anyone else.
However, in first class i was more active than other kids. I always wanted to move around, to do sport. My teacher could not handle it. She was also a horrible teacher to be honest, little she was caring about anything. My classmates started picking on me because i was not wearing some really cool clothes or because my ears were standing wide.
I started to play pranks on my teacher to gain some laughs and a better reputation. The teacher always noticed the pranks, but never how i was picked on. No teacher ever did.
Then i had to go to a psychotherapist or something. I was diagnosted with ADHS and had to take some stupid pills for many years. Today i know only one thing of it: This happened because of the greed. They just saw an active kid and then ""here, he needs those pills"".

I switched classes, got another teacher who was much nicer and thanks to the pills i became a LOT quiter. I stopped playing pranks, my grades were 1 and 2 in everything, but the picking actually didnt stop. I've never got to become one the cool kids, and that one therapist always took me out of class two times a week to play some boardgames with me because i was very fond of playing didnt make it any better. The picking became bullying, situations i got drawn into a corner after school, threatened and slapped just for fun or because i did not believe in god. They took all the reasons they could get.
Sometime in the third grade, something happened inside of me, i dont know what, and i lost motivation to learn. My grades became worse and i never found interest in the life outside of fantasy anymore. After i switched school and came into the fith grade, my brother showed my World of Warcraft. I was sooo deeply lost in there for many years.
My grades became even worse. I was still the quit one, but after fourth grade my parents stopped giving me those pills. I still had to visit many therapists, had to do all kind of tests with them. They looked at my brain activity via cables, tested my concentration, how i move and everything. I did fine in all those tests and being claimed very intelligent.
But thats all that happened. I had to visit a therapist once a week to make some more dumb tests or play board games. I had more therapists than classes! The picking and bullying went from one school to another. I always tried to laugh and act like it was funny. They may have not cornered and threaten me like in the school before, but because i was playing along, the fun they made of me became much much worse.
I was just sitting in the school, head on the desk, waiting for the day to end. Ive completely stopped learning, inside and outside of school. All i wanted was to go and play videogames at home, alone. Or read my books. I have read the whole Harry Potter series at least 5 times. I actually did have had some ""friends"", but they also never were true friends. They never covered me. They never helped me. I did had some fun with them in the breaks, but thats it.
My unwillingness to learn at school and denial of everything went so far, that i had to go to a school for ""Hard raisable children"". 4 teachers, 2 educators. We were maybe 10 pupils at once at the whole school and i was in the middle of them. They were, what i definitely never was. Antisocial ""gangsters"". Playing all big, doing really bad things, breaking the law, seriously hurting other people and then, there was i. The quite one, the one who always was being picked on.
And of course. This did not stop there. They just did with me whatever they wanted to and took from me whatever they wanted. I was there for 3 years. In my third and last year, i was the ""oldest"" one on that school, most others being gone, new having arrived. And in that last year, i sweared to myself to never ever let anyone getting near me. 
Then the time came for professional school. I've actually became a monster. Not only unwilling to do anything demanded from me. I verbally attacked anyone of my classmates speaking to me, laughing at them and tried my hardest to make them feel like dirt. It was also around that time i found my first and last girlfriend online.
Met her in World of Warcraft, we fell in love and i even visited her two times for a week each. We were together for almost a year. It was a wonderful time, but it wasnt supposed to hold. As with many online relationships, the distance is too much and the feelings fade away. She started being annyoed whenever i wrote to her, this was going for more than a month until i could not take it anymore and broke up. This was, like, one of my hardest decisions in life and today i still miss her somewhat.
Well, back to school. I tried my hardest to make anyone feel like dirt. I even started something i have never done before: Not showing up at school. For me, there was no sense behind it. I never thought of my life in the future, i never cared. There are people everywhere in the world and videos and so on telling you, that bullied children will be the most beautiful inside, that they are only sharpened while the bullies stay ugly and meaningless and so on.
Bullshit.
I swallowed my sadness, my anger, my fear for my whole life long. And that did not go well with me. Besides having a GF for one time, i was never able to share any of whats happening inside of me. Of course children will not share this with their parents. They still dont know up to today whats going on with me. I dont even know who i am anymore or what i am. I always dream of dragons, such majestic creatures, and then they are hunted down by humans all for greed and glory. I found my love for dragons a while ago, not the type of love you would see in a furry community. I kind of praise them. I swore to never play any game or read any book where dragons are harmed. 
There is also only one god for me, and that is the law of mother nature, and nature will take it's revenge on us one day. 
Yes, i started to hate humanity. I was made being fun of my whole life by so many people. Only online i found some friends with 18 i can count on. 2 of them are still my best friends and we help each other wherever we can. Thanks to them, i turned back to normal, kind of. 
I still cant get over my hate and anger, everywhere i look i see the same faces. Faces who act all friendly, who demand to be friendly, but wont even give a homeless person some bread.
I am never really outside my doof except to buy food, go to work or walk my dog. But one time i did years ago and i saw a homeless woman, sitting on the street like dirt with thousands of people walking past her and ignoring her. I couldnt bear it, i had to go to the bakery and buy her some food. I just walked up to her, gave her the bread, she smiled at me, said ""Danke. Du bist wirklich nett"" (In english: ""Thanks, you are very kind"".) and suddenly, most people around us started clapping their hands.
Why are you clapping your hands?? I have nearly nothing and shared what i have. Instead of clapping, go to the store and buy her some food or give her at least one Euro. Clapping wont help anyone.
Thats whats making me sick. People appreciate the ones actually doing something for others without possibilities, but doing something by themselfes? All i think today when i see other people is ""hypocrite"".
However, this feeling i also sucked up to the point i dont realize it anymore.
Ive had so many negative feelings, and i dont know where they are anymore. I dont have any positive feelings about anything. No one ever cared for me in real life, so i stopped caring for myself.
I am right now sitting here, with some really wild hair. My parents tell me to go let them cut because it looks terrible. But i dont think i will because why should i? This is right now my whole existence. Why should i do anything? No ones caring anyway except my parents, but parents are parents, not your friends, not your love, not someone you can meet and build something up.
I dont know what to feel anymore. I dont know how to care anymore. I know i will never find any friends like this, but i also definitely cant get out of my situation. I am just sitting here, on my chair, doing stuff on my PC, everyday after going home from work, which i do with the most played neutral motivation someone could ever see. I just go there, work my hours, and go home.
I know if this is going to continue like this, i am going to die alone when i am old. And yet, i dont even know if i have a problem with that. My life has gotten full of emptyness. 

I just wrote down whatever came to my head what i remember. There is.... still so much more, but i would then still be writing for at least 3 hours.
I know, my english sucks here and there. It's just not my main language, mostly learned from communicating online. And maybe many things i dont have explained enough. I dont know. This is the first time ever i wrote something like this down. I dont feel better. I dont have hopes.
I just kinda wanted to finally write it down since in the last time, i was repeatedly asking myself, who i am, what i want to do and where my road will take me and to none of this i can find an answer.

Thanks to whoever is reading all of this. You may think good or bad of me, i dont know."
1250,"Hello, 

I just wanted to share this as I can't say it to anyone in my life - as I don't have anyone anymore who I can really open up to on this. The passion has been gone for me from my marriage for a number of years now, I like my wife as a person and don't want to hurt her but I have zero interest in her romantically anymore, but we have a child I adore and I know if I leave I won't be able to survive the depression and loneliness from not seeing my kid for probably 4 or 5 days a week - I just can't face it. My wife is still is in love with me and she seems blind to the reality of our situation or else she's ignoring it, we don't argue much at get on reasonably well - give each other a lot of space. I'm in my 30's so I figure try and hold out until my kid reaches her mid / late teens and by then she can choose for herself and she can see me as much as she wants. Thing is that's about 15 years away and it's hard to stay in a marriage which is essentially dead for me. But even the thought of not living with my child everyday is horrifying for me. Anyone else have experience like this?"
1251,"Hi all. Any guidance at all would be appreciated!

Just a little background: I am 30 and do not live with my parents. My mom, dad, and younger sister live together. My mom has been diagnosed with depression since menopause (~10 years now). She retired around 5 years ago, and since then her depressive episodes have been extremely long and terrible, especially in the past few years. Each time it’s about the same: she hardly eats (maybe 4x/week and it’s a few bites) or showers (2x/month) and she doesn’t get out of bed and doesn’t want to talk to anyone. Her episodes last around a month and she speaks of suicide often. In fact, she has been in an involuntary hold once after an attempt and has also had a voluntary check in to a hospital. She refuses therapy and stops taking medicine when she feels like it. She also is incredibly dependent on my abusive father (in all senses of the word) and they both live in this isolated bubble of judging everyone they know and don’t know, not realizing what toll it takes on themselves and the family. They both use the excuse that their generation doesn’t believe in mental health. Even my dad who sees his wife in this state thinks she can’t get help. He constantly begs me to come home and gets angry and lashes out at my family at home when I tell him that I’ve been trying for years but thay she needs more help. I know that my dad and sister have been doing everything they can for so long and much longer than me, since I haven’t lived at home since college (because of my family’s toll on my own mental health).

My mom is currently in one of these episodes of feeling extreme shame and misery, and while my sister and I have constantly pointed out the obvious reason she feels this way (having been controlled by an abusive man who she can’t live without, but who has also made her hate her own family members and friends) because we knew the trigger into this episode was because she was scared her husband would be jealous of the birthday gift my sister and I gave her, she is so stuck in her thoughts. For years I have been at her side, just letting her talk through her thoughts and offering love and support when she is ok and when she is not. She sometimes comes to the conclusion that her life has been stripped of its freedom after getting married to my dad, but that sends her into a depression that lasts weeks to months.

I just would like any sort of guidance. I know many people have told me to seek mental health guidance for myself and I have. But that doesn’t take away from the fact thay my mom is suffering. Nor does that take away from the fact thay my sister is dealing with this every single day while I just hear about it through the phone. I wish there was something I could do for my mom, but she feels burdened by thinking thay she is a burden on us. I never tell her anything to that effect, nor does my sister. But sometimes I think us telling her that we want to be there for her adds to her feeling of burden too. But when we give her space, she thinks we’ve given up on her. I’m at such a loss.. Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice they can give me? I would appreciate it so so so much."
1252,"hey, I'm new to this.
I'm not really sure how it all works. I've struggled with depression for a few years now. But only last month or so its gotten really bad. I don't want to be here anymore but I'm scared to die and wouldn't go through with anything. I don't know who to talk to, I cant tell my boyfriend, family or friends because I don't want them to know."
1253,"I had a fallout out with someone today. You might sit there saying to yourself ‘Come on mate get a grip and move on’ but it’s not as simple as that. This person I fell out with wasn’t just a friend, wasn’t just a best friend, she was a soulmate. We’d meet up near enough every day, having the time of our lives together, always making each other laugh and smile. Over the past year we’d created a bond stronger than just friends, we were family. We both knew each other’s parents and got along with them so well. Everything was perfect, we both felt like what we had was unbreakable and it would last forever. We had big things planned for the future: holidays together, making speeches at each other’s weddings, nights out together, heck, we even discussed moving in together but out of nowhere all of those plans and aspirations came crashing down and now I just feel hurt. I feel like without her there is just a big hole in my life and nobody can fill it because she was so special. I spent so much time with her and now that time will be spent crying in my bedroom alone thinking about what could have been. I just feel so hurt right now and whilst my bestie isn’t in my life, I don’t think I can ever recover. She was unique, one of a kind, special and I loved her and cared about her so much and I still do. I know we only fell out today but I’ve been crying non-stop and have contemplated suicide and self-harm because I don’t want to live a life, she’s not a part of and I just want her back. I know I wouldn’t have the bottle to actually commit suicide or self-harm but it really has been on my mind today. I’m not writing this as a cry for help but I just need someone to talk to right now to help me through this difficult time. I’ve never felt this low in my life and I’ve never really done anything like this before but I just feel there’s no other option. Until either I feel better and recover without her or we make up, I just need someone to talk to."
1254,"I haven’t seen a main/general discussion/check-in/just-talk thread on here so I thought I’d take a stab at creating one.

Right now I’m just checking in.  I’ve been away for some time, and I’ll get into that a bit later.  For now, hello to everyone.  Glad to be here today.

I wish everyone a better day today than they had yesterday.

Adam"
1255,"I recently have spoken to my 3rd psychologist as I continue to spiral. At least this one has a psychiatrist as part of the practice. 

I'm 41 and am completely and utterly lost. I can't start work, be at home, or deal with any stress of any kind. They don't know if its bipolar or depression yet. I stay in bed alot but don't sleep. My mind is constantly flashing images and thoughts that I can't control. 
I can hold long in depth conversions with someone while my mind is elsewhere. Almost as if I'm watching it all from inside my own head. I have panic attacks when trying to start a new job. I was leaving an industry to change careers and was set to start before corona hit and that was put on hold. Ive interviewed while freaking out inside, landed jobs but feel in my own mind im worthless, and that I am a failure at all I do. The little voice that tells me not to believe that has gotten softer and softer and I don't know what will happen if I don't hear it anymore. 
My wife is supportive but scared. I feel useless and need to provide for my family. What kind of a man can't get through his own thoughts to work? I was extremely successful before, cock almost but had to work 70 hours a week to do it with non stop after hours emails and calls. It broke me down worse. 
I have had 10 plus concussions. The last and was last year from a car accident which I'm still trying to recover from. 
I've had manic episodes going back to age 5 that I can recall and always sabotage or lost myself in the end. 

Sorry for rambling. I'm just so lost. I think about disappearing. Not hurting myself but just leaving my entire life and going to live as somewhere as someone else, living under a bridge. My wife could get my death benefit and my wife and kids would be free of me. 

I am sure many have it worse and I should suck it up.  I just can't."
1256,I tried amitriptyline 25mg and it's not helping with sleep. I don't want to take a benzos or anything addictive to get to bed does someone have help with what works for them?  I was looking into lemon balm
1257,"Lately my negative/suicidal thoughts have become more rational than emotional, at least that's what it seems like. I view life as something inherently negative and difficult and all the positive things as irrelevant, as these are just a distraction to make us feel like we're living for something, like it isn't all purposeless. And people who go along with it are the ones who are winning and finding some meaning in their life. So, putting aside my emotions, I feel like my only logical option is to stop living (not in immediate danger right now, just voicing my logical conclusions). My question is, if you've ever been in a similar situation, what helped you get out of it?

I've tried therapy and talking to my close friends and making positive changes and positive self-talk and so on, I'm currently trying to get myself diagnosed with whatever I may have, but I feel like antidepressants will only help with the emotions, not the obvious absurdity of ""trying to be happy"". I would absolutely hate a domestic life or trying to find happiness through finding a partner, but it kind of feels like what you're supposed to do. And I would hate to find happiness in momentary things, like waiting forward to a better job or some certain event, because that happiness is temporary and doesn't come from within. So I'm kind of stuck here, since nothing feels like it really has a point and being ""happy"" also weirdly doesn't feel a good enough state to be in? Idk how to explain it, it's kind of like I need chaos in order to even imagine being content. Sorry for all the rambling, I'm just hoping maybe someone has any kind of advice on what might have helped them."
1258,"Good Morning All,

I'm not quite sure why I'm here or what to expect of it. But I'm giving this a shot, I'm going to be honest and upfront, I'm going to not lie to you all like I do everyone everyday. It's a bit cowardly because none of you know me in real life or will ever know me, so it's a little safer. Here's some thing's I haven't said out loud yet. 

1) I'm suicidal, I have passive suicidal thoughts often. I once made a plan and attempted suicide, I called my ex who talked me out of it. This was almost two years ago. I do not want to die now and I do not have a plan. But I do think about how much pain would be relieved by this and I question constantly why I'm here and what's the point when everyday just feels like it's on a loop. 

2) I have an amazing partner, he's the same ex who stopped me from committing suicide, we got back together a few months after that. I've cheated on him too many times to count. I am a disgusting human being and yes I know there is a special place in hell for cheaters like me. I haven't cheated in quite a long time, no I don't expect applause or kudos or anything over this, but I'm just glad that I haven't done it. I will not be telling him that I cheated, this is selfish I already know this. I'm flat out a BAD PERSON, I think this thought a half million times a day, no it doesn't make any of it better and no it doesn't ""repent' or ""fix"" things. It never will, I will always be a bad person for my actions. So please don't make me feel worse, unless its going to lead to getting better. I know what I am and I'm sorry and I can't change it.

3) Two years ago after my breakup and HIV diagnosis, I had this fire and ambition. It was amazing, I got in shape, I ran a 10k and had a decent time, I was really moving upward at work, even though I was taking care of it alone my house was always spotless and my yard manicured. I took my dog on regular walks and trips and I was close to family and friends. I don't know how this was possible, I think about trying to do all of that now and its more than intimidating, it doesn't seem logically possible or sustainable. How can I do these things, I know there weren't extra hours in the day. How come I'm a complete and utter failure when I'm with the person I love but not when I was devastated and crying every 2 minutes. 

4) I have a goodish job that I don't deserve and I'm not qualified for. I work a lot, which is another struggle when trying to make room for life. My job requires 9hrs a day during the week at the least and it's a 45min commute both ways, so yes I work very full time. My job is complex and requires a lot of structure and mental agility, I don't always have this. I find myself confused most of the time and I'm not any where near as intelligent as my coworkers. I'm good at bullshitting though, so I'm able to smile through it. 

Thanks for reading that, I know it was not fun. Does anyone else live or feel like this?"
1259,"Hi, I don't know if I feel like posting my entire story but my intro post has info I think. Basically I'm just doing badly again. My anxiety isn't the main problem any more, but depression has got worse. I think. I'm just sick of trying, so I don't do it. I feel like I have so much health crap going on, that I'm supposed to be dead. And I just get annoyed at everyone. People's drama keeps getting on my nerves. I just feel like I'm a crap person. Horrible thoughts went through my head when I was on moclobemide and also when I was not on anything else. I'm reminded of being a teenager and the same thing being the case. I feel like I'm stuck in poverty, and even doing the slightest thing feels hard. I walked to the postbox today and that was the first time I'd left the house in a week, apart from taking out rubbish. I struggle to do it these days. I just feel like, everyone else has to put up with my sh**, and why should they have to. Wish the chronic pain and nausea would go away. Wish everything would, to be honest. Sorry."
1260,"But I am unable to.

My love. I openly forgive you for always putting me last.

I thank you for all of the humiliations in front of the people whom hate me.

Thank you for the pain keeping me up at night.

Thank you for all of my anxiety and worries.

I fought for years for you to hurt me like this over and over again.

I have been working all these years and I have little to nothing to show for it.

I thank you for the good night sleep you are able to get when I am in undescribable pain.

Thank you for all of the times I rebuilt this relationship. And thank you for pushing me away.

Thank you for abusing me and always making me feel like it was always my fault.

Thank you for hurting my parents when they hear my words.

Thank you for allowing me to forgive you, even though tomorrow you will move on without pause.

Thank you for showing me the silk string that has kept our marriage together.

I forgot how many times I sowed it around our hearts.

I thank you for all of the painful moments you scarred my heart with.

Thank you for abandoning me when you knew it was my biggest fear..

You remind me of the dumpster I was abandoned as a child in.

I remember the football that I sowed together with red string to keep intact; not knowing it was inflated by air.

I remember the rain of that day. I remember all of the rain you placed in my heart.

Thank you for braking my heart over and over again.

Thank you for the shame I feel inside. Thank you for reminding me of just two years ago.

Thank you for showing me the next two years.

This year I will not shave my head bald in tears for you. In front of the mirror. Listening to Wake me up inside by Evanesence on repeat.

The neighbors will not hear me sobbing after you beat on me.

You will not place me back in financial ruins over and over again.

I will never let you see me cry.

I will no longer repair this relationship by myself. If you continue to pull away. I will allow you to fall into the grand canyon outside of my soul.

If I am garbage to you. I will allow you to throw me out because I promise this is the last time you step on my heart.

The torture of sleepless nights ends today.

If you walk away from me from today forward I will take it as a direct sign from God that my heart does not belong to you, and I will seek that person God has ordered for me.

I will no longer carry your pain in my heart. I will no longer fight your battles.

I will not abandon you how you have always abandoned me. But I will walk away from your tortures.

I will be free to spread my wings and fly once again.

Because before I take flight. I have already forgiven you.

I accept Gods will.

I will not allow you to hurt me ever again.

Unless you can finally apologize on your own accord and without my guidance.... I know never to return to this painful prison you seem to want to keep my love in.

My heart has felt enough pain from you.

If you do not love me unconditionally. Do not hurt me or harm my heart.

If you can not find it in your heart to love me. Have the heart to not hurt me. And have the heart to allow me to find pure love.

I forgive you for this pain I feel.

And I pray that if you want to leave me. You go.

I will raise our son with love. And never take our pictures out of my office.

I will allow myself to heal.

Loving you with my entire heart was not a mistake.

If your heart is unable or unwilling to love me. It. Is. Not. My fault.

If you love me you will show me every day. And if you don't it is okay.

Your ability to not love me but, hurt me is your own problem. And not mine.

I free myself from all of this pain. Because of you I have learned how not to treat a person.

I deserve love and happiness. Even if you don't understand that. 

I know that you witnessed my daily prayers for our future. 

I have done everything from my heart. I understand that only a person in pain causes pain. 

I pray that you find it in your heart to finally love me because if you walk away and abandon me again. I am not going to stop you.

I will not me in a marriage by myself. 

But I am going to love myself."
1261,"My depression has affected my ability to work in the past but I've been able to hide it and I've never had any issues with deadlines. I've just had days when I couldn't do anything or I'd cry at work or I couldn't focus but no one ever knew because it wasn't reflected in the work I produced.

I'm filing out a health form and I'm not sure of the practical reason for the questionnaire but I get rewards for completing it so obviously I'm going to finish it! However, they ask questions about ""have your felt depressed"" and I always lie about it. It feels wrong, especially because I think I'm skewing some data they're collecting by lying. But mostly it makes me sad that I fear backlash if I'm honest about struggling."
1262,I would still be depressed. But at least I could stay home and watch TV all day and eat. I would hire a maid and a personal chef.
1263,"Hello there,

I am here to try and findout what's 'wrong' with me, and maybe find some people that deal with the same problems as I do, as I don't know what to do anymore :(

Here's some of the stuff I'm dealing with:


I honestely can't remember the last time I truly felt happy. Not with the big stuff (like getting my own house) nor the small stuff (girlfriend asking me out, friends wanting to do something). I never ever feel like ""yes that be fun!"" I'm just like okay sure. I don't really feel motivated for going, but I know that I must. My girlfriend is especially struggling with this as I cannot 'hide' from her. She doesn't see me laughing and she doesn't see me being happy. She only sees my very neutral facial expression and she just knows I don't seem to care. It hurts her as she thinks I don't want to do anything with her.



I am unmotivated and I don't have any passions. Where I see people all around me enjoying their hobbies or work or whatever they're up to and I'm just here having no clue if there will ever be something that will attract my attention. I don't have subjects to talk about because I don't have anything going on, there's nothing interesting for me. It mostly always sounds boring to me.



I am currently doing a job in IT (for 3.5 years now) but never really been happy about it. But at the same time, looking at job offers literally makes me feel depressed. Where I know plenty of people have motivation for their jobs, some even have fun, I literally find nothing interesting. I know jobs aren't really meant to be fun (I guess?) but atleast they should be for a bit? All the job offers I've read sounds extremely boring.



I've been doing things my entire life that most people don't understand. And honestely, I dont understand either. I am speaking about basic stuff here like brushing my teeth, personal hygiene, cleaning the house, visiting the barber.. I know it's wrong and that I shouldn't do this but I somehow just can't get myself to it most of the time. It's like I don't care (especially to others) but I know deep down somewhere I do, yet I can't...



I feel quite tired most of the time. Social interactions aren't that tiring but I really don't want too much social interaction or I will feel a bit.. weird in my head. Like a heavy head. 


I had myself researched for autism about 1.5 years ago and the result was that I am not autistic. I've stopped my search for answers back then until now. I don't really know what to do anymore... it would already mean alot to me if I could even just find 1 hobby that really interests me alot just so that I can forget about the rest, and maybe feel some sort of happyness.

Is there perhaps anyone here with a similar story?"
1264,"I hate that mental illness is hereditary. I didn’t ask for this. My mental state isn’t where I expected to be at my current stage of life. I can’t bitch and complain, which I’d love to to do, but what good would it do? My brain is what it is. My life is the best I can do. I’m not even remotely admirable. On most days, I struggle to maintain some semblance normality. I don’t like feeling weak or fundamentally flawed, but I am. I try so hard to turn it all around, but I can’t seem to maintain my discipline. No matter how hard I try, the depression eventually takes over again and then it becomes a win to simply get out of bed and take a shower.. I’m not proud to admit to any of this. As bad as it sounds, it’s exponentially worse to live through. 

My point is that no one is a “freak” or alone. Everyone is going through something.. always. When you see someone/anyone, you don’t know what they’re dealing with everyday. That should give you a pause when you want to judge them or hate them. We’re all the same. We feel pain, we have flaws, and we are all fundamentally dealing with our own human problems always. Why not try to help each other rather than trying to singularly focus on our differences. 

We’re all confused, scared, lost, and searching for meaning. Why constantly separate ourselves into groups when we are all ultimately dealing with the same problems as humans. Love of family, fear of death, wanting to be better, and the utter confusion about why we’re here and what our purpose is, is all universal. Who gives a shit about black, white, man, woman, gay, or straight. We’re all just people.. Think about that.. we’re all the same and we’re all in the same crazy boat traveling thousands of miles/hour around the sun. We’re all just people and I don’t know about you, but I could use others like me to lean on. I’m not perfect.. I’m severely flawed. I’m sure a lot of us are. 

We, as humans, have so much more in common than we have differences.

Please remember that. It’s very very important to remember that we’re all more alike than we are different.. I’m sure there’s millions of others out there like me that need a friend. Race, gender, or sexuality couldn’t matter less. Try asking someone how they’re doing. They may say “fine”, but spend a little time with them because they are ultimately more like you than they’re not. It’s not complicated..if you think it or have felt it, that person has too. 

Life is tough enough people.. I think we all could use others to give us a hand, or maybe even just a compliment from time to time. If you need an ear, I’d gladly listen to whatever’s on your mind and I truly mean that."
1265,well it's been nearly four years since I've needed to join any support groups and was feeling on top of my depression well living with it last few months even pre covid was staring to feel I was loosing the battle again with my thoughts and moods reluctant at first to speak go as to me I felt I should cope talking to people who know me wanting to shut away again but then covid lockdown happened and I felt I could slip away from society although I had to go to work through it all to cut along story short impact on relationship back to go which I was glad I did back on some meds n trying to cope once again which is so hard and the older I get even harder I hope to chat to people who understand where I'm coming from instead of here we go again and it will be ok xx
1266,I am so depressed again for the second day I dont know why maybe it is because next Wed it would have been 16 years since my husband passed away and I am missing my mom.I dont know confused to and I just feel out of whack.Like I dont belong here.So I have been just laying down all day.Watching Xena .I am afraid to be alone.I dont understand that either. I just feel so messed up.I have a doctors appointment on Sept 15 and when I spoke to my shrink the other day he said he doesnt know if it will be in his  office .I dont think so I dont want to leave my house to scared and because of this virus too.
1267,"I will cut to the chase. I wish I had someone else to talk to besides the thoughts in my own head. It gets stale pretty quick and suffocating after a while and the 2 years that prolonged my aggravation hasnt provided much. I dont mean to come on to anybody with vengeful anger about it or to complain or bitch but, as many of us here undoubtedly Express, I dont have much options when it comes to maintaining my own personal insanity or expressing my distress. I'm sick of feeling alone. Beyond fucking sick of it in a way I cant express here. I'm sick of myself, my feelings, my own head. I'm sure some of you can relate. Not that I shouldn't take responsibility for whatever flaws I may have but, essentially, it wasn't like others were jumping to help. Cant expect them but still. It still would be nice to have someone on my side for a damn second. I apologize for the anger expressed here. I dont get along with people real well or just real shy and awkward in others. The fact that my anxiety and depression comes out so much brings out rage in me and frustration. To the point where I cant stand myself anymore nor the empty life I live. I'm not here to give everyone a suicidal diatribe or anything. I guess I'm just fed up with being ok with four walls to talk to. It was like this before quarantine and now it's the rule which, of course, DOESNT help. Yet again why would there be help in the first goddamn place? But I'll concede that's just an immature part of me talking. Anyway, thanks for reading my spiel if you did. As long as I don't take up any unnecessary time or anything from any if you."
1268,"I am currently abroad visiting extended family, and I just heard my 'fling' from four years ago is visiting in a week. He would like to meet and catch up. 
I have already been here for three weeks, and my depression is becoming more daunting every single day. I barely have the energy to get up in the morning, and feel no excitement to go to the beach or do any of the things that are 'expected' in this climate. 
Additionally, I am currently in my eating disorder recovery, and am staying with an aunt that has let her underlying anorexic patterns and jealousy towards me take over. It is extremely triggering to share meals, and I feel my self-confidence weaken every time we get ready to go out in the streets. She also 'mocks' me for my depressed behavior, comparing me to a bat for 'staying in my room and not seeing daylight', only coming out to eat. I have tried to pick myself up by going out for lunch and ice cream etc, but then she mocks me for going alone, referring to it as a lonesome and sad thing to go wihout friends. She doesn't see the importance of finding comfort in one's own company, or learning to love who you are without outer recognition. 
My fling lives in the capital and doesn't have a lot of spare time on his hands, so this is my only chance of seeing him. We have an incredible emotional connection, and I believe we have a mutual romantic affection for one another. He makes me feel wonderful about myself, and has always been there for me. Nonetheless, he has a girlfriend who is coming with him, and she is extremely concerned about letting him see me. She previously blocked me, and when I went to the capital to see some mutual friends of him and I - he specifically told them to not mention I was there to avoid 'drama and conflict'. I don't want to interfere, but it would be nice to say hi before we go back to our different realities.
There is a plane home in a few days. I'm not sure if I should take the first plane home and prioritize self-maintenance and seeing my mother again above seeing him, when there's no reason for me to 'expect' anything from him but a bitter girlfriend. If I stay, the next plane is in two weeks, and I don't think I can bear the thought of staying here any longer.
 
What would you do if you were in my shoes?"
1269,:low:
1270,"So I've have been dealing with depression since I can recall.  8 or 9 wanting to be dead all the time.  Very few friends and never treated for it.  
I have a lot of other physical conditions like severe asthma since birth (I'm now 50).  In high school I started developing essential tremors and they have progressively gotten worse for 35 years with age comes normal vision and hearing issues.  When I was 26, I had my first back surgery.  Thinking I screwed it up 20+ years later I went to see why I hurt.  I had been walking around with a broken neck for a couple of years and had degenerative disk disease. Two weeks out of surgery I had to move, no money and 2 teenage daughters to move all my stuff.  Neck never healed correctly.  A week latter my appendix ruptured and I almost died from infection.  Just last October I had another back surgery.  I have severe tinnitus and the ringing never stops. Nore does the pain, the shakes and twitching or the fact that I'm always short of breathe.  Now I developed an issue with vertigo due to a TBI I got apparently when I broke my neck.  
Now divorced for 12 years and still single, not a friend to talk to, both my girls are adults on their own.  Now I have a second Grandchild on the way.  
I'm just mentally done with the chronic issues. They wear a person down.  Without insurance (I'm on Disability) I can't go to counseling or afford half my meds every month.   
My girls don't want to take care of me and I am sick of being sick and alone. 
I'd never put the pain be put on my girls, so I suffer so they don't have to.  I'm just tired. A kind of tired that sleep will never fix.  Adding the stress of this Rona crap and mask Police always confronting me just puts me over the top. 
Sorry for the long rant.  No one wants to hear the list, at least I was able to get it all out."
1271,"What did I do wrong? How’d I end up here? I’m alone. Uninvited. Hopeless. I despise myself. My world isn’t spinning anymore. It’s standing still and time is not on my side. I’m 30 years old. I’m lonely. I make the wrong decisions. I’m not happy. I feel left out. I feel codependent. I feel worthless. It’s like my heart stays broken. I work as much as possible to try to keep myself busy because I hardly have any friends but I fail. I try to make friends but I’m always the low man on the totem pole so I’m cut out of things. I make the wrong choices with my career, my relationships, my physical self, my heart, my time. I. Make. The. Wrong. Choices. Every. Time. I’m in a hole I can’t get out of. I want to weigh less. I want to take up as little space on this earth as possible. I want to be so thin that people talk to me about how thin I am out of fake concern. Like I used to be. And even though I know they’d just be being nosy, at least i would feel like they’re concerned with me and for my wellbeing. I think I’ll be alone for the rest of my life as a consequence of the dumb choices I’ve made in my life. Maybe I should just die to be done with it. So that people mourn my loss of life but then forget about me or become numb to my absence. Maybe I should die so that my parents, my family, my friends don’t have to be burdened with me. My complaints. My worthless life. Maybe I should stop eating for so long that my body shuts down and my heart stops. That way I’m miserable for a long time on the way out since it would take a while for me to actually die. To just not be anymore. Maybe I deserve to suffer through my death. Maybe. Probably. I should just go. I’m disgusting. Goodbye. I hope your lives are all better without me. I’m sorry. I should have done better. I should have been better."
1272,"I ask because I haven't took my fluoxetine for a few weeks and have been having some withdrawal symptoms like feeling sick, numb, dizzy etc. More importantly though I think my mood is crashing as I have felt lower recently and been worrying about my appearance again and doing OCD type things related to it which I on't go into detail with for now (these things are more controlled when I am on my fluoxetine). I need to get back on them. I am on an anti-psychotic too which I get injected every four weeks (clopixol) but my medication seems to work best in tandem.

How do you feel when you miss your medication?"
1273,"Hello 👋 I am trying to move out of my flat and recently got told that people are not allowed in my flat due to the covid-19
Virus. 
Which means I may not get alot of help moving all of my stuff to and from the flat to a new one. I don't know for definant if I have it but I do have a feeling I've got it if that makes sense?

I live in supported living which means there are staff there 9/5 at the moment but I do feel extremely stressed at the moment which is causing my anxiety to be bad.

Have any of you moved out of supported living into independent living? If so how did you cope x"
1274,What is an accurate online depression test? Each one I take has different results.
1275,"Hi. 

So I have probably had depression for awhile and anxiety not as long but more recent. However my depression certainly got more real and severe recently. As I was escaping depression new world I was trying to enter hit me everything I've missed while being depressed which led to a new level of depression and worry and sadness and anxiety. 

Anyway for the first time I have had pretty noticeable physical implications...

I feel older suddenly. I am now obsessed by age and scared of getting older. I feel like I look older. Suddenly as a guy who had a very fast metabolism and didn't put on weight almost no matter what...suddenly I'm gaining weight despite not really eating that much only in the abdomen area like a beer belly without the beer....

It's also extra panic and worry to me...and I have no idea if this is reversible is this normal....have I ruined my body through stress? Any helpful ideas or experienced people? Thanks"
1276,"Hot dog

I've eaten.. Which is a step up.. I had a tin of eight hot dogs and that's all.. My freezer quit a couple of weeks into the lock down and I've been unable to replace it... so  I'm really limited as to what food I can keep... been living off prawn cocktail crisps and dairylea spread on brown bread... I wonder how long it will be before I start eating tins of cat food... I'm turning into a bag lady.

after I ate I put some Red Dwarf on the Tv and sat up straight in the middle of the couch... don't remember what happened after that really.. I was dizzy and............................

ended falling asleep sitting up.. Which is an art I've mastered recently.. I dunno why.. Maybe its because IM old...

I just want to die !.. I'm old and I have no future.. All I can see is my own death... the bit I don't like is all the paths between here and there look painful... dying isn't easy... 

 why is it so hard to kill yourself ?.. there doesn't seem to be a easy way out.

I'm down to a minority of one again... and nobody will help me... God hates me !.. So why doesn't he just kill me ? I'm somehow dammed to walk the earth for some reason... I'd much rather be dead at this point...

Suicide is always in my thoughts these days... I wish I could find the courage to just do it... but I've haven't got a way out... it seems my death is going to be long and drawn out.. Maybe that's what God wants... a slow lingering painful death."

1280,"Hey, I have serious depression for 7 years. I take medications from start and go to psychotherapy for half a year.

1281,"Hi. Ive been joining to forums since some years, so fae I havent met people I can have good conversations. I dont have anyone in my contacts lists that Ive met in the forums.

I check the forums pretty often, I spend some good time reading the threads and sometimes replying.

The thing is that I dont feel Im talking with anyone ! 

Forums are just a bunch of words. I deal with lonelines, and forums help me to distract a bit, but sometimes (like now) I start to feeling a rush.

I feel so alone, no one to talk, no one to tell my things, I just deal with my stuff alone. I write and write new topics in forums pretty usual, at least 1 or 2 times a month, but just a couple of replies and then nothing, I try to reach people even just to talk about their problems so at least I can have some conversation, they stop replying.

Its just a big void, stress me a lot live in loneliness.

There is another here who also miss having serious conversations with another one ?"
1282,"What should I do? My depressed girlfriend broke up with me due to needing space, but gets mad when I give it to her and she still wants to go on dates with me.

Before we started dating she warned me about going through depressing stages, pushing people away, and being insecure. We've been together for 2 years, when she feels overwhelmed or too stressed, she goes into depression. It's happened before, but this time was the worst and she told me she wants to start over as friends, take things slow, doesn't want to bring me down, but still wants to go on dates, but doesn't want the pressure of a relationship. I feel in my heart I would regret it if I walk away. She says she sees a future with me but wants us to pause our relationship.

She started initiating contact the next day after asking for a break and got angry for not hearing from me.  She wants space, but expects to hear from me everyday and still wants to go on dates."
1283,"Yeah!  

Deathly silence seems to be my only friend, most nights. Hot night. Fan on. Typing away. No family contact. Nobody I can call friend to talk to. 

What is all this for? What are we here for? If we have so many nights like this in our lives, why are we even put here? What celestial purpose is served by me craving friends and company, but to go on spending night after night, year after year, without them, and missing having some.

In the end, I realised it was pointless having continued contact with my other sister, so, during a time when my phone line was out of order, I rethought my days and times and decided that I'd not phone her, again, when the line was repaired. 

And, y' know?...I've not missed anything. 

After talking to her about the dog, her health and how her son was, every subject I brought up elicited only silence from her.  There were far too many times when I'd end a paragraph of talking with, ""What do you reckon?"" and there'd be silence.  After the fourth second, she'd have the bloody cheek to ask me if I WAS STILL THERE!  Anything other than her only subject of domesticity, and it would be, ""I don't know,"" [followed by silence] or ""I've never thought about it,"" [followed by silence] or ""I wouldn't know about that."" [followed by silence]  There'd be no natural tendency to just come back on what I'd said and I think, in the end, I realised that I would be missing nothing by no longer having those calls. It's just a mixture of courtesy and ""conversationalism"", in the end...the readiness to show an interest in what the other person is talking to you about. It's not rocket science.

And, to be honest, I've noticed the faintest traces of me growing stronger because of that. One of my sisters is a sociopath, the other is so far up herself, she won't lower herself to talk, unless it's about her household's health and how the dog is. Take her beyond those subjects and she's clueless. What could I possibly have lost, in cutting ties?

To make matters worse, my GP retires later this year and, it's been made pretty clear, I would then no longer be able to remain with the practice, because he's the only GP, there, who was willing to make house calls and none of the others, he suspects, would want to do any such thing. And, it just keeps getting worse.

Apparently, I'm then out of the catchment area and I'll have to go to another practice. My GP did say, on the phone, that other people outside the catchment area, who can even just occasionally go into the Centre, can remain with them, because of those trips there, THAT I CAN'T DO! But, because I am completely unable to go to the Centre, I don't get the luxury of staying with them.  I'VE BEEN HOUSEBOUND WITH AGORAPHOBIA FOR 22 F---ING YEARS, FOR GOD'S SAKE! (Give or take the occasional outdoors trips.)

I believe that life moves in cycles of 7 years - ""Septocycles"", if you like.  I'm at an age where I know that my next 7 years, 2020-2027, shift me from a great Septocycle, right into a hellish next Septocycle of badness! I'm half way through the first year of seven and I'm already feeling unable to cope.

So, I'll ask it again...what is the point in being here? What possible purpose do I serve, in the lives of others, that justifies me being around!? Somebody said to me, yesterday, ""When you're going through Hell, keep going!"""
1284,"To make a long story short, my girlfriend asked for us to take a break, but not break up and still go on dates. This was due to depression and stress she is experiencing.

I made a thread about it here: My depressed girlfriend wants a break, but not a breakup

She asked for me to be her friend, support her, and listen, but not fix her problems. How do I go about getting her to open up, so that I can listen just like she asked? 

It's kind of hard to listen when she's not  opening up, but I don't want to be too pushy"
1285,"i have a very very difficult time getting in touch with my doctor.this happens a lot.rite now im out of adderall as of today.had this happen a few tines before with the longest i had tonwait when i was out was 4 days from what i remember before i was able to get the scripts.

rite now i take 60mg of fluoxetine,i have noticed that if i take 3, 20mg and then go back to my 40mg and 20mg, it seems to help and i can feel it working.(different mg as i pay out of pocket and its cheaper)

i also take 40mg of adderall a day.something ive been taking on and off as a kid and decided to get back on.today im out and cant get my doc to send my scripts,answer phone or return calls.

im also taking lmethyfta at 15mg a day..i was on deplin but switched over to a big brand on amazon due to price.not sure the one i order on amazon  really works but it seems like i feel a little better than before after taking it.

im suppose to take mertazipine at night to help with sleep but i worry it will be too strong for me and i wont be able to get up in case of emergency or for work.

for a while now.my moods change.1 minute i have lots of energy and get up to do things.the next im sooo tired and just want to rest.to the point i miss work.like a week.thrn go back to work for a few days and so on.been like this for months.

when i first started taking my meds.i had so much energy, i didnt know what to do with it.i just want my energy back so bad that itself can be depressing.it makes me want to leave work even more.

my wife is now ""encouraging"" me to leave work due to some family problems as we live with family memebers until weather cools so we can setup rv on our property and get the well up and running plus a good generator as we are going off grid.

the thought of that makes me want to pack up and just go do it due to the fact i can start farming.no neighbors or internet etc.i can focus on myself.

this is affecting my work and even relationships severly.i thought about disability,but i dont think i qualify and dont want to sit at home just being given money.i rather work,especially on my farm,qeldong and small engines.

when i take my adderall.a little energy comes back for a couple hours.i have a hard time taking new meds and even adderall i was nervous even though i took it many times as a kid during school year.

sorry this is soooo long.just want to get things out for a better understanding and for advice.

to the point...

is there any way i can boost my energy?i want to get up and move again like when i first started taking my meds.any way to get a trial of deplin so i can at least verify thats also part of my problem or anywhere that sells genuine 15mg of lmethyfolate?
thank you everyone."

**First of all, please, if you are depressed and do not have a strong grip on it do not read my post. I am taking fluff away so it’s gonna be depressing. Please, I do not want anyone to suffer: if you are struggling yourself you should not help others even if it is tempting.**


I have been reading many posts about depression, on many platforms, and one thing I noticed is that depressed people like to talk about themselves, their lives, their mistakes etc. It seems to be an 'irrestitible urge'. I wonder why this trait is so common in depressed people including myself and if it is in itself a symptom or perhaps a 'warning light' that these people (us) ignore for a long time until it becomes a compulsive behavior. This behavior leads them to constantly analize themselves and their past under a negative, melancholic, light perhaps fueling the issue. At any rate, this is my story, and where I am at.

I am a 40 years old man who has immigrated to the States from Europe 17 years ago. I moved to the States because it is where my now wife was from when I met her 18 years ago. I don’t have any family here and I am not good at making friends. At the age of 30, while wondering all my life about my difficulty making friends, my mother told me when I was a kid I was diagnosed with Asperger’s. Mind you, these are the 80s in Europe, times were different back then so, my mom decided to not have me officially diagnosed and shoved the news under the carpet. Also note, I do not resent her as she thought the label and the associated stigma would affect my life: I think she made the right decision. In my life, I never purpously stole, robbed, deceived or harmed any other human being. I overall consider myself a decent person...but I know I cannot be, otherwise I would have more people around me.

I am no stranger to depression. My first encounter with it, also the first time I considered taking my life, I was 12. Then again once during my teens (of course) and adulthood (because why not) and now, during the Covid Pandemic, I think I am going through some of the toughest times of my life. The interesting thing is that I do not consider to have had or have a tough existence. I wasn’t abused (at least I don’t think) I wasn’t in a violent dysfunctional family and, even though I had an horrible relationship with my dad that led me to leave home at 17, I think my childhood was pretty decent if not even plain good. My dad ended up ubruptly leaving this world 3 years ago, just for the records. Anyhow, even in this Pandemic I am working so it is not effecting me economically but mentally. I work and sleep...that's pretty much all I do most days.

My wife, the person I love and admire the most on this planet, has always struggled to find her place in this world, identity-wise and career-wise. She has always blamed circumstances for the decisions she made and goes about her life resenting those decisions as, if they weren't dictated by circumstances, she wouldn't have made them.

5 Years ago (after I had finished my schooling) I thought it would have been a good time to try having kids: my wife disagreed and saw that as too much pressure that led us to break up for some months. I moved out as she wanted to 'find her place'. Months later she contacted me and wanted to try it again. I reluctantly (due to the suffering experienced during that break up) said yes. We slowly restarted where we left from but some things never felt the same again. The pain I experienced grieving her loss might have scarred me forever. However, although upset at first, I do not resent my wife for doing what she did; she never did anything on purpose to hurt me, she truly felt the need to act as she did.

3 years ago my wife, was diagnosed with MCTD. We investigated the origin of a skin rash she had for months and that lead (because I asked the doctors for it) to an ANA panel which unearthed the condition. That year I had a severe moment of depression and panic. I wish I had been stronger to support my wife but, in the end, she was the one taking care of me. I feel like I always end up hurting the person I love the most in a way or another. I despise myself for that.

At that point she seemed like she wanted to have kids (fear of missing out perhaps) but I was not on board with that. The break up 2 years before had devastated me and to date I still have not fully recovered from it psychologically (and I am not trying to be dramatic, I hope you believe me). Again, I do not blame her for my pain: I want to make that clear. I just was not in the right state of mind.

And here we are now, I am 40 and she is 38 and we do not have kids.

I was prescribed Lexapro for depression a couple of months into the pandemic timeline. I am reluctant to take medications because I do not want to be enslaved to them the rest of my life. So, illogically, I have instead self medicated using THC for the past few months. being such a widely used 'light' illecit substance, I thought it was gonna be easier for me to break free from it.  Unfortunately, I think I was wrong.

Don't get me wrong: I don't normally do drugs. Last time I did any kind of illegal drugs it was 20 years ago and I probably had done it 5-6 times. It would help with sleep back then. So anyhow, THC allowed me to re-live a number of events from my past; memories I could never retrive before. Many memories from my past, in fact, I could never remember - I link the 'block' to the relationship with my dad but I can’t be sure. So, these memories helped me being more serene and, for some time, made my depression go away almost completely. Of course, TCH is addictive so, six months down the line, I was consuming it at an increasing rate to the point that some days it was all I would do. I realized I was in this drug's grip and needed to do something about it. In that precise moment my wife, who had lost her job at the beginning of the pandemic and had been depressed herself, started talking about a possible separation. Her reasoning was because of the many things she couldn’t do in her life because of me. She had been isolated for two years barely seeing anybody else as she started working from home and, when the pandemic started, she stopped seeing any human being but me for five months. I think our living situation was already a precarious one before Covid hit, so when it did, its intensity was heightened for my wife as a result of all these conditions. I stopped consuming THC...and had a panic that lasted a whole day short after. My wife had to help me through it and, being that she had no idea I started using THC to fight my depression, she might have thought that it was all a reaction to her decision of separating. So, logically, I started using THC again to avoid these panic attacks, but this time I would just use it at night to sleep and decreasing the amount every day in hope that, when I will attempt again, the panic attacks will be manageable by myself.

Starting a few months before the pandemic hit (Feb 2020 here in the US) my wife has been losing weight. As I write this (six months into the pandemic)she is 15 lbs lighter than she was when it started. And she has not been trying to lose weight. She is also losing her hair at an increased rate, so we have been seeing doctors to figure out how to stop this. She seems to be ok most of the times, I don't know if she just doesn't show her worries or really worries less. She is the kind of person who cannot take medications regularly and seems to be able to focus only on the things she is interested in. She has ADHD. I am constantly thnking and researching about her condition and finding ways to prepare for it and keep her as healthy as possible. This is eating at me. I wish I could take all her issues myself and suffer in her place instead. But, because of my mental state, she has to continually reassure me things are fine. I know she is experiencing a full on existential crisis and I cannot help her with it. I am weak, when I should be strong. I think this is not gonna end well for us but, at least, if that makes her happy I guess I could wrap my head around it eventually. I just worry about her...and myself. I worry, that is all I do. Every minute of my life. I look at things and start having heart burn because I don't see their point. I am growing increasingly skeptic of my own purpose and, for that matter, the one of anyone else. These recent developments are leading me to not see the point of life and longer. Everything I did in my life, the suffering endured to achieve anything I have ever achieved, amounted to nothing and, among all of that, I am increasingly more afraid of being alone. Recently, I find myself constantly picturing an old and alone me, and I can't think of a way that could be a happy life at all.

So, here I am, 40 years old, no kids, no family around me in a country where I don't really know anybody except for a large number of acqueintances. I tried to make friends but it never worked out. Or maybe it did but I never noticed. I am still relatively healthy and good looking. I am intelligent in some way and have a good career. Even without my wife I should be able to be happy but for some reason I can't. I fell into the trap of thinking that others can make you happy and stayed in that trap for 18 years when I know the only one that can make one happy is one self. But I don't know how and I fear one of these days I will finally get in it just deep enough to not be able to get out anymore. These events placed me in a situation where I can’t even understand if I am with my wife because of love or because I fear being alone. Does it have to either or? Could it be both?

I have not been blessed with a mind that understood the frequencies and the rhythms of this universe, unlike some lucky ones, for me it has been a wack-a-mole game in the dark that lasted my entire life, with more issues popping up that I could timely solve. The social interactions that for some are routine and simple for me can be a complicated maze to navigate trying to not get hurt or hurt anyone along the way. I know that until my mother is alive I have a reason to stay, but once she is gone I suspect the strength will go as well. I just hope in the mean time I learn something that could help me. I wish one day I""ll look back at all this like in the movies. Alive, alone or in company, crippled or healthy. I hope one day I could be reading posts like these written by younger people then I will be, and I’d be able to tell them what worked for me. I would be content even if I could help one of them as I wish right now that one would be me. But I have the feeling I won't see that.

I never did take Lexapro. I am waiting to get over my withdrawals to start taking it, it may be just a couple of days away. I am lost. I don't know what to do. I think about maybe trying having kids as it seems what everyone else does. Will that make things better? I doubt it and it could then ruin the lives of the children I would have. I just don't know what else to do. On the one hand I am thinking about letting my wife go on by herself to not damage her life anymore. On the other I would like to remain by her side to help her thorugh tough times should they come. And try having kids? Would that help either one of us? Is that a rightful reason to bring someone else onto this sad world? Can we even have kids at this age and with our conditions? I don't know.

I wrote this in hope that perhaps someone older who recognizes a similar life story or similar experiences will tell me what worked for them and shine their light on at least some of the path ahead. I know we are all unique but, with all the people on this rock, there has to be someone out there who can relate...at least in part I hope. And with those parts I could possibly build myself a raft to get out of this paralyzing cold and navigate a little further. If not, perhaps I will get past this on my own, and this will be a remaninder to myself about what I went through. Maybe I won't get past it, maybe I already gave up, and this piece will remain floathing in the ether years after I am gone; proof I was here after all. I had dreams and hopes that I seem to have misplaced and can no longer retrive. And so I left alone. You won't know, but if you couldn't help me maybe you can help someone else. If you got a grip on your depression and are strong now, help others who are weak, help me, and someday someone will help your daughters and nephews who could find themselves in my situation."
1287,hello I have just rejoined n was wondering if anyone was still on who I used to chat with not saying I don't want to chat with new people the forum helped me so much 4 years ago I rejoined recently has struggling again which I recognise it would be nice to chat too with people that understand think that's where I have gone wrong friends think I'm over it and when I mention the D word its avoided most of the time

1290,"Hey all! New member. I've suffered with depression and anxiety for over 20 years. I've been having suicidal ideation for about the last 5 years and now I've reached my end.

I'm terrified of dying. But I need to go! I've screwed up at work and am now facing disciplinary action (I opened my stupid fat mouth once to often and dropped myself in to a world of shit). Also a private chat with work friends has been spilled to management so I can't trust anybody at work any more!

I am therefore on my last warning at work, and I will fuck up again as it's in my nature!

The only way not to take my family down with me is to end my life!

Is it possible to be referred for assisted suicide outside the UK if you're not terminally ill? This may be my only way out of this mess!"
1291,"my family doesn't care if they are talking about how fat and heavy i am and i'm only around 160 or 155 they just don't care how that hurts me i was laying on our mini freezer and i was told to get off because i was fat and i made a face at my mom and i said rude, and she said ""whats rude about it you're bigger and you'll break it"" i don't think they know how bad i struggle with my appearance and my weight they don't give a shit if they hurt my feelings that i need to respect them because they are my parents i'm just a kid in a adult's body i would like the same respect i'm suppose to give them instead of being treated like shit i relieve my stress in the worst way possible but what else can i do listening to music doesn't help none of the things that are suppose to bring me ""joy"" help it feels like i don't enjoy things like i used to and i'm scared"
1292,"Ok so i wasn't sure where to post this really, its a bit odd. Basically i had a spider living in my bedroom, it was there for about a month and it didn't bother me, it was just minding its own business and where it put its web wasn't in my way so i left it alone and i got used to seeing it there. Last night a sprayed some deodorant in the room and immediately afterwards i saw the spider leaving its web and running away, it went under the bed i think but i didn't see it again. I then looked up and found out deodorant can kill spiders or at best it annoys them. Now i feel really bad about it. Ok i know it was only a spider but i didn't want to kill it or make it suffer. i got used to it being there and i sort of liked it. I feel really upset about it. What can i say? i knoe it must seem very odd and trivial but thats mental health for you i guess and things like this do bother me, if i see a bug in the house i always catch it to let it free rather than kill it. I didn't mind the spider being there because he would have caught the flies and so on. I know i didn't do it intentionally and i know it was just a spider but i still feel bad and i can't help it"

1296,"I am depressed for a very long time now and people tell me stuff like:

Get a different mindset

Don't keep hanging in the negative thinking

Do things you enjoy ( anhedonia ) I can't enjoy things :( 

You're harming yourself with your self talk ( negavitivy ) 

You're negative attitude is making us have a hard time too ( i don't do it on purpose... I hate myself )

You have to do it yourself, we can't change you

You are relying too much on others

You need to stop dwelling on things

And the most annoying one : You act like a victim and you have a high self pity all the time.

I REALLY DID NOT ASK FOR A DEPRESSION, WHY IS THIS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND FOR PEOPLE?

AND BECAUSE OF MY AUTISM I NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO THINK POSITIVE AGAIN, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME

AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE?

sorry for my capslock, i am losing faith 

I DO THINK THEY ARE 50 PROCENT RIGHT THOUGH, BUT I AM NOT MENTALLY STRONG ENOUGH TO ENDURE THIS ANYMORE...

ANYBODY HAS ADVICE ?"
1297,"I have 2 friends I talk to weekly. As bad as this might sound, in a perfect world these 2 people wouldn’t be my friends. With covid-19 there isn’t many opportunities socially right now and even if they were I have a lot of trouble making friends. My one friend especially has always insulted me but he has begun to do it more and more and in harsher ways. If I say something about it he says I can’t take a joke. He has started calling me and having people on the line without me knowing so they can make fun of my voice( I have a high voice). He knows I don’t have any other friends so he uses that against me and says this is how friends talk to each other. I know he isn’t my friend at all but he is the closest to a friend I’ve got. I have no dating life  either so I’d only have contact with the family members I live with. Idk what to do anymore. I know this probably sounds self centered with everything going on in the world but I feel so lonely and like a nobody. Nobody cares about what I’m doing or how I’m doing. The only person I hear from outside of my house is this guy who always talks down to me."
1298,"Ok , I realize I am somewhat fooling myself by asking for Only positive stories with THC/CBD used to treat depression. . But I need a win right now please. I recently went off leaxapro recently,( horrible side effects), and now I'm in the middle of Lexapro withdrawal symptoms, I got my medical marijuana license and am currently experimating with about 15 mg of THC and an equal 15 mg of THC, all in tincture form under the tongue.please let me know if you've had any relief for your depression or anxiety provided by THC and or CBD, also, maybe you've had good results with THC /CBD for easing Lexapro or any other meds withdrawal symptoms.i get horrible ,sudden,negative floods of emotion from the Lexapro withdrawal.it reaches into my brain and pulls out these relevant ,personal and negative outcomes for everything.its almost as if it knows me intimately."

1300,"I've been depressed for quite a while now. Initially I thought it was just a phase and I shared how i felt with my bestie. She's a really nice person, who totally gets me and I know she cares about me. But for me, after a few months of talking to her about these feelings, I stopped. She never complained but I kept on thinking how bored she must be hearing me rant on and on about what I'm going through. We haven't met for a while dur to this COVID 19 pandemic and I went out of my way to convince her I'm fine. But I'm not. And I'm dying to talk to talk to someone on my difficult days, but I can't bring myself to trouble her with my problems."
1301,"I've tried everything for self help to try and feel better. I haven't been diagnosed yet, but I'm thinking it's depression. Everyday I feel down in the morning, anxiety throughout the afternoon, fatigue, trouble sleeping some nights, etc. I still function, but I just dont feel right. Some days are better than others. I'm going to call my PCP or just go to a hospital for a mental health assessment. I tried another mental health center a few months ago and they weren't much help. Hopefully I can get this figured out soon."
1302,"So everything has gone wrong. I nearly killed my goldfish and probably will loose a few that I've had for many years because I messed up there water by putting Pothos plants in there to reduce the nitrates and make things better for the fish but instead the fish are all at the surface gasping for air and on one of them its scales have gone red and bloody I've probably increased ammonia levels and killed all the beneficial bacteria in the tank.

Many of my plants have got root maggot so I'll probably loose them too at some point and I can't attract any women because I'm just shit and a loser in life."
1303,Well I have suffered with depression for years. Now I’m going through a bored faze. I feel bored even if I’m doing something. I don’t work so I spend most of my days sleep or watching t.v.

What to do?

1305,I'm confused tbh my anxiety and deppresion has been really bad lately and for the past week I've spent almost everyday in bed and I get out of bed around midnight maybe stay up until 8 if I can... usually take a shower eat a bit.... but I guess what's concerning me is how bad is it to stay in bed as much as I have? I've been here before tbh but I feel like I was at least more active then...I usually get out of bed for about 30 minutes every maybe two hours during the day go to the bathroom and eat...I just don't know what damage I'm doing to my body and how long this can last. I do take meds and have a psychiatrist I'm also trying to find a therapist it's just so hot during the day I feel sick and anxious and yeah I know I'm rambling just wondering if anybody has been through the same thing.
1306,"Hello. I am a 26-year-old girl who feels completely alone, devastated, exhausted, and unwilling to fight anymore. Please, don't judge or insult me as this is the last thing I need since I try my best fight and heal my invisible wounds. I am a believer who lives neither in America, nor in England, nor in a country where there are Protestant churches. It's no secret where I live, but I just prefer not to go into such details. However, thanks to the Internet, I started following profiles of Christians and even Mormons on social media - people who inspire me with wisdom and their life. Unfortunately, due to many reasons and obstacles in my life, I will never be able to live abroad and experience such type of life. And this weighs on me too.

However, the reason I turned to you for valuable advice, even though I go to therapy, is because I always believed that you are a great source of support, lack of judgment, and a shoulder to lean on.
I know that no one has a perfect life and everyone has problems. But I feel like my problems are endless and I will never be truly happy. I had many problems with my appearance, health, and life in the past that I managed to overcome by myself. BUT my biggest problem that terrifies me is that I am 26 years old and I will never find the right person and true love. Boys always preferred someone else instead of me and they almost never been interested in me, although my friends say that I have a great character and I am beautiful. All my friends already have long and happy relationships, and so far, I've only had one. While looking in the profiles of Christians in social media, I often see how they define themselves ''blessed and happy people without big problems, to whom God often sends miracles'' They find the love of their lives in a unique way in their early 20's. They build big and happy religious families, which we often see in beautiful photo sessions. They have many amazing and loyal friends.

And although I know comparison is bad, I can't help but take a look at my life. I am 26 years old and so far, I have only had one relationship. There is no prospect of meeting the right person anymore, because the places where people meet their loved ones, are impossible for me. I graduated from college, there are no men in my work, and I have 2 girlfriends who also don't go out in big companies. I don't think I've done anything so bad in my life, nor am I a bad person, and I really don't know why nothing good happens in my life. I also pray to meet the love of my life, to have a strong and happy family, but unlike believers in social media, miracles don't happen to me. On the contrary - I'm alone and I don't think I ever have a chance to meet the right person. My parents are not interested in me, my dreams are shattered ...

All these years, I struggled with my problems and unhappiness all by myself, but now it really becomes too difficult and I can't stand it, I don't find meaning in life.... I even start thinking that I'm cursed or born to be alone and unhappy, while so many people around the world, especially my age ALREADY have wonderful families and a happy life full of miracles. Please, from the bottom of my heart, I go to therapy, but I would love for you to give me a piece of advice or just an opinion, because I really feel shattered, exhausted and I can't anymore ..."
1307,"I constantly think about my childhood. Everyday.

I'm 30yo woman from Europe, I have a great relationship, a succesful, dream career in the art industry, and a beautiful home. I live in a different country than the one I was born in, but the problem started when I was way younger and still living in my home-country. Now it's just worsened.

FAMILY
I had a very loving parents and a wealthy family but my mom used to hit me sometimes if I misbehave ( her mother did that to her too, I think that's why) Sometimes it was kinda hardcore, with me crying on the floor. Majority of time tho my family was very loving and affectionate. They would always listen to me when I talked, they were interested. They were supportive of my imagination and dreams.

 I was very afraid of growing up. I don't know why but the thought of being an adult terrified me. I have a memory of being 5 and crying that I don't want to be six and older. My dad was constantly sad and having a lot of troubles at work. He used to talk to himself while driving me to school, thinking that I don't hear. 'Everything is just a mess. Dark, dark despair' and things like this. I prayed before sleep everyday, asking God to prevent Dad from commiting suicide, cause in my child-head it seemed a very likely scenario. My Mom on the other hand was always super optimistic, easy-going and active person. Everybody adored her. She had a dark side to her, with getting angry and beating me sometimes ( at that time it was perceived as a normal practice to noughty children, but I hated her for it) When I would tell my friends at school they wouldn't believe me that my Mom does this, cause she was always all smiling and nice and kind of a 'cool mom'. 

Apart from some disfunctions in our family, I miss my childhood so much.


SCHOOL
I was bullied at school and didn't really like the subjects. There was a lot of pain and fear in my childhood, I feared some school subjects greatly and felt shame when I failed. I was never a good student. I had terrible marks in everything except Art. My drawings were the best in the whole school. I was able to draw ANYTHING from memory. That was the only thing I was good at. Today I'm making a decent living out of my art. I was bullied and I was considered a very ugly girl by my peers. And still for some reason I long for those times. Why?

I miss my primary school days. I was a 90ties kid. 
Whenever I hear a music that was on the radio when I was 8 or 10, I tear up. I think with great love about those sunny days, when I felt each day could turn to an adventure. Playing with kids at school, watching Dragon Ball and Disney films and dreaming I'm one of the characters. Coming home from school, Mom making dinner that smelled so good. Playing video games with my brother, walking our dog. Watching movies with Mom and Dad and my brother on hot evenings. Reading Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter for the first time. Dreaming about future. Visiting my grandparents, always showering me with love and acceptance. Taking a part in school plays, being very good at it. Doing a lot of happy mischief with my peers, having picnics together. Everything was so exiting back then. 

When I was around 10 I was often the last student at school to be picked-up by my parents, cause they finished work late. There was a special classroom for children who wait for their parents after class, with one teacher looking over us, a lot of books, toys and tv. I would often sneak out and wonder through empty corridors of our school. Entering empty classrooms if they weren't locked, admiring the sunset light that was dancing on the flowers and walls. I was expiriencing, feeling EVERYTHING. Even little things woud give me a magnetic thrill. And now it's completly gone.


LATER LIFE
I don't remember nor care about things that happened after. My high school and studies are like a blur. I was always very social, and had some friends, but in the end it didn't mean too much. I don't really have friends, it's more acquaintances. I felt the thrill of living again when I met my current boyfriend, and for two years I felt very alive. He is my best friend and one of the few things that keep me happy these days. But after receiving a degree and starting my career, even tho I'm doing very well and I love what I do, the nostalgia wave returned and covered me whole. 

TODAY 
I spend hours online to find pictures of my childhood toys or things I owned back then, I even order some of them. I stalk my primary school's online profile, and save pictures of the classrooms on my PC. I even stalk my childhood friends that I don't know anymore and save their photos from when they were young and at school with me. I sometimes play the music I was listening then, and cry like crazy. I feel like sado-masochist, cause doing all that brings me a lot of pain and sadness but also some strange kind of bittersweet pleasure.
I live in a different country now. My parents have aged. My brother lives with his family far away. My grandparents are gone. There are no family gatherings, no movies or video games together. I'm 30 and in my head I feel like I'm 15 stuck in time. I was always very nostalgic, even at 16 I missed the primary school and all. Couple of days ago I watched the film Breakfast Club for the first time and one quote made me cry for an hour. 'When you grow up, your heart dies' - this is exactly how I feel today. 


MY GOAL
I want to live here and now. I want to smile to the past but not dwell on it. I want to feel the exitement of living, especially that I'm doing very well with my adult life. I want to get back what I lost. I was wondering if there's someone with a simillar problem to mine.

So sorry for mistakes, I'm not a native english speaker."
1308,Sometimes I feel like life is a boring story where I'm this lonely person.  Just the same thing 7 days a week. Same thing every week and all I have to tell my friends is same old same old things. Times where I get fed up with it. I don't know. Maybe I need something new.
1309,My depression causes me to overeat. Right now I have a stomach ache but all I can think of is stuffing my face. I'm not even hungry. I am very sick.
1310,"*Trigger warning, themes of self-harm and suicide*

So I have this issue where I have constant unwanted thoughts. They're not like regular intrusive thoughts where they leave quickly but rather my brain will repeat the same thing at me for HOURS. It's very distracting and can make it hard to do things or sleep. Sometimes they are harmless thoughts, like one time my brain just repeated the word ""Cerveza"" at me for like 5 hours straight (FYI, it's the Spanish word for beer, also I'm not Latina nor do I speak Spanish fluently). Other times, they'll be telling me to self-harm or commit suicide. It can be images or words. At best they are extremely annoying, at worst I'm obsessing over graphic details of self-harm and suicide. They can be completely random and happen for no reason but if something bad happens that's usually an automatic trigger to immediately go the suicidal route, no matter how big or small.

At the moment I am currently unable to seek treatment (It's complicated) and so I just have a few questions. Is there a specific disorder this pertains too? In the past, I've been formally diagnosed with MDD, GAD, SAD, and ADHD for reference when I was in treatment, they by no means finished helping me so I am a little worried there are things (This issue among others) about me that have gone undiagnosed. Also, more importantly, how do you deal with it? How do you distract your brain or just make the thoughts stop? It's starting to significantly affect my life and I do not have many people who can help me right now. Thanks in advance!"
1311,I did not hear the alarm this morning and wake up much later than I had planned. I felt that the whole day was wasted. Anybody else feeling the same way? :low:
1312,"Although I live with my dad he is 95 and deaf so I can't talk to him, I also live with my daughter and her husband but we don't talk much either, I just need some one to talk to as my depression is getting worse and the voices are driving me mad.

1313,"Hi, 
I have severe depression and anxiety, and have been told I have a problem with alcohol and have done for 10 years. I use alcohol as an escape, but ultimately it is me self destructing. 
I have jeopardized every relationship I have had with friends, family, work etc and I'm at the point I need to stop this horrific self destructing cycle. 
There are many things which have contributed to my mind being this way, and some are unfortunately never going to disappear or get better. I need a way of coping with these things going forward and as much as I have had 'support', no one seems to want to listen when it gets back the third, fourth.. millionth time. 
What have others experienced which has helped them, as I'm at a loss."
1314,"It takes so much energy to pretend to care. To manage the basics. Fake it till you feel it. Cognitive behavioral strategies. Referencing. Meditation. whatever else. When you have something to move toward, they can be helpful. When you just don't see the point in getting up or answering when people talk or going through the other daily motions of life, there's just nothing. 

Worse, people have drifted off to more lively venues of entertainment and interaction. Without the effort to keep up even a partially chipper pretense, there is little to draw a support network. When you fail at reaching basic societal standards of being a viable, non-scum, human being because you can't find any point to anything- you don't get more than the dregs of human concern or friendship. 

I feel like bit by bit I've realized over the last years, whether I admitted it or not, I'm a spongy glut. Soaking up resources better spent on better people, I fail and try and repeat. While self-hate is certainly a component, I think in the end I'm just tired of fighting myself to find reasons to care and act. 

I'm in the unique position now of having nothing left to depend on me, while I am wholly dependent- and useless. I have heard of so many wonderful people here who are trying and reaching out and implementing changes to revitalize and engage their worlds. I keep rooting for each of the people who have shared their struggles against these intangible and thus far unbreakable chains. 

I feel like I've been treading water for years. I just want to let go of this last spark of life that has me breathing and writing. I'm so very tired of trying to try.

Apathy is a sort of living oblivion --- Horace Greeley"
1315,Ive been on my own now for a number of years. Any sort of relationship has always been a disaster for me. I have purposely insulated myself from people and usually am happier on my own. But over the past few days im finding myself increasingly lonely.  No idea why? I have my animals and usually dont have time for humans face to face.
1316,"Musings of a Mentally Ill Mind

 

I feel like I should be in a high school gymnasium joined by 11 concerned faces turned my direction when I say “Hi my name is B, and I am mentally ill”. I hate the sound of it, mentally ill. It makes me sound like a serial killer. However, there is nothing so interesting about me as that. In fact if there is one word on this planet to describe me, it’s average. I live in an average house, in an average neighborhood, in an average town, with an average job, with an average income. Even my mental illness is average. I suffer from anxiety and depression first diagnosed in my late 20s, but I’m certain it’s always been there is some fashion.

I really want to change that label, mentally ill. Maybe I can change it to something that is purely positive like … Starlight. Could that change the stigma that comes along with the admission that my brain does not function correctly?

I suffer from Starlight. There that doesn’t sound so bad does it? Well as I think on it more, I’ve read that the starlight we see from Earth can come from such a distance that the light we see can be from a star that has already died. In that sense, maybe Starlight is the wrong choice. I’ll have to keep working on my label.

The stigma is incredibly frustrating. When the pancreas doesn’t produce the appropriate amount of insulin, you have diabetes. No one expects you to cheer up or shake it off when you are diabetic. My brain doesn’t produce the correct amount of serotonin and dopamine and yet that’s all I hear from people.

“Cheer up.”

“It’s not so bad.”

“Other people would love to be you.”

My response is always the same. Does it matter? Does it matter that other people would love to be me when I don’t want to be me?

Telling my story is completely terrifying. I don’t want to lay my flaws out in all their glory, but maybe if I do someone somewhere will understand these flaws, and they’ll realize they are like me. They’ll realize they have experienced emotions that do not belong to them. They’ll realize that it’s not normal to be satisfied with your life one minute and want to throw it all away the next. They’ll realize that mental illness is just that, an illness, and it can be cured.

I am fully aware that I’m angry, I’m full of self-pity, I’m narcissistic, and I’m so, so sorry. This is my mental illness in it’s raw reality.

The Anger:

Anger is the most intense emotion that my illness produces in me. It’s a feeling of bitterness and imbalance. It’s the reason I question the existence of a higher power. I just can’t imagine if there were, that this benevolent entity would force me to live with this Sunshine? (label is still a work in progress) and give others what I call the ‘gilded life’, the perfect life. Why do some win and some lose at birth? What kind of god would choose between their children like that?

One particular gilded life I’ll refer to as TC, to protect the innocent, and he certainly is innocent. It’s strictly my skewed view of his life that makes me angry. I’m certain he’s the loveliest person, but I hate him. TC is the epitome of gilded. He grew up in a theatre family in a cultural metropolitan melting pot or so I hear from interviews I’ve read or watched. He has had nothing but success after success. He wines and dines with the elite and oozes talent, beauty, money, and privilege from every pore. I imagine his weekends are filled with beautiful people, insightful conversation, the perfect home, and trips to the beach. I’ll bet he has someone to do all those mundane average things for him that fill my days like grocery shopping, cleaning, laundry, and making the bed. I expect his weekdays include inspiring interviews, table readings, and costume fittings while I spend mine knee-deep in spreadsheets. It’s the dream life every human wants to live, but so few are actually afforded.

The really messed up part is that I can’t stop watching him. I should reiterate here that I am mentally ill, but I’m not a stalker, or any type of criminal for that matter. What I am is a corporate accountant, a wife, and a caregiver to two cats. When I say I can’t stop watching him, I’m not talking about through a telescoping lens outside his home. I mean it in the way we all watch the gilded, on Hulu, on Amazon Prime, on YouTube, on the evening news. You get the picture.

But why? I hate him to the very marrow of my bones, why do I watch him every time there’s an opportunity? I mean it’s practically vomit inducing. I’m a lot of things, but masochistic is not on the list, so I’m convinced I can’t turn my head from TC’s gilded life because I think if I eventually see the cracks and flaws in that life, maybe some of my anger will fade. Maybe my tragic averageness will start to be enough.

It’s everywhere - television, magazines, radio, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter – perfect gilded lives for as far as the eye can see. Damn! Why can’t it be me?

The Sadness:

Sadness is the hardest emotion from my illness for me to work through. My sadness stems from my sense of failing, failing at happiness, failing at being a woman as I’ve never had children, failing at being enough as I am.

That compounded with the immense guilt I feel for being so angry, so jealous, and not being content with the many gifts I do have in my life creates a recipe for never ending tears. Some days are better than others, but at times the tears can’t be kept at bay no matter how hard I grit my teeth and paste on that insincere smile.

The Passion:

Lots of young girls dream of a fantasy romance as they grow into adulthood. I was no different. I dreamt of meeting a man like TC and having that man be intelligent, loving, and constant. He would think I was beautiful and be full of passion for me. We would live that gilded life together.

My reality was actually quite sweet as the boy I asked to prom my senior year said yes, and six years later to the day, we said “I do”. However, it’s now 17 years since, and passion is the farthest thing from his mind. I certainly don’t blame him or hold it against him. We’ve been together for 23 years and although I look ok for my age, I never was going to win a beauty contest if you know what I mean. Well not until they create Ms. Average America at any rate. I might have a shot at that!

My husband is my best friend. He is intelligent, loving, and constant like I wished for as a young girl. He is also hard-working, a true gentleman in the carry your bags, open the door, take your hat off inside kind of guy. He’s also pretty easy on the eyes, but 23 years, and mental illness takes a toll on passion. Sex becomes sort of mechanical. It’s nice but you don’t really have to have it, and this becomes another source of guilt. I should try harder. I should be sexier. He deserves better. The thoughts go round and round until the sadness returns.

Hope:

Hope is the emotion that spurs the most fear in me, but I think it’s the most important for a chance at recovery. Hope inherently brings with it the chance for loss.

I’m going to begin seeing a new psychiatrist this week and my hope is frighteningly high that she will be the one that will know how to piece me back together. She could know the right prescription for my mental health. However, what if she tries and I’m too broken to be helped at this point? What if I just don’t have the strength to do what needs to be done?

Fear and hope hold hands in my heart, but I have to keep hoping. When the hope runs out the anger, sadness, and fear is all that’s left, and I’m not sure if anyone could live like that.

Contentment:

To answer the question of what it is I truly want in this life: contentment. I want my smile to be real. I want to be content with my place in this world. I want to have made some kind of difference when I’ve left it.

As you know, I will not be leaving behind any children, or a fairy tale life story, so maybe this is my legacy. My fight with Brilliance? (kind of liking that one) can be known and can be identified with. Maybe someone out there will feel a little better knowing that I’m here, I’m broken, but I have hope that the pieces will fit back together, and I won’t need to compare my life to anyone else’s. I want to inspire hope.

I heard the words “contentment is an emotion hard won” uttered on television once. That resonated to my very core. Not only is it hard won, I think it’s the only emotion worth winning. The rest is what we have to suffer to get there.

I know that today I am a work in progress, if I’m 100% honest, I’m still rooting for TC to fall in a well, but with my luck, he’d get some gorgeous scar and be even better looking afterward. However, I’m going to do this! I’m going to get back to being me, there is no other option, and I want to bring as many of us as possible with me. Join me on my journey toward mental health."

1318,"i have a persistent non stop depression filled with anxiety each and every single day. im lost and find myself ALWAYS worrying about harships in life. like losing my dad and my dog they have been gone for years but i cant let go of it. i worry about my mothers health she is having a hard time herself. i cry and panic they are not coming back and i can not come to terms with it. the rumination of sad unbearable thoughts is killing me. i dont understand how people can live normal lives. ive been a shut in for years. dont hangout with friends dont even hangout with family because when i see them i start thinking about thoughts of losing them or if i see my dog i start thinking how he might pass away soon to so i block myself off from family because that way i dont get even more attached to them incase something does happen to them it wont emotionally hurt as much even tho im at my limit. ive tried 2 antidepressants which did not work. this world is so sad and im not built for it in my current mental state. how are you suppose to accept that you lost a family member.......most people can put those thoughts in the back of there mind and go about there day and live normal lives. the only thing thats on my mind is sad unbearable thoughts that make you feel sick to your stomach. i cant even waolk by place I could hurt myself without getting a panic attack because i think imagine if i hurt myself and how scary it is to just be seconds away from something that could hurt you or end ur life! ( im not suicidal though) my mind is living in fear......when i try to read success stories or videos on youtube of peoples triumph over depression there always seems like theres a catch like there doing it for money. you see link in the decription of there video directing you to buy a certain suppliment, or this guy who said magic mushrooms brought him out of depression but than he has a link to sell mushroom grow kits! like who knows what to beleive. i dont do anything normal, i couldnt bear having a family of my own. if i had a kid i would just worry about what if he got kidnapped. im not built for relationships i have normal feelings but the depression and anxiety is unbearable. my brain is just rattled from thoughts"
1319,"I've been up at odd hours again and don't go to sleep until dawn. I'll sleep through the mid afternoon and then will stay up for a few hours and sleep some more. I do have anxieties about sleeping alone at night due to minor phobias and my mother has discussed finding me an emotional support animal. I'm an animal person already and usually when a dog or cat is present, it helps aid me in public environments. I believe if I had a dog with me while I slept, it would make me feel safe and secure. Don't get me wrong, I love my cats! They're just stubborn and have you seen a cat on a leash in public? Yeah, I didn't think so. A horse would be cool if I was casted in a western movie and it was allowed. I'm not picky with who gets my love and attention, I'm guilty of wanting a zoo. Anyways, I just realized that having a companion around wouldn't be so bad, especially since I have detachment and trust issues. I'm not going to lie but animals have helped me with suicidal thoughts. Like, my cat knows when I'm upset and always leaves when there's an argument. When I thought about suicide, my cat would follow me around as if he knew I was having troubling thoughts. Animals know a lot more than what they let on, so consider your superiority out of line!

Animals aren't just helpful companions or furry children, they're literally my medicine. I can't tell you how many times I've rode horses and refused to go home because I was having so much fun! I miss visiting the stables to take riding lessons and my biggest dream is to have a stable of my own! People tend to complicate my life and make me like an outsider. This isn't me being indifferent, but sometimes dissociating does help my mental health. Animals aren't an escape by any means but it's definitely something I need more of in my life. Please give me advice on how I can find an emotional support animal who fits my personality."
1320,"I feel confused on what I want or how to approach everyday. Barely scraping by and a lot of days I feel on the edge of complete insanity where I just want to walk away from everything and become homeless or end things in other ways.

I'm married but I don't know if I can make her happy or if I can make myself happy. I got married too soon but I was desperate to be loved I think. The loneliness eats away at you. I'm not sure how to move forward since everything ends up being a brick wall. 

I hate working full time to make nothing. I'm stuck. It fills me with deep hatred and rage. I'm all alone still and the realization that getting married hasn't fixed my inner issues but has made me realized how broken I really am.

I've tried explaining that I just feel so down that I have no interest sexually and reassured him that it's nothing to do with him but I'm not sure he really understands . He keeps pushing for sex and the only way I can get him to stop is to forcefully push him off me or raise my voice , which is a horrible thing to do so I usually avoid that and just give in . I know sex is an important part of a relationship , so we're still having sex at least twice a week because I don't want him to feel unwanted or rejected but it's difficult for me to maintain .I'm going back on medication soon so I'm hoping that if my mood improves it might help but has anyone got any other suggestions for getting my sex drive back ?"

I'm in a bad marriage but I feel like, well, I'll be dead soon so who cares.  I think it was hard for him when I had my breakdown & he's lost respect for me & finally, just doesn't love me any more.  COVID means we're stuck together, also, because I'm a crazy person, I don't make enough money to support myself.  He'd never kick me out.  
I lost all my friends due to a series of unfortunate events.  My best friend killed herself.  Another died of mixing drugs.  One wrote me off when I wound up in the psyc ward.  And the other was the mother of my daughter's rapist.  (which is why I ended up in the psyc ward).  
But that was a few years ago.  I got stable & I got a job.  But COVID happened.  Really makes the family problems obvious.  The way my husband leaves the room when I come in.  Asks the kids if they want to go do something but not me.  I come in when he's watching TV & then I'll find him watching the same show in the other room.  
My job is stressful - I never thought it would take the form it is taking now, because of covid.  
But I'm really here because I can't make myself do anything.  Like, shower.  Change the bedsheets.  I'll eat because I get hungry but I won't cook.  I haven't vaccuumed since Christmas.  Really.  I haven't put my laundry away from two or three washes ago - months if I'm honest.  My husband is angry that I never cook or clean.  I feel guilty.  But somehow I can't make myself do anything.  Not even fun things.  I can't think of a single thing I want to do besides sleep.  But I have insomnia.  So I try alcohol or pills to put me to sleep.  
It's anxiety and it's depression, both.  I've left my psychiatrist a couple messages but he hasn't called back.  How do I make myself do things?  Like my work, first of all, but also pick up my room & do the grocery shopping & I need to prune the bushes in the garden & call my dad & clean the bathrooms & take stuff to the thrift shop & remember my sibling's birthdays & dye my hair & deposit my cheques & get my prescriptions renewed & cancel my memberships & clean out the garage & get rid of the old, broken furniture & clear out my clutter & all the other stuff normal adults do.

1328,"Oops, I’m back here with feelings again.

Tbh, these depressive moments are standing to blend into the normal. I’m convinced they’re the real moments of truth, and my usual self is just surpression and putting those rose tinted glasses back on because tbh what else is there. And digging for the truth has just validated my subconscious discontent.

Tbh, I have no one I’d pity if they were traumatized by my death. I have no one to love or confide in, I have no support system for normal growing up things, let alone feelings. I have no stable lifestyles to mirror, I have no one to check up on me, I’ve never had a “real friend.” I don’t have the control over my life to close my door to cry it out, save for the latest hours in the night, and I am scolded even worse if I am seen crying. My efforts I put into the universe, in general, are not reciprocated. I don’t want to do anything I do, I don’t even want to play my games anymore. I don’t really want to read. My chosen profession feels pointless. It’s too complicated, there’s too many subfields, I don’t know what I want anymore.

So how do you do it? I don’t have the love in myself to do it for me, and I don’t have the spite to pick myself up either. My plans are getting more vivid, and I don’t like it. I feel like my mind might shut down, is that even a feeling? Do minds do that?

1329,"Despite having a boyfriend, a family and some friends, I have the feeling that no one cares about me.

My boyfriend has shown me in more than one occasion that I'm the last of his priorities, literally everything and everyone is more important than me. He knows that I'm struggling with borderline personality, anxiety and depression, and still he keeps making me understand that I'm not worth his time/energy. 
And when we fight, I'm utterly destroyed, in tears, with the worst headache, while he is just sitting in the other room, playing videogames with his friends online, laughing like nothing had ever happened. This breaks me every time.

I don't have the courage to leave him, because I'm dependent from him in many ways.  I live in a foreign country, and literally everyone I know is either his family or his friends. If I left him I would have no one. And making new friends on my own is not working, I've been trying but there is just no way.

The friends that I had from my country of origin have all stopped talking to me at some point. The one that was my best friend, whom I considered a sister, stopped responding to my texts after a minor discussion. 20+ years of friendship down the drain because a stupid discussion (not even argument). I haven't heard from her in 3 years.
Another one stopped talking to me in a similar way. I honestly don't miss her, but she confirmed that it's really easy to let go of me. 

About the other ones, which I wouldn't really call friends (ex classmates, ex roommates etc.), I know that if I texted them with ""Hi, how are you doing?"" they would respond, but no one, ever, texted me with something like that. 

I have no brothers or sisters, and the only one who I am in touch with from my family is my mom. But even she neglected me during my childhood, both my parents treated me as they would treat a plant (as long as you keep it alive and fed, it's gonna be okay). Never occurred to them that a person needs something more than that.

After every fight with my boyfriend (which have been on a weekly basis lately) I feel more and more empty and alone. I just want to get on a plane and disappear forever, but right now it's not even possible because of Corona.

I'm stuck and alone and I have no way of making my life better."

Recently, we were talking about something and I realized she didn't really have my back like I thought she would. When I talked to her again and brought it up, she said I misunderstood her. 

So today I talked to her and we were discussing the virus.  I mentioned that if I was quarantined, I wouldn't have anyone to get food and stuff for me so I said I really better  keep from getting near people that could have it. 

She said I could always have food delivered.  It really hurt me that she didn't say she'd get me food if I ended up quarantined.  During the discussion I mentioned it again. She said she would get me some  but she would be too afraid if the virus everywhere got bad (widespread).  It's always ""I would, but..."" There's always a reason I'm noticing.

Well I wasn't talking about the virus getting bad like she said...I was talking about me being quarantined because I was in contact with someone who had it or because I had it.

She started talking about some other things after that and I said I have to get off the phone and did.

No more me helping her.  Why do I actually think I have a friend when people don't care and want to use you....at least that's always the case with me.

So now there are zero people in my life...zero.  I always have to be alone in the world.  I'm strong because of it but it still hurts."

                   And on top of that I'm still in love with someone, but I know that wouldn't have anything to do with me if they found out my secret.  I'm very good at hiding my teeth, but I don't want to do it anymore.  I want to be able to smile and laugh with friends or random people, but I can't.
                   Suicide has crossed my mind.  And I know that this seems a little much for just bad teeth, but it seems like the only way out.  I'm so scared of dentists and what they will think about my teeth. If someone has any advice I am more than willing to listen."

I really want to talk with people. When I enter to this forum I read about people with problems, and its ok, I understand some people really post to ask for help, advices, problems to resolve, etc.

But what I want is to meet people who also have depression, and talk. I really miss to have a conversation."
1335,"I'm adult female, 24 years old. I live with my parents still til I graduate (next year ). All my life I felt like my relation to my parents (especially mother) are not so common. My mom is very great mother to me and my sister, but I have deep emotional attachment to her from childhood, like I can't"" leave her alone"". I sometimes regress talking to her (like a 6 year old child) I do everything that she would probably want me to do, behave the way she would like, her answers are most important to me/like truth. Every problem even small I tell her, every situation. But there is no need, she was never controlling! She is so normal mother, even never even strict! In my puberty I had episodes of physosis and she was only one there for me. I only ""like"" my friends/other family members, don't feel sad if they go, like here is my mom! Because all my love I give is to my mom. It's like anyone would not be important to me, like they come and go. But I forgot one thing. She will go too one day... It was my biggest fear during childhood and these days I'm obsessed with that again. I feel like I could kill myself then. It sound childish but I really feel that way. I'm even afraid. Right now at 24, I feel like she is worried about my deep attachment and problem with separation from her. I still feel like a child and she told me that too. I feel horrible. My sister is nothing like me. I just want normal relation/normal separation, I'm adult. I'm feeling I'm becoming LESS and LESS mature each day. When I was 21/22 I wasn't that childish/regressed, it only get worse now. Maybe it could be symptom, im worried, don't feel well right now. I'm depressed from my early teenage years."

I imagined myself being dead yesterday and It made me so happy all my worries were gone for a very short moment. 
I know nothing will be so happy and incredibly like before, I'll never tell myself ""I'm so happy we lived to see that"" anymore, I'll never see it never again. I want to leave I want to never come back I don't want people to hate me I want to people support me but I will never deserve it.

1338,"Good afternoon, I am a 35 year old male who was diagnosed with depression and anxiety yesterday during my first meeting with a therapist. He prescribed me 10mg of prozac to take daily. If you can, please read my experience and if you have any words of encouragement or help I would greatly appreciate it.


I'll start out by saying I am terrified of taking medication. When I was a teenager, I was heavily into drugs. MDMA, Acid, Pills, etc.. It was when I turned 20 that I had my first panic attack. I thought I took too much hydrocodone and I googled ""Can you overdose on hydrocodone"" the google results sent me into my first panic attack (which I didnt know at the time). I thought I was dying lol. Ever since then, the thought of taking medication gets my anxiety sky high.

The only medication I have gained enough confidence to take is Indomethacin for my gout flare ups. Even with that, I have to take it right before bed and go to sleep immediately so I don’t have a full blown panic attack. My issue is I am afraid of feeling the medicine ""kick in"" (which it doesn’t). I guess all of those younger years of taking drugs that do ""kick in"" and the panic attack I eventually experienced on one of them is why I am so terrified of medicine.

I'm unsure if any of this makes sense or if I am explaining this correctly but I hope someone out there understands what I am going through. Back to the Prozac, I am terrified to take it. I'm worried it will ""kick in"" and I'll feel high or extremely different as I am always on high alert on how my body feels. I’m scared I’ll feel artificial and this will send me into a downward spiral of anxiety which will cost me my job. I have a wife and a newborn who depend on me so the thought of that scares me.

Thank you if you took the time to read this as I know it’s a lot."
1339,"how do you tend to respond?

I usually respond with, oh, you mnow how it is, or what do you think?

I've learned (at least in my experience) people don't really care. it's asked more out of politeness not because people are concerned

what about you?"
1340,"I wasn't really an envious and bitter person until recently, and it's driving me to overthinking and feeling low.

I was bullied in college by my own friends, and after college, these bullies got jobs easily and are doing well in their lives. While I am struggling to find a job, and I never had one until now. And now I got stuck in this pandemic, making job hunting much harder and riskier. We're not really poor, but we're almost at that point, and me being the one with a college degree gives me pressure that I have to support my family and bear the responsibility of us going out of poverty. It makes me really envious, to the point that I would have bitter thoughts in my head. My bitter thoughts would go like ""the world can be really unfair sometimes"" and ""they're rich, why do they get jobs and I don't?"", or ""why do bad people do better in life?"". These bitter thoughts would then lead to hopelessness and depression. My thoughts would then go like ""Am I not good enough"" or ""Am I cursed/unlucky"" or ""Nothing good would probably come in my life"" , or ""I feel anxious about the future"". I'm too depressed to learn stuff related to my career, and so I haven't been making progress ever since. I tend to overthink at night sometimes because of these thoughts and can't sleep well.

I know being envious is really bad, but sometimes I can't really help it. I sometimes see myself becoming the bitter and envious person who hates people. I'm trying my best to get rid of this attitude and become a better person, but the people I tell about this just tells me to stop it. I'm having a hard time trying to get rid of this attitude. I'm hoping that maybe someone can share some tips in coping with jealousy and bitterness, and being able to cope with hopelessness and overthinking. Thanks."

1344,":stomp:I grew up in a military house. Had to be presentable at all times. My depression all these years never interfered with my ability to look sharp. But I will admit now, in my 40s... I'm taking a who cares approach. I still bathe... once a day. Wash my hair every 5 days and wash my clothes every 2 weeks. But.... I'm just tired of it. Today I was tempted to go to dunkin donuts in my pajamas. I did walk outside to get my mail in my pajamas and slippers, with my hair looking like I got attacked by a blue Jay. I can feel my self care starting to slip. I figure, who cares and why not. Nobody paid attention when I was dressed to the nines.... no one will care when I'm shuffling around like a bag lady. 

It's hitting me that my time is wrapping up. I'm not anxious or fretting. There is peace in this. Maybe 5 more years. 

I think I want to start writing to leave something behind. Something that friends can look to as a source for who I really was. Not that plastered person that makes everyone feel cozy and at ease. 

Don't want the mentally ill woman scaring people.

1346,"Hi. I have depression which is mostly now under control with medication and following therapy. However (and I don’t even know if this is linked to it) every once in a while I have these outbursts like a tantrum or something and I spiral down and hurt people around me with what I say. This happened last October, and this week, so it really isn’t regular but I still don’t want it to happen again.

both time’s I have been away. In October o was with 2 friends, visiting one of them who lives a few hours away.And this time I am away with family.

I don’t even remember what sets me off but Istart making comments that make people around me think I am irritated with them and then it spirals to a point where I insult them, I think both these occasions something has been done or said to make me feel insecure and like they don’t want me there or don’t want to do what I’ve suggested and I take it personally. But I really start acting so out of character and like a child. And then I cry a lot and am very embarrassed. And start thinking all the negative things about myself I used to when in real depression. Then,I’m ok again. And both times in the days and weeks before I have been fine, in a good place, happy etc

does anyone know why this might happen and how I can avoid it? I just want to understand more"
1347,"Hey :)

I hope I am not the only one, but I feel very frustrated when people do not have a picture in the ""Avatar"" window. If your nick-name starts with an A, there will be an A in your avatar window if you don't have a picture there. You and everyone with a nick-name starting with an A will have the same avatar picture. If you use the nick-name John. Your avatar will be a J and so it will be for all the others with a nick-name starting with a J. 

It is very difficult to recognize who one is talking to without a picture that identifies you as Ann or John of whatever nickname you have chosen. ""Oh, there is a J, is that the same J as I spoke to yesterday or is it another one""?

Please take a picture of your shoe, your elbow, a toe, a flower, a tree, a cup, somebody's pet, the neighbor's door, a motor, a doll, a squirrel, an ice-cream or whatever ..., and load that up. It is easy.

It will help us so much to understand who we are talking to. ""Oh, there is the green door again. I spoke to her yesterday here at the forum"" ...

1348,"You know those people who are totally there for you. They understand. They want to help you. They have a lot of advice for you. –In the  beginning. 

In practice you notice they don't actually want to be around you. They might check in from time to time, but if you're still depressed, they'll be back some other time. And if it takes a long time, like months, years, honestly, they kinda gave up already. If you want to be what you maybe were once before depression, maybe before some life changing event; you'll smile a lot and have forgotten all about depression – you just let them know and go show it. Prove it. Maybe they'll take you back into their lives."

I feel aleniated. I feel people is different to me, or me different to people.

Its complicated to explain, but when I go outside and see people I think ""oh, there are they doing their stuff, and Im here doing mine"".

I live in my world, which is pretty different to their world. Which is ok.

I see them, I mix with them, I try to do the things they expexct from a person, and its all ok.

The thing is, how many here also feel like this ? Im looking to find others who also have this kind of problem. 

But dont get confused, Im not talking about people who is socially akward, shy, or have social anxiety.

Just people who feel different and just cant find any other person to match."

I really don’t know how in hell I can just ‘grow up’ when life keeps getting just.. unbearably harder.

So how does an out of shape person run faster? Say he’s running on a treadmill. Simply speeding up the belt won’t work. He’ll reach exhaustion faster and burn. You need to train him.

1357,"Hi All,

Didnt know what else to do so decided a post on here wouldn't hurt. Basically I am at my worst at the moment,  the worst I have been in a while, I am desperately clambering between ideas of how I can change my life and improve my mental state but all paths have lead to dead ends and disappointment. I exercise and eat well yet feel unhealthy, almost as if I am dying. I have been to the doctor and been tested for any actual illnesses and according to them I am healthy, so it can only be my mind making me feel this way. I cant feel the love I used to feel as my mind is clouded in anger and confusion, I have zero control of my emotions and I feel like I am becoming a threat to myself and the people in my circle (not in a homicidal way just lashing out). I hate my job, my career pattern has been going the same way for the last 5 or so years, it goes like this - Start a new job, claim I enjoy it for a few months - Then I begin to detest the job, constantly calling in sick and missing work etc. - Then about a year in I will find actively begin searching for a new job and leave on bad terms with my current employer out of some sort of spite I have towards them ONLY then to fall into the exact same pattern in my new gig. I know what people will say, something along the lines of ""Well look into doing something that makes you happy!"" and I get that is good advice and I wish I could but trust me there is nothing, I have prowled the internet for months and its all the same sh*t. Moving on from career issues - I am starting to become paranoid of those around me - I love my friends, My girlfriend and my family but I am starting to feel like they do not feel the same about me - Infact I feel like they are beginning to feel the opposite. I feel like they are being sneaky, using me and what not. I find myself over analysing every move the people in my circle are making, zero trust. I feel like I sit angry most of the day and if Im not angry I am depressed, I wish I could articulate better how my mind is functioning at the minute but I cant, I am both scared and content all at once, going through bouts of acceptance that my time may be coming to an end then other times thinking of others and pointing fingers as to who is making me feel this way and spiralling into a rage but in reality it is me, I dont feel like I can do much more in the way of self healing. I always imagined when I was younger (I say that as a 23 year old) that I would defeat life, my idols were always the heroes of the story, the people who conquered adversity against all odds no matter how big the task. The people who put others first no matter the cost to themselves - Not me unfortunately, it seems my existence is becoming more & more costly to the people I love most as the clock ticks on. I cry when I remember myself as a child, I remember how terrified I was of life and everything in it, just a helpless little boy - I always told myself I would grow to be fearless, now I sit here years later only scared of my own mind. Strange.

Sorry for rambling on, I just had to say a few things without any strings attached. Life is a very curious thing. Thank you to whover made it to the end of that nonsense.

1358,"I lost my father in December 2019, and it's been 7 months, and frankly life has gone downhill.

They say when these external occurrences pile up, one after one : A person can become helpless with the facts and an onset of 'depression' is more like a learned helplessness :  The best thing you can do, is to treat yourself to something - like that odd glass of wine, and really 'laugh' in the face of disaster.

My elder sibling has been living with the remaining parent and over the last 7 months, has bullied her into signing all the papers in her name, so the sibling has full control on finances.  She's taken everything that can be taken - bar one thing.  It's always messy, when these things happen.

My younger sibling and I don't care about the money.

We're more concerned over Mother.  Hence my younger sibling has moved to London......

It's just one big f**k up.

Just to end - She said this to me once.

''I hope you get locked up and the key thrown away .....''

Och.  Whatta uber bitch.

End.  Just needed to plop this online.

1359,"I recently had a mental health assessment due to suicidial thoughts I mentioned to my thearpist ( I said I wanted to disappear"").. It was administered by a PNP what I wanted was to check for adhd but ended up with depression, anxiety and trauma ( which makes sense because I have a history of those things and they still bother me). They told me that because I wasn't diagnosed before 12 and the other issues I have there isn't a clear cut way to tell if I have adhd since the symptoms overlap. The medication suggested was Wellbutrin for depression which can also help with adhd symptoms as well. Im not sure if this is normal. Im not sure if I'm over thinking it but should I get a 2nd opinion ? Is a Psychiatrist Nurse Practitioner as qualified to asses and diagnosis me as a Psychiatrist ?

1363,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone else had been on this. I've been on 300mg moclobemide for about a month now, and I've not had good experiences so far. Ever since I started cutting down my old duloxetine a couple of months ago, I've had nausea and stomach problems - and bowel problems as well, which have improved a bit since cutting out gluten, but I keep getting sick. I had to go into hospital once because of it because I wouldn't stop being sick, and I had to go into hospital again because my ketones were bad because I couldn't eat (I'm type 1 diabetic). No antisickness tablets really work except ondansetron and even that's not totally effective. I keep getting diarrhoea and headaches, and I keep flushing red for some reason. I can't really drink alcohol because it just makes me sick even more. My blood pressure has been fine (I'm on a few drugs for that, as I had stage 2 hypertension for ages), so it's not that. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Does it stop? I'm feeling really crap about it, to be honest. I'm not feeling any better depression-wise either and I'm having intrusive thoughts whenever I talk to other people (I used to have them in my teens, where I think really horrible things automatically when I'm speaking to someone and I'm scared they're going to come out my mouth). I'm even more sensitive to noise than before coming off duloxetine, and I'm irritable. Hating everything so far."
1364,"Ten years ago I really seriously hurt my ex Girlfriend (not physically). I was with her for 9 years, from around 18-27 or something similar to that. She loved me unconditionally and her family were even nice and it was great. I still to this day, can't understand what possessed me to act the way I did. I can not comprehend it, it simply doesn't compute with me and I even sometimes struggle to believe what happened.

Last Friday I was out walking and saw her in her car eating before going to work. It was entirely unexpected (although I was aware she worked nearby). I didn't say anything and I don't even know if she saw me, I was just a bit shell shocked. If I was to approach or talk to her, I know she would be really friendly and genuinely interested in hearing how I am doing.

The only way I can describe this event is that it has completely rocked me. I feel almost as if I have been transported back to that period. The Guilt, the emotion, the self-hatred and the loathing of myself is overwhelming to the point that I feel like I can't breath. I've no idea why it has got to me so badly. It has spiralled over the weekend to the point that I am spending numerous parts of the day crying and unable to breath.

After it all ended between us we met up about 6-7 times for food and just to walk together as I think we were both struggling to adjust. In that respect it didn't end with any bitterness, or spite necessarily, it was just sad.

All the emotions from back then are back now - despite the fact I am with a new long term partner (of 6 years), that also makes me feel bad as it's not very fair on her obviously.

I feel that there must be some sort of medical term for this - like regression or something, it almost feels like PTSD in some ways, like reliving a really terrible time which was emotionally crippling. Especially as at the time I was entirely alone afterwards, with no family and very limited friends or contact.

I've read up on Chronic Guilt and about self-forgiveness. I am fairly sure this is in the right ball park.

Sorry for rambling, I am just really lost at the moment and I am not sure how to overcome this. I am hoping it is temporary, like it has triggered the same emotions, the same feelings from back then.

Thanks

1365,"Hello everyone! I  am a bit curious regarding a matter concerning depression in children to try to understand my experiences in my own life.

i have  been having a hard time finding many Opinions to this, so why not ask directly where people have experience?

i myself have dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts since 8 years old- possibly earlier, though my memory only goes so far. it has been a struggle to understand the severity of my depression due to how Long i've experienced these thoughts, so I have  become a bit Numb. i am not entirely able to grasp how ""bad"" something like this would be for the age i was back then.

i will not go into too many details- but these thoughts involved ways to actually carry it out for me.

So, what do you believe to be the threshold of ""normal"" depression in children? Low mood, fatigue, appetite changes, difficulty concentrating? Is something like the feeling of wishing to not exist, or even having fantasies about ending things, cause for an even greater concern? Cause for fear for the child?

these things can Sometimes be thought of as ""common"" in adults  with depression, even if they are more  severe Symptoms, so they do not always get  the same reaction of worry for  the person's health and safety.

i am not asking for a professional opinion, allow me to make that clear as well! i am looking for different opinions from people who have experienced depression, and their thoughts on it

i suppose i am asking, in an effort to better understand myself from those days?"

At first I thought that’s a relief I just need to be myself. Then I realized I have no idea what that means. What am I like when being myself. I was aware I wasn’t being myself, but with it actually being said I literally was confused and perplexed about it. After babbling around trying to salvage the mess I created I realized it was to late and tried to move on. In the past several hours I’ve just been thinking about who I am and what being myself means and honestly I’m no closer to an answer than I was earlier. I have no idea where to begin.

And the last 3 years have been the worst. it's always been verbal with him but has turned physical, not hitting more like hair grabbing but non the less physical.

1369,"Hi everyone,
I’m not really sure where to start or if I’m posting in the right place. I’m not posting for myself. My fiancé has struggled with his mental health since the beginning of his teens, he is now 21. He has depression and anxiety. It’s always been bad since I’ve known him, but recently it’s getting so much worse. He is suffering with a lot of health issues too (some of which he gets embarrassed by), which he has been to the GP about, tests have been done, however the GP has come to the conclusion that they are all caused by his anxiety and just left him to deal with it himself, whereas my fiancé believes the doctor is incorrect. The GP also gave him antidepressants (which was literally it, no other offer of help) but my fiancé has stopped taking them. These health issues have made his mental health so much worse and he feels he can no longer go to work. His mum lives over an hour away from us and is trying to help but she’s being pushy and it’s stressing him out even more. I feel like I’m on my own in supporting him and it’s really difficult because I don’t know what else I can do to help him. I’m worried it’s just going to get worse and worse. I don’t know where to go from here. He gets quite irritated and angry at the smallest things, so even talking about trying to get help stresses him out. He refuses to go back to the GP, to see a therapist or to go to a specialist clinic for the health issues he’s experiencing. I really don’t know what I can do to help, it worries me so much and he won’t talk to me or anyone. I’m just asking here to maybe get some advice from people who are going through/have been through a similar thing to him so I can help him better. It breaks my heart that he is going through something so bad and if nothing is done I know it’s only going to get even worse, but I’m at a standstill now and I don’t know what to do to help him. If anyone has any advice at all, it would be so greatly appreciated.

1370,"Hi All, I’m hoping to find some advice.

Just a bit of background: I had been dating a guy for just over 2 years. I suspect that he has depression but he has never mentioned it. For context, when we met he was in the process of getting a divorce which is now entering its 6th year of negotiations. He has four adult kids who live with his ex on a different continent. All five, including the wife are on antidepressants and do not work, leaving the financial obligations solely on him.

We had a good relationship despite some emotional issues in which I felt that he could not express his feelings or talk about it. Recently he had a bad (silent, distant, withdrawn, sad) day and called off the relationship, stating that he wanted to move to a different country and that he was unable to love me - he had taken a couple of hours to decide this.

After some distance and reflection, I realised that it was more than emotional and commitment issues and that it might be that he is depressed. I felt that this could be aggravated by the lockdown which my country is still experiencing, as his job revolves around travelling for 2 weeks out of every for. Could the  lockdown have brought out negative emotions and thoughts that he has been suppressing by keeping himself busy?  We are nearly 4 months into lockdown, which is the longest he has been in one place for the last 20 years.

I am trying to determine if he is in fact depressed? Further, I do not think that he will be moving to another country for at least the next few months until travel restrictions are lifted. I am the only person in the country that he has a close, intimate relationship with so I feel obliged to offer him support if he is indeed depressed. He does not have any family or close friends that he would open up to and I’d like to think that he has opened up to me a little during the course of our relationship.

I have made peace with the break up and I am strong enough to offer him support as a friend and nothing more. After all, we were friends before dating. So, do I support my ex in his depression? And if so, how?"

1374,"Hi, I have recently been prescribed Quetiapine. Does anyone have experience with this?

Currently I take Pristiq 150mg and Mirtazapine 45mg, however I was gaining a lot of weight with Mirtazapine so my doctor has prescribed Quetiapine 25mg (as an alternative to Mirtazapine) to help with depression and sleep."
1375,"Usually I feel anxious, but today I've been feeling more down. I do have days that seem better though. I still don't now exactly what's going on other than anxiety and possibly depression without seeing a professional. I've looked into places local that screen and treat mental health issues. From the reviews I've read it can take awhile to be seen. Sometimes they don't even return your call. It just gets frustrating when you try so hard and you still struggle."
1376,"Hello, it’s been a while since I joined this forum. I’m in my last year of my early college graduation track. Still kinda depressed, still having periods of being almost ok, ups and downs.

I’ve learned a lot about deconstructing myself and trusting my feelings when things are wrong. I still get anxiety, and I stuff feel depression, but I know more about why, and I acknowledge the alternatives that hold just as much spite as ending it all.

...I found out I was a gay. Gay in a “you can’t stop other people from what they do but being gay is wrong and not how god made you and if you get married/have sex and it doesn’t end up with babies right away , you’ve committed sin” kind of family. The signs should have let me on to that go as far back as when I was a 6 y/o, but I blocked them out out of fear, so I’m, finding out as a teen/young adult anyways, instead. If I came out of the closet... just the idea of falling in love with and living happily ever after with a loving wife makes me so...happy. And oh my gosh, if she was hot? Nooo— do you know what kind of feelings would go through my mind if she was that kind of person who smiled a lot?? I would become an immortal who could live off that for substinance??? You know, that feeling? Agh, and..and... curves and..you know??

I’m scared about what happened with my gay friend. Her family and mine are friends on facebook. She had a boyfriend now, we don’t talk because I realized she didn’t care about me and just enjoyed having me as another ear to rant and brag to. Maybe she’s bi, maybe she’s not, and my family would take a slip from her family‘s book.

But part of me is willing to remind me that I could keep up the façade. I’d be okay in just a healthy relationship with a man. I might not be into him, but like, sex would be biologically practical? From a young age I always liked the idea of adopting a kid that existed and needed love, anyways, instead of going through the life endangering pain of labor. But like, all women do it? They say you become immortal through having kids. And I would be a good mother, I was a proud future big sister from the time I was a one year old baby, my oldest memory is getting that big sister band and thinking “cute!” I could survive off being loved back, someone finding you attractive is nice anyways? I’ve been faking emotions to survive anyways, and I know how to do it so it’s genuine enough I don’t hurt anyone, so I could technically do it. No one would have to know. I wouldn’t have to go through that pain. But I’m scared of that too. And I know it’s still wrong. I know it doesn’t make sense to take that risk if I don’t even like guys in the first place, with a family that doesn’t acknowledge marital rape as a thing and disfunctional/toxic relationships as being healthy relationships.

Also, it’s hard to put it down, but I need that advice. I think my family is narcissistic. Here starts a long paragraph, so if you believe me flat out, just skip to the next one. I found out it was a thing with my mom talking to me about how my dad was many years ago, and I recently did my research on it because of this feeling that something is wrong and realized they both are, my little brother kind of fits into that too. I wouldn’t say if they have the disorder or not, but they act like it. They tell me they love fighting and having some spice in their relationship, they do things that seem so illogical that caused needless confusion and strife growing up. They are a chaotic family, when they fight it’s your daughter, she’s just like her grandma, she’s just like your mother. Some of my first memories are about how if I sacrifice my emotional balance and cry easily when they get mad, they’ll leave that state when they’re scary and have that look in their eyes where they could do anything to me. My parents come into my room and sometimes start scolding me only to realize there’s nothing for them to scold? My mom esp still does it. It doesnt matter how hard I try, they’ll still be equally mad at me. She makes me upset And ruins my mood, or acts like I made her upset for no reason, and then comes in moments later with a scary amount of happiness to her? My mom has the drama feeding thing. She gaslights me and twists my words towards herself, I’m not allowed to lock my door and want to be alone, I’m not allowed to cry, I’m not allowed to be depressed and have her be there for me. My dad is generally ok now, he was worse, he follows my mom with the teasing but he’s gotten better if I keep him at a distance, he gets mean if I get too close to him or try to bond with him as a daughter, and he’s headstrong, which is kind of a man/testosterone thing I think? But with my mom the things he says and the lack of things he does like he doesn’t ever learn that make me think “wow they’re perfect for each other,” those are the things that clue me in. My little bother...is kind of controlling? Like the way he’ll forget to feed his dog or take her out and not seem like he cares till he gets scolded for it and told its cruel bc she’s such a sweet pup and other dogs would bark and get angry and she just sulks instead? Also how he only pets his dog or interacts with others when he wants to, very briefly, and then goes away. He feeds her very little and and won’t feed her more than he’s decided to feed her, even when he’s hungry. Growing up he used to trouble me/ make me cry a lot, and my parents didn’t do anything because “what to do he wouldn’t listen. Do you want me to hit him? You can bring the spatula and I can hit him? Do you want me to tie him to a chair and make him let you hug him?(yes, hugs to me from him were 97% forced/punishment ones)” and obv the answer from me was a sharp no. It took until I realized I was still buckling his seat/etc at the age at which I was his age buckling my little brothers seat that they stopped babying him. He doesn’t get anxious/scared when my parents fight, rather, he incites some of the fights. He’s the ally I learned to keep at a distance, he can stand up for me, but he doesn’t love me by my definition of love. None of them do, and I know that.

But it’s hard because the bad is mixed right in with the good. My mother who crushed me in all those little manipulative ways also shares these profound talks with me about spiritualism, shares things she learns from her job to get ahead that people can only really learn from their parents or social circles, she listens to ebooks about how to invest your money and really intelligent things that consistently shows me that she had a good/logical intelligent person in her, it was just so twisted up together with the illogical childishness and bad that no amount of heart to heart or waiting for her to change ever brought real change. My dad used to come home and just yell, he used to argue and not listen to what I say in reply until I was a broken mess, no matter if I was right. He’s only nice to me when I keep him at a distance and don’t see him very much, and he made fun of things like my“piggy nose” as early as 3 years old(which escalated till 3yr old me scrunched up her nose and stomped her foot and got accused of wanting to apparently stomp my parents heads like that (my parents made self-projecting accusations like that whenever they felt like I was a suspiciously good child in comparison to their own childhood selfs) and 3 year old me was so indignant at it all that she made it a permenent memory— because she knew 3 was a ridiculous age to be accusing a child of things like that and teasing them, and she didn’t ever want to become that sort of parent)...But that same dad paid for my college. We’re not even that rich,they couldn’t afford to eat much more than porridge or bagels or turn on a heater or buy a bed when I was born and I was born kind of tiny bc of it. So it’s not like letting your daughter become an animator is something a small me could have ever expected. I would like to look up to my parents for things like this, you know? But the only way I can do that is by separating them, the manipulative ones that like the fight, and the parents in the same bodies that sometimes sound like the best parents a child could wish to be raised by.


I know my mom was extremely abused, mentally and physicallly, growing up, and I know she was suicidal and depressed when I was born. She was alone in a foreign country, married to the first man who paid attention to her. Postpartum depression wasn’t a known thing, long distance calls were expensive, she went from a hot tropical city world to a cold northernmost American city with ice and snow and barely any people. My dad was neglected, a big part of why he married my mom was because she could cook and he was starving for some good home cooked food. He was very mischievous to his teachers and he kept a lot of pets he found outside in the wild. He has this scary darkness in his eyes and sometimes called me things like “satan” and “wiccan” out of nowhere(no offense to people of the Wiccan religion! Somehow non Christian/heathen=witch=wiccan in my dads head...)

But I still own the things that happened to me. And while I do love them, I will never LOVE them, not how I struggled so much to love them, to be strong and wait till they figured out their own lives enough to come back and be there for me. I have to accept that that will never happen. People who love you hear you when you are silent. I’ve been vocal about things that hurt me and been forgotten/ignored.

But they’re not as bad as other people’s parents, and I don’t have extended family, or close friends to feel safe with. My best course of action is to slowly move out and become completely independent, so till then I kind of have to cope.

But now that I see them for who they are, how do I avoid the emotional conflict they thrive off of? It’s scary, because so much of these narcissist traits make so much more sense than my childhood beliefs that my parents were just too stressed to see what they were doing or something. I’m...really in danger. I’m depressed and I can’t keep giving them the reactions they want, but if I don’t, will they stop pretending to love me? Will they do something more extreme? How do I just manage, when my mom demands my attention and my reactions, calls the police to come check up on me at midnight if I don’t call every day, even that day I confirmed with her I dropped my phone in water and would be leaving it in rice?

I just want to be okay. I need to buy myself time but still be okay. I’m a legal adult, but If I can, I want to have a relationship with my family, because I need those few times the affection feels genuine and the advice is real. I want to be mentally okay, I want to be happy. I’m sure I can live alone, but I doubt I can thrive alone. Not with breaking my family off, all at once, which no one seems to cover, but I’m sure other people have done."
1377,"I often hear how other people have been through traumatic events or had really hard lives and think, how do I have a right to be down? I've had it pretty good and I can recognise and appreciate that but I'm depressed. It makes me feel guilty."
1378,"Every negative thought that pops into the brain so quickly...Think about that thought, literally say it in your own mind,

When it does literally tell yourself "" ok, there's that thought again"". Everytime it creeps in, ""ok theres that thought again"". YOU WILL RETRAIN YOURSELF XX"
1379,"Does anyone have treatment resistant depression? Meaning no medication has helped you. If so, can you advise what has helped you to finally get out of the hole?"
1380,"As I write this, I sit here crying, struggling to find the words.
I'll start from the beginning.. As a child I had the most loving parents, they gave me everything I ever wanted. They were the most amazing parents I could ever ask for but the person I was most closest to was my grandfather. He wasn't just my grandfather, he was my best friend. We done everything together, he would pick me up friday after school and I'd spend the weekend over at his, we would clean his car, mow the lawn, go fishing, go for drives while I tell him how school was that week. When I turned 12 he passed away, I didn't understand death and I was so angry at him, how could he leave me? Where has he gone and why doesn't he want to see me? I can't describe the hatred I had for him. I started getting involved in things such as drugs, gang crime and other things. At 16 there was a gang fight between the gang I was in and a rival gang. A member of the rival gang was stabbed and killed. Me along with a few others were arrested, I spent 6 months on remand before going to trail. At trial I was found not guilty and the main suspect was found not guilty due to self defence. After coming out I decided I wanted to turn my life around and better myself, me and a close friend went to college together to study graphic design. We had plans to finish college and start a business together. 8 months into the course, he passed away and I lost all motivation to finish college. I went back into my old lifestyle, I was moving up ''ranks'' in the gang and becoming known amongst rival gangs. Someone in the gang who I thought was my good friend invited me to a party so I said yeah. There was no party, it was a set up to rob me. I was jumped by a group of around 8, beaten all over and stabbed in my butt cheek. I decided this is it, this is where I change. I got a job, I kept clear from everyone in that lifestyle. I met a girl from work who I got close to, we got into a relationship. This is where my life became even more hell. Things started out good, she seemed caring. After a while she spoke about things sexually. Including others into our sex lives. I wasn't happy with it and we argued, she told me the only way I can be loved or wanted is by allowing these things. So I did. It was hurting me, I went back onto anti-depressants but I allowed it still because I wanted to feel wanted and loved. There came a time where I started drinking and taking drugs to numb myself, one night we drank together and she invited a few guys over. I was drunk and she allowed them to do things to me, sexually assault me, rape me. I kept quiet about it because as a guy I felt so ashamed, pathetic, dirty and disgusting. I felt like I deserved it because of the things I allowed. Eventually the relationship ended and I was in a dark dark place. I attempted suicide via an overdose. I wanted the pain and suffering to go away. I spent time gaming, not because I enjoyed it but to kill time. I could go online and what felt like 30 minutes was really a few hours. It helped time go by. I tried letting people back into my life, new people but I couldn't, I couldn't trust anyone. I felt like I didn't deserve anyone. Then I started talking to this girl and I felt good. I let her in and we got closer and closer. There was times we would speak sexually and I'd bring up getting other people involved. Not because I wanted it, but because in my mind I believed it's the only way for me to be loved and wanted. After each convo about it, I'd cry because I know deep down I wanted to be loved and wanted without these things. She became everything to me, for the first time in my life I felt normal. She would tell me her plans in life and I'd listen, I'd sit there and think about how I'd love to watch her, be by her side as show succeeds. We spent every night calling eachother for hours and hours. Every day I'd tell myself today is the day I tell her about my past but I bottled it every time because I was scared. I was scared to show someone how pathetic, dirty and disgusting I am. I eventually pushed her away. She's gone. There's nothing I want more in this world than a chance to sit her down and explain everything, a chance to show her how good I can be, another chance to grow with her. I'm back to feeling lonely and empty. I hate myself and regret so much in my life. All the things in my past are haunting me. I slept last night  contemplating an overdose . I've pushed more people away because I feel like I need to be alone, I can't see myself winning this battle and I don't want them to be hurt once I've gone. I'm going for a walk tonight and I don't want to come back. I want to just be free. I'm so tired."

1383,"Hi ok just joined so this may be a little long winded so apologies but just need to let it out, kinda anxious about just posting.



I’m a guy in my mid 20s and the last few years for me have been really difficult. A couple years ago I started to get really bad abdominal pains and to cut a long story short after several A + E trips and some minor surgery I still have these pains. The doctors have seemingly decided it’s a hyper sensitive bowel issue but it leaves me struggling as the pain isn’t always severe but it is always lingering and lurking and can suddenly go from a small level of pain to really severe. I am currently on pills to help with pain but they aren’t working great and this pain then causes issues in other aspects. Symptoms are mainly severe abdominal pain and frequent need to visit a toilet (with less than pleasant outcomes).



I’ve never really had much of a clear direction in life but this pain makes it very difficult to work and makes me feel a bit worthless and lack independence as I still have to rely on parents and live at home. I’m also quite an anxious person so this adds to that and I really struggle when meeting new people and feel quite lonely often. I only have a small group of friends (about 3) but we have a few different interests so sometimes feel like I miss things and we only meet once every 2 weeks maybe.



Another thing that I feel self conscious about is my whole look as the pills can cause side effects and I struggle with flaky scalp and weight gain due to this. In addition I’ve never had a partner or done much sexually so can make me feel a bit of a loser.



This all causes me to feel quite low and depressed most days, I struggle to find joy in a lot of things and just question what is the point. I have only recently begun to self harm, nothing too serious but not something I ever thought I’d be in a place to do.



I don’t really know what I’m expecting from people in response to this, I’m just hoping it helps me in a little way to have an outlet and if anyone has any advice pls share

if you’ve read this thank you for hearing me complain x"
1384,"Every day feels like torture. Even showering and brushing my teeth and using the bathroom feels unbearably arduous. The days feel like a never ending cycle of hell. And I obsess about them becoming even worse. I’ve started experiencing germ-related obsessions too and spend what feels like half my time in the bathroom washing my hands at this point. I get trapped in that cycle too. 
All I can think is that life is not worth it. 
The challenges of life far outweigh the good. I know life can be so beautiful but that just isn’t my life and won’t be, partly or maybe mostly because I have to live as me and I’m.. just the worst. And I don’t even want to try to get better because I don’t want to build hope only to get crushed again. And for some reason that I’m not completely sure of, getting better just seems bad too. Like more responsibilities and just like fooling yourself into thinking things are okay, hiding from the truth.
I feel pathetic even feeling this way like can I stop being so dramatic. I’m too old to still be feeling this way when I already have felt this my entire life. Instead of getting better, I’m getting worse as the years pass, even being in therapy. And I know that I have a lot to be grateful for at the same time and I should appreciate the moments that I have what I do. But it’s hard to do that cause I just then imagine them being taken away.
I’m so behind in life and have so many things I need to do but even the smallest things have become insurmountable. 
I’m just so tired."

......... im not into drugs or partying so that life style is not for me but looks like i might have to rent a room in the ghetto parts of town where all the theives and drug addicts are. no offense to them but i cant win. cant find treatment for mental health and now this.... what a living hell!"

1387,"Many medical articles states that after having a very stressful. Time or having an anxiety episode people often lose large amounts of hair 2 to 3 months after the episode. Has anyone have experience with that or know anything about it?
I'll see how much stress we one need for that to happen. Would it be one months of intense stress and no more after that or a longer period stress?"
1388,"Hi. So, I've been googling, and everything leads to depression. But it's not that? While when I'm stressed I do feel depressed, most of the time I'm content with life, yet since I was 6 years old I wanted to die. Death has always fascinated me and still does up to this day. Whenever I try to talk to people about this wanting to die (I am not suicidal, as I'm not harming myself or ever did. I tried committing suicide while being really really drunk, but on a sober mind never.) people say to get therapy. To be completely honest, everytime I've went to therapy, I couldn't get a diagnosis, made my mental state worse and brought me closer to being suicidal. 
I just want to die, even when I'm completely happy, I always fantasize about death. My close family and friends don't accept that. Push me off to therapy, which leaves me worse off than before and actually making me suicidal. I know this is supposed to be a mental illness, but... I have no idea what this is. This causes several problems. I don't take life seriously. I want to die already. I take big risks, they do pay off, but if I fuck up my life completely I don't really care? I remember being like 7-8 years old (I was a happy child in a loving home, only recently found out what death was back then) and I was fantasizing how I would die, even practicing the perfect ""last breath"". I even do it today, I am in my mid twenties. Does anyone else relate to this? Being content with life, but still wanting to die? Like. I don't like the planet, I don't like people tbh as well. I find they are arrogant when there's nothing to be arrogant about. Quite annoying. I was born to die. Is this obsession? Fetish? Noone seems to be able to diagnose me. 
Am I sad writing this? No 
Am I depressed? Haven't been for quite a while 
Stressed? Sometimes, but not right now. 
Does anyone have any advice or am I like the type of person who's gonna have a mental illness named after them? Cause I haven't found this type of thing anywhere or if it's out there Noone is talking about it."

Nothing interests me anymore, I don't want to die, but I'm just done with everything."
1390,"A couple months ago I renounced my religion. It was a huge change in my life and it was very hard to deal with. I want to thank you for the help I received last time, I really appreciate it.

Unfortunately, the depression returned again, but, at least, it's not as bad as it was back then. My problem is that the real world looks gray to me now. Love is just chemical reactions, afterlife is nonexistent, the soul is not a thing, all that kind of stuff is depressing the crap out of me and I don't know how to accept it. I really need your advice to start thinking more positively."
1391,"Does anyone here struggle with depression alongside lethargy and sleep apnoea?

Why Do I ask?

From 18 to my mid-fifties I never seemed to have a good night's sleep and occasionally had mild depression from being over-critical of myself which I kept under control with self help.  I had 2 separate successful and demanding careers where no-one had any idea of my underlying struggles.

Then, seemingly overnight, I had extreme tiredness that quickly led to depression and my effectively taking early retirement. Various antidepressants and talking cures had little or no effect and I overcame the depression with exercise and self-help/CBT. The tiredness remained and sleep studies showed that I had central sleep apnoea (where my brain stops signalling me to breathe rather than the more common throat issues) and Periodic Limb Movement Syndrome (where my legs and often my whole body twitch in my sleep); however, different treatments over 3 years all produced frustrating false dawns, leaving me with excellent sleep statistics but still struggling with feeling tired and crap.

Six weeks ago my struggles got too much and a crushing lethargy quickly led to depression. Doing anything other than sitting and vegetating is hard. I eat healthily and exercise, jogging 3-6 miles each day (not bad for someone in their sixties), so this isn't ME/CFS.  Over the years I've had all sorts of blood, neurological and cardiac tests that have come to nothing.  I've tried a variety of health-related pills without any success.  I seem to be banging my head against a wall, figuratively and literally (yes, really; I've done it in frustration many times).

With the backlog and increased demand caused by the corona virus reaction, I can't see myself getting any help through the NHS."
1392,"Hi everyone, 
I desperately need help. My partner is shutting down all the time, I feel like we aren't in a relationship anymore. He owns a business and I manage it. It's gotten to the point where I can no longer manage running it, I have suggested we sell it but he keeps saying that I'm fine running it. I'm really struggling and he doesn't help me much at all. He suffers from ptsd and now I'm guessing serious depression. I don't know how to help him and my own mental health is going downhill as well. I don't want to end up in hospital. He also has serious back pain but refuses to get any help. He has a psychologist that he sees weekly. 
When he does talk it's either about his back pain or he's snappy and moody. No more hugs, no more cuddles. 
I understand he's going through a lot but so am I and he doesn't seem to see it. I'm hurt and alone. 
It's been like this for months now and I can't live like this, any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
1393,"Finally learned to accept myself for who I am.

Just wanted to thank people who have been there for me in the past and took time to offer support."
1394,"I've come to the point where I'm completely and utterly done with reaching out to people. I don't care what anyone thinks, I'm done trying because I always fail again and again. I'm numb and have this feeling that I can only describe as being smothered. I'm not done with everyone's fake sympathy and unrequited feelings, if you can't do it, don't! It's as simple as that! I'm not someone to feel sorry for, I'm just stuck in between like usual. I'm suicidal with no friends or close relatives to help me through, I have a therapist but she's not supposed to be my friend. I know people these days are always joking about how depressed they are and it honestly doesn't help me. It only invites trouble into my life and creates this false sense of security. I've been neglecting myself and so has everyone else. I hate how I feel like such a burden now and how my dad's toxic parenting has done nothing but give me a low-self esteem. I'm sorry to break to you, but there's nothing healthy about a father who pushes his own shortcomings onto his own children and then gets to play favorites as well. He has caused me so much anxiety and depression growing up due to his emotionally distant nature. He literally tries to use materialism to make amends and when you confront him, he'll use what he's done for you against you! My mother has had it with his shenanigans and knows how negatively he's affected me. Plus, I'm codependent due to my anxiety and depression so he has more control over my life and I hate myself for letting that happen. I'm seriously considering suicide because I feel like nobody cares! No, really! Nobody actually cares, it's all for sympathy's sake. If you cared, you'd reach out regardless if you know them or not. You'd let them talk and you'd only listen. You'd see yourself in their situation and you'd let your experience shape theirs. Let's be honest, nobody cares these days and they never will. You're always going to be in it for yourself and it's always going to be about your opinion. If it's in your heart, you'd say what needs to said. Don't fool yourself and you'll be spared. 

This is how I'm feeling at the moment, don't take offense to it. I'm just angry right now and all I can do is stop everything. I give up."
1395,"Hi, I'm 24. I need your help. I bored my family and everyone by this, even one doctor and no one knows how can I help myself. Anyone feel/felt the same?  I have headaches that feels like nausea in my head/early fainting feeling nearly every day. I have been vomiting every day for year and a half, right now much less only when I'm on my period (5 days a month). I have insomnia, moving/trembling in my full body (mostly legs) when I try to sleep (when stressed especially).  And feel motion sickness every day even when I'm not in car, or anything. Like I'm going to throw up, faint. I had seizure when I was 15 and never again all of sudden. I'm stressed, depressed and on Zoloft. I can't be great college student because all this. Is this something more than psychological stress/depression?"
1396,"I just joined mental health forum as I was diagnosed with depression at 12 and have recently experienced my most severe depressive episode and feel that my depression is noW interfering with my ability to function. My most recent severe depressive episode felt like it came out of nowhere and I was unable to move off of my bathroom floor (it came on in the shower). I am unsure if anyone else has experienced it but I could physically feel it and had no control over my body, this is a first for me. I was not able to get up for hours despite telling myself to get up. I am very scared as this has been the most extreme episode to this day and I have attempted suicide as well as been hospitalized on multiple occasions. I have also been experiencing an almost out of body feeling as if nothing is real and I just feel strange and out of it, more so than usual. I know depression is something I will deal with the rest of my life but am scared as for a while it felt like it was more in control and the bad days were not quite as bad, I even started dating as I finally felt I was stable enough to pursue a romantic relationship. I can’t quite put in to words the severity of this episode but it is affecting my work, my (limited) social interactions, and I know if I don’t snap out of it soon it will impact my friendships and my new relationship. I want to resume therapy but it is difficult due to the current situation with COVID."
1397,"Hi
I have had a bad turn again. I came off my medication a year ago, and suffered a period of dissociation but got through it. Been through a lot of change, broke up with person I was seeing. Sounds odd but we didn’t know each other for long but thought I had met my soulmate. Work has changed a lot and I have been struggling with it. Have been really down the last 2 months But now started feeling dissociated and disconnected again as well as sometimes sucidal. Don’t want to go back on meds. What do I do feel low"
1398,"Hello beautiful people, I'm new here. So, I am severely depressed. Last weekend I survived an suicide attempt. My life is slowly falling apart. My mom kicked me out of the house because she couldn't deal with my depression anymore. I'm now living with my dad he's so worried for me and he's always there to listen to me although he can't understand my problems. I feel like I'm a walking corpse when I take my antidepressants, I feel like there's not a single bit of life left in me. I have no goals, no motivation, no hobbies anymore. I always feel like this is what I'm going to deal with for the rest of my life. My heart is telling me to move on and that I will be happy again but my brain is telling me to give up. I am so angry at myself for letting this happen. I don't want to feel like there's always something that's pulling me down, I want to be free. I have a hard time telling people how I feel because my family would often tell me "" You aren't depressed, You have no right to be depressed, my life was a lot worse..."" so I just go quiet and say that I'm fine. If someone would give me an advice I would really appreciate it. Thank you for reading."
1399,"I wish I could be addicted to World of Warcraft or other games. I just don't have any fuckin' hope. Even if I do, I'm still depressed and unhappy. The only thing that makes me happy is Blizzard's StarCraft Series and Warcraft Series, which I played both years ago. I love Warcraft, and Warcraft was even more fun than StarCraft.

I given up everything to survive. I wanted to be an otaku, and date someone who shared my interests. Doodle anime girls, drive nice cars (not expensive ones). I wanted to write variety of stories. Creepypastas, Romance stories, Action stories. Read books of various kinds.

Can't do that anymore. Living with my parents restricts these hobbies. Plus, South Korea demands oppressive ethics. Doing my hobbies will get nowhere in life here, even for Americans like me.

All because of what? Couldn't afford shit in US. Especially medical care, which South Korea is good at. Like I said, I have severe bipolar disorder and I need affordable healthcare."
1400,"Dear all, 

it is almost 4 years now that my mother is diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder. She has been treated many times with several antidepressants (SSRI, MAOI....). Last medication was a MAOI (Jatrosom) which helped her at the beginning but then it got worse again. 

She is refusing the electroconvulsive therapy. 

I'm thinking about discontinuation of antidepressants, since they won't help her anyway. There are two options: 

1. After discontinuation, it will get worse or stay same and after a (maybe long) period she will come to herself. 

2. It will get much much worse and the possibility of remission will decline. 

What do you think? 

Thanks 

Kian"
1401,"Im an 18 year old boy and I dont know if I should look for help. I will explain.

 I have a pretty normal and boring life, I go to school and work. I have an internship and I am doing pretty good on all of these things. My internship wanted me to work there when I have vacation from school and asked if I could come back for my next internship. I am also an assistent clubmanager at our local football club. I have a good close group of friends. And a good family and good parents. But for a long time now, I feel like I didn't deserve any of it. You know... that someone just gave it to me and that I didnt have to do anything for it. Even if people tell me that I deserved it and worked hard for it.  And whenever I'm sad, I feel that I am just being a pussy. Especially now my brother has a hard time finding a new job while I got offered 2 jobs in a week, I feel that I have nothing to complain about.

 I can't seem to be happy and I lost interest in almost everything. My sleep schedule is non excistent and I want to harm myself sometimes or even kill myself lately. I am also starting to experience intense fear sometimes. Mostly when I think about my position as an assisten clubmanager at my football club. It is my responsibility to find a referee, but if I cant find anyone than I would have to do it myself. And just thinking about it can make me almost panic and left shaking. But I dont understand why, since I have been a referee for almost 2 years now and never experienced it before. And this is just one example, I have more things like that. Like being afraid of going to party's, meeting new people or even seeing my friends that I have for years now.

And I feel that I cant tell this to any of my friends because they wont understand, tell it to other people, make fun of me or just dont care. And I dont want to tell my parents because I dont want to be a burden. At night I always think about all of these things and what a loser I am, how much I didnt deserve anything I have. Or I think about people talking behind my back like my boss or something. That he is telling other people how stupid and childish I am. But then I think that I shouldnt complain because they are not real problems and that I am just being a pussy. So I dont know what I should do. I guess that Im more confused than anything else."
1402,I'm never taking any antidepressants before. However I am having a depressive episode for the first time in my life for the last 25 days. I'm afraid to get onto antidepressants though I feel I can control the anxiety that seems to be 24 hours a day. The only thing I'm concerned about Side effects and withdrawn from the different anti-depressants. Does anyone know any antidepressants that work and have hardly any side effects were not addictive? I thought there must be new ones out like that?
1403,"Hey everyone. I'm a guy and I want to share my problems which has been affecting me for the last three years. Long post ahead, please bear with me.

So here goes.

I'm an architecture graduate, and I graduated a year ago. I had a really tough time during my senior year, and the things that happened during that time is affecting me badly, to the point that I have changed as a person. To start my story, I belonged to a large group of friends (I think we were about 15 in the group) and our group was formed during my junior year. There are 6 of us boys, and 9 girls. Everything was fine though (aside from the small bad jokes and a little favoritism). Until senior year came, and that was the time we were doing our thesis. I noticed the sudden change in my friends, some of the boys suddenly became arrogant. They make fun or criticize my work too much. They said things like ""your topic isn't as good as ours"" or ""I should have been the one to have your topic, because I can do so much better"". They also bullied me and humiliated me in front of people like calling me a pervert or a noob. They also bullied me for getting rejected by a girl I tried to court. At some point I got fed up and talked to three of them about it. I was so disappointed at how they responded. The first person did say sorry to me though but he wasn't really that sincere. The second one told me ""Well I do this to my high school friends too, and they don't have a problem with it, so why are you so mad about it? You're too sensitive"". The third person hit me really hard. He told me I do not have enough confidence and that is the reason why they we're bullying me. In short he was victim-blaming me. He even told me to watch this ""How to be an alpha male"" video. I have to be clear that at this time I was already building my confidence and some people already respect me. I've known these people since I was a freshman (I didn't have the confidence back then) and he did explain to me that he still sees that freshman version of me, which probably explains his actions. The girls didn't really care that much about me though, probably because I don't drink alcohol. It's because most of the people in this group do drink alcohol, and only two of us don't. They also have favoritism, and yes I was the one left out. The bullying still continued though, and greatly affected me especially because this was happening along with a stressful time (thesis) and we were also having financial problems at that time. They criticized my work too much and pointed out all its flaws. I don't really have a problem with people who criticize my work, the difference with these people is that they also laughed. A few days before the final defense, I cried and even thought I wouldn't make it. But thankfully, I did and was able to pass. I spent the last days of college with these people, because of course they were my friends even all through that. I tried to see if ever they will change and be back with what they were in the past. But they didn't. Moving forward, I graduated, and at this time I kept thinking if I should maintain my connection with the group, because some people in the group are really nice, but the majority isn't. The last day we were together was at the beach. It was a celebration of our success as college graduates. One of the girls called me out for not drinking alcohol with them. She lowkey told me that I don't know how to relate with them because of not drinking alcohol. I don't drink alcohol because it's my personal choice, and that I felt that she didn't respect my personal choices.

I had doubts on whether I should keep the connection with this group or not. At this time all these people who bullied me and gave me a hard time immediately got jobs or to be more exact, apprenticeship (some of them got jobs instantly because some employers know them/their parents personally). Because in architecture, a graduate has to undergo apprenticeship to become an architect. Meanwhile, I was having a hard time looking for apprenticeship and that made me depressed. I got rejected in all the companies I applied for. What added fuel to the fire was these people kept asking me if I already have a job. To be clear, I am the eldest child in our family, and we aren't really that well-off. But we are financially enough to be able to send us children to a private school, but not well-off enough to have a good lifestyle. (Btw we don't have our own house and we live in an apartment). I did disconnect with this people by not talking to them and not responding to their messages (I still keep them as facebook friends so maybe one day when I become successful, I'll make sure they'll see it).

I got depressed because of all these, the bullies keep flexing their jobs and showing it off. Meanwhile, until now I never got my first job. I feel the pressure, being the eldest in a not-so-well off family and having this responsibility to build my family's success. I did talk about these to some of my friends in high school and they did helped me. But then suddenly some of these high school friends got into a relationship. At this point I wasn't really envious of them getting in a relationship until one of them posted on social media about me being the only one who doesn't have a girlfriend. This annoyed me but since this was a friend, I told her not to post it in social media because it did trigger my feelings (my college friends bullied me for getting rejected). I also opened up about me feeling jealous of them. She scolded me for feeling that way even if I told her about those bullying experiences with my college friends. The year went by and still I wasn't able to get a job. And until this year, where we got caught up in this pandemic, which caused me to be more miserable.

All this time, after graduation, I always stayed at home and rarely went outside. It was because I feel ashamed for not being able to get a job. Also because my parents are strict, they don't want me going outside unless necessary. I have been staying at home for a year until now (because of the pandemic) and it's really depressing especially because I don't have a lot of friends, and I'm currently single. I never had a girlfriend before. 

Because of these experiences, I have become an envious and bitter person. I wasn't an envious person before but I think these experiences changed me. I also swear a lot now (I never really swore before until now) and it became a habit for me. I feel frustration and insecurity. I feel this bitterness of not having a job or a girlfriend. I get frustrated every time I see someone posting their job or couples in social media. I know it's wrong to be envious but sometimes I can't really help it. These experiences also cause me to overthink sometimes like I feel anxious about the future, or sometimes I think, if my college degree was even worth it. I also tend to overreact at times like sometimes I think why do people who torment you get better at life. This overthinking tends to get out of hand sometimes especially because I have been staying at home all this time (before pandemic until now) and doing nothing. I did tell these to my family and some high school friends but they only tell me to get over it. I don't have anyone else to talk to about these things, they'll probably just tell me to move on. These experiences also cause my anger to sometimes go out of control, I say things that can really hurt. My conscience keeps telling me to stop being this kind of person, but still I tend to go out of control. I feel stuck and hopeless, and my attitude slowly becoming worse. I know my attitude is not good, but I fear that it's becoming more of a habit now. Sometimes I think I just want to go back to the person I was before I was bullied, but yeah frustration and insecurity are getting the best of me. 

I'm having a hard time because the past keeps coming back to me, and I'm having a hard time to move on because I can't seem to move forward with my life, being stuck at home (even before pandemic) and not having friends to talk to about these things. I try to distract myself with other things, but yeah the past still keeps coming back.

I believe that what I really need is someone who I can talk about these things and understand, and not just tell me to ""move on"" or ""get over it"". I want to become a better person and so I want to start by tackling these experiences. I hope that maybe someone can start a conversation with me in this post. Thanks."
1404,i suffer bad anxiety and depression. i would say mostly anxiety and i have found some really use information. apparently alot of people with anxiety disorders may have abnormal activity in there temporal lobe of there brain and being put on lamictal or tegratol can in some people really really help there mood and anxiety. has anyone had luck with an antiseizure med for there anxiety? i know its mainly for seizures but off label it can work wonders apparently.
1405,Feeling hopeless
1406,"I'm a 28 year old man and I have had suicidal thoughts because of being skinny and having a small body frame in general, plus I still look like I could be 18 years old (good thing or bad thing?). Have had to deal with people that judge me and say things about me usually behind my back but loud enough for me to hear. I never have felt like other people ever and all I want is to be able to do what other people do and take for granted everyday. Just even being able to go to my local park without having social anxiety and feeling paranoid that everyone is watching me or laughing about how I look. It upsets me so much and I've been on anti depressants but stopped as I don't want to become dependant on them. I don't know what to do, feels like nobody understands me or can help me. I'm sick and tired of being like this and having these problems and starting to hate people because of how some have treated me. Please any help or advice not sure where else to turn."
1407,"Sometimes I feel like a boring character in boring movie. Same things everyday I wake up whether it's a weekday or a weekend. I also feel like being alone all the time is getting the best of me. It Makes me hate life, it makes me depressed , pessimistic and the worst of all I get emotional nihilism. It's been a year or so and I havnt found a single friend in this city, it sucks. I just get have this feeling that I am bored of this world. I don't know what it is. Is it a spiritual thing or just a feeling I don't know. I just wish good would take me. At times I am tried of being alive. Theirs are times where I feel like a lost soul in strange world."
1408,"Lately my job has been causing me severe depression. I called out yesterday and today simply because I didn't have it in me to go there. It's not a particularly stressful job, but the culture of the coworkers is a lot of drama and bs, management is a joke, and it's super boring. Idk what to do until I can get a new job. I've been applying, but it won't happen overnight obviously"
1409,"I really want to blow my brains out right now. I stayed friends with my caretaker after she quit her job and she just ended our friendship while blaming it on the power differential, while she always talked openly with me about all her problems. Also I am disappointed in dating sites and Tinder. I barely have had even one single interesting long-lasting conversation. Most of the time I get blocked for seemingly no apparent reason or I stop getting reactions pretty soon and are left completely ignored. I also I sent multiple long e-mails to different content creators on Youtube which I really like who are all ignoring me (or at least for one month now). And all my parents seem to be able to do while I'm broken is stand there and sit with me. Which I can't really seem to appreciate. I don't even know what I do want them to do. And all the conversations with my many caregivers seem to be somewhat the same. I have an opinion or feel a certain way and they try to convince me otherwise. Sometimes I can see their point, mostly I don't. It all seems so pointless. It seems like I'm heading nowhere, my fate in mankind is beyond repair, and somehow I don't feel loved. I just feel alone and I feel lost."
1410,"There`s any other here who has spent really long time without having anyone to talk to ? I mean really long time, a whole year, a whole 2 years, and more. Not talking about casual conversations, I mean, a good talk, with someone you enjoy to spend time, a talk that you enjoy, a chat with a friend. Ive been so many time without having that. Ive been at least 5 years. This days to me, have a talk with someone that I enjoy seems just like a dream. Thats the main reason I joined here to this forum, to find other people that I can relate to, have someone to talk. Any other here have the same problem ? Of not find someone to talk, find someone you can feel a conection ?"
1411,"I think I've also had a tendency towards depression, but I feel it peaked in puberty (mine is connected I believe to fluctuations in hormones and PMDD) but also recent life experiences. I am a bit of a cynical idealist, I know life is cruel but I also hope it's not. In the past year I lost my mother to cancer (she was suffering on and off for five years) and saw her die. In the same year, I discovered my long distance boyfriend had been cheating on me with multiple women despite our plans to move to be together. One of the women fell pregnant. The whole time he lied to both of us that he was infertile so I had to come back and have pregnancy tests and blood/urine/self-swab tests to see if I was okay (fortunately I am.)

Due to covid19, I am unable to work (a little here and there only) and I find myself just feeling utterly hopeless. I feel like every area of my life has broken or is breaking apart. All I want to do is eat and sleep. I don't really see the point dreaming or hoping anything, because it always seems to go wrong. People are selfish and disappointing - at some point 99% of them WILL lie, cheat or leave. The world is geared for instant gratification from food to sex to entertainment. Even though we are destroying our world and each other, we won't stop.

This morning I have felt emptier and sadder than I have in a long while. My period is due so I know my hormones are feeding into this. Life just feels cruel, unfeeling. If you are emotional, sensitive, caring, you will be stomped on. To survive, you have to be cold, numb, unfeeling. I've found myself feeling like a little kid recently, just wanting to eat junk and watch cartoons. I can't stomach anything adult like sex (which in my mind feels tainted by an abusive liar) or work (which feels like a trap.)

Just wanted to share with people who might understand x"
1412,"I'm feeling extreme and excessive anger in past year. I sometimes hit myself when I'm angry so I will not hurt anyone. I fought a psychotic episodes or something like that for 8 years, I was delusional, depressed and suicidal but not angry at all. Just felt worthless and paranoid and numb. In past 2 years I was feeling a lot better, no delusions, no paranoia, depression. But now depression came back with anger. I'm angry at the world. I hate this world, this society, everything. I feel there is no future for me. I'm lesbian by the way, my friends do not understand me, my best friend was psychologically attacking me for so long and I finally realized that. He was actually bullying me for who I am but he is gay too so I haven't realised attacking for so long. I really loved him, trusted him but he was so toxic and mean. If people like me don't support and accept me, who will? This world is not meant for me. I feel like that. This world is for ""common"" things, not for me. This only get worse each day. I sometimes pray to God for better and happy days. I feel that He loves me. My mother is so cold and distant, she is depressed too. I think I'm reason of her depression, my psychotic episodes in past possibly. I have dog and cat and I love them more than anything, they are only positive aspect in my life. I'm scared of society. Society is only made for men, never was meant for women, especially homosexual women. Society is f*cked up. Violence, p*rn, p*dophilia and rich culture is everywhere. Where is humanity? I just want to be somewhere else. Everyone is bullying me. I have distance with a lot people I know because of my anger and their possible attack."
1413,"These low moods are so annoying man. I have a couple days where I feel alright then back down in the shit. 

Im laying in bed trying to find the motivation to get up and eat something but really can’t be bothered.
Stuff I used to enjoy just really isn’t doing it for me. 
I’m getting tired of other people, I can feel one of these days I’m gonna snap but in reality I won’t because it’ll just make everything worse. 
I just wanna fucking feel something, anything."
1414,"it makes me feel hopeless having to rely on drugs... in order for me to sleep at night i have to take atleast 1mg or 1.5mg of ativan. it use to only take .5mg so slowly i am gaining tolerance to this drug which scares me. on top of that my depression and anxiety are bad and i find myself literally in panic mode the whole day just rushing and not being able to calm down. when it comes to chores around the house, working on anything like fixing something my brain is a mess. getting groceries, making dinner, forgetting some of the groceries in the car, than i accidently left my keys in my car, than i cook and forgot wait i need clean dishes to put the food on and im rushing this whole time and i have no off button my brain is rattled. so however thats fixed i would love to know. cant even wait in line at the grocery store without feeling like a panic attack is happening. and if i dont take ativan at night ill be up until 5 in the morning before i fall asleep! so im being controlled by drugs. has anyone tried some homemade concoctions for there mental issues that worked? maybe lemon balm, magnesium and gaba would be a good thing to take before bed??"
1415,"I am afraid that there’s too many things wrong with me to ever find happiness and marriage. I wonder if anyone could share if they’ve had any success finding love as a person with mental illness. At this point I don’t even bother because I feel like a burden. And I feel like who would ever want to be in a relationship with someone who has problems.

I feel very depressed because I am dealing with:
Hypersensitivity
Severe depression
OCD
Emotional eating 
I’m overweight
My hair is falling out and I’m unwell physically
I’m unhappy with my job
I still love with my mom at 25 because I can’t afford to move out.

I feel so afraid that my life won’t improve because of how my mental illness impacts my life. My deepest fear is of never finding partnership due to my many issues. And overall I feel like such a failure.

If anyone has anything hopeful to say I would appreciate it. Because right now I don’t have hope for the future."
1416,"Lately I've come to the realization that everything I've been doing in my life so far is wrong. I've been playing the wrong instrument with the wrong hand. I've been finding the wrong people in the wrong places. It's all wrong to the point where I feel utterly hopeless. I've been having restless nights and when I finally get around to sleep, I have dreams where I'm running from someone. Everyday is coupled with anxiety attacks and a feeling of existential dread. I feel haunted by the same thought, ""everything up to this point in my life is wrong!"" I honestly can't take it anymore, I wake up uninterested in getting up because I know that being awake means facing my mistakes once again. I just assume it'll be another day of hearing myself rant and rave and I usually end up right. I don't know if this is a precursor to what a quarter life crisis is supposed to be and if so, I feel it miserably. I live with my family but I have no friends or any close relatives, I'm alone most of the time. I have delved back into the world of self-harm just so I can help myself handle the stress, otherwise, I'm being nuisance towards my family. I feel like a burden on my family due to having a history of suicidal ideation, so if my family could cover me in bubble wrap, they would. I feel like my depression has dug a hole for me and now that I'm coming to my senses, I've realized how far deep I'm actually in it. It's full of years of poor decision making solely based on fear and anxiety. It's from those times how being forced fed shoddy advice from people who claim to be on your side. Blurry teenage years that have since blindsided me with ill intent. I could go on and on and on. I just hate realizing all the lies I've told myself and how they've intimidated me into silence. It honestly makes me wish I would've just called it quits years ago just so that I didn't have any regrets. I hate who I've become and yet, being myself is just as scary."
1417,I drink about once every 2 weeks. I feel so much anxiety and shakes from last night I went overboard and had to many. I don't know why I can drink anymore. I have such bad panic attacks my head feels like it's buzzing like I'm going to pass out or die. I just feel terrible
1418,"I had a really bad argument with my parents.
They basically said that I am not normal, that it's not their fault if i dont have friends. they said i cannot talk with people, that other girls my age can and are really nice people. that im asocial and i should live alone. that if i'll marry, my husband will kick me out within a month because he cannot eventually stand me. that i repulse people because of my behaviour.
i thought to kill myself when they said such things. i really wish i had friends like everyone else, but it seems i am unable. i wish somebody could understand that i am depressed and the depression kills the joy in everything i see. what hurt me the most about these words is that they think i didn't want to have friends, but in reality is that i could not make friends with anyone. what did i have to offer to anyone but sadness? im so sad and deeply hurt, i want to end it all. i see no light, no future. and it's been years, and nobody noticed that i barely float in this sea of sadness. even when i try to talk with someone they dont listen to me, they say i am evil, oh evil, how i hate this word! i wish that would exist someone who could believe me. but it seems impossible. the only people i talk to, my parents, dont believe a word, for them im only selfish and evil. and they humiliate me with the most terrific words. i know these words are true, but i cannot change that! it's too late, too late for everything. why i become like this, where did all my happiness go? it's not my fault and yet it is, im not like they said and yet i am.
ive been crying for two hours now, and i have a terrible headache. i am empty and my soul is shattered."
1419,"Last year was hell for me. My delusional mother was angry, violent, and often had fits of rage. She attacked people and almost got arrested. And yet, I couldn't send her to the hospital; I had no money. I couldn't get help from welfare. Most (not all- I have my aunt and grandmother helping me) family members couldn't help me out and it was hellish. Thankfully, she received medications from Korea's finest hospital, thus effectively treating her from the illness.

I went through trauma, and constantly vomited. As time passed by, I was cured from it. But as for now, I'm depressed. Initially, I thought it was burnout or exhaustion. It was hard struggling through school because of this mess.

But I'm fully rested and feel better. But the depression continues. I have no hope.

I try to think positively. Like, if she goes off again, I can send her to the hospital. I can save money by moving out of my home, use the money I receive from my father and pay for her hospital fees, and I can move in with my grandmother.

It was a good, realistic hope I could've EVER think of. And after I graduate, I can move back to US to continue my education.

But COVID-19 is robbing me of that hope. Even if it wasn't the virus, the economy in US is already messed up. I'll always be unemployed. And don't get me started about South Korea's situation.

Nevertheless, these problems aren't the factors that depress me. I can't think up of anything makes me happy. I'm feeling depressed and miserable.

Not to long ago, I could drink caffeine to cure it, but I have serious stomach problems. Can't take them anymore.

I'm hopeless by the moment. I think I should go to my psychiatrist. Unfortunately, he can't prescribe antidepressants because I get enraged and gets violent.

I've taken them. Effexor, Prozac, and Abilify. I had delusions that everyone was short-tempered and could beat the living daylights out of me (well, some of them actually are). I wanted to punch and kick these hot-heads until they could threaten me no more. I felt threatened and wanted to harm people who were giving me hell.

Thus, I can't accept that I have a depression. Because I have a severe bipolar disorder. If I get treated for depression, I go nuts with rage.

But if I let my symptoms go untreated, I fear that my depression might go worse.

I can't take antidepressants. I might go violent. But my mother's psychiatrist told me that Abilify doesn't cause anger."
1420,"there is research showing that antidepressants DAMAGE the brain and dull it. ativan and benzos and antiphycotics clearly damage the brain and cause dementia... so if we cant use drugs whats the answer?? talking about it does not help, diet and exercise does not help.... the only thing that DID work was an SSRI i took but it stopped working....its so confusing weather you can trust medication or not. ive been depressed for months on end so its obviously not going to get better on its own. as i said exercising and diet are not helping. i guess i have to throw medication at myself"
1421,"Is it weird that I've kind of accepted that being depressed is a part of me and that I am reluctant to persevere with treatment because I'm so not used to not feeling miserable that it seems abnormal? I feel that I am a non entity, I don't count and I'm nothing and when I seek treatment and start to feel better about myself then I feel like a fraud and that I don't deserve to feel positive and good about myself. I don't know if this makes any sense but it's how I feel at the moment. I've just started back on antidepressants but am considering stopping them as I don;t feel it's any point trying to recover, I don't feel worthy of treatment. Sorry everyone x"
1422,"I have been fighting with depression for around one and a half years. My family pushed me aside for my younger sister, I have no future in education and I have nothing to really live for. It feels as if I'm in a bad dream I can't wake up from. I have kept all of my problems to myself and I recently decided I need someone to talk to about everything"
1423,"I am so awkward around people, it’s like I’ve got zero common sense and I’m a complete idiot. It’s like I forget how to think. And my heart races and it feels like I am having a panic attack. Then after that I go and cry for an hour. I am just miserable. This is a repeating cycle. Sometimes it’s going ok but then an embarrassing moment happens, even around my own family, and I get really depressed again. I’m so tired of being controlled by my anxiety. My family probably think I’m a complete idiot for all the stupid things I’ve done even though it’s due to anxiety. Not to mention the fact I’ve never told anyone about the anxiety and depression and how they have together affected me. I’ve thought about killing myself to just escape. That would be great. I sometimes think about running away from home while no one is there just for attention because it feels like I’m being ignored even though it’s all my fault because I don’t tell anyone. Oh and I have referred to these people as my family but I don’t feel close to them, they are actually my foster family but my social anxiety has prevented me from speaking to them for my whole life and so I don’t even have people I can talk to. Most people have parents they are close to but I am too anxious to even go near them. Also have panic attacks around my siblings too. Yet another reason why I should just die."
1424,"Hello everyone, I hope you're all doing fine during this time period !!

I recently started to feel more like I deserve to be hurt more, I feel like my ""struggles"" are nothing next to what other people might experienced. 
I get upset and anxious around people, I am legitimately scared of most of them and I feel like this is very stupid. 
I thought ""where did all the anxiety and depression started?"" and realised that I am overly sensitive and should be over it, I should not have depression just because I was sexually assaulted at 14 by my boyfriend, when some women are really raped, just because all my friends left me and I got bullied, when some children unfortunately die because of bullying, just because my stepfather went to jail, when some people lose their father because of gang violence...

I feel like an imposter in this forum, my struggles are not worth it and as important as yours. I am just weak :/
But If my struggles are real, why can't people see them ? I always confide in the wrong person and cry of regret after"
1425,"I am afraid that this sadness will never go away.
What hurts me the most is that people dont value my feelings. They think that I am naive and cannot take a decision by myself. The truth is that in the last years i didnt care what was happening with me, I was so depressed and looking back I have little or no memory of that time, it's like fog. 

My parents want to control every little aspect of my life. It's almost funny since when I was younger they didn't care how I was and then suddenly they know what is the best for me. They are manipulative. Sadly, I am aware of this. At first I trusted them because I love them like any child does and I didnt want to believe that they could be like that. Maybe they are not aware of it. Anyhow, they like to make me feel guilty and they succeed in doing so every time. It's been like this for years, and even now I cannot run from this constant guilt for not pleasing them that I should not feel. 
I wanted to believe or hope that after graduating I will be finally free from their grip, but it seems it wont be like that. 
They are planning to be keep me near them forever. I dont want this. I despise them for wanting to keep me like a dog at their feet. Some part of me wants to fight and say goodbye forever, but I feel like there is no point in doing so, I will be depressed whatsoever, away or near them. 

It's not like I have low self-esteem, but the depression overcomes every little aspect of my life. Everyday the little joy in me diminishes and I cannot take it back. I dont enjoy almost anything. I lose interest in new things at the same pace I gain it. If I ever accomplish something I always think that it has no value and I became sad again. My dreams are nothing and even if they become true I will most probably become sad again. 
I feel like I gave up a long time ago, I am kind of addicted to feeling miserable, to be in pain. No surprise if I cope by starving myself. It's like I deserve pain and I enjoy hurting myself. It make no sense though, because instead of being angry at people for hurting me I direct this anger towards myself. I don't know why I act like this. Maybe because I dont want people to get hurt, I prefer to hurt myself than others. I care about people even if they dont give a damn about me.

I always put others first. I believe that there my fault lies. The root of all my problems. And it pains me a great deal if I dont do this, make my parents proud, I feel endless guilt and shame. I feel selfish and bad person if I think about myself first. I believe this comes from my mom telling me I was a ""evil"" person that only cares about herself. She still tells me this. I dont know if this is mental abuse but I am sure that's not fair.  

I feel just empty and bitter."
1426,Things just are getting harder and I feel worse and worse about myself and the future. I'm trying but it feels like i'm in a sinking ship holding a bucket with a giant hole in the bottom. I want to give up but know I'm trapped and can't I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore.

1428,"Yesterday I celebrated my 29th birthday... the last 3 years I have hated them. I will cry, lay in bed and be a total witch the entire day. 

I had a hard upbringing... I was molested by a sibling, I do not know when it began but I know when it ended. 
My mother worked all the time, I was mainly left with my father who suffered with bipolar and schizophrenia... so i was always wondering around with cousins or my brothers and often left to fend for myself. 

fast forward to now... i have alot of issues building relationships... i am struggling daily with the anxiety and depression 

My mother is at her own dark place, stays depressed, stays drunk or high... shes just not the same person i remember growing up

she was supposed to come see me and the children for my birthday... she did not show up when we face timed she was not ready to go anywhere and was in full force cleaning mode.. 

she apologized to me for some things in the past, and then began to tell me how id hurt her and how she needed an apology to??? It was like she had finally apologized for all those years in all those hard crazy traumatic years... but then took it back???

I got off the phone with her so lost... struggling and began to darken down into my depression for the day it ruined my birthday and once again i found myself lost again blaming myself... angry, sad hurt confused...

how do i get through this pain? how can i move forward in my life, how do i forgive someone who keeps hurting me and honestly has no grasp on how much ive endured or does she? 

I am in counselling twice a month... but i got so much crap im working through i dont even know where to begin

1429,"Hi,

I'm not sure if this is posted in the correct section.

however I'm in a kind of a situation where my own blood is making me feel like ****.

As the behaviour of my cousins, etc has changed over the 10 years or so, we where tight as kids but as time progressed we became distant.

I believe this is due to my past in school, college, university I got into drugs, alcohol and bad company etc and my family are quite religious etc.

I feel like they look down on me, I'm not very good at approaching if I do I will get angry and get into a fight.

There is a lot of favouritism going on.

That's why I keep away from family functions or when I do go on Eid I just sit there in the corner by myself. itching to leave. 

Any advice ?"
1430,so before and during my menstrual cycle is it normal to go through depression?
1431,"today i was driving home and I don’t know how to explain what I was feeling but i just started crying. I kept thinking what if I just didn’t stop? If I didn’t come home would anyone notice ?  I’m home. I’m fine... this isn’t urgent. I just can’t stop crying, I’m scared. I’m scared because I know this isn’t who I am. I’m scared because I didn’t go through some dramatic event. I don’t deserve to feel this way. People have it so much worse and get through it why can’t I have a normal day. I stopped talking to all of my friends so I don’t have anyone to talk to. And even when I did have friends I never said anything because i felt like I was seeking attention. the only reason I can talk about it now is because nobody knows who I am on here. Please what is wrong with me. Someone. Anyone"

1433,"Hi,
This is my first post. I used to be a very happy person and am happy with my boyfriend even though sometimes we have some arguments.. I have been working in a company for two years at junior level then promoted to a senior level for 3.5 years. Everything was fine and I was happy. In March2020 I had a chance to move to a different department and it is to do with sales and previously my job was mainly admissions for students applications. The first day I started at new job was working from home. First two months were listening to some presentation trainings and it was fine, until the day I need to do presentation for PowerPoint I started to have insomnia and not knowing what to do... so then I told my new manager that I didn’t think I could do it and wanted to change back... they were being helpful and talked to HR and they pretty much let me do the old job for 4 weeks and then decide whether they can change me completely back. At the end of the 4 weeks they confirmed I could be back as a senior role and I was happy at first. Then I started to feel panic again cos I felt like there were so many changes in the months that I was gone and then the junior people I trained are now really good, I started to feel like I couldn’t do anything, lost my confidence and had to take sick leaves due to depression and anxiety - every time I turned on the laptop I felt shaky hand and shaky body I couldn’t do it and in the end the GP has signed me off for a month however as I felt like I couldn’t do it anymore and my mom is worried (all my family is in Hong Kong), I decided to resign and using sick leave and annual leave to cover the notice period.. it’s a painful decision. And my boyfriend and I were together for 4 years in June but we both know there are some issues between us and we have no future so I will be even sadder when I leave UK (planing to leave in end of August). We are still living together but we know on the day I leave we will be separated..
Even when I’m currently in sick leave, I’m not good at all. Everyday has nothing to do and thinking about how am I be able to find a job in HK. The job I had in the UK is my first ever proper job after graduating from Masters. (I came to UK in 2013 and been staying since then). I have not worked in HK before and I feel like I won’t be able to do any job. My experience in the UK may not help. And I have spent my parents money to do a masters but I can’t write well or present so unless I find a job that suits me I feel like I won’t be able to do anything..
I also got worries that I got so many friends and colleagues on social media.. how would they think of me etc some of them asked me how am I lately as I haven’t been on social media.. I just didn’t reply..
And I got LinkedIn updated with my previous senior title and the latest “Regional Manager” title since Mar 2020, how should I update it? I was thinking of deleting my LinkedIn but I feel bad. Shall I update it to say Mar-June 2020 regional manager and the senior title to July 2020 that I left.. I just worry how my connections will think etc
Also worries that if I find a new job in HK and they ask me what the reason to leave was and if my HR will say due to depression - I hope not??
Also worries when I move back to HK, I’ll update my WhatsApp to a HK number and the app will notify all people my new number and scared that people will ask why did I leave UK etc

I have been struggling everyday 😭

Did someone have a similar experience and how did you overcome it?

Thanks"
1434,"My DLA has now been stopped,the accessor gave me zero points for everything.My accessor told a load of lies,she also fabricated stuff.Now i am forced to write an appeal letter.They didn't take one blind bit of notice to my doctors letter,they shouldn't be able to get away with it.Dirty,underhanded,rotten liers,i want to punnish them."
1435,"There isn't a sub-forum specific to sleep (pity). For a long time sleep problems tended to be seen as symptoms of depression, though in more recent times, a few researchers have questioned whether it could be the other way round, and that sleep problems are the cause of depression. Of course the terrible fact is that what causes what is all still pretty much of a guessing game at the present time, and the medics are no better at treating sleep problems than depression.

One of the very few things that seems to help me get to sleep some of the time is playing a recordings of Ocean Waves. There are lots of such recordings available, some of which are much better than others. Ones with yelling sea birds and not good nor are ones which includes sounds of  ""trickling water"".

Anyone know of any good ones? I'd love to go down to St Ives with recorder and record the beaches there!"
1436,"I’ve had depression for years - since I was a teen so over 25yrs now. I have good and bad periods but these last few years it just seems to have been more low than good. 
I’m feeling mire &more like I just don’t want to be here anymore. I won’t do anything because of my children, but it doesn’t stop me feeling this way. I feel like a failure as a mum, my eldest daughter hates me and constantly points out the fact that I can’t hold a good relationship,I wS married to the kids dad but he was abusive, I eventually left him after 16yrs, i then had a relationship that was even worse - he was a narcissist and completely broke me down. I got out of that after a couple of years with help from professionals. 
Im left with ptsd on top of everything else, but had edmr which helped a bit. 
im on the max dose of antidepressants which I guess help a bit, but the feelings of not wanting to be here anymore are getting more often. 
I spoke to a nurse at the docs who told me to refer myself for counselling (which I haven’t done yet because of the virus). 
Ive got 3 other kids at home (eldest has her own place). 2 of them have additional needs and it’s hard doing it all on my own. I can’t work due to the needs of one of mine, so we don’t have much money which means I’m always having to say no to things. When I do manage to put some aside for us to go and do anything -my older boy never wants to come. He doesn’t come out of his room and spend anytime with me at all. Yet their dad comes to take them out and he’s up, ready & happy to go. 
I know it’s my own fault - I shouldn’t have stAyed in those relationships for as long as I did, and because of the ptsd I moved us all to another county as I couldn’t cope living where I was anymore - something the kids weren’t keen to do. 
I just wish I could be a better mum and change everything for us, I wanted to have good relationships with my kids but it feels like I’ve failed them that much that they don’t want to be around me anymore.Part of me wants to just disappear next time they’re out with their dad, then he can have them and maybe they’ll be happier"
1437,First I am so angry now I cannot stop crying.Why am I like this?I dont like it one single bit.I keep telling the doctor the meds he gives me are not working.I am on trilpetol they didnt work in the past and they are not working now.I cant stop peeing.I cant get my left leg to stop being so swollen and my doctor is useless all doctors are I dont trust them as far as u can throw them.I could die soon because I have heart desease would anyone care?I dont know.I cant get anyone around here to help me I told the guy who is suppose to pick up the boxes outside that i needed them to be taken away >I am so sick of his nasty attitude he doesnt want to do a damn thing.If he doesnt want to do his job then he should quit.I am sorry but sometimes I wonder why was I even born?What is the point of living if u r going to suffer all the time?Sometimes I feel like nobody cares or understands. I know I know I hit my hit my head a few times.All I want is to be normal .
1438,"Hi, so I'm new to this site. I don't really know where to put this thread so I just put it in the Depression category. I'm 20, I left school nearly 4 years ago and I've had quite a few jobs since then. I believe it was 2016 that I went to the doctors and was told I had ""Low Mood/Depression and Anxiety"". I started seeing a therapist about 4 or 5 months ago just to try and talk about stuff, and learn about what to do better to handle it. After a few sessions I brought up the possibility of having PTSD, having had some very traumatic experiences during my childhood. After a few sessions of me talking about what had happened and what I'm experiencing she had agreed that it is likely that what I'm experiencing is PTSD and had to talk to somebody at her organisation to basically check it and talk about the possibility of that. Now that we're about 3 or 4 months past that it and it seems clear that I do in fact suffer from pretty severe depression and anxiety and some sort of PTSD.

So what has this got to do with not being able to hold a job?

In 2015 I got an apprenticeship, I was 17 and it was brilliant, I finally had a job. It wasn't what I really wanted to do but it was brilliant money and I got to learn about retail and warehouse work. It didn't last long. Just under 2 months in and I had already broken down, and whilst I was at work. My manager wanted to talk to me but I refused and I just didn't want to be on Earth anymore. I had no idea what had gone so wrong but something had and very quickly.

So I left and took a pretty long break, I was unemployed and doing nothing at all for about 6 to 7 months.

September came round and I decided to try a college course in woodworking, I'm a pretty hands on person, always told that I'm good with my hands so I decided to give it a go. To no surprise that didn't last long either.

However I had just started a part time job in a small food shop near where I lived and it was pretty good, I worked there with somebody I already knew and made some new friends. Life was just alright, I had no real future prospects there but it was alright whilst it lasted. A few months in and my manager starts to really slack on the job, and so does another colleague who was a close friend to him. Work starts getting stressful for everybody so I start looking for a new job, but this time I'm going to try and look for something I want to do. I applied to a very prestigious heavy engineering firm, I had done engineering in school and I thought it was pretty good. I waited a few months with no answers whatsoever. One day I got a phone call and I was through to the next stage, then the next one and then the next one. Out of just over 300 people I and about 12 others got an apprenticeship there. It was incredibly sought after and I was incredibly fortunate to have got a job there.

Life, at this point, couldn't be any better. But something starts to go wrong. I noticed after a few months that my mental health is severely deteriorating. I don't want to go to college for my training, I don't want to go to work, I don't even want to leave my house or to speak to people. I am drained, and I would say the worst I have ever been. After 5 months of that apprenticeship I left, fearing for my mental health and how low I had stooped. I had tried to line up a different college course but I wasn't accepted.

So I locked myself in my room for about 8 months, rarely seeing the light of day.

At this point I decided to get up and do something (yes, finally) so I started looking for jobs and after many attempts and applications I got nothing back at all. So I did what most people suggested I should do, go to the jobcentre. So I did. I was there for about a month or two and I got an opportunity to do 4 weeks of work experience for a very prestigious high street store and a chance for a job afterwards. So I did it and actually enjoyed those 4 weeks, I made some new friends (though I didn't talk at first and was called ""Quiet Boy"") and I ended up getting a job there afterwards, the pay was very good, especially for my age and everything (again) looked good. And again my mental health started to deteriorate and I left in just under 3 months but I had another job lined up at a pub very close to where I live.

Now I'm about 4 or 5 months in and again my mental health has just plummeted throughout those months. I'm currently studying at college as well but I always seem to get a few months in and I just crumble. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I don't know if I'm doing what I want to do, I don't even know what I want to do anymore.

Idk why I'm really writing this, but has anyone else has these sort of experiences? Have you got past all of this?
Thank you for your time."
1439,"Well I have been a depressive for 12 years now and decided to do some thing for myself, now I get out of bed at a reasonable time, 9/10 o/clock have a cup of tea and a fag then breakfast usually cereal, I don't shower every day, then I go for a walk , weather permiting, if its peeing down with rain I go on  u tube mainly looking for comedies, it makes a difference at least it clears my head for an hour or two."
1440,"When I started having suicidal thoughts, at one point i started writing about them, in a way, trying to copy what my mind was saying so that I could analize them later.. I stop doing that, but I'm not sure why.. I don't remember if it wasn't helping or what happened. I have been having pretty bad days and I thought of writing, but is it a good idea?

1441,"Has anyone been diagnosed with atypical depression? or do all doctors just lump depression into one criteria.
I've never understood my depression, If I have something good happening then I can be happy for a while but as soon as the event is over then I can't  look back and think that it was a happy event, but it's ok at the time.
I sleep longer than I should and doctors have always wondered if I have chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia because I ache all over. 

Rejection sensitivity  is what I find the hardest to deal with, I feel that people want me when I'm doing something for them but when they don't need me any more then I'm discarded, I don't just feel it, it does happen, it's been the story of my life. It's no excuse for people treating me this way but it may be the reason why I find it so hard to deal with.

I was brought up by a covert narcissistic mother, none of my family have anything to do with me because she had managed over the years to convince everyone that I am the problem.
I was googling different types of depression and realized how I fitted into this diagnosis and for me it would be good to finally understand why I feel the way I do and to maybe receive the right help and medication to help me.

Im 59, when I was 18 they put me on marplan a MIOA drug, it was the only medication that helped me, for a few years, reading about atypical depression, it seems to be the first choice for this type of depression but doctors are reluctant to prescribe them now.
It would be really good If anybody else has been officially diagnosed with atypical depression and if any ssri medication has helped them.
What I want from getting an official diagnosis is to be able to not blame myself anymore for all my relationships with friends and family breaking down.."

1445,"Hi,

I’ve spent 3 years trying to help my girlfriend with crippling depression. 

Counseling, Meds, drugs. You name it.

NOTHING WORKS!

Every day she really really wants to die. I mean really wants to. I talk her down on a daily basis at this point. She hates herself. She says she’s hideous. A burden. A waste of money and space.
However, she’s the most beautiful human being I’ve ever met. 
She has a dark pit of depression inside her brain that rules it.

meds only“put a swimming pool cover over the depression “ but itisn’t gone. It isjust capped off so she can function normally on the surface but she still feels like dying continuously inside. Even on meds.

Mushrooms didn’t help. A laundry list of meds from the psychiatrist didn’t help. Counseling didn’t help.
She was abused mentally and physically as a child and took it all in and believes it.
Ive convinced her to stay around to at least try the mushrooms, which didn’t do anything because we can’t seem to get good ones.  Next up would be electroshock therapy which she wants to try. 
She wants to erase her memories and feelings somehow.
Weed helps her but only for a couple hours then wears off.

I can’t figure out what to do!

Can someone please help me??"

I've always dream't of moving to the isle of wight. I've holidayed there many time and I always feel so much more relaxed over there. I know a holiday is different to living somewhere and I'm worried that I wont feel happy when I get there and my problems will follow me.

1454,"Sometimes, in a case of myself, all the time, you feel terrible tired of dealing with your thoughts plus the life challenges, family trouble and economic problems that, you need to speak with someone, and when you do they blame you, they say it's cause you don't do enough or that you are feeling depressive because you don't ask for help. 
So...
Isn't talking to a friend asking for help, support from them? 
What else more can I do, if to solve my economic I work my ass off, I for my family trouble I do more to change whatever this time they didn't like how I did and for my mental issues I get up every day to figth instead of stay at bed and let things get worse."
1455,"Hello everyone
I’m really looking for some advice and I apologise in advance for the long post.

My ex boyfriend has a history of depression but refuses to seek medical help. About 7 weeks ago things at work got stressful and he  went into a downward spiral towards depression. I could see it slowly coming on day by day. Before that he had 5 months of happiness, the longest I’ve ever known.

His behaviour over the past 6 weeks has at times been vile towards me. He seemed constantly angry at me and would be hot and cold, one day he loved me and the next he would ignore me for days and said he didn’t want to get back together.

I’ve also caught him lying over really stupid things, is this a symptom of depression or is he just being shady with me.  He also claims to not remember things that have happened.

I am starting to wonder whether he is really playing me or whether his erratic behaviour is a symptom of his depression. I’ve tried to support him but his behaviour has made me quite ill now too.

I stopped talking to him last weekend and last week was the nicest he has been. He’s back to saying he wants me but he never seems to be able to commit or to spend time with me (he comes to my house in the evening but never stays etc)

I guess I am trying to ask is this the depression or is he just playing me? I’m so hurt and confused but I don’t want to abandon him."
1456,"Hello everyone!

I sure hope this is the right board for this post.
Yesterday was my birthday. The happiness of the people around me put my indifference regarding my life into perspective. I now consciously realise that I don't care what happens to me.

I've been wanting to die ever since I can remember. And this is no exaggeration; I specifically remember having had these thoughts as early as my days in kindergarten, and thinking, that, once I'm tall enough to reach the knife rack, I'll just do it. Evidently I still was innocent enough at that age to be unaware of how much gut this takes. I always could look at the trees in the park, at my wardrobe or at some books and all I feel is a romanticised longing for death, like you might long for a vacation in Paris. As I grew up in an abusive household I just learned to live with, accept, and a few years ago, embrace these wishes, which lead to two suicide attempts, of which I haven't told anyone to this day.

There was no planning involved. I distinctly remember the first attempt; watching TV one night and thinking ""Fuck it"", in the same way I think ""Fuck it"" when I don't want to cook and order a pizza instead. When I realised I had failed I got up and went back to watching TV.

I enjoy no activities. I don't enjoy being around people, I'd much rather be alone, and, there's nothing I want out of life; there's nothing for me to realistically work towards. I've tried therapy with two different psychologists. I quit both therapies after some months, realising, that they weren't doing me any good.

In the recent months I've been laying around all day, waiting to die, or for some change to magically take place, whichever happened first. I've degraded to being afraid to leave the house.
I'm too apathetic to care about the state I'm in to do much to change it as well. Sometimes, and it's been like that for a while, I can't move my body. I care so little about what happens to me, or what I do, that it physically paralyses me. When I'm walking and this feeling erupts, I feel too weak to stand and just let myself drop to the ground. For reasons I've explained, I don't even mind thay. Things like these are among the only aspects of my life that still make me laugh, which is why I sometimes see my condition as the most entertaining part of my life.

What do I do at this point? Has anyone reading this experienced something similar?
Thanks!"
1457,"I have my mother, who after a stroke she now have cognitive issues. Memory issues, etc. But she have anger issues, she yells at the TV, she gets angry at everyone, including myself, sometimes I dont know if call her to check how she is doing, she hangs the phone on me multiple times, I feel that so disgusting, I try to do what I can to she be ok, and sometimes she just treats me like trash, other times she is ok, but if she asks me a favor, and i cant do it, then she think can treat me like a dog. 

Anyway, today I went to visit her, and we been pretty good, until some subject appeared on TV, a woman talking about medicinal cannabis, which is still a taboo subject where Im from, Argentina, and my sister is a bit of a ""hippie"", and they always fight about ""natural medicine"" vs ""scientific medicine"". And my mother started to yell at the tv, the woman was talking about how cannabis oil have helped her daugther, and just pissed me off so much my mother saying ""that woman just want to appear on tv !! she dont know nothing about laws"", and the poor woman just trying to do something, its so upsteing to listen. She, my mother, likes to talk like she is super smart at laws, which yea, she knows somet stuff, but sometimes she is wrong and cant see when she is wrong. 

And the weather here is so freaking hot its almost impossible to breath."
1458,Just got my medicine fixed quit drinking alcohol 3 days ago. The medicine is working but the alcohol cravings are making me want to jump out of my skin I think it’s worse to be an alcoholic when you’re bipolar do you agree?
1459,"I'm 34 and I have had very low iron levels for a long time. In March this year my doctor inserted an Implanon (I think they call it Nexplanon in some countries) implant in my arm as the hormones in it would stop me having heavy periods and that would help my iron levels. It worked for those problems and my iron levels upped...

HOWEVER about a month after I got the implant I started to feel more anxious and depressed than normal.

I have a bit of a history with anxiety and depression but they weren't too bad. In the past I'd have a big cry about once a month.

But it got to the point over the last six weeks where I have been crying almost daily, very unmotivated and in a huge pit of depression.  I think it might be the hormones from the implant so I had it removed 5 days ago. Waiting to see if I improve.

Has anyone had a mental health experience with birth control methods or know someone who has?  I feel so lost :hidesbehindsofa:"
1460,"Hi.  I am a father with 3 children.  I am a 42 years old.   My kids are pretty young, ages 3, 10 and 14.   Their mother and I got separated then divorced 9 years ago, because she demanded to.  I never wanted to really get a divorce.  I was not as happy because I felt an incredible amount of pressure to stay in school and go to colleges and universities from my parents but I could barely understand what any of the teachers all those years were saying, because I thought all the kids were looking at all the subtle details of what was wrong with my face.  Every second and minute onto hours were agonizing starting in high school.  The first day of high school felt like it went on for days, every minute horrible.  I told myself the next day it would be okay and I'd do my best...   I tried, was a repeat of the horrible feeling of the first day and continued like that every day for the entire first year of high school, onto the second and third year, besides art, cafeteria, walking around the halls I felt okay and here and there some other classes when I understood what the teacher was talking about were okay.  Anyway, my parents were really controlling, but I didn't know it at the time, took me 20 years to figure that out, like they wanted me to keep going to all this school as their way they said they may keep paying for me, but I had to live at a poverty level, not that bad, you know, typical student I guess,  And it all felt pretty bad.  Actually most of high school was bad unless after school I was getting drunk or high on weed which got rid of all of my inhibitions and I was really popular outside of my class, I mean the kids in the grades younger than me thought I was cool and I hung out with them, but most of the kids in my graduating class looked down on me and gave me the silent treatment and it felt awful.  Anyway, I didn't know any better, because I guess I was a simple man already as odd as that sounds being an Italian, haha, but I did not get how to concentrate in class and was getting hairier like a big man but very young I mean when I was like 18.  Anyway, it made me worry about my appearance.  But I kept sitting in those classrooms where I felt awful day after bad feeling day for most of it...   anyway, all my friends turned their back on me and I felt really bad looking at one of the Universities I attended age 18 and 19 because I got a hernia and had hairy arms and tried to grow my hair long like Jim Morrison, but it was really dark and wavy and had braces and zits and could barely hobble around campus the whole semester and pretty much felt like a freak compared to the other kids.  This guy from high school saw me and I waved and said “Hi,” and he said ""What happened to you?"" and he walked away from me fast.  Anyway, I cut my hair short then a girl actually noticed me and was nice and I looked attractive out of nowhere, just needed a short haircut, I guess from pressure from my dad to be like him because he was in the military and like it was a family thing for the men to have short hair. Okay, so my friends turned my back on me in my home town, was living at my parent’s’ house and in dorms to go to school nearby, and they stopped talking to me and made fun of my for my appearance and pushed me out of their group, the skateboarders, and one of them got in really good shape and invited pros to his house to skate his ramp when they came into our small town for a demo, and they all were jerks.  I kept studying and studying like a hermit with no social life and made almost all As…


  Anyway, I decided when I got my braces taken off to leave town and go to Los Angeles for a summer of art program to try video production and art as a career.  I love L.A.!  I waxed off my arm hair and had no arm hair, really good looking teeth and I got in shape and skateboarded to class every day and the prettiest girl at the summer program liked me.  So I decided to move to L.A. after I got home to Virginia.  When I moved there it was alright but not like the summer program, had no social life much at all and it took me 2 years to meet my first real girlfriend who I got to have sex with all the way.  She was a young actress who went out there from Texas and was trying to be a famous actress and filmmaker, and we met in the editing room at a film school I got into rom making good grades.  Anyway, I kept going to all this school the whole time I was in L.A., from ages 19 to 27, and I never once smoked marijuana nor did I drink alcohol more than maybe a few times right near the end in the holiday Christmas mode missing home, just wasn’t ever my thing besides in high school used it to socialize better.  So the whole time in Los Angeles from ages 19 to 27, literally the same age that Jim Morrison moved out there until he had gotten famous and died at 27….  Except instead of being a famous rockstar like I really wanted to, I made all the films instead and went to school like my parents wanted me to for them to help me pay my bills by having to go to school like they said, which was okay, I guess, but not what I planned on.  The whole time in California was sober and went to school and worked on movies.  It was okay, but you know the school was difficult, but I finally felt okay about my appearance with my girlfriend who for once gave me confidence in my looks, so I felt happy for once in my life in social situations and was confident.  But she wanted to settle down, get married and have kids…. However, I had something to prove still from all those people looking down on me in high school like all those years of that, so I wanted to prove I was famous.  That whole time in L.A. I had worked as hard as I could imagine at my films like way harder than anyone I had met to make sure my films were good enough to get recognition, and I built a pretty good resume and got famous people in my movies and stuff, learned how to do pretty much all movie jobs myself and made real movies.  But I never got to make a living at it and never got to really be famous.  I mean, I had to push and push and make it whatever it was from my tremendous effort and I was expecting to be a big A-list actor and director and Jim Morrison type in return, but it never happened, and her biological clock was ticking and she wanted to settle down and have kids, but I wasn’t ready.  So I didn’t understand why, but we broke up.  She moved a little further away in L.A. and I was finishing grad school around there.  It felt AWUL away from her, like powerless, like awful and really bad feeling and missed her a lot and loved her a lot and really wanted to be together with her again.   So I moved to an apartment on her same street and tried to hang out with her again.  She was not interested I found out unless I wanted to get married and have kids.   So finally I proposed to her and we got married….  We settled back in my home town when I was just 27 and she was about my same age.  And we had two children but it was like awful feeling having to live in a small town and work a regular job as unbelievably hard as I had worked at my movie career and all that suffering I went through in high school, literally got to the point of looking like a freak, and I was not ready to let that go, wanted to really make a living at it at least, but instead I had to wear some suit and be like some failure back in my small town it almost felt like.  So I became depressed.   It would not go away, until I cried and cried in front of a mirror and asked God to please make the depression go away.  And it went away!  It took a few days for me to get happy again, was still worried, but the depression never came back or years…. and in those few days I quit my job and with the money I had saved decided to make a movie.  So it was a lot of fun and I worked hard doing my best work and made a good movie, but after that I had to get back to work again, and it made me sad and not like it…. And something had to give, and we started arguing.  And she had issues too from high school and it caused problems.  And she took the kids away to Texas.  And she made it hard for me to see them, like her Dad always kind of acted better than me and had tons of money.  I was not as comfortable around him.  He’s okay, I love him, but like he is only into himself and his immediate family sometimes, kind of can be a jerk, but that could change. So it was really really hard for me with anxiety I used to get to trade and see them and being around her rich father (by some miracle my anxiety went away in my early 40s now!  It was a miracle, so I suggest hanging in there and the anxiety will go away.  You will figure out where it is coming from, usually parents….   Not always, anyway, getting to my parents, hopefully I will be kind about that. Anxiety can be from too much caffeine or real influencing factors in life like home, work or school being stressful, relationships, not just a chemical imbalance causing anxiety that people often get misdiagnosed as, but I am not a doctor).


    Anyway, she took away the kids to Texas and would kind of hold them hostage when she was angry at how I had acted and team up with her parents.  Then she’d get in argument with her parents and team up with me and bring them back to Virginia or like still get along with them hopefully and bring them to Virginia.  Anyway. This time around she has had the kids there 3 years!   It has been awful!   I mean, been through a lot of suffering without them, no social life, trying to be celibate and do what I can to make her happy when she does not respond as much to my messages and make it a little more difficult to see my kids but I can still see them around her dad usually, but maybe it will be okay.  I guess it is okay, just really difficult to be there for the kids every day or at least every weekend.   And that is the problem that has caused me depression.  I am afraid to work at the famous acting or filmmaking, the actual work I do in oil,, like, even though it is my gift on earth and I am really good at filmmaking, it feels wrong with how much I prioritized it when we were married almost to an obsessive level placing that as more important than other things.  And it was wrong.  I did not get that far with the stuff, but some people I think were afraid of me how big I acted and like some big Arnold Schwarzenegger flying in my helicopter or something, haha….  Really, I mean, I had it all wrong, like, embraced the wrong things to get bigger with my art and film and music.  It was like you had to sin to get really big with it in some ways, and it was wrong, but I think looking back all of my films were good, it was the other things that I was angry and acted big and angry about like having to work a regular job or money making job to support my films, and I felt like the devil brainwashed me at one time or tricked me like the devil tricks people into a life of more sin, tried to get me to give in to temptation, but sometimes fooled me with fear to be this horrible person I never would have thought I would become like a Republican homophobe or something, and I finally, thanks to God, got back to my regular kind, good humble, meek self again, my actual soul really, who is kind to people regardless of race, regardless of whether or not they are gay, etc., and by reaching out to those people I was afraid of in love and kindness with all I had, I actually went across country trying to be as kind as I could to them, then I think God granted me to be released of those fears, and I was okay again and back to my regular self, my real soul how it was all along.   Anyway, I can see how some people say selling one’s soul to get famous or rich is possible for some, but please just know its all wrong, and not worth it to literally be taken inside the earth into a very real place of illuminati-like genetic manipulation, I mean that’s how they keep them alive so long, mix them with animals and unbelievable, relentless torment down in hell, the only real prison to be afraid of on earth, but I mean ALWYAS follow the law, but a real jail or prison is nothing compared to the unimaginable suffering of hell inside the earth.   But Heaven is a much more beautiful place times almost an unlimited amount, an unconditional acceptance and love feeling that goes beyond our mere 5 senses and is I think a real place that we go after death.  Life is all about being kind to others.  We can act like they already are in Heaven here on earth, but we will probably mess up and sin here and there, because we are human beings.  Other people may get us to sin.


      Well, here is the advice I was looking for… and still am or will be in the future, so please offer me some advice…. Its really hard without a woman to come home to and hug and love to be in love with, to go to for everything, all my secrets to her, all the truth, that we shared with one another and trusted one another, until something bad happened, like we started being interested in other people and it made it awful, I mean really bad.  And I have had to suffer most of the past 10 years, 10 years, think about that, without her, without anyone to hold like I held her and trusted her with everything, when everything was okay and we had one another.  Like, what do I do now?  I do not like living alone.   I like having someone to live with but someone really, really special and I can’t get past her right now, but maybe I have to to move on and feel healthy.  It caused me worse depression than imaginable that lasted for years without her and the kids.   I don’t like Texas much at all to live in….  To visit its okay.   I think I can’t live there.   I just like the idea of living out in the woods or in Los Angeles, or I don’t know….  I never even get excited about being with a woman anymore, like it feels wrong with the kids so far away.  But I am comfortable out here.  I live out in the woods, and I moved here a few years ago, and all my anxiety went away out here.  I love the woods away from people, and its a special house for me.  But I may have been here too long.  I don’t know.  Maybe I have to get out there in the world.  I feel not motivated at all anymore.  I am not that happy sometimes.  Its okay here and there, but not like it was when we were married.  I mean, I don’t get excited about the stuff that used to make me happy anymore.  Before everything was me, her, the kids and getting as but as I could, lol, and trying to be famous for my films and my actual work at my films, creating all the music, the screenwriting, I mean the real work to make a film good….  And when I got into acting later, also making my image a priority.  But I get the sense like its wrong now and maybe I pushed it too much?  But I know I am supposed to keep looking good but not like a number one priority that’s for sure, like I used to push my appearance, that’s wrong.  I mean, I have a Youtube channel and its not as big as I would have liked, had it for 14 years and some people think its big, but its not making enough money right now.  And I feel like at my age, 42, maybe I have to get in really good shape way better than everyone or something to look really good so they will subscribe more.  My face looks pretty good though, did not drink or party all these years, work out, eat way healthy, do not smoke.  I know not many people admit that looks are important.  But I think they are noticed a lot and give an appearance of good health and less problems and that’s why actors and Youtube people are usually more likable when they have that happy go lucky personality, and I try to do that and pull it off sometimes, but then like here and there my life feels awful.  But I know its not important at all to Jesus and God really, maybe a small amount to us on earth that it makes us feel happy, but really I don’t know, maybe I will grow old and be like one of those big body like 92 year olds, you know, not in the best shape but they are likable and happy, like this old woman who build my house with her husband, lived here until she was 103 and she was so cool and likable and used to garden naked in the hot sun, hahahaha….   I mean really though when she was like in her 60s I think she gardened naked, but no one cared, and it wasn’t gross.  And I am okay with growing older.  But I have to pay my bills, and I don’t know that I want to like work at hard work stuff anymore like work with my hands at stuff I never, ever in my life enjoyed, which is one of the only things I know how to do to make a living.   And I can’t sell my house because it is way special, like in my family sort of, but I own it myself.  And my parents, like they can be controlling of others, and they have TONS of money, and its hard to compare myself to them ,because they did really big things, and regardless of how big my resume looks, I don’t have their type of money and I don’t need it, but I’d like to retire or not have to work anymore after working the equivalent of 43 years of my life full time, and I am only 42 years old, that’s 30 years at the filmmaking and 13 years at home renovation and home repair.  And I don’t like the home renovations and repair that much.  I mean its okay here and there, but not at the rate I’ve had to do it, like 18 hours a day.


   Anyway, how do I get my kids back?   Do you think my wife will ever want to be with me again?  She said she lost interest 10 years ago but I kept holding out for her and only messed up a few times here and there every few years would be with someone or have short few months of partying I did twice that lasted like 4 months in 2011 and again in 2015 that she really didn’t like.  She found this other boyfriend and conceived or third child with him, but he is a dead beat dad.  I am willing to be there for them every day of my life, but she makes it difficult to be there for them.  And she may never forgive me for the partying, and she has my kids hostage for 3 years now.  It caused me to be dangerously depressed for 2 years until I got past my porn addiction or the wrong things that used to give me temporary happiness, was really hard to retrain myself to try to feel okay and I fixed up my house relentlessly for years to get it ready for them, until I had to go to a doctor for my health working so hard.  Anyway, it makes me really nervous the idea of living in Texas.  I think I’d have to live like away from people there, and it would suck not having anyone.  I just can’t live there.  I am pretty sure I can’t live there, have to keep living in Virginia.  But I had to travel there 7 times already in 3 years, then the past year couldn’t keep going anymore, was too hard staying in shoddy hotels or too expensive hotels all by myself and it put me under a lot of pressure.  It took a lot of money, but that was nothing compared to the emotional trauma it caused me, like really really bad depression for more than 2 years until I finally got passed it (it all goes away if you wait it out long enough and keep being your regular good intended self).  So tell me about your situations.  What all have you been through with depression.  They say divorce is really bad for men, not that bad for women compared to how bad it is for men.    I am like afraid to actually try to get happy and find someone again after all these years, been alone for the past 5 years mostly, but messed up a couple years ago.  Should I try to move to Texas?  It does not feel like home there.  But I miss my kids a lot.  I can keep visiting, but its not that great.   I can try to sue her and get her back to Virginia.   That could actually work.  Because she is going against the divorce decree.  I hate to argue with her though.  In the past it would get okay again and she moved back to Virginia the other two times she did this, but it only took a year, both times unbearably awful feeling, really bad.  This time was the worst, 3 years without my kids.   I did my best parenting from here like on video chat.   Okay, what to do?"
1461,"shifts at my job are from the morning to around 4, so i have a lot of the day left when i get home. ive been feeling really useless lately when i get home because im not using the rest of the hours of the day productively. i want to sit down and watch tv or read and i feel so guilty about not doing anything useful with all those hours that im home."

1463,"When I was around 9/10 years old my Dad left my mother for another woman this has messed me up for the rest of my life I believe. I've basically been full of anger all my life but I tend to blame the one person whos fault it probably wasn't. Around ten years ago someone very close to me accused me of possibly the worst thing anyone could ever accuse a man of. Long story short i was found not guilty within 15 minutes of the jury being sent to decide on their verdict. I have always been open and honest about it with future partners because I wouldn't want them to find out off anyone else other than me but they soon start to use it against me in arguments. Last year i split up with my partner of 8 years which I took reasonably well all things considered. Everything seemed ok she was allowing me to see my 4 year old son who is my absolute everything. I had my suspicions she had left me for another man when 3 weeks after we split my son mentioned another mans name one I couldn't make out and couldnt get an honest answer out of my ex. This got me looking for a new woman when out of the blue a woman added me on Facebook which I will no longer go on. My ex found out but she was told by people to keep my son away from the woman I jad just met. I was not aware of her colourful past ans the only person making noise about her was my ex. My sons mother got social services involved and was willing to say anything about me to ensure my new woman had no involvement in my sons life. This new woman was manipulating me for around 8 months pretending she was trying to get my son back, trying to get me help when really she was putting ammunition in my exs gun to stop me seeing him because she wanted her kids to get all the attention from me. Whilst I was with this woman I was diagnosed with non-rem parasomnia which means I can do things in my sleep and have absolutely no recollection of what happened so I basically wake up exhausted every single day which obviously affects my mood and how I speak to people. I left this woman as I could not take anymore of her behaviour but this only became worse when I left because she is making lies up about me to anyone who will listen, she has stalked my house, my sons house, old friends of mine, her own sister and turned against her own mother because she helped me out with my dog as she threatened to take my 6 month old pup to the kennels. My life now seems to be spiralling out of control. I feel like I am going to blow everything I've worked hard to acheive during my life by doing the things I do to numb the pain because I no longer enjoy anything i'm doing including work.

1464,"So I had sinus surgery three weeks ago (6/1/20), balloon sinuplasty, something I've needed done for about two years. It was an outpatient procedure that took about 3hrs and doctor said it went well. Standard recovery period is 10-14 days. I went to the first post-op three days later (6/4) and the usual visit involves literally vacuuming out the sinus cavity. Literally using a tiny suction device to remove whatever may be in there. The doctor does these low-risk surgeries very often because it's a common problem and almost no one ever has any complications. Over the weekend however m pain level was climbing. Like 7 or 8 out of 10. I was using the sinus rinse and taking the prescribed pain medication and antibiotics and had a humidifier going and slept in a recliner to keep my head elevated. I was doing everything I was told to but didn't feel any better so I called the office that Monday (6/8). They fit me in and he vacuumed out my nose again then said keep up the good work, it's just taking a little longer than usual for you to heal. He wasn't worried. So I did everything I was already doing. I had another post-op appointment scheduled for that Thursday (6/11/20) where he again vacuumed out my nose and told me to keep doing what I was doing. Take some Tylenol is I have any pain. Then when I woke up Saturday (6/13) I felt HORRIBLE. Sorry in advance... I had a low-grade fever and my face hurt and when I blew my nose it was neon green. Red flag. Called the doctor's office on-call service. They phoned in a different antibiotic for me. It was a seven day course which means I was done with it yesterday (6/20) but I still felt terrible.

Then it happened...............

I was laying in bed with severe congestion trying to sleep. I grabbed a tissue to blow my nose and when I did I felt something solid in my left nostril. Not like a glob of snot, nothing the body produces. I had no idea wtf was going on so I literally put my finger up my nose and felt something. Then I pulled it out. It was a tiny little piece of plastic, like a tube, about an inch long. At this point my nose was bleeding so the tiny thing was covered in bloody green snot. To stop the bleeding I grabbed another tissue to shove up there and when I did I felt another solid object. IT WAS ANOTHER PIECE OF PLASTIC. Except this one was half the size with a hook on one end. By now I was panicking. I'm bleeding all over my shirt and sheet and my nose hurts so badly. I didn't know what to do. Eventually I calmed down, cleaned myself and the plastic pieces off and put them in an empty pill bottle. First thing in the morning I called the doctor's office answering service and they told me the only thing to do was call back the next morning and ask to be seen ASAP. If the bleeding doesn't stop (which it did) go to an urgent care. Needless to say I'll be calling them first thing tomorrow morning. 

Now however I keep thinking about this whole thing and it's causing me to have such anxiety and depression. What if there's more pieces in there somewhere? I'm depressed that once I get the bill I'll be spending upwards of $4,000 for this mess! Why did I bother? I feel like the doctor is going to downplay it. Pretty much say, ""oops sorry."" I wish I could have someone go with me but because I'm working all week and no one is allowed to enter the office except me because of COVID I'll probably have a breakdown in the exam room. I've read about instruments being left behind after surgeries and lawsuits and whatever and it makes me so incredibly anxious. 

Has anyone else had something like this happen to them? Probably not but at least typing this out is making me feel a little less anxious."
1465,"Not everyone gets better.
Actually MDD often is worse with age.  That’s my experience after 30 years.  Yes, I’ve been on about every drug and combination.  Therapy, group therapy, consultation and unsuccessful treatment at Mayo Clinic.  Good on ya all those cheerleaders who are better.  I get worse and worse."
1466,"i’m not sure how to explain this. i know i have other mental health problems, major depressive, gad, ocd, trich, and anorexia. but i keep forgetting who i am. i know logically what my name is and how old i am but i don’t know what any of these words mean or what i am. i don’t know where i am. i feel no connection to anything. i remember loving my family but now i can’t feel their love or mine towards them anymore. am i becoming heartless? a robot. i feel empty. i just got a job and everyday i’m putting on a fake face, talking to people like it comes natural to me and then the second i have a moment to think my brain immediately thinks of every horrible thing that hurts me and then i just fall down a deep hole for a couple minutes until i’m blinked back into reality to distract myself with work yet again. i feel miserable. i want to be happy but i can’t even feel anything. i recently went through a bad breakup idk if it’s possible for that to mess with my brain but i feel completely out of it. i can’t do anything and today was my second day and i really really want to quit my job. i just don’t want to do anything i don’t want to try i just want to lay in bed and sink. my ears are in a constant state of ringing. peoples words to me become a murmur i can’t focus on. i feel people’s eyes on me, expectations, i want to do nothing so i can’t disappoint"
1467,"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for many years now, self harm and drug use became second nature to me at one point. I had it under control until December when my grandad died and then I started to spiral, I started to get help through therapy and medication and I felt so much better. However the last week or two I have found myself using cocaine again to try and stop myself self harming. Hoping someone can give me better coping mechanisms?"
1468,"I’ve had depression my entire life and i feel like there is definitely something wrong with me, like maybe a personality disorder. I have a hard time connecting with people. I rarely do. When I do thought I find when someone hurts me, even making me suffer through a minor miscommunication or one bad comment I automatically don’t seem to care for them. I’m not easy to be friends with. People put up with me but I don’t put up with anyone. Even if I know they deserve better I can’t seem to make myself care about maintaining a friendship with them. this makes me wonder if i truly care for people. I don’t know if I truly love anyone because I automatically feel completely disconnected to people when they hurt me."
1469,"For the first time in 12 years I actually feel the world is great, I think my new meds have kicked in and I feel wonderfull."
1470,"i was really depressed before and on my birthday as i'm always is and my mom slept upstairs my brother and his friend slept downstairs and i was still up and i haven't had issues with having someone montioring me taking my medication and i didn't have a reason for living anymore so i took an overdose, i freaked out i woke my brother and he told my mom and they were gonna take me to the hospital but ended up not going until i relaxed that day i thought i was gonna die, i was out of it for the whole day

i need an opinion what type if any damage did i do to myself?"
1471,Do not let ANYONE make you feel guilty for feeling depressed. Those people aren’t worth a millisecond of your time and energy.
1472,just thinking u all going to pub next week?or not depression and all that
1473,What am I supposed to do now? I've completely given up on every aspect of my life it's like getting out of bed every morning is a struggle. I've completely lost the will to live and I just don't even want to try anymore nothing really helps I just want it to be over.
1474,"Woke up at 4am and then couldn’t sleep. Mind was out of control.Got these stupid thoughts that everyone I know is in a better place than me. Even people I haven’t seen for 10 yrs. Then I started to hate myself for thinking this way. Perhaps I’m better of dead. I hate these thoughts, they are taking over my life so much I’m losing my identity. The weather is bad, the lockdown is bad and it’s Monday. I wish I knew what to do."
1475,"give me some tips and also tell me some medication procedure.
thanks"
1476,"TL;DR my mom (59) has been struggling with severe anxiety and insomnia that evolved into psychotic episodes and manic depression that has lasted about 4 months. She’s lost a lot of weight/hair and refuses medication or any medical help. Unsure of what to do or how to help her.

This all started in October of 2018 when my mom (59) lost her father. The two were extremely close and his passing really affected her. But she was able to distract herself with all of the arraignments, fixing up the house to sell, etc. This also created a massive rift between herself and two of her three brothers. They no longer speak and there’s a good chance they will never reconnect. Through all of this she was experiencing anxiety, but was able to combat it with keeping herself busy.

December of 2019: my mom went back and forth on whether or not she should sell the house. Ultimately she realized it was too much work to keep up and when the house sold everything changed. The death of her father finally hit her and the anxiety started to turn into a form of manic depression. At first it manifested in her sleeping patterns. She typically slept around 6 hours a night, but she began only sleeping around 3 hours every night.

In January of 2020: I decided to move out of the house to move in with my girlfriend. This was another massive change for her to swallow as she and I are very close. She suddenly began to obsessively panic trying to figure out what she was going to do with her life. We spoke daily about this crisis and I tried to get her to see a therapist or life coach. She eventually went to our family physician who suggested therapy and prescribed Xanax to take whenever she felt a serious bout of anxiety coming on.

February 2020 - now: over the last few months her state of mind has dissolved. Her insomnia has gotten to the point where she’s only sleeping a couple hours a night. Her focus and ability to follow conversations began to severely decline. She couldn’t watch TV as it frustrated her too much. We took her to the same family physician who prescribed Zoloft. Despite our efforts, she wouldn’t take it. Over the next few weeks she became increasingly paranoid and manic. After a pretty severe meltdown we got her in to see a psychologist who also recommended Zoloft. She still wouldn’t take it.

My dad then took her to another family physician who prescribed Remeron. She agreed to try it as it would also help her sleep, but would only take half of the suggested dosage as she became paranoid of becoming dependent on medication. This paranoia grew to the point where she would stare at the side-effects for hours on end. She only took the half-dosage of Remeron for a couple weeks and then refused to continue.

We returned to the doctor and he prescribed yet another anti-depressant that she refused to take. It became very clear that this approach wasn’t going anywhere. Her mental state continued to decline as well as her physical appearance. She’s typically thin and athletic. She’s lost a lot of weight and all the muscle definition in her arms and legs is completely gone. She’s basically skin and bone despite eating somewhat normally. On top of that almost half of her hair has fallen out.

The physical side of this has compounded a lot of the problems she was already facing. She now stares at herself in the mirror for hours and won’t leave the house. She can’t even get the mail or go sit in the backyard. This makes any doctor’s appointment or potential therapy sessions impossible. Luckily, with the COVID quarantine she’s been able to keep a low profile with her friends and hasn’t been pressured to see anyone outside the house.

My father has been with her 24/7 through all of this and has managed it the best he can. It’s great that she’s not alone, but at times he wonders if he’s enabling her behavior. It’s a daily occurrence where she will just stand and stare at him for long periods of time until he tries to walk away. She’ll grab his arm and try to get him to stay. She’s become increasingly paranoid that he’s going to abandon her.

He’s hit a breaking point twice. Once he asked me to come to the house where we tried to bargain with her to go to the hospital to get help. My mom was a complete manic wreck and I stood in the yard for 10 hours trying to calm her down and get her in the car to no avail. She was a nurse and was convinced that if we take her to the hospital that she’d be put in a straight jacket. I know she knows this isn’t true.

The second time was a couple weeks ago when my dad called the NAMI crisis line. They sent a mental health professional to the house to assess the situation along with two police officers. My dad had no idea about the police showing up and my mom had another meltdown. She became so worried that the neighbors would see all the cop cars at the house and told them to leave. They somehow talked her down and the mental health professional was able to speak with her. Because she’s not a risk to herself or anyone we cannot legally force her to go to the hospital.

Ultimately they suggested a phone-therapy routine that consists of talking to a therapist, a life coach and a sponsor (somebody who has also experienced similar psychotic episodes / manic depression). And now we are caught in a catch-22 where she doesn’t believe the people on the phone will help because they can’t see her physical state and she won’t go see a therapist because she’s self-conscious of her appearance.

Now she’s just stuck. She hasn’t had any meltdowns recently, but she’s still suffering from crippling anxiety, can barely sleep and has behavioral ticks that won’t go away. She’ll stand at the kitchen table for hours at a time, repeat sentences and basic activities (like texting or watching tv) seem insurmountable. I call her about 2-3 times a week and try to keep the conversation small talk (I do all the talking) because if we start talking about her condition we will go around in circles for hours. I try my best not to get frustrated with her but have slipped a few times.

The timing of all this with the quarantine has been a blessing and a curse. It’s given her time and privacy to try and get through this, but it’s also made everything feel more strange for her. Now as things start to re-open I don’t know what to expect.

Thank you for reading. Any help or suggestions would be very much appreciated."
1477,"Hi! I've had this account for a while but I've avoided posting anything cause every time I start typing I feel like its stupid and delete it. But I told myself I would today as I'm in need of some advice and don't really have anyone around me to speak to :) I just don't know what to do anymore. I've grown a hatred towards the people I'm closest to and I have no idea why, I feel drained and empty all the time and I haven't been able to properly cry in a long time. I almost feel emotionless. I try to socialise and see my friends as much as I can as a distraction but it never works and I always end up wanting to be alone - even when I do see my friends I feel like I have to force conversation and fake laughter. I feel like I have no escape. I'm so comfortable being in this state of mind that there's a part of me that doesn't even want to get better and that makes it so much harder for the other part of me to keep fighting. I don't even know what advice Im asking for, I just feel so hopeless and I'm so tired of constantly having to fight the same battle"
1478,"Hi all.

I think I've reached the end of my journey now. Have been crazy depressed for ages now, and nothing has helped. 

I feel like I've nothing left to give. I wish to thank everyone who has reached out and been kind to me on this forum. And wish you all the best.

Take care x"
1479,"Part of me wishes there were some secret to doing things you don’t want to immediately rather than dwelling over them for hours, but as someone who is severely depressed, I dread every single thing and I am simply feeling like I am too tired to do anything.

These days I am lying in bed until the afternoon because I have no energy to get up. It doesn’t help that it takes me several hours to just fall asleep. When I’m really tired throughout the day, how can I still motivate myself to do things which make me uncomfortable? Can I force myself somehow?"
1480,"So! Dunno where everyone is in the world but I'm in central New York and our governor just extended ""NY on pause"" (the closure of non-essential businesses) until May 15. That's another full month. I know this virus is serious and I'm not downplaying it in any way but this is really hurting my soul. On top of that it's still freezing cold and snowing! The weather this time of year is typically crappy but not like this... Sunday it was 60°F, a little breezy and sunny. Today is overcast, the temperature has halved and everything is covered in slush.
Given all that, I've been fighting with myself all day. Ridiculous thoughts. I'm afraid if I don't keep my mind busy it'll wander to deep depths, maybe even suicide. Granted I still live with my parents and that's somewhat of a distraction. I know there are people out there who are worse off than me though; people who actually have the virus or are quarantined with their kids, or people who're still working and being exposed every day. But I can't help feeling depressed and Idk how to help myself. I'm bipolar and was diagnosed years ago so I've been on medications to help with depression and mood swings. But I'm having a really hard time with this isolation even though I know it's for my own good. I need to see my friends, I need the distraction of working but those things are unavailable. Maybe this post is just me rambling on and complaining but even typing this out is helping.
ANYWAY. The point of this whole post was for me to get my troubles out of my head and into forum to see if anyone has any suggestions. Where does everyone live, and how is your local government handling it? More importantly, how are YOU handling it? What is everyone's coping mechanisms, because at this point that's the proper term. That makes it sound like we've been through a war and that's what it feels like sometimes. There's enough for me to do to keep busy yet it's like there's a brick wall standing in my way. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get through this next month? I feel like I'm literally going to go honest-to-God insane.
If you've read all that I really appreciate it. Thanks in advance too for any replies.

I hope everyone is safe and healthy!"
1481,"As a person who suffers from depression I am often sad and do not take part in other pleasurable things that “regular” people do. I don’t go out, party, I have never dated with frequency, I have never married, had kids and I have very few friends. I think through all of this depression had me focused more on the negative and had a hard time seeing normal people activities as pleasurable. Looking back I can see how much I missed out on at least in part due to depression. Does anyone else feel this way?"
1482,"Hi everyone, thank you for taking the time to read this. I’m a 23 year old female. Around late last year I found out that my dad has another family. I’ve known that he has an affair since I was 12 or so but I never expected him to have kids with that woman so it absolutely tore me. The way he told me about it wasn’t helpful either, he just brought the kids to my apartment out of the blue one day. After that I fell into sort of a situational depression - I was sleeping a lot, I didn’t feel like doing anything, was barely eating, skipped classes etc.

That’s around the time my boyfriend came along. We’ve known each other for a long time and never got to see each other much as we both moved away from our hometown for uni. He called me up and asked if I wanted dinner, that was the day after my dad left my place after spending a night there with the kids. He asked if I was okay because I did not seem like my usual self, eventually I told him what happened and he took care of me. Looking back, I honestly don’t know what would’ve happened to me if he wasn’t there with me. 

Things at home are messy now. My mum moved out recently, and I try not to go home if possible. I live with my grandparents and when I went home a few weeks ago my grandmother kept going on and on about how I should help my parents reconcile, and that I should “fix their marriage”. I cried a lot when I went home and had trouble sleeping. Home just isn’t even home anymore. 

My boyfriend has his own apartment but most of the time he stays with me at my place, and everytime when he needs to go back to his place for a few days whether it be for work or because his friends are coming over, I cry. I know he’s only going for a few days, and I know he’s only about 20 minutes away, but I can’t help it and I don’t know why I’m acting this way. I know it’s my problem because he has given me plenty of reassurances, he’s always there when I need someone. I don’t even know why I cry when he needs to go because I was always very independent and really liked living alone. 

I apologize for the long post. Any replies will be very much appreciated, thank you. Take care!"
1483,"My summer holiday has started two days ago and it seems to have really bad effect on me. During the school time, I have lot of things to concentrate on so I thought the depression was gone (and I think my other MH issues are enough).. even during the coronavirus season when I actually didn't go to school or work and was only at home, I was ok depressionwise, because I got up and did a lot of work for school and then had time to relax, so everything was more or less good.. 
In June I was back to work because they were able to reopen. Wednesday was my last work day and at the beginning of the week I already had all my grades at the university. I was looking forward to the holiday. I thought I'll just do all the relax things I did during the pandemics, and those I wrote down during the school time when I thought I wanted to do something and didn't have enough time. On Wednesday evening when I came from work it was okay, I read a book, practice musical instruments, played a game with my family... But the next day it didn't feel ok anymore. 
I just feel like I'm wasting time. Plus this is my last holiday as I have only one year left at the university. So I should enjoy it and I feel guilty when I feel like nothing makes sense and I don't want to do anything. Also I must start working on my final thesis and I'm scared I won't be able to do it well, right now I feel unable to begin at all. And when I realise it's my last year of university, I start stressing because that means I'll have to give up my part time job which I love and I will have to find a real job which is unlikely... My sister finishes university this year in the same field and there are job offers but everyone wants someone with experience, so it's likely that by this time next year it will be the end of everything... I will be condemned by society and my own family if I don't find a job and I will lose my beloved part time job for nothing. I know it's far from now and it might not end like that but the thoughts just keep coming... So it makes me feel like the whole university studying is futile and my part time job is futile, and I just can't relax at all. 
My best friend who is like a sister to me and if she didn't take care of me I don't know where I'd be, or if I still would have been alive, she's gone to her cousin's wedding  so I'm going to be lonely for 3 days so it's making it only worse. And my mom suggested that perhaps she'll meet someone interesting and fall in love and start a family and then no one will help me survive... So that freaks me as well.. I know it's unlikely, but as my mom said it I started to realise also that this will come to an end one day as well and I will have to learn to live all alone and I don't think I will be able to. But I don't think there's much perspective for me to ever get married, because who would want an insane freak like me... I said to myself few years ago that I might try some dating website when I get my MH issues under control but as it hasn't happened since then, I don't think it ever will.. and anyway I'm unattractive so even if I wasn't difficult to live with due to my MH problems, why would anyone want to be with someone as ugly as me... Just unlikely.
I know I should think about all these things because none of them are happening now, but I just can't stop... And it makes me feel depressed again and I don't have enough motivation to do anything I planned for holiday and if I just stay in bed and play with my phone, I hate myself afterwards... 
Sorry if it doesn't make any sense, I just really had to tell someone..."
1484,"I think I’m depressed. I’m 36 and don’t take much joy in anything anymore. I care about my wife and her happiness but my own is beyond my grasp. I can’t relate to music or games or reading or any other hobby like I did when I was younger. My career is stagnant. I make enough to get by but I don’t seem to have the motivation to move beyond that anymore. 


And a lot of stuff goes wrong in my life constantly. This objectively terrible year not withstanding, nothing has been going right for me on a personal level either (health wise, work wise, even just succeeding in day to day minutiae without something going wrong) . Most of the time I respond in a very muted way to these issues, something I think my wife appreciates because I seem stoic, but occasionally I will feel absolutely overwhelmed and alone. It really sucks.

Anyway since talking to my wife about this would just make her worry and feel unsafe and insecure I’m venting it on the internet."
1485,"Well I've been having trouble with my neighbors below me which has worsened and they have been doing some work in one of the other flats where an the ex housing officer lives. To cut it a long story short she has told them that I'm mentally ill and made me out to be a crazy person and has said all sorts so now they have got me down as crazy person as well as the neighbor opposite him. Every time I do the washing up or sweep the floor or run a bath he bangs up like I'm just sitting there making noises deliberately to annoy him which I'm not, I'm just going by my every day business and do things quiet. 

That ex housing officer has let out confidential information as well as inaccurate information about me which is discrimination. 

What can I do about this?"

1487,"I didn't know what section this post technically should go under, so I came here to the Depression section.  I don't even know if this should be classified as a rant, a cry for help, or what, but this topic has just been heavy on my mind lately.  No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to shake the fact that I hate most things about myself. 

My self-esteem has always been low, but it wasn't until recently that I realized that I don't even know if I can change that.  I just don't know how to love myself.  I don't like my body, my facial features, or my physicality, as I am an ugly, skinny, and small 21 year old who basically looks like a kid (and is shorter than some). 

I don't like my past and the way I have handled certain situations.  I don't like my mental state, as ever since I graduated high school and turned 18 it has gone severely downhill.  I don't like my social life, as I have not ever had a girlfriend/relationship and currently have no friends at all.  There are definitely more things that I am missing, but I can't think of them at the current moment. 

To top it all off, when I was 17 I found out that I had Asperger's Syndrome, which explained some things but just left me feeling  a whole lot worse about myself as a result.  I have never really liked some of these things my whole life, but I just realized recently that I don't think I will ever like them.  I just don't see a way out of this hole of self-loathing that I am encapsulated in.  And then I wonder why I have no friends, but after thinking about it it seems obvious to me now.

I have a very negative outlook on life, and always portray a negative attitude almost all the time.  I have no clue what to say or how to react to people's emotions, and I come across as rude most of the time (or so I've been told; I don't actually think I do, but since I have Asperger's this discrepancy makes sense).  And on top of all that, how is someone supposed to like me when I don't even love myself?  I just hate myself so much, and wish every day that I was just a different person.  I don't even know if I should ask for help because I feel so hopeless, I think I may be beyond the point of help.  I just don't know anymore.  Thank you for anyone who read this giant ramble, and any response is appreciated."
1488,Does anyone have any positive stories for taking Venlafaxine for treating OCD - what dose age were you on -  how long did it take to work. Only positives please
1489,"This is a long one. TL;DR doesn't do the story justice, so I won't be posting one, I'm sorry.

So, in 2016, I had the worst year of my life. I made some bad decisions that led to me losing some friends, and making more bad decisions - one of which led to a psychotic break. A few days later I had a mental breakdown from the severity of the episode, as it lasted for days. I was lucky not to be diagnosed with psychosis. I recovered mentally from that particular issue, but my depression came back in full swing and hasn't left me alone for more than a month since.

I tried to better myself, and try to make contact with people I've hurt in the past, but always to no avail. There was always one person who I wanted more than anything to be able to see and talk to again. I never told her this but I was in love with her. We had a 'thing' while she was dating someone. I know. Bad. When everything went downhill, she stopped talking to me. Last I had heard from her, she wanted the exact opposite, even if everyone found out about us. She had feelings for me too. I was heartbroken when she stopped talking to me like that, but I forced myself to understand. But I tried to make contact with her since and she never responded. It was like a shot to the heart in 2018, when I ended up at the same party as her by complete accident. We acted civil around each other and I saw she was with someone else. I was happy and sad at the same time. Happy she wasn't with her previous boyfriend, he was awful. And sad that she had found someone else. But again, I forced myself to understand, as I wasn't a part of that equation anymore. I knew I shouldn't have, but i messaged her later asking to reconnect, it had been 2 years and I wanted my friend back, at the VERY least. I told her if she isn't okay with that, I understand and that I won't message her ever again. She never replied.


A week ago, I was at a BLM protest handing out water bottles and granola bars to protestors, when she approached me, wearing a mask so I didn't recognize her. She said she was ready to forgive me. When she said that, her eyes gave her away, but she lowered her mask to confirm my suspicions. She walked away and I lost her to the crowd. It was like a dream come true. I messaged her later saying that was a hell of a stunt she pulled ambushing me like that, but I was glad she could get that off her chest. We agreed to talk again. Over the past week, it has been far more than what I expected. She missed me even more than I missed her, and that is saying something. It's insane. I met her in person just the other day. We sat in my car and talked, caught up, listened to music, confessed how we felt back then, poured our hearts out over the whole situation and explained everything that happened from our POVs. 

Apparently she was abused and manipulated into believing I was this force of evil on her life, and in her vulnerability, she took her negative feelings and shifted them all towards me. And cut me out of her life. Her new boyfriend has since helped to ease her pain and trauma. She's still healing but she came to the realization that I was not what her ex painted me to be. So when by complete coincidence she sees me in public for the second time in four years, she approaches me. It felt like fate.

We've now become even closer than we were before. But just as friends. Which is GREAT. But that's the problem. Even when I'm happy, I'm depressed. Even when I get everything I want, it's not what I want anymore. Like, I want more.


This new person she was dating is now her Fiance. I'm so happy for her. I have met him before and know he is a great guy. But the feelings for her I thought I had gotten over have come rushing back. We both admitted we were in love, but what I didn't tell her is that I still am. What right do I have? To come back into her life and cause trouble like that by telling her? Absolutely not. I will not repeat past mistakes, and I will not ruin this engagement for her. She is happy. I will never compromise that. But it hurts. It hurts like hell because I have had constant depression for over a week now. Thinking about her and how happy I am, yet sad at the same time. I find myself thinking about how maybe they'll break up still and it's sickening to have these invasive thoughts of something so messed up.

I feel so pathetic! Like Bojack Horseman or something. I hate that comparison, but it really is as pathetic as it sounds. I finally got something that I can't describe how badly I've wanted for *years* only to find that I'm still not happy, and that I want more. It's f*****g selfish and I hate it. I hate myself. Why can't I be happy? I want to be a part of her life, but just talking to her hurts. Because I know, no matter what, I can never tell her how I feel. It feels like maybe would be smart to cut her out of my life, but first and foremost, I absolutely do not want to. Second, how would I even go about it? She'd demand a reason. And I can't lie to her. I would never lie to her. I'd end up telling her how I feel and that's the exact thing I would be trying to avoid by cutting ties. Needless to say that doesn't seem like an option to me. So here I am. Best thing to happen to me in my entire life, reconnecting with the most important person of my life, with a bond stronger than ever. And I still can't get enough. I don't know what to do with myself. Out of all of my depressive episodes that I deal with every single month of my life, this one is the worst I've had since my breakdown in 16."
1490,I don’t fall asleep until 5-7 AM. The sun is coming up by the time I’m falling asleep. I’ve been trying to get it back on track for months now. I usually wake up around 11 or noon. I have a therapy session at 7:15 in the AM next week. How I’ll swing that one will be interesting. I did feel a hell of a lot better the earlier I got to bed. I realize why I’m so damn tired all the time but my anxiety is extremely high so I don’t pass out till I’m exhausted even tho I lay in bed 3 hours before falling asleep

1492,"Hi everyone

I hope you are well and safe.

I come from a dysfunctional background. Growing up around abuse. Sexual abuse. Physical abuse and mental abuse. Surrounded by really unhealthy people. Forming and attaching to some one sided relationships. Whether that was with my family members, friends, partners - any form of connection with people has either been one sided or just toxic abusive connections. These type of relationships despite of making it me feel low valued and non loved. Because I grew up around these connections. I usually form these type of relationships when growing up, it's what I've ever known. It's what I feel safe with.

In the process of it, I am a fearful person. I am scared of close connecting with healthy emotionally avaliable people. Makes me feel uncomfortable. I tend to keep away from two sided things. I usually only feel comfortable toxic two sided things. I have been in love with two men who were highly emotionally unavaliable. I became the pursuer even after the relationships hit a brick wall. Where a secure person would walk away from something or someone who wasn't valuing her - I held on. Couldn't let go.

I am quite reserved. Quite closed off. Highly empathetic towards others. I can care for others but I won't allow anyone to get too close to me to care for me. If I feel someone is about to get close, I feel suffocated. I feel scared. I feel unsafe. I don't show vulnerablity.

When I have a bad day, I usually feel low and unworthy. I tend to reach out to toxic people whom makes me feel unworthy and unloved and that familar feeling soothes those same feelings I am already feeling. It's what I call emotionally self harm.

It's a reason why I refuse to enter a relationship with anyone, I don't want anyone to deal with my toxic crap. I'd rather sort myself out and be emotionally avaliable before entering any relationship.

I have been in therapy since September last year to help to address some of these issues. It's taken a long time to start opening up to my therapist. To feel safe. To feel okay about being vulnerable.

My therapist is a wonderful, kind and caring human being who cares greatly about her work and her clients. Since recieving therapy with her, she has taught me to work on my own self worth and self care. Thanks to her and this forum, I have walked away and let go some of the unhealthy people in my life of whom I have held on too for a very long time.

Every week, she says a lot of powerful and encouraging words. Thanks to her, I've managed to start being kinder to myself and to start feeling worthy. I've worked on healthy relationships at work with my colleagues.

I have opened about my abuse.

Our therapy session this week, I felt I had opened up a lot. Still continue to not look after myself in areas. My therapist quite fondly and pointed out, I am a worthy person. I am important. Those were the first words said at the beginning of our session. That encouraged me to open up and share.

She frankly pointed out, that she feels she can connect to me sometimes and other times, I back off and put up a wall. Then she doesn't feel connected. I thanked her for being open to me. This has hit a nerve greatly. Because this is a huge barrier for me which is why I don't form healthy relationships. This is the killer.

I don't know what a healthy relationship is. I don't know what it feels like. I don't feel safe with it. I feel great when I connect with people at first and then the fear steps in, then I back away. My relationship with my therapist is the first one I feel someone is truly listening. Has good intentions. Caring. Wants to help me. When I come away from our sessions, I feel worthy. That's not what I'm used too. Someone is begining to remove the bricks from my wall.

Can anyone advise on what a healthy relationship is? Looks like? How to trust others and let down your wall?

I don't have a clue!"
1493,i have a drink to help my depression but then after feel depressed so i have another drink and it round and round all time
1494,"Hi Everyone
I'm struggling at the moment and I can't sleep, I've had problems sleeping for the last decade, but right now I can't get a wink.

I've had depression for most of my adult life, there are better times and worse times, unfortunately at the moment it is one of the worst times,

I lost my dog two days ago, or rather we had to have him put down, 
He was a german shepherd and he was only 3 years old, 
I Loved him VERY much, and for the most part he was a lovely, cuddly, beautiful doggo.
unfortunately ever since we got him he had an aggression problem, in the first year we had him, we had minor injuries from him when he bit us, 
he was prescribed a medication from the vet and with training (with several professional trainers) he was doing much much better, we thought we'd really made strides with him and he was a joy to have,
3 weeks ago he was sat by the front door during a lightning storm, I went to see what was going on and he lept at me and bit my arm giving me 5 bite injuries on my arm, I had to have a tetanus shot and two lots of antibiotics for a week, 
we put this down to him being scared by the storm and an accident and despite the fear this gave me I really wanted to believe this was a one off incident.
unfortunately it wasn't and earlier this week he attacked my dad completely unprovoked for no reason, who suffered worse injuries than I did a total of 22 bites,
As much as we loved him, we couldn't risk him hurting anyone else, 

We made the logical decision, 

but It breaks my heart.
I miss my Dog, I love my Dog, my dad is also heartbroken, We got the dog around the time my dad Semi-retired and my dad absolutely idolised him, you couldn't say that a dog was more loved than he was.

my Dad also suffers from mental health issues, burned into my brain is this moment just after the attack, we managed to get the dog into a different room sealed off from us, my dad was sat in his desk chair, bleeding EVERYWHERE, we were frantically trying to make sure he was going to be ok and to get him taken to hospital, and my dad WAILED a cry I've never heard before, this wasn't from his physical injuries, though they were bloody and horrific, but he wept as my mum said ""he's got to go"" my dad collapsed into his chair and he said ""WHY WHY did he do this to me, I love him so much, and when he's gone I'll have nothing left!""

my physical injuries have almost all healed, my dad obviously is suffering at the moment with his, but to look at him you can tell the mental anguish is just as bad, and despite his injuries he has sat there today ""I miss my dog!, I miss him so much!"".

It's 1:55 am here and I'm still up writing this because I can't sleep,
I've been struggling with my mental health for years, recently in the past few months especially with lockdown it had gotten much worse, right now, right now I feel completely broken.

And like my dad, I Miss my Dog :("
1495,"Hi,

I'm new here.

I've stumbled upon it because I feel so sad.

I've developed feelings for a friend. It started as a minor crush but has grown and grown over the space of a year. However, they have just started a relationship with someone they're besotted by. I'm literally crushed.

I know the usual, back away, distract yourself, you'll find someone who loves you. That's just not helpful right now as I can't back away for other reasons (work together closely so can't make this awkward). 

I don't want her to not be happy and wouldn't do anything to break her up from this other person. It's just devastating to be seen as just the friend. I can't get passed the pain in my chest."
1496,i was prescribed 25mg of seraquel in addition to the 40mg of celexa i currently take to help with anxiety and depression. but isnt 25mg barley anything when it comes to seraquel?? seems like its an extremly low dose of it and i dont notice any drowsiness at all
1497,"Hi everyone since the year started I hace been feeling down partially due to work and partially due to a bad dating experience (which was not the first time so not really something to affect me much) but since the quarantine started this feeling of emptiness has been slowly appearing. I can hardly find the motivation to do things anymore the only thing that I still have motivation to do is sports. Other than that I can't help but think what is the point of it all, I am feeling like crying all day"
1498,"Hello
Erm, not sure how to start. I'm in the UK. We're still in a state of semi lockdown with covid. I'm starting to get depressed again I think. I've had depression on and off for a long time and also ocd. I've been quite isolated with my mental health in the past. After many years I was just starting to to function a bit better, make friends and had just started volunteering. All of my routines have changed since all of the virus stuff started. Volunteering is indefinitely on hold. I've hardly been out since the beginning - covid has made me very anxious about my ocd getting worse again, so I'm scared of going out and doing anything.  I'm starting to feel really low and isolated again. I'm crying at random times. I'm getting urges to hurt myself, (Am I allowed to put that here? I'm not sure if I need a trigger warning?) but am scared of needing to go to hospital because of covid. Everything feels really pointless and I've been hiding in bed. I was under the cmht but they discharged me at the beginning of lockdown. I've just got in touch with a counsellor on skype, but she doesn't know me and I'm not sure how helpful it could be. But at least it might be someone to talk to.
I'm just feeling pretty low. You know when everything just feels so unimportant and pointless and you keep crying? But then when I do try and pull myself out of the slump I just think of all the awfulness in the world right now and feel awfully anxious on top of everything!"
1499,"I stutter, I'm really fat, I have a severe social anxiety, I have such extreme shame of my stutter, I have ADD, Epilepsy..

It's like no matter if I lose weight and fix my social anxiety, which by the way will be real ******* hell, it's like.. what's the use? I will still have so much weight on my shoulders. I dream of hanging around with friends to have fun with, go drinking, shopping, whatever.

It's so nerveracking to be isolated in my apartment. I have no job, no education higher than a year in high school because of social anxiety. All I do all day are to sit in front of a computer, watching Youtube or playing video games. Like I've done for the past 10 years. And now since the last 5 years even that is hard on me. I can only play Singleplayer games.

Every day is the same. But sadly I'm too scared to kill myself. I wonder too much on what happens after I die."
1500,"I have never had many friends because people don't really understand me. I don't really have anyone i can talk to. I have this feeling in the pit of my stomach, its horrible.

I'm sick of wearing a mask and pretending to be happy, why is it when my brain suddenly starts to feel somthing after days of nothing  I feel sad and lonely. Why for once couldn't I feel happy.

More than anything I just want someone to understand me. I want someone who I can talk to who won't judge me for what I say then maybe i could drop my walls without fear. I have no friend and i feel pathetic for it. I feel so much older than twenty one, I feel like I have been alive far too long. I feel tired.

Love Star x"
1501,"It's no wonder nobody loves you, your parents don't even care. You have no friends, nobody likes you, I don't like you.
When I speak to you I tell you the truth, I can tell you what people are thinking because I think them. I tell you the truth about yourself.
You are worth nothing, you never would have made it on your own because you are weak.
You would be doing good to remove your genes from humanity, you possess nothing useful.
I have to look at you everyday and no matter what I say you do nothing. You want saving from yourself. You are all the things you hate.
You can't hide from it.
Try and achieve anything and you will fail.
If it's really that hard why do you continue? 

So  I'm not feeling very happy today, what do I do when my mind speaks like this? I would have to force distraction but it's right there in the background saying what's the point?
Where do I find the strength to combat this, how would you begin?"
1502,"Hey everyone, 

I notice during this week that my mental health becoming worse and worse. 
Usually, when I am not in a good mood I do several things... 
Going out for a walk or run, yoga and meditation, reading, chatting with friends.
Sometimes I just eat some sweets or watch a movie.

But this time I don't know... I have that feeling that I can not help me alone anymore... I tried it hard but it does not matter what I am doing my mood is not becoming better. I have a headache, not like a pain but like my brain is numbed and in cotton.

Something heavy is on my chest that I have the feeling I can not breathe and someone is squeezing my throat.

I had an exam at the beginning of the week and I don't know if that triggered everything. I read the report and something wrong was written. I spoke about it with my supervisor and thought, after that conversation, I'll feel better and happier. But that was not the case.
I know that the report has no impact on anything and I was here and there confronted with similar situations in my life that when I was right that someone judged wrong about me. That is simply I can not take it, but I can deal with it... usually.
I do not know if I can but I do not want to be out of this situation, it sounds stupid. I try to walk longer than usual, speak with a good friend over 4 hours but at the moment we hung up, I just look to the wall and feel empty. Actual a bit better, but when I woke up this morning... the headache, the heavy thing on my chest was still there. 

However, I do not know was that the point what was triggering me or something else that I can not take myself out of this situation. I am a strong person and it makes me more ashamed to realize that I could have a mental problem. I do not afraid to ask for help ... but I do not want to ask friends for help or speak more about it, not to bother them or make them concern.

My boyfriend tried to help but I said to him to leave me for a few days alone since I want to fix it first and then am I back.

Every morning I am waking up and hope that I feel better but that is not the case... the headache is there, the black clouds are over me, the grey shadow is still hugging me.

What can I do? I do not want this all to have an impact on my life, studies, or relationships. But I have the feeling I do not have the power to change anything.
I hope I did not start to develop depression or sth else. I have now these feelings since Monday. I can not suppress it or ignore it, I can feel it so clear. Now a friend is around, who I have not seen for ages... I do not want to see anyone and speak to anyone because I have the feeling I need to change my mood and put a happy face on. 

Does anyone faced something similar and have an idea?

Thank you all!!"
1503,"Anyone else battling during the lockdown? My mind is overworking. I'm constantly in this morbid mood. Everything around me is making me feel sad and getting to me. There's no one I can talk to about it and I think that's the biggest issue. Loneliness. 

I'm working from home but it's not doing enough to take my mind off of it. Can't count the nights I have been crying and thinking about how no one gives a damn to check if I'm okay. 

Anyone going through something similar?"
1504,"My anxiety is turning into a deep depression. There are nights I know how deep the thoughts can go and if I last through the night without thoughts of self pity. This is just the beginning and I'm worried that if the effort doesn't come out the way that is exacted, I'm going to fail. This is all new to me in a sense that I was deeply undesirably happy. Now I'm just angry and I don't know where. I have artwork that I can make but I feel inadequate to post it here since I've been making typos mistakes. These mistakes are small and convenient auto correction on my phone that is still hithers me. I guess this is some sort of praying for me. These words would be looked upon by myself as guidance to my own realms."

1508,"Has anyone had anxiety and a panic attack at the same time? If so, how long did it last? What did you do to help take it away? Is it caused by overthinking?"
1509,"That's what I tell anyone who asks. Not that they ask me anymore. 
I tried lowering a med recently. My foggy head cleared. For a moment. UNTIL the depression returned.
I really need it gone. Gone on way too long. 
Im a liar, a cheat, drug addict. 
Haven't been right for a long old time. 
I finished with my girlfriend of 13 years. Did the right thing. Now I'm involved with someone else to bring misery to. N when they ask me how I am. I tell them I'm fine. But I won't be around much longer."

1511,"I will try to describe my situation as clearly as possible. Word of caution, I'm not a native English speaker , so I apologize for my grammar in advance. Nevertheless, here I go:
I am 29 year old design engineer from eastern Europe. I've been raised in a small township for 18 years of my life, graduated high school and moved to a bigger city. Family consisted of stepfather (that came to my life when i was 5, never knew my real father) , mother and grandmother. My stepfather was very psychologically unstable (spontaneous, maybe somewhat aggressive , no higher education - just a profession of welder, always wants to prove his superiority /  knowledge, despite lacking basic understanding in income management, drivers license (and a wish to get one), ambition to look for a better paying job (instead doing some worthless amateurish metal work at home)  and so on.), despite that, somewhat ""good hearted"", though overshadowed by flaws mentioned above. Mother basically never held a job, always was a housewife, as a result of having to take care of my younger half-brother. After he grew up, she still never worked a day. Even as when I was a child , I've noticed her problems with alcohol, though never thought as child or teen , that it would become this bad.
Fast forward several years, I have graduated university (been able to support myself by working during summer holidays + my grandmothers help from her pension), started working, found a girlfriend and  managed to by my own a apartment with a mortgage quite recently. Starting age at 23, when my grandmother died, and she had not been to support them financially, in addition to this, I started working full time, so my mother constantly called me and complained how they don't have money for food, medication , etc. so I've been giving them help for the last 6  years (sending some money , when things got really bad, I estimated, approx. 5k e during that time) I know that her  alcoholism became really bad, as her health already started to  deteriorate  , due to years of drinking.
Now, I know that i should have done something sooner , instead of just helping with money, but as I mentioned before, I had to built everything I have now from ground up, so helping my parents with problems mentioned above (maybe sending mother to detox , help to move somewhere else, forcing my stepfather to get driver's license and paying for courses and so on) due to financial limitations ( I barely managed supporting myself, helping with little money I had for parents and saving some money for the future). Currently, my stepfather is really tired of mother drinking and lying for all these years, and declared  ultimatum for her to stop drinking, otherwise he will leave. He took away her access to family finances (basically a debit card) . On top of that , their income is really small.
Now, I feel this is the peak of this problem I've been dealing for may years, and I don't know what to do:
Do I invest all my resources  and time to help them as much as possible, ignore them completely and let natural selection to takes it's course, or something in between?  If I had unlimited resources ,I would help without a second thought, by myself being in lower middle / middle class (by my country standards) puts me in this position, where I must choose.
I will feel really bad for getting them to suffer like this, but sacrificing quality of my life and delaying / postponing all my  plans (currently we're thinking about a child) is somewhat unfair not only for me , but to my SO.
Maybe someone was in similar situation and came up with an ingenious solution, I'm not are of?
Thank You for Your answers  in advance, maybe they will help me to make a decision."
1512,"There are many ways to assess whether you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. These can include, but are not limited to: feelings of hopelessness or irritability, feelings of guilt or self-loathing, trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much, loss of motivation, or change in appetite or weight. 

What are you FEELING?"
1513,"Hi All!

It dawned on me today that I can't really remember the last time I was truly happy.

Seems I just exist really.

Is it due to long term single-ness?
Is it due to not having a regular full time job (part time agency job, 1 day a week, 2 days a week, can be a whole week, varies)
Have I a serotonin imbalance?

I wish I knew."
1514,"Recently I've been in a very bad place. It's never been this bad. 
I'm going to fail getting in med school for the 3rd time now. I have no clue what I'll do with my life. My other grades aren't good enough for getting in other colleges and being a bio major limits my options. I have no clue what I'm going to do. My parents will be furious. Especially now that my dad will be coming back home in few days I'm so scared. This probably doesn't sound like a big issue but my whole life revolves around this one exam. It's my gateway magical way to move out of an abusive family and finally getting some help and having a chance of doing good. Me failing again means I literally have no hope left. 

I've also been experiencing physical issues like headaches all day (I've always had these) and feeling nauseous and dizzy and weak. I specifically feel nauseous when I start getting bad anxiety. 

I really don't know how I'll survive this. I know I'm scared to do anything of that sort I'm a very scared person in general in life. But I've been thinking about suicide almost all day everyday. It makes me cry all the time because of how bad I want it but I know I can't do anything. 

I really really reallyyyyyy don't think I'll survive this."

1519,"Hi there, 
I am a 20-year-old student-athlete that over the last 14months has faced an injury that has caused me, to put it simply, have the most difficult year of my life. 
My injury was manageable at first, with me achieving one of my sporting dreams over the summer (a culmination of 6 years of intense training, injury management and severe pain that all seemed worth it for this one win). In reality, it now feels like 30 seconds of pure euphoria, a peak of my life, and everything is to be downhill from here. 6 months on from that I'm in a pit. My injuries pain is worse, some days preventing me from walking, often taking heavy medication such as codeine to simply function. I've not been able to manage training with the injury anymore so I have gained weight, and worse turned to occasional narcotics as a stimulus to ensure that I can still be happy. 
The operations hope to fix the problem and allow me to return to training again, to which I am hopeful. Yet, I'm a realist in my thinking and am aware that the operation required is not successful for a handful of people. I also have many months more of waiting before I'm under the knife, a period of time where I don't feel myself and don't know how to continue anymore. 
If I try to expand my social life, I gain weight, drink too much, and do more drugs. If I try to go back into the gym to train I either aggravate my injury (forcing me to take more painkillers) or put myself in a position where I don't see it as worth the effort anymore (the realist inside of me questioning my willpower to train against the chances of me returning to the level I was before the injury). 
People's advice to me has been to keep yourself busy with uni work or coaching, to which I am. Nevertheless, keeping myself busy during the day still leaves my head rushing at night about the point of things. Others have said try get a girlfriend, to which my reply is I'm too picky and I, in my mental health position, really struggle to find someone I connect with, I refuse to get into a relationship for the sake of it. Another one is to look for a new sport, but the nature of my injury prevents this annoyingly.
I basically feel like I've lost my drive for life, as it was engaging in my sport that made up my character.

Any advice or perspective would be appreciated."
1520,This chat is for all current and past athletes who are struggling with depression and anxiety
1521,"I‘ve been suffering from anxiety and depression for a very long time (20 years so far). Managing my mental health condition seems to be a never ending struggle, in a similar fashion as managing diabetes or any systemic and permanent illness. Even though I now have a pretty extensive toolbox: access to therapies, doctor appointments, prescribed medications and even anxiety and stress relief workshops, it only seems to lead to the next relapse. Something always happen to throw me off balance. I try to stay strong, but it’s terribly hard. In fact, it seems to get harder and harder to get up after each colapse. That’s pretty much why I joined this forum. I can’t keep this on forever. It’s destroying me inside. I feel like I’m losing my mind and I fear I’ll eventually snap to the point of no return. I need help. 

I wish my family was behind me and supporting me through this ordeal, but I come from a very disfunctional, broken and scattered family on which I can’t rely. The only ones I could really rely on were my grand-parents from my mother side, but they’re both deceased now. They’ve always acted as some kind of surragote parents, so since they died I feel like an orphan. I feel so very alone and drifting. I lost my anchors.

Since I reached adulthood I gradually lost almost everything that was dear to me: family, friends, boyfriend, money, job, study, physical health, mental health, so I’m not sure how much more I can lose without going complety crazy. The list of things that keeps me floating, that makes my life worth living is now so very short that I get anxiety just acknowledging it.

I wish people would stop giving me suggestions, advice and opinions (especially those therapist who seems to really never have known any struggle in life EVER). I just need plenty of HUGS. And thank you for those who read this far. Your compassion and moral support is really appreciated."
1522,I've been feeling pretty down this week. Give me a list of something to be happy about? What's that one thing that cheers you up no matter what. Whether it's something mundane or something big. 😀

1524,"Being attracted to something vs someone is why you seek out things that are new. When you're attention is drawn to something that is higher then indifference, you can feel it in your tailbone as an attentive attraction. This doesn't just have to be in your vision but sound as well as you stare blindly. Something new that is enjoyed above indifference can be as powerful as cleaning your room or re arranging in making you happy. Attraction in your vision can be shameful and painful with anger when it is for a person and other people are around. You might see a girl in your vision and keep her there and think other people saw you staring and get paranoid or competitive. People don't generally want the attraction of strangers in modern times. When you stand amongst strangers you may quickly look away at something if you even make eye contact. Depression comes from attraction to people who aren't there and the cure for it is attraction to things that are new and above indifference."
1525,"Mine will get pretty bad at times when all I want to do is lay down and sleep and sometimes cry.Now tonight for instance I just completely broke down for about a minute then they went completely away they will do that some times,u see I also have bipolar and a mood disorder so I never know when my moods are going to chance. I love to listen to music knit and crochet . I do tend to shop online a lot and i often buy stuff i dont need. It is like a release for me like if i buy something it lessons my depression. What do u do while feeling depressed or even anxious?"
1526,Hi
1527,"Hi,
i am needing to go to get my mail but i am just to low to get out the door and walk out the the mailbox on the street. Any suggestions? Just feel it is too much to go to the effort of this simple task. i cant seem to be able to push myself to do it"
1528,I thought maybe joining friendproject would help me feel better because i'd be around people like me but.. no one is like me. They all have friends. They all go to school. They all have a life. I feel horrible now. I feel so excluded like always. I've been crying every day for weeks. I can't take this loneliness and isolation anymore. I cant do anything without depressing thoughts coming in to my mind. Even if i do feel better my step dad starts trouble.. i'm going to crack up.
1529,Yesterday I didn't feel as bad and had a busy day. Last night I was relaxed and got some sleep. Then this morning I wake up feeling miserable again. It sucks when you want to feel better and then you don't.
1530,The more medication  I  take  the  more  suicidal  I become  they had me on 14 medications  a day and I hurt myself and needed medical attention.
1531,"If I sat down and had to list positives there are quite a few - I'm married to an absolute soulmate, we've got two children, a nice house, I did reasonably well at work so we're comfortable financially.

But, and it's a big but, no positives ever enter my head. I seem to have a memory for everything that has gone wrong in life. The stupid thing is they're not big things, mainly little social embarrassments etc, but in my head they seem to outweigh all the positives. The memories can be triggered by random things, I might read or see something and everything comes flooding back. Everything is crystal clear in my head too, as though it were yesterday. I don't know why it is, it's just like if it's something bad it's stored in my brain in intimate detail. Why is this?"
1532,"Hi all,
I am turning to food because I am bored. Anyone else ever do that? I have gained ten pounds! Sleeping most of the time doesn't help I am sure. I have now switched from cookies and baked goods to smoothies and nuts. I am so bored because i have no energy to get up and do things like i used to do. I want to do things in my head, but my body won't go there. What do you do when you are bored?
Today I have been inside the house the entire day and mostly in bed. I need to change that bad behavior fast. I am searching for ideas that have worked for you for overeating, being bored, and not getting out of the bed/house. Thanks in advance > i am enjoying the forum and all the hugs. Mert :)"
1533,"I've been there, the feeling of being alone and the silent thoughts in my head affirming that nobody cares, I've been through it... hurting myself just to feel the release of the pain inside. People thought I was crazy and all, but to me it helped, truth is I was sinking lower and lower. It got harder and harder to get back up... but I eventually did. After it all, I survived, I became stronger. I kept on pushing myself to get better. And now, well... I can't believe how far I've come. So if you are going through depression and have thoughts of suicide... DON'T DO IT. You are stronger than you know. Just give it time and it too shall pass. Just try... what's the worst that could happen. Hold on. You'll get through this☺ ."
1534,"Do you think that black families, latino families, and afro-latino families find talking about mental health or your own mental health struggles taboo. I found it very hard to open to my family about my mental health problems."
1535,"I don't know, it's one in the morning and I'm just hopelessly depressed listening to ""Someone like you""  by Adele. It just came on via youtube and I just got reminded of how the song came out when I was in high school. Back then I had some semblance of who I was then. But I'm not the same person I was then anymore, it's depressing thinking back on it. I had hopes and dreams back then, and I don't even remember what that felt like. I had things I loved, but they don't give me joy anymore. I use to have courage and confidence but I don't remember where it came from. I know these feelings will pass by morning, but my chest gets so heavy with this feeling of nostalgia and heartache that its unbearable waiting for it to past. 

Sorry, it's just so gloomy, I just needed to tell someone and get it off my chest."

1537,"I am new here; my mental health story is pretty long and winding and I might go into it sometime. 
But something I’d like to share/vent right now is this feeling of being lonely.
It’s something I struggle with quite frequently. And it’s a confliting struggle. Because I really don’t feel like letting people in all that much to actually get to know me in depth. And I don’t trust romantic interest.
But sometimes it feels really dark and heavy to look yourself in the mirror and think ”You will die alone”.
I don’t know how to deal with that one. Not in the slightest."

Im feeling low and deppressed again today . has anybody else ever felt their friends drift away from them just because one suffers from deppression, i have a few friends that have been avoiding me since i went downhill with my deppression and i keep blaming myself for it , i just dont understand what i have done wrong , for them to stop talking to me . 😢"
1540,"So after my 1st post in here was basically ignored as is most of the time with me, which is mainly why I never say how I feel.
I am now faced with a job I hate with no way out, depresses me every day to the point I just wanna cry.
No friends at all, this was proven as in the 3 months of lockdown I've not had 1 message or phone call from anyone other than family, despite me attempting to make contact with people I thought might be sort of friends.
Debt that I am slowly paying off 
Feeling like a failure in everything I do, not being good at anything including my job!.
If it wasnt for my wife and 2 amazing daughters I probably wouldn't bother anymore tbh.
Not sure why I'm writing this as there is literally nothing that can be done to make it better, I cant leave my job as I'd have to drop wages and we rely on my wages to pay the Bill's.
Here's hoping some kind of miracle happens, until then I will attempt to keep going for my family, fingers crossed something changes as I see no light at the end of the tunnel atm"
1541,Does anyone else get these severe spells? They usually last between 10 to 14 days for me. During that time it's like my body shuts down and I can't function. I'm currently stuck in one and I have no appetite and insomnia. I'm having to self-medicate with alcohol just to survive the day. It's wrong I know but it's the only way I can survive. My doctor has limited me to just 7 2mg Diazepam a month now so I don't have those to rely on. I hope this episode passes soon :low:
1542,"So I haven't been on here in a while and I've actually been happy for quite some time. 
Until last few days however, I'm having some stupidly dark thoughts again and it feels like it's crushing me to the point where I can't fight it off any longer. 
I full on broke down in tears last night and living alone makes it worse because I go through it alone. I don't knkw why I feel this way, I'm fine financially and do have hobbies.
I'm just fed up of feeling this way again but it's much worse than before and I don't know why."
1543,"I'm really struggling these days with my depression. I have seen a therapist for many years and I don't think thats the problem. She helps in a lot of ways but sometimes my family makes it hard to stick with what I've learned or tools I've gained in therapy. I have always hated my body and felt like I'm ugly. I have a lot of health problems where I struggle to find food I can eat and food that doesn't make me sick. I have a lot of trauma with my health problems and food-- as a kid I was dieting often for my health and it caused me to feel deprived and scared of food at the same time. I always thought that as I got older my health allergies and issues would get better. They have just gotten worse and coming to terms with that has been really hard. I struggle with body image issues like many women do but deep down I've always known that I'm fortunately not obese or extremely unhealthy in that way. With corona and being indoors because of my severe seasonal allergies I've had little exercise and it's increased my depression. My mother and I fought all last night because she essentially called me fat and said that this is the most weight I've ever gained (which I found hard to believe and was shocked to hear). I'm extremely distraught because even though I've always felt like I'm fat and unattractive, it's different when you hear your own mother and sibling say it. I've just hit a really low point in my life. Do any of you have an advice as to how to cope with this or any kind of words of reassurance? Thank you"
1544,"Hello all,. 
I am starting a new routine today for the morning that includes a youtube video aerobic exercise class for thirty minutes. I am feeling low energy now, but i decided to push ojn anyway, I will reward myself with a special treat if i can do it. Dr Abraham Low says its not how you are feeling its how you are functioning.i  am trying to function at a higher level today than i have been doing so far. it is depressing to me i have to put in all this effort, but i accept it, or am coming to accept what is so just that is progress.i am trying prayer too as part of this routine. i plan to endorse for the effort (spot from Dr. Low's positive endorsements in his books) Mert"

It has been a while since I've felt this low. I have lost my appetite and intrest in anything. I wish I could stay in bed forever and never get up but duty calls. 

The worst part is that I can't talk to my husband about it. He has suffered depression before but how do I explain to him that I am just sad for no reason? That I just don't feel like living anymore? He will think I am being selfish but I am not. I've been holding on for a long time for him and our daughter but I feel like I can't anymore. Why should I keep fighting if I am not good at anything?..."

1547,"Hi all,

My contract is running out at work next month, and my manager will be telling me whether they will extend my contract next week.

I've been worrying non stop and can't enjoy whatever im doing due to this, this could be on Netflix, vaping - chatting to my friends on WhatsApp or face to face - my mind just drifts off.

I have seen the job market it is really dire not many jobs out, hearing about job losses, redundancies everywhere. 

I'm in a posiiton that I have to work, I cannot be jobless and that worry is driving me nuts.

I don't know what to do, I just want closure"

1552,"Hi everyone.
I've been a member here for a long while, but mainly just for reading.
Can't say I've been of much use to anyone, unfortunately.

Anyway, the reason for me posting now is because I'd like some help or advice.

I work hard, regularly doing 60 or 70 hours per week. Until quite recently I loved my job. In the last couple of months though, I've been struggling to get through every day.

I get up at 4am everyday, start work at 5am, and finish when the job's done, normally between 3pm and 5pm. Even though I get a good 7 hours sleep every night, I constantly feel worn out. Like my head is full of cotton wool. Everything is muffled.
Life seems muffled. All I think about and plan is the next day's work plan. I don't have time for anything else.

Which leads me onto other things in my head. I find myself getting very easily wound up, angry, tetchy, and I know this is coming across to colleagues. I'm surprised no-one has pulled me up on it. And I know it's in my head because I have done the same job for 4 years, and never had these feelings constantly in that time, but the tiniest irritations get to me very quickly now. 

When colleagues call me, whether it's work related or just a friendly chat, I can't be bothered to talk to them. I just want to be left alone to get on. It's the same at home. I live with my parents, but spend all my spare time playing my drums or piano (both instruments are electronic so I can play with headphones on.)

I've been single for the last couple of years, and would love to meet a nice girl, have some fun, maybe settle down etc etc, but any women I try to chat to seem to always, always have something better to do, and never even give me a smile. I'm starting to think the old saying ""there's someone for everyone"" is utter b******s. 

I'm sorry for going on so much. Believe me, this is a very much shorter post than it could have been. So much s**t going on in my head. If anyone is interested, I can expand. Just starting to wonder what the point of everything is. 

I had a few bad things happen to me over the years. I lost my long term girlfriend 6 years ago. She died following 3 heart attacks, at the age of 30. My brother died 2 years ago, aged 47. I miss them both terribly. 

I sometimes wish it had been me instead of either of them. 

Again, sorry for rambling.
Any help appreciated.

1553,"In 2018 I know my life has changed a lot because of some events which made me, until today, feels and see differently about life, I think it was the year I really experienced depression. BUT I was and tbh until now is still not sure whether I am depressed or not because thought out my life I've always been a happy person, even during bad days I've always managed thru it and become a happy person again. So now, since 2018, many times, I have questioned a lot about the point of living because during my bad times I seem to be giving up on it - I don't see any point of living even after try to read a bunch of articles about why it matters. 

Basically, I just don't know whether I am depressed or no? Is it just in my head? Or what? I try to tell this to my friend or even mom but all I get from them was that it's just a made up thing in my mind. Is it true?"
1554,"Hi. I just made an account on this site.

I'll go straight on point.. I'm a 20 year old guy and currently study on university. The last year I have been feeling very... empty. I'm not sad or anything, I just don't feel anything at all. The problem is I can't motivate myself to do anything anymore. If I'm free from school, I wake up at around noon and stare at the computer screen until 4 am. Repeat next day... Things I used to love, like working out, playing guitar, football don't excite me at all anymore. I keep telling myself to stop reading useless stuff on the internet and instead be productive, like study or be creative somehow... but when I try, I do it for five minutes before I give up.

I also have social anxiety (self diagnosed haha). I hate spending time around people I don't know unless I'm drunk as hell. I have many friends, none that I trust 100% though. Even with my friends, I sometimes feel very nervous and anxious, and I have no idea why. I always feel like I'm being judged by the way I look or act, even tho I know it's all in my head. My confidence is at an all-time low, and it shows on how I come across (I'm pretty awkward in social settings).

I don't know what to do with my life. I have no passion, no ambitions, no hobbies that I enjoy and I'm not even interested in my line of studies. I don't know when all this happened. When I was younger I always was one of the ""cool"" kids, but that kid is long gone. As I said, it's not like I'm crying or feeling alone, but this passitivity is killing me! Has anyone ever felt the same and gotten out of it? I'm at a point where I do not see a point in living anymore, not because I hate life but because why would it even matter? I have never thought about suicide tho, but I mean that I don't really give a fuk if I live or die. I feel... nothing."
1555,I feel so lethargic and no interest in anything. It makes me sick. I don’t know what to do in these 24 hours. It is driving me crazy. I used to go for walks but I haven’t done it in a while. I have social phobia and it is hard to do anything with people or outdoors. I always feel stupid and ugly. My stress is so high. I feel like I’m gonna die soon from inactivity and stress. I feel like there’s no point in me living anyway. I don’t know how to start having hobbies and being interested in something.
1556,"I was keeping busy, feeling less anxious, and actually sleeping better. Then suddenly I start feeling bad again. The anxiety flares up, not sleeping as well, depressed mood, etc. It definitely gets frustrating when this happens."
1557,"I have so many good things in my life, good friends and a family who wants to help me and it all feels so wasted on me. I am struggling a lot with self loathing and other things. It's just been especially hard recently and I really don't know what to do."
1558,"Hello again to the members of the forum,
I hope some will read my story.

All my bad thoughts came back to me with the previous terrible events happening. 
I went outside once and I just remembered how scared and nervous I am around people, I am pretty sure I have social anxiety especially with strangers but now it became worse.
I feel like people hate me so much, even on social media where I actually have some friends. I feel like I am a bad person and if I'm not I'd hate that someone will think that I am.
I'm pretty sure people judge me for my appearance, my way of talking, etc
And with the current events I am terribly ashamed to say that I am frightened of being misjudged by a POC/Black person since I'm white, even though I know that I am/was always anti-racist and I ofc agree with the fact that Black people have all the rights in the world to be angry. I know it's white fragility/guilt.
Besides, I always had a goal that a cherished in all my hard times but now I am completely lazy to accomplish it and I'm just thinking it's stupid. I lost all motivation and time has stopped.
I feel like I don't deserve anything, and that since I think that I am a terrible person who everyone hates, I did self harm again (the last time I did it was 3 months ago) because I need to be hurt and punished.
I do it regularly to suffer since I don't deserve to be happy, that I am terrible, and hated by everyone and mostly myself.
And the worst thing is that my birthday is the 19, so in 2 days I just want to die already knowing that I'll be seen as the ""important"" one..

I posted that here because I was doing fine a few days ago, and i want to be like that again.
I feel selfish for always thinking about what others people thinks about ME.
Can you give me some advice how to just don't care about what people thinks about me ? I have a loving immigrant family, and real nice friends in real life and online, I was doing great in my life goal...
I just don't understand why do I care about people who doesn't know I exist and will never see me again ? Please.."
1559,Why does life push us forwards? Is it built in or do you either have it or you don't? I have the instinct to survive physically. But my mind gives me no meaning no purpose. Everything dies so why do anything? Everything will end so why create? The while universe will end and everything forgotten so why? How do people continue its madness! Life makes no sense and the whole thing is insane! We're all pretending
1560,"Hey everybody, I hope you're all well. For a while I have dealt with both anxiety and depression, but as of lately it has spiked... And at literally the worst time might I add... I just can't seem to find an escape in anything, I feel so compromised. I'd explain it but truthfully I'm not sure I understand it myself. If anyone is up for a meaningful uplifting chat, as the thread says lol, feel free to message me. I'd greatly appreciate it"

1562,"hey everyone i hope yous are all doing well :)
im really struggling too keep myself together at the moment with everything that is going on around me,ive recently gone back too work and my interactions with people have gotten alot worse, im literally shakeing inside, my mood has dropped through the ground, i just cant see the way, all the feelings im haveing that people hate me are just so load in my head, i took some time away from the forum because i felt that everyone here possibly hated me too. i know it makes no sense, everyone that ive interacted with here have been noting but nice and careing and i really cant thank yous enough for that, im currently a apprentice plumber\fireplace fitter in ireland and its nearly impossible too not have too interact with anyone while im in work,between screaming out measurements and planning jobs or just all the lads talking with me in general scares me so much, i just cant help but feel that they dont like me or they think im a waste or a wierdo, i really try my best too be normal but i constantly find myself in a panic because its all too much, the sounds, the smells, the looks, the feelings on my skin, all the hurt and pain in the world just crushes me. i then go home completely exhausted mentally and i hate myself for feeling this way and other dark thoughts come into my mind that i cant handle properly, i try so so hard too be nice and polite and exceptible too people but its never enough, i cant help but say im ""grand"" everytime someone asks how im doing, i feel like i cant talk about this stuff too anyone who is physically in my life  incase they think im weak or that im a snowflake, i desperately want too seek help but this thing that is stuck with me gives me so many reasons too not go and get help then on the flip side it hurts me and causes me pain 😓 im really sorry if none of this makes any sense at all, i dont know what too do anymore or how i should go about trying too improve my situation but it all seems hopeless too me, i try and i try again and again but im kicked down eveytime, i try too do mindfulness in the evenings whitch does help a little in terms of keeping me grounded but i always fall back into it, at this point i just hope and wish too be normal because ive never felt so out of place."
1563,"*Tw; Suicidal thoughts, self harm* Everything hurts. So badly.

During the day, my anxiety is overwhelming. I get paranoid that my parents are talking about me behind my back, and it makes me shake and my heart race. I get some form of anxiety attack sometimes 2-3 times almost every day. I worry about everything - I go through cycles of reassuring myself, then worry continues, then reassuring and distracting myself, over and over until the worry somewhat dissipates. Even then, it’s not enough.

At night, when I no longer have to wear the mask of seeming “fine”, I feel the depressive thoughts come back. They’re more intense at night. They’re filled with thoughts of worthlessness and death. I can’t take the anxiety anymore. I’ve had anxiety since I could remember. I have bad memories that flood back, more often as of late. I’ve also had thoughts of hurting myself again, even though I’ve had a good clean streak.

Due to not wanting to worry my parents, or rather, keep up the appearance of being functional and independent, I stopped seeing my therapist. My parents dislike my psychiatrist so I’ve stopped seeing them. I am tapering off all meds. I torture myself with thoughts of getting help again, knowing I won’t get it nor deserve it.

I’m just really tired."
1564,"I had quite hard childhood due to the serious psychological trauma that is one of my first memories and affected my life significantly. I had tough life as a child and later, I wasn't interested in things like other kids, was total stranger and suffered from constant bullying at school and everywhere else.
Later in my life there was a girl that helped me a lot and returned me to normal life, because while living with her I started to study a lot and found happyness in science. I was dreaming about having my own child and giving him perfect childhood and life, that I hadn't myself. Later on I've met my wife and she've got pregnant shortly and unintentionally (or at least without her intention). She wanted to make a career, was planning to change job, thus she wanted to do abortion. I wanted this child so much and didn't allowed it. She gave a birth to our son. Now he is 1yr old. He is everything to me, even if he just starting to talk, we are already the best friends. My wife's dreams is ruined (at least for now, but she don't believe that she will still be able to have a career). She gives care for our child - he eats healthy and more than enough, has toys, clothing etc.. But he lacks one thing that in my opinion is most important - mothers love. Wife plays phone games all day long and do not show attention to our son. If he cries, it just gets her angry. My heart breaks when I see it, when I know it. It is constantly in my mind and it made my life very sad. I would be happy if I could be with my son much more time and I try to be with him as much as possible, but the problem is that I have to took care of my own career, because I am responsible for them. While there was a quarantine and I was working from home, I was constantly seeing my child crying and her playing with cellphone. At least I was able to take a breaks and play with him, but now when I have to go to office, I know that he is unhappy and she don't pay attention to him. I wanted happy family, but most importantly, I wanted happy child. I try to talk with her, but the answer is that she don't wanted him and it was my decision. It is true. It is my fault. But he is our son and we both must love him. I can't think any way out of this hell. I can't leave her, because I would not get custody, I can't talk about it with her, because it gets her angry and she starting to blame me for it (and she is right), I'm dreaming about not being alive, but I know that I will live for our son. Maybe I take it too serious? Maybe mother not paying attention for child is not harmful for him and he will grow up normal and will be happy?"
1565,"Hi.
I just don't know anymore I feel there is something wrong with me, I really struggle with social interactions and I cannot seem to connect with anyone, I feel as if there is an invisible language that I am unable to learn. I have no friends outside of work and have not made any friendships since school.
I am 26 and live with my parents, I have a decent job that I enjoy which helps a lot but my life has become work with no social links. I just feel so down and alone right now."
1566,I hate the thought of pregnancy so much. I never want to have sex because of it even with precautions. It makes me so sick thinking about it. Even just knowing I’m a woman with a healthy womb makes me so uncomfortable. I feel so vulnerable and scared. Menopause also scares me a lot. I’m just scared of the future. I want to be okay :( I want to be healthy so I don’t end up in a horrible state when I’m older but I’m not. I hate myself so much. I hate that I wasn’t born a male. I’m so paranoid that someone’s going to assault me. I got a vision of it happening and I just feel so scared ever since. That also increased my fear of pregnancy. I hate life. I feel like I’m losing it.
1567,"I have a really hard time talking in person. I get offended by sarcastic tones. When someone starts talking to me I freeze and don’t know how to answer without mumbling and sounding like I’m drunk.

I can talk but I can’t ‘talk’. I don’t know how to ‘fit the standards’ in social settings. I feel like people just rip me apart when they see me, just the vibes I get. I get nervous and panicky when I have to pass a crowd or anyone really. Because of my tathered clothes, body odor I can’t help but feel like they’re just ripping me limb from limb. I don’t know how to speak ‘the language’ that’s socially acceptable. I’ve developed a stuttering problem. I slur my words because I’ve always had a weakensss. I feel like I’m too weird and ‘creepy’ to be loved. I’m the ‘creepy uncle’ in the family. The only one the kids aren’t willing to hug. The adults drown me out with awkward small talk. Today I finally just said, oh the same thing as last time. The same boring thing you wouldn’t understand. I was just frustrated and didn’t want to be there, the only person making small talk in the room while 23 angry family members listen to my voice. People just ‘go through the motions’ with me in the everybody s a winner aspect and have no interest when I reach out for help of show genuine interested in any given subject. When I’m not around I get talked badly about. Like I’m some kind of inferior awkward black sheep of the family and community."
1568,"Before this anxiety I was almost an introvert and I really liked to stay alone and enjoyed my hobbies. I don't care if anybody around me or not. I was happy.

But now because of this anxiety (even a lot better now tho, but not fully recover), I'm scare to goes offline and left by people around me. I always want to stay around people and talk to people. I stick to the forum all day, chat with my friends, I work around my colleague but when they go offline or go back home I feel like I left alone and sad. I know nobody can stay around me forever even they care for me. But I think I'm too dependent to other people. I think this is bad and selfish. 

All I can do when I feel alone is playing games, it can distract my feeling and anxiety somehow. But sometime it cannot. I really depress and sad when I think about those anxiety and overthinking level is getting high. 

Is there anyone experiences like this and how do you cope ?"

Warning: long read. I'm not looking for advice from this, just wanting to share my story in the hope that it may help.


Last year a number of pretty shitty, and stressful, events happened in succession. I won't list them because I don't want people to compare; people react differently to different situations. Before this I just moved in with my partner, we had already supported each other through a lot and it felt so right to us. I have never lived with a partner before and we moved to a new city to start new jobs. I was excited and nervous.


When my partner and I met I was mentally strong, happy within myself and knew exactly how to love and care for her. I felt on top of the world, she came into my life and it was like the cherry on top. There was nothing particularly special going on before we met, I have a normal life but I was actually happy and content within myself, which I hadn't achieved for a few years, and I realise that makes so much difference to how you deal with situations.


After moving in together, these events happened, and I slowly started to lose myself; fading away from who I was. I lost my energy, I couldn't get out of bed (luckily I had flexi hours and could work from home otherwise I would have lost my job a long time ago), my thoughts and body language became so negative and really delayed. My partner became my comfort and I relied on that too much. It makes me so ashamed to admit that. 


One of the amazing things about my partner is that she taught me how to open up, but after years of bottling up unknown emotions, they all poured from me onto her! As much as partners are there to support you, they are not your full time therapist; especially when they have their own shit they need support with. She was amazing though; she let me vent, encouraged me to cycle with her, try new things etc. But the longer this went on, with no real improvement, it began to take its toll on her and our relationship - she wanted the old me, the supportive me back and so did I. We both assumed I was grieving or something and it would soon pass. I felt so lazy, so helpless, so ashamed and frustrated with myself - my self confidence hit rock bottom.


I could see she needed me but I felt like I was being weighed down, it was like  the real me was observing, screaming 'I'm still here! Please be patient!' But the shell of me hid that and gave nothing away that she could hold on to.


I sought out help from my GP and was advised to go to group CBT. After 6 weeks of 1 hour group sessions I had initial optimism, but  unfortunately the dark thoughts soon squeezed that out of me. I started karate, which although I was slow at because of my hazy mind, I really enjoyed and it gave me purpose to leave the house. The physical activity helped me so much and I felt like I was gradually able to do more stuff in my life each day. At the hardest times I struggled to even look after myself, so doing something like house chores became a real struggle to me, but I was determined to contribute. It was my way of reaching out and saying 'I know this is hard. I know I'm a miserable, lazy shit, but I am trying. Please be patient'.


I could feel myself starting to enjoy things more, but the worthless thoughts refused to go away and they were consuming so much of my mind, and energy, that I had little to give my partner. I would be there to listen, but my intuitions, judgement and empathy were not kicking in. I hated myself; she was in pain, struggling and asking for help and all I could do was listen, not take action. Listening to someone is extremely important, but sometimes people need more than that and I couldn't give it, no matter how much I tried, how much i wanted to, I'd somehow lost that side of me. I felt so angry at myself, even more worthless, and like a terrible partner. It was eating away at me so much that I became withdrawn. She deserved better than that, all I wanted to do was help her like she had helped me.


I seeked out one to one therapy to tackle my low self esteem, this helped me to talk through some things and took some of the emotional burden off my partner. I was told that I shouldn't be ashamed for being selfish, because I had been through a lot and I had to work on myself before I could fully support her. This helped. I was able to think to myself 'Okay yeah, those were shitty things. They did have an impact on me, but let's move on and find myself again.' And I did, well I found glimpses of myself. Despite me progressing with my attitude and motivation I could still feel something niggling, pulling me down, holding me back and having bad days.


My partner and I went on several holidays during the positive side of me (I still had shitty days, but more good than bad). They were great but something didn't feel quite right, I lost all belief in myself as a good partner and questioned how she could love me, even unintentionally testing her commitment once. No matter how much I loved her, how much she gave me butterflies, how much I thought she was the love of my life I lost how to love her the right way, tune into her needs and let her open up to me for a change. I thought me listening and being more positive, showing glimpses of me again was enough, but it wasn't. At a time when my partner really needed me she felt like she couldn't rely on me and she let out all her emotions of how, whatever was going on with me, was pushing her away. She felt lonely in a relationship. To hear those words from someone you truly love, and care about, is soul destroying. I had allowed her to feel lonely! I had failed her! I was angry because I felt like I was there and ready for her; I felt so much stronger and couldn't understand why she felt like that. I had worked so hard but it still wasn't enough. The thing is, what I realise now, she was more in tune with me than I was with myself and she could see what I couldn't - something was holding me back from loving myself and her. This frustration became consuming, but the more I fixated on finding out what was wrong and judging myself, the less present I felt.


We both decided that moving out and giving each other space was the best solution. The day we moved out lockdown was announced; we had planned to try and rekindle our romance through dating again, but the lockdown prevented that. I was determined to use this time to workout what was going on with me - for myself, her and the relationship. These events happened a year ago, I didn't feel like they had an emotional hold over me anymore. So why the low self esteem, the frustrations, the feeling that something was constantly hanging over me? I felt positive because I was handling lockdown quite well, feeling fairly positive, but the mental side felt foggy.


Just like last year, a series of events happened. A lot of it occurred to my partner's loved ones and I was determined to be there for her this time. To show her I am reliable, she can trust me. It was my time to hold her close and kiss her pain away! But then, like a tsunami, I was flooded with dark crippling thoughts about how worthless I am, how I'll never make her or anyone happy, how I'm a waste of a life! I spent time in my room crying, telling myself ' Snap out of it! She needs you! Everything she has done for you and you can't even give back! You're pathetic!'


Again, I listened to her, I turned up with a smile, made food, etc. but I had nothing in the mental tank to offer for real support, because I was spending too much time putting myself down and dwelling on what was wrong with me.


She told me she wasn't in love with me anymore and I begged her to see that I was improving, that I just needed more time to figure out what is going on. She told me she had waited long enough, which she had. She stood by me longer than what most people would have tolerated. I know how it feels to be lonely in a relationship so it kills me to know that whatever was hanging over me, despite my efforts of telling it to do one! Meant I had unintentionally pushed the love of my life to that point.


She needed my support, but until I knew what was continuously pushing me down I just had nothing to give and I didn't want her to go through anymore pain because of it. I was causing more damage than good to her and so I chose to take time finding out why the hell I couldn't snap out of it and why it was following me around, preventing true progress and ruining my relationship with the most amazing, passionate, caring, selfless woman who I want to make a life with.


Why did I choose time? Because I was hurting a girl who was already hurting. I had been trying so hard to get that old me back, but glimpses were not enough.  Not enough for her or me.


I drove away knowing that I had left the girl of my dreams and it broke me. It broke her. She blames herself and questions why she isn't worth fighting for. Well she is! Any person would be extremely lucky to have this woman in their life and she deserved to have a strong person to break down to. Just like I did when I broke down to her. Asking for time was the hardest thing I've had to do and it hurts me every minute of the day, but this overhanging darkness was like a disease taking the life from the both of us. I didn't want to bring her down with me anymore. So what may seem like a selfish thing - leaving her during her own difficult time - I did it to stop her from hurting and wondering what she's doing wrong. I realise now there was nothing she could have done unless we both had answers. She may not see it, but I really fricking love that woman and she deserves to let herself go and be fully supported in ways I couldn't do anymore, for no known reason.


It has been two weeks since I made that choice, during which I have been frantically watching TED videos, reading articles, taking quizzes to understand what the hell led me to this place, what is wrong with me and how do I make it stop?! A lot of them provided some insight, but still not quite giving me the answers to this constant mind hijacking. I had more counselling, they again told me not to be harsh on myself, that last year was a lot. Okay, it was but I feel like I've moved on from that a long time ago.


Then, I went back to the doctors. We had a lengthy discussion, I told them every method I have tried, the details of what has been happening. He agreed that last year would have impacted me, but I have actually been struggling with depression all this time and probably experienced some less damaging depression episodes earlier in my life!


That's not a surprise to you, because it's in the title. But it was a surprise to me and hard to take. Both my parents had struggled with depression and I didn't want to be affected the way they were. I have started with medication and agreed to go on a treatment plan. I got home and started to research depression, looking at forums and blogs from those who suffer with it and looking at their partners pov too. The more I read, the more I realised that so much of my thoughts, and actions, were because of this and not because I'm a lazy, selfish person.


I learnt things like it affects your ability to think and act clearly, it can slow your motions so much that people can actually see it! It can suck the joy out of your life, it can make you feel like you are a burden to everyone, make you want to hide away in a dark place and not socialise. It can make you absent minded and like you want to sleep forever. It can impact yours and your loved ones lives to breaking point! It can also take, on average, 10 years for people to reach out for help and find the right support.


So why am I so happy to be diagnosed with this seemingly crippling illness? Because I finally have answers! I have reasons for those behaviours... okay, not all of them (some of them can't be excused by depression)... but for the majority of things where I was so harsh on myself for not knowing how to ""snap out of it!"" I can see that other people have suffered with them too and it's not something you can just snap out of. It doesn't mean I'm weak or was doing anything wrong, which is not what I was telling myself.


I am not alone in this and neither is anyone else who is suffering or has been diagnosed. It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can actually think more clearly now!


This will not be an easy journey, I know that, but this illness will not define me! 

I have unknowingly been living with it and even in the times, at my lowest, I was still able to see some light. With the right help I will continue on my journey and will not stop! Now I can stop spending so much time trying to figure out reasons for all my thoughts, and actions, and start learning the best techniques; understanding that it is not out of choice, laziness or selfishness. I will not give in to this illness. I will understand it and fight it! My diagnosis is not the end of me, it is the beginning of a healthier me and my patronus is knowing so many other success stories and believing in myself.


I am also going to fight to get the woman of my dreams back. She deserves the world and I now know I can give her what she needs and more. I want to stand by her side through all of life's rollercoaster events like she has done for me. Depression doesn't have to result in an unhealthy, unbalanced relationship. I believe we can work together as a team and support each other through each other's ups and downs. Wish me luck xxx"
1571,"I've been posting on here for awhile about my struggles with anxiety, sleep issues, and a low feeling mood. Lately it feels like I've seen some improvements. I don't feel as anxious anymore and I'm sleeping better. I'm still struggling with some fatigue and a low mood at times though. I'm trying to stay busy and think more positive about things."
1572,"I'm so freaking scared of my parents... I thought I get used it but I don't know why... maybe because of my period I grow so emotional, that fear just overwhelms me. Whenever they tell me to do something and they're inspecting the result my every nerve stills and I can't breathe. Waiting. I hear the way they breathe, the way they draw breath before speaking. I hear their tone. between their words. all of these tiny details speak danger to me, alerting me, yet I am a captured, helpless prey. All they do is speak words to me, never hit me. All these invisible knives... I can see them, sense them after my whole life's training. and I have to hold myself up as I did over and over again. Because no one will save me. No one will even believe these words can hurt at all. 
When they stand close to me I can't move. I don't dare to breathe. All my instincts tell me to stay away. I just burst into tears after my parents left my room. They didn't yell. They didn't speak mean words. But their emotions so apparent, as an enormous burden on me. invisible threat."
1573,"My partner has had a bit of a breakdown. We were in such a loving relationship and planning a future together. He then had a severe bout of depression and anxiety and is really struggling and everything has been turned upside down.  He is not sure what he wants and says he feels completely numb, towards me and towards everything. All he knows is he loves me. I don’t know how to deal with this as he now never comes near me, cuddles me, there is no affection. Is this going to get better or is the emotional numbness just directed towards me because a relationship is too much for him at present? I don’t know what to do."
1574,What are psych wards like? I feel like I really need to admit myself into one but I’m uneasy because I don’t know what to expect so it’s putting me off of it. My mental health is very low at the moment and I don’t want to hurt my friends or family by doing something irreversible.
1575,"I keep having this ""inteventions"" with my family and they ask me why I don't do enough, or what they do to help me? Why I don't let them? And then after they just day to me to find things to do that makes me feel better, they say they know i tried they say I do my best? So? Is this me or they are just talking circles. 
I sometimes feel I live for them and for their expectations, even though they make me how I am and also, never make me understand what is purpose in life.  
I can't control my mind and the constant pressure from myself to myself to become someone better and also remembering that I'm not capable of nothing."
1576,are going to be homeless again. My landlord is trying to evict us saying we owe back rent. We are fighting it in court. But then the covid19 showed up all court is on hold we have proof they are lying. They then changeed their story about how much we own (yes it's legal)  we got word from our lawyer that even if we win the case my landlord is stopping our mouth to mouth lease. We have no where to go. No friends no family our credit is bad and now everyone does credit checks to rent a place. We were thinking about buying a camper and living in it. But I not sure if it's a good idea. I don't know what to do any more I'm scared.
1577,"My childhood sucked like a lot of people. My mother was an alcoholic and my dad beat her. I never felt loved as a child and my mother would be cruel to me to make me cry. I always cried alone in my room. I am unable to make friends, I feel unable to trust people. My mind tells me they are selfish and evil. So I struggle most days with doing anything, I feel i cant be honest about anything. I feel unlovable because my own parents blank me for no good reason. Hard to overcome this feeling of worthlessness when I have no good memories to break out of it. It is all bad. How do I fight this despair when I am all alone and my worst enemy. Any tips on your experiences that might help me to build some confidence. Also has anyone ever felt like they are nothing or do not know who they are? I feel trapped and this makes me scared and paranoid. It's so nice to be anonymous. I'm quite new to this, I think I just need to vent and hear peoples experiences to know I am not alone."
1578,"I've been working again for about 3 weeks now after 2 months off and I feel like I'm drunk when speaking to clients.

I've always been a bit socially retarded and awful in group situations. However my 1 on 1 especially working, I know exactly what I'm talking about I've never had any issues with communication. In fact clients often comment on how professional/polite I am.

However. Since going back I just feel out of it. Stumbling on my own words. Getting lost in what I'm saying, lack of small talk and overall just a bit of a mess. God knows what my clients are thinking.

Has anyone else had anything similar or any ideas as to what's going on?

Thanks all."
1579,"I don't know how to describe how I'm feeling at the moment, I'm overwhelmed, anxious, scared so low and uninterested in anything, I am scared of failure so I never try anything, my thoughts overwhelm me and I overthink everything, I'm struggling to really find a solution that works anymore, ive had therapy, taking tablets at the moment, don't have any friends to really reach out to that will really help me, my family are pressuring me and worrying me about my job and don't seem to really know how to help me with this, I don't know where to turn or how to cope anymore, whenever I look at things like , meditate, read a good book, listen to music or do something for yourself, I get annoyed and frustrated at that because they never work for me for long enough, I get anxious over those solutions, I'm super insecure in myself and I can't seem to escape this feeling of uselessness, I'm also so fricking tired all the time even when I have time off everything it makes it worse, but when I go to work it's bad too, it's just an endless loop of hopelessness and stress."
1580,"I cant find that someone to share life with. Im lonely to the max. I struggle to generate enthusiasm for anything. Ive always been alone, no relationship experience. I meet people but theyre never interested in me beyond friendship if even acquaintence. Im tired of being alone. Im tired of doing everything alone. Going anywhere, waking up, eating, watching a movie, etc. I do everything alone and I just cant enjoy any of it anymore. Is it absurd that I feel so hollow because of it? I dont seek validation from someone. I simply want someone to want to be with me. I just cant form that sort of connection with anyone for some reason. I need someone to love me. I need to feel their warmth next to me. I need someone to let me love them. Am I wrong to feel so worthless? How can I not when no one has ever given me even a second glance? I am unwanted and I dont know why. Is loneliness a valid reason to not want to go on anymore? I know there are others with much worse problems than I. I wonder if this emptiness I feel is valid enough to be so unhappy. I often feel self-indulgent of my sadness. Like I have no right to feel so bad compared to others. I cant help how I feel though. All I know is I need love but I have no one, and its killing me slowly."
1581,"So I'm usually quite positive and don't hang around negative people and in this climat it's almost impossible to anyway.
But I miss my family and think that I'm just not coping very well at the moment.

We speak everyday on whatsapp or over the telephone but I haven't hugged my mum since this whole affair started so it's starting to drag me down a bit not really sure what to do to distract my self any more x"
1582,"Hey guys,
Recent months showed me how messed up my life is and how little i can do about it. I could write 100 pages about my 26 years of life but I know not everyone wants to read it all. I really beg you people to try to help me understand why my life looks like that. Most importantly what can I do about it, if anything. I want to point my issues and events from life, year after year events, that could cause that.

- I see myself as low inteligent.

- Not doing things that should be done in order for example to avoid further damage ( didnt see dentist for years even though i got pain, didnt get any blood tests, got eye floaters that is not checked up etc )

- now with that pandemic im afraid to call for unemployment

- i got issues in general to call anywhere and get something done, i would rather do everything online but not always its possible. For this reason i have no insurance. I just dont know how to talk to people.

- Difficulties with thinking at all. No thoughts are created in my brain. I cant have conversation even about weather. I struggle so much with talking. Thats the main reason, in my mind, for not having friends, talking to people, achiving anything in life.

- Social phobia. I am afraid of talking to people. I have nothing in my mind to talk about.I dont like when people want to ask me anything. I am scared not to be able to respond.


- Life in virtual reality. Thats the big one. I spend last 10 years in games, on forums talking about not importants stuff and trying to feel good about myself. I would pretend to be someone that I wasn't. I would act like I have something when i didnt have it. Many years were about creating a person that I wasnt in fact. But back then I felt good about it.

- Lack of real family. My parents as far as I remember never lived together. It was never discussed. I never had real conversations with my family. Just simple ones. Nothing. I bounced between my mom, her parents, my dad again. At some point I stopped to care. My feelings were shut down for anyone.

- Not keeping with touch with my family. I didnt talk for years to my father's family and mother's as well. Why do I feel okey with it? I dont know...

- No goals in life at all. All i wish is for everyone to leave me alone. Life could too.

- With my stepfather, I would be afraid to go to the kichen to do something. Like i feel like i have to say something but I know I cant. When I was on diet I would get so pissed I cant go to the kitchen knowign I have to heat up the food while he was there. If I forced myself I would freeze or got this heat coming through my body.
- being afraid in general of everything, always overthinking, even things that i've done in the past still can stress me out.

- there are many other issues. Things mentioned above may not even cover it all.

I would like to try go over last years and tell what happened that could cause how I am today.


Before 2005
I lived in small village with my father's parents and my mom. My dad never lived there with us. He was always around places, different countries. He promised to finish one level in this house so we could live there. This never happened. As far as i remember I was pretty normal there. I was hanging out with people. They visit me, i visit them. We played in the garden, ride on bicycles, played some games. I would go visit my family. I would be happy about it. I was travelling in train for hours to see them on vacation.
After 2005
It was a year where my mom won green card and everything has changed since then. This year my father's mom had accident and couldnt take care of us. For this reason we had to move out to my mother's parents ( the other side of country ) because she had to take chance and go to united states. She was afraid to take us with her because she didn't have anything planned over there. Thats how we lost our green cards. My father lived where my mother's parents lived. Close to the same city. The thing is he was always doing his suspicious business. I had to finish school away from people I grew up with. It was in the middle of semester. And now I also lost my mother by my side.. I remember to this day that she was calling from US and i didnt want to talk to her. I feel now like change started back then and I was backing out from everything. I dont know if this was this year or before 2005 but when I was at my moms parents house dad texted me and asked when he is going to see me. I responded that he would wait as long as I was waiting for him. I remember to this day this very moment. I remember how I didnt want to see him. How they struggled to take me out from the car so I could hang out with him. I simply didnt want to. We had like time scheduled to be together because I think I didnt want to be with him any longer than needed. I also remember that one time I visited a friend in his house. Maybe I was even playing football with people.
Once I finished elementary school which was next to my grandparents house, the next school was too far for me to go to. Thats when me and my brother moved to the father.

2006-2009
This were school years that were so horrible. People in this school were retarded, abusive, not respectful that I remember throwing up before going into this school. I even got some pills from doctor. At one point I found my father as wanted on police website. I also wont forget that. I remember my mother coming back for few weeks and she was sleeping on a couch. My dad in a room, she was in the couch. And nobody explained anything. I think I was explaining it to myself back then. I tried to interpretate what was happening.
It was also a time where i started to play one game. It become my escape from reality along with forums. I started virtual live there not even knowing im escaping something. Thats where I felt safe, important and needed.  I had my life online not caring about real one.
Somewhere around that time someone told me that my mom has a new boyfriend or something. She met him in united states. Not sure how I reacted to it. But also she bought an apartment on credit with my dad around this time after crisis happened.

2009-2012
High school years. I was in the best school in a city. Not by a choice. I just followed 3 people that i went to school for last 3 years. I knew i would die without them. I wasnt meant to be in this school. So much to learn, so much stress and I couldnt keep up with that. Horrible experience.
During this years I was asked by school psychologist to invite one firend to my home. After years ( i asked recently who come up with that ) it was my moms idea. It never happened. I didnt let anyone come to my home. I was also send to some meetings with shy people. Well I went maybe twice and never came back. I was also send to school where they help you improve your memory but I also didnt last.

It was also a year where something shady started to happen with my father. My mom was aware of that. Dad was taking money from people, promise to import cars and people never seen money and cars. I think one time dads friend confronted my mom and she wasnt aware of anything. After that while she was in country, when my dad left she locked door and never let him back. I remember it to this day. Tears are coming to my eyes that things like that had to happen in my life. But again it wasnt discussed. It just happened. Nobody asked questions. From this moment my grandparents moved into our apartment and lived with us. I was more into virtual life. I wasnt into any family time, hangouts, trips. I was no to everything even more than ever. I was struggling to pass at school, i hated every minute over there. There were also 3 weeks that my dad was arrested and driven thorough different cities because of court cases. He even cheated on his best friend. He even took money from me and never gave back.

Now, once you pass the school there is a test that you have to take and based on that you go further into another schools. There is a speech that you need to give on selected topic, wiriting an essay and other math tests. That day I didnt even want to go. They called me from school where am I. I went there not prepared at all. I barely said anything. They gave me passing score anyway based on prestigue of this school. Well, I failed on essay and this they couldnt cover up. I got to do it again and somehow I passed.. I was the only one in this school to fail.. it has to mean something.
Also at the end of 2012 we left to United States... after getting green cards..
One month later my dad passed away.. heart attack..


2013
It was a year that I got myself into positive addiction. I started to workout and it become my obsession. I never was into any workouts, especially interval trainings but i really loved it. I was taking some English classes here, then my mom signed me into college but I really didnt want to go. I just hoped for things be okey somehow... I already wasnt thinking about future or anything. I wanted everyone to leave me alone. This year I worked for the first time in my life. It was work from school and as you can imagine i didnt want to. I was freaking out. My mom was forcing me. When I got into this work somehow it was fine. But the whole process to make it happen was horrible. When I heard I would have to pick up phones I spoke to them and said that my English isnt good etc. Somehow I avoided it.
2014

It was sad year. I was in ESL class in January for short semester. Now, there was a girl who seemed to look at me every few minutes. I didnt think of it too much. I didnt talk to her. Deep inside my head I knew this is not for me. But at the last day of the class when we were signing for next one, we signed up for the same class. She said i should sit next to her. I felt that what I just did was wrong. I know my place in this world and i shouldnt even try to get closer with her. Well, me her, one girl and guy even managed to go to the movies. Like my mom and brother couldnt believe that. Movie was Endless Love. I remember how she was sitting next to me and looking at me. We texted a lot with each other. More texting than talking in class. We texted late at night. Right after we got to our homes. But in real life it was different. I couldn't do anything with her, make a joke, ask her to go out and after few weeks it become wierd. Even she said we have nothing to talk about and I started to go crazy. We texted less. I was loosing my mind. Like I wanted more but I knew I can't. I started to follow her. I knew that once this semester is over I may never see her again. It was horrible experience. I think later on she blocked me and by the end of the year unblocked and we talked again. She wanted to hang out but i never made it happen. One thing that I did was when she asked me to bring charger to lab with computers I connected it to the pc and managed to copy all pictures from her phone to usb stick. I dont even know why I did that. One picture had her home address and it turned out that she lives 7 minutes away from me. From that moment, 6 years later whenever I want to go for a walk for some reason I always pass her house. I dont think she lives there anymore ( i saw she has a boyfriend  and before she lived there with her auunt ) but it become my routine to just walk by her home. It was also a time that for the first time in my life I had this feeling that I dont know what to do with myself. It was so bad to find a place for me to have a peace in my mind. I cant put it into words how does it feel when you dont know what to do with yourself. So horrible.


If this wasnt bad enough my brother used to abuse me for how i am, for avoiding everything, for being me. He called me human wreck and vegetable. When we were on vacations this year, we stayed at home alone and he tried to abuse me physically and I never got pissed in my life so bad that i texted my mom that im gonna kill him if he does it again. From that moment everything between us was different. Even though we slept in the same room for years, we didnt speak a word to each other. Like a ghosts. 6 years later I still dont trust him and dont consider him my borother. We exchange few words but its not family love. I cant understand why it had to be and still has to be like that.


During this year i had 2 jobs. In one i was fired because in supermarket I didnt want to deal with people where i had to slice the meat. I wanted to put stuff on shelves but it wasnt enough for them.

I was also in liquor store where they fired me after i told them i go for vacation in the busiest period for them. I also felt i dont fit there. I think even owen told me that once before i even mentioned it. It didnt make me feel good at all. I didnt like to talk to customers about alcohol. I always tried to call someone to help.

I continued to workout, it was still my obsession.



2015

It was a year where mom found me another delivery job and as of right now i still work there. I happened to like that job very much. But still I was always backed out. Couldn't make friends with anyone. I knew I couldn't. I always had my space when people talked or joked. I would just listen. Not add anything into conversations. Many people liked me but there was nothing  I could to to make some friends.


I continued to workout

2016


Mid of 2016 was a changing period for worse. Again i met someone at work but this was only as a friends. Again i texted with this person a lot and she was happy to have a friend because nowadays its difficult for someone who doesnt want anything more. And I didnt want to. She was so cool and funny that I was scared im gonna fail again. I managed to hangout with her, even tell her about my problems. I think it was first time in my life that i had a drink with a dinner. I never had alcohol before. We went to NBA match, we hangout in shopping malls etc. But when it came down to coming to her birthday or seeing more of her friends i started backing out. It was just too much pressure in my mind. With time she found a boyfriend and she couldnt give me as much time as i needed. This was horrible to wait for text from her for hours. I again didnt know what to do with myself. I felt so bad inside. I felt like im alone again and problem was i didnt want to be alone. I was so bad to the point that i made a decision to see a psychologist. Believe me I didnt care about anything in my life, i didnt ask anyone for help, i always held my feelings and emotions inside but this time i couldnt. I cried a lot, during my meetups with doctor too but after 6 visits this feeling was going away and i stopped coming. I was asking my doctor about stuff i am asking you. She seemed not to know how to help. Thats why i stopped going there and i came back to my world.


After that I stopped working out. I never felt this fire inside of me to do it anymore. I realized how amazing it was to have a friend, how great it would be if i was on the same intelectual level as she was. I started to hate myself.

2017 Life changing year.


This was a year that after reading any of above you wouldnt see that coming. I had a girlfriend. What? Yeah.. thats right. At place where I work there was a girl that wasnt my type at all. She seemed to be crazy, liked parties, going wild but somehow I was into it so much you guys dont even know!

It started when I noticed she was drinking at work. People from the kitchen would give her something. It was first time I bought vodka and asked her if she wants something. We drank in a basements for a while and then she asked me if I want to go the the club with her. I was frozen to death. We exchanged numbers and I went with her. Guys, prior to going out I was so scared I drank all day. I felt more confident while being dizzy. She was alcoholic at the time so she would ask me for a sip. When we got to the club, i was getting shots and then tape was over. I lost touch with reality. I lost my glasses, wallet and hat that night. I woke up with her in a motel. We got back somehow to her house, she ordered me a cab and when i got home i felt so different. I felt like something new is coming, i dont know what is it but i wanted it so bad.

Changing moment for us was when one night she was so drunk with other friends that she didnt know what was happening to her. She was bipolar on her meds and drinking. She was calling me and i run back to the city to find her. Somehow she said name of the hotel and i got there. What i saw was plenty of firefighters and other medical stuff around her. She told me after when she saw me that night it was turning point for her. Like she fell in love with me. She said everyting at the moment went quiet and she saw only me. But it wasnt the end yet. Her mom came to pick her up and when i thought shes safe it turned out she got worse at home. She called me and says shes gonna kill herself. She said she took an overdose and she hopes not to wake up anymore. I was on the phone for so long, i didnt know what to say. Then her mom came to the room and called ambulance. She was screaming. Then she called me at night after she was detoxicated. We talked whole night. The next morning i skipped day at work and went to pick her up at the hospital. And you know what she said? If I have a sip for her. Like it wasnt the first time she ended up like this. For some reason I went with a flow. I wanted to be around her. We even started to stay on the weekends in the hotels. There was something cool about her that i wanted to be with her. I didnt care she had mental issues. She was so smart, so intelligent, funny. I felt so good with her. For the first time I started to have strong feelings to anyone. With time I helped her to stop drinking. Somehow I managed to move her into place where I lived even though it was small and no private room. We lived in living room and everyone was walking through. My stepfather wasnt so happy about it but i guess my mom talked to him. My borther at the time moved to another country. So we had all living room to ourselves. Same year we even went to a vacations and my mom said she wouldnt believe until this happens. And yeah we did go. Like its so difficult to put into words how all this started for us. Looking in the past it is just crazy. From nothing we had something. She accepted me for who I was. Not for nothing we had some fights already.

2018

Around May we got our first apartment and we were so excited for it. I didnt believe this was happening. We loved each other so much that we wanted to do it. But at the same time things did slow down once we were here. I didnt have a reason to go out anymore. I started to become my oldself.  ithought everything will be fine without any afford. I was wrong. When we lived with my mom we wanted to be outside so nobody bothered us. Here things got worse. We had many fights, many moments where we thought its over. But we were still together, somehow. My girlfriend was the one holding everything in one peace. I was getting too comfortable by not doing anything. We again went twice for vacations. Also another shorter trips.
You have to undesrtand that she was loving person. She loved her family that I could see it through her actions and words. She was abused as a child. Her grandma rasied her when her mom abused her. Thats why we somehow connected. We both had issues.

2019 Beginning of the end

Around vacation time my girlfriend's grandmother started to have issues with her health. She was the one that raised her and she had so much love for her. She didnt know at the time she will have to take care of her for months. Thats where also religion played bigger role. Her family members are Jehovah Witness and she never believed into that. She was abused because of religion. But at one day it all changed when her grandma had heart attack while being in her arms. She said it was this day when she prayed and she feels like God listened to her. She told me she still loves me but is not in love with me. I did so many things wrong during our relationship that it got to the point she had enough. And i agree with it. Even if it hurts. To this day I have in front of my eyes all messed up things that i did. Every time i said no to something. It hurts so much. I beat myself for it.

In last months I cried so much. I was broken to peaces, i would drink a lot ( im not anymore ), im still depressed, im just a broken human. She was the one I was waiting my whole life for. And just like that its all gone. I couldn't be on higher level to make things greater. I wasnt thinking outside the box.

From having the best human being by my side I was left alone in my apartment. I dont understand any of that. I dont have any energy to be alive. If i had a switch that could turn my life off I would do it. I experienced so much of bad stuff that I dont know when it ends. There is nothing good about my life. I suffer on every step that I make.


Please explain to me what is wrong with me, am I autistic? Do i have a brain damage? What do I do about this life? I am not heading anywhere. If you have any questions please do ask. I have nothing to lose anymore...
Personally  I dont believe in any therapy at this point. Maybe meds, yes.
She told me many times that i was different when i was drunk and you know what, I agree with it. I was somehow opened more, I still feel like I am. Alcohol makes me talk more and be more brave but I cant be on it all time. Is there any meds that could solve this problems? To me, the biggest problem in my eyes is not being able to think, talk. I feel like when someone talks to me about anything there is nothing inside my head to respond. Its so sad. I lost so much because of that. Please any feedback appreciated. Any comments why I am living this life. Just anything.
Im in so much emotional pain, i miss so much life that i had with her for 2 years. Its difficult to put it into words how this whole situation put me down. As a human. I dont have anyone that could help me. Could understand me. She has many issues with her family to deal with. She cant deal with what im going throug."
1583,"I've been in therapy for 7 months and I somehow feel worse - more hollow, less whole.

I have plans to stop eating once I am deemed healthy enough. I can start over and not tell anyone this time round.

I've discovered that pretence at least stops others from worrying so much. If I take care of myself and act normally, then I'm fine, right? I hope they think that.

One day I'll run away, forever. Under a pine, I'll curl up into a small, tight ball and hug myself until cold and hunger doesn't bother me. I'll be with nature. Life will be on pause forever."
1584,"I am crying, not silent, but like a river spreading all over ... It is extremely heavy to cope with all the isolation in this corona time. I know I'm not the only one, but this day it is me who cannot cope, who need online support. 

I'm trying and trying, really clever, what else is there to do,  .... So one day one cannot take it anymore ...

So it is for me today, I know that when this crying has calmed down, I will look into my toolbox and continue the cleverness and try to survive, but how long will it last?

I needed to tell somewhere in hope of support ...

(I have a therapist to call if needed. My medication works well, but they are not supposed to cure loneliness or other trouble. I do not want advice, just human support that it is OK to have a day out of control). ☮"
1585,"I feel like my mind is black sludge, I feel numb and empty and horribly restless. Just passing the time until I can go to bed and hope to block out the day and escape from my mind for a few hours. I don;t want to be here anymore. Something is holding me back from taking my life but I don;t know what. I think I need to get my affairs in order and write my notes. The time is coming soon, I can';t stand it anymore, nor the guilt. The longer I'm here the more harm I cause. Does anyone else feel like there's something horrible inside their head? I think my best description is black sludge, or black oil slopping around. I can't even cry anymore, there's no tears left."
1586,"I just got dumped by my LDRS girlfriend. We had an argument 3 weeks ago and she cut me off completely. It was her fault but then I mentioned about her ex during the argument that ""You don't care about me as much as you did to your ex"". She got mad and hung up. I couldn't contact her till now. Since we are having LDRS, I tried my best to make her happy and available 24/7 but there is no back and forth for me. She wasn't even into me. Is it possible she is having someone else? We are in committed relationship. She said she need a break but I can't help it I miss her so much and ended up sending alot of text message that how much I want to be okay with her back but she doesn't care at all. All she was telling me is leave me alone and I want to stay alone. I dun want to date with yet. What is ""yet"". Is she breaking up with me or not. Mman.... I am driving crazy.. I can't concentrate on my study.. games and reading. I want to be in peace. I want to get over her."
1587,"Had a good week but can feel myself slipping now. Hope it doesn’t last. 
much love to y’all out there"
1588,"So, here's the thing. I've been urged by my friends to sit down and type out some sort of cohesive framework to my thoughts and problems, but, for reasons that I hope will become clear, I haven't - not in full. Not for months. I have little hope of any clarity or coherence here and I apologise in advance for what will almost certainly be a mess of a post, if I even end up pressing the post thread button. So. Sorry.

I turn 30 this year and I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was 16. That's half my life with a crappy black shadow hanging over my head. Tried to kill myself four times. Damn near succeeded on one of those occasions. It took me until I was 22 before I tried any medication and I've been through all the major SSRIs with no results. Sertraline did nothing. Fluoxetine made me a zombie, which is the closest to successful, I guess - if I wasn't feeling much of anything at all I wasn't that depressed. But that's a 9 month window that disappeared in a druggy haze. Citalopram, the latest, drove my anxiety through the roof, and I've not been off it that long so it may explain a thing or two. Maybe. I'm currently fighting to try bupropion, though in the UK it's only prescribed for quitting smoking of all things.

This would be all and well if I believed for a moment that depression were the cause of my problems, but I think it's just a symptom. It took me a long time - years - to reach a moment of clarity, but there was a moment at the end of last year when I realised that, at some point, I had given up all my goals and dreams. I no longer did anything I was interested in. No longer read books, painted, wrote... just sat around playing games with friends and being miserably unemployed. I remember having goals and working towards them but while I was willing at the time to blame depression and circumstance for failing to achieve them I've analysed (in great, sleepless depth) my past and current behaviour and there's something a lot less logical than that at foot.

I procrastinate. Constantly. And not just procrastinating things I don't want to do, but things I genuinely do, until all desire to do so has faded. Motivation has little power over me. Discipline, a little more, but as soon as I intend to do something, there is an INSTANT cognitive switch that takes the task at hand, shoves it back and says ""hey, yeah, this isn't important, you can do this tomorrow."" Tomorrow, of course, never happens. I've been aware of doing this for a while but wallowed in self-loathing, labelling it as laziness and lack of motivation, until I came across a truly excellent TED talk on procrastination by Tim Urban. If you're interested, give it a google; it simultaneously broke me and lifted me up, because, after years of feeling completely alone and despondent, feeling that I was self-sabotaging without rhyme or reason, I'd found someone who was talking about my exact behaviour. I am what he would describe as an archetypal 'disastinator', someone who doesn't ever get anything done because their circumstance and personality have left them in a catastrophic limbo. The part that broke me was that, while I believe I have found an answer, I haven't found a solution. I'll drop a little quote from his talk here:

"" If you Google “how to stop procrastinating,” you’ll find about 1,000 articles, all offering terrific advice on how to do it. The problem is that the articles are always written for sane people, and procrastinators aren’t sane people. Being insane, procrastinators are always under the delusion that they’re sane, so they read an advice article and think they’ll be able to apply it to their life. But then it doesn’t work out that way.""

I am not in control of my life. I have lost all motivation and all drive because any that I can muster is immediately diverted. To get anything done - ANYTHING - is exhausting, because I'm fighting with myself and usually losing. I know exactly what I need to do - find the right medication, find fulfilling work (or any work at all at this point, but jobhunting is a surefire way to send myself into a depressive spiral), gain confidence - but every attempt to push myself in the right direction inevitably ends up spiralling somewhere else. I hate it. It feels like a battle lost before the first shot is fired.

I've talked about it in passing with friends and they've all offered kind words and advice of things I could do which is all very well and supportive but my problem isn't in the not knowing of what to do but the DOING. I am, by nature, deeply rational and introspective but this isn't something that can be rationalised.

If I'm quite honest I don't know how to wrap this post up, except by asking... has anyone else felt this way? Has anyone beaten this? And... how? Because I can't find a way."
1589,"Hello
I was wondering if anyone has experienced the following and if you know how long it can take to stop or how to help the symptoms. 
I have take citalopram for 4 years and in September I started reducing my dose from 40 and I have now stopped altogether. This is what I wanted personally. I also took time to reduce my dose as per my doctor's advice. 
However, since I have stopped I have felt pretty bad. I am experiencing weird feelings in my lips and my eyes don't catch up with my head. I feel very moody and go to feeling extreme anxiety very quickly. I also feel like I could sleep anytime. I also feel like Im going to get a bad cold or flu. Extreme dreams also. 
Is this normal and can I expect it to last a long time? 
Thank you kindly"
1590,"My family is religious. I also used to be, but I think I'm not anymore. I feel like I need to tell them, but I'm afraid. The religion affects our daily life, the way we make our decisions and also our thoughts on health problems (why we get sick). Actual medical treatment isn't replaced, but mixed with the religious treatment ways (which sometimes have a higher priority). I got a physiological trauma since I realized I can't believe anymore (more than 2 weeks ago). It was very disappointing, because I used to believe into the religion since my very early childhood and now it's all ruined. I used to manage to deal with all that somehow, but now I can't even do my daily stuff and sleep properly anymore. I feel like I must tell the family about my depression and the reasons, but I'm not sure what that will lead to. We really matter to each other and the family loves me, I know that for sure. Currently I'm sick with an uncommon (for me) digestion illness and my mom is really worried about me. She's probably suffering even more than I do rn. The family knows about my mood as well, but I haven't yet made them aware of the reasons. I think the digestion illness started because of my significant stress and therefore can't be defeated until I feel normal. I tried a lot of stuff to calm down, but it didn't really seem to be effective against my depression. I had a talk with my mom in the beggining of the whole thing and I claimed that I still do believe. She then told me that she would still accept me if I told her that I don't believe anymore. However, I still think that the changes will be massive for all of us when I reveal the truth. I recently became adult, but I don't want to break up with my family, nor to lie to it. Please, help me to settle down and give some advices."
1591,"Frustrating isn't it?

Life is hard. The economy's screwed. Hope is bullshit. Everything's fucked.

The only way to deal with pessimism is to toughen up. Work your ass off and endure and push through the pain. Endure the pain as is and forget lesseningvthe pain. I was taught that lessing the pain by enjoying yourself is a sign of weakness.

And the people who say this shit are right.

This mindset ain't healthy. It can fuck a person up. Mentally and phsycally. Sucking up the pain rather than lessening it can bring psychological harm. And it brings physical harm.

But so what? My life is so hopeless and difficult that I have no choice but to work hard to survive and suck up the pain. I can't do what I wanna do. No way!

Not only that, everyone goes through this shit. I wonder if they go through the same pain as I do."

It's okay to not be okay, but I'm in a state of depression that I just don't know how it'll end because quite frankly I feel compromised on every level. I'm struggling to find joy in anything, it's severe overthinking that just consumes my over all thinking. I just want this to end but I don't know how to do it.

1595,"Hi everyone! I want to dedicate this thread to feeling alone in a seemingly careless universe. Every single one of us is after all a separate entity and thereby inherently isolated from everyone else. We can only bridge this gap through small acts of love and kindness. May this place bring us just that.

""We're born alone, we live alone, we die alone. Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we're not alone"""
1596,"Biofeedback is a sort of psychology treatment. It involves watching you systems at different points in thought like your blood pressure.
Your tailbone inside your body can give you biofeedback on your minds agreement with thought and outside things. When you agree with someone else's gestures by making or immitating those or similar gestures at the same time you agree with their tail bone wag and it gives you a weird feeling that you are with them on what they are saying. Feeling your tail bone wag doesn't always come out the balance system but dizzyness can occur from your tail wagging. When you are forced to learn something you get anxiety because your tail doesn't have a choice in the matter and it stiffens all your systems up.
When you get depressed and lonely then you feel pain in the heart region. You're heart sings out the ear whistling you hear and attaches into your balance system. The whistling sparks up when you are motivated to say something as your brain wants to stick up for you the one guy. but a lot of times our motivations turn to hazard, like starring at someone then not saying anything. Embarassment can be suffered pretty much by any form of love. People embarrass themselves trying to be funny and impress others out of desire from the heart to be loved. Once in this form you may be shunned for being funny which then turns back into anxiety and physical pain.
Falling in love with or being in close relations to voices is dangerous. You can't really trust what you hear them say. Just like pretending to taste something is a cure for anxiety it is also too a cure for strarting to believe in lies with voices, you can ask them if they are lying if your problems with them are severe like you believe they are your neighbors or friends talking down to you."
1597,"Does anyone have atypical depression?

  In atypical depression if good things happen it gets you out of the low mood.  In major depression even when good things happen, it doesn't change anything.   The problem with atypical depression is that the lows get too low.   I'm at one of those lows right now based on things going on.

1599,"Hi all,

I'm in a new relationship (5 months or so) with someone who is very very supportive and understanding, and we share so much with each other. In fact I've never felt able to be so open with someone I'm dating. I have depression with anxious tendencies, am on meds (citalopram) and have been through a course of interpersonal therapy, and he has occasional episodes of anxiety which I also try to support him through. 

Despite all this, i constantly feel like I'm a burden to him. I've been in a low period for a while now and while he has made me feel better in bad times, I feel like I am not able to be the positive and fun person i want to be when I'm around him. Far too often (considering I'm on meds) I have days when all I can think about is how useless I am and how it would be better for everyone if I just died - including thinking of ways in which I could commit suicide. Since we got together, my inadequacy as a girlfriend to him has been the focus of my negative thoughts. I'm always worried I text him too much and he is secretly thinking how annoying I am. I don't want to share these thoughts because I don't want him to worry he is making me worse, and I don't want him to feel forced to initiate contact with me just because he feels sorry for me. 

I'm aware of how lucky I am to have a partner who has been supportive of me but this only makes me feel worse. Does anyone have any ideas for dealing with these feelings? 

Thanks"

Annet

I wake up disappointed and disillusioned. Thoughts are racing through my mind. Did this really happen? How could she? You’d have to be ice cold to do something like that. To drop me like a brick. To cut me off like a cancerous lump. At the start I thought her a sign that the universe might not be cruel and uncaring after all. Now I am convinced that there is a demon somewhere laughing. Wanting to see me fade.

I have decided to give the owl shawl I bought for your birthday to my little sister. You don’t deserve it anymore in my opinion. At first I wanted to write a note: maybe we could have stayed friends in a parallel universe. <3 Joost. But I don’t believe in alternative timelines… I learned something as of late: ‘you got to stop watering dead plants’ Something I am not good at, but something I have to do. You only have ONE life. And apparently you do not want to share yours with mine. That is your choice, but then you have to deal with the consequences. 

Heartless, fucking heartless Annet! You shared your deepest feelings, fears and hurt with me. But apparently I did not get to know you at all! And then you could say: “Don’t be so childish’. Well… These sort of things destroy someone, or at least that’s what it does to me. I hope I die soon so I don’t have to deal with this bullshit any longer. “I can’t do anything about it… I just cannot see you as a friend” **inadequate moans**.

1604,"I've been feeling so depressed lately. I feel like i lost all hope in humanity. Everything is just pain and suffering, always. I wish we could just live peacefully, but will that ever be possible? History shows again and again that humanity has always been selfish and self destructive, and nothing ever gets better. I really can't deal with society's problems anymore. Life just seems bleak."
1605,"My parter has had a big depressive episode and has decided they no longer want to live together. We live in England and are still during lockedown which is causing more issues. She comes to me daily saying she is moving out, then she isn’t, then she will stay with her parents then she won’t, then she won’t move out then she will. I’m exhausted and scared that she will just one day turn round and not want me at some point. She blows hot and cold, all over me one minute then pushes me away the next. She says she doesn’t mean it. I’m emotionally and physically exhausted. We had so many plans together and if she moves out we’ll end up having at most a weekend relationship which in my mid 30s I really do not want. She is dead set on having her own space etc and I said I would support her decision but my head is such a mess right now. She doesn’t realise what it’s doing to me."
1606,"I'm sorry if this gets too long. If someone reads it all, I'll be forever thankful! I'll include a shorter, less detailed summary at the bottom.

I’m in a long distance relationship (we live in different countries) with my girlfriend since two years ago. She has struggled with mental health most of her life and currently has depression and an eating disorder.

About 5 months ago I noticed that her mental health started declining more and more. When quarantine started and she couldn’t go outside, lost her job etc, things got even worse. Lately things have been super bad, especially the past days. She says things like ”maybe I shouldn’t exist”, ”I should have disappeared”, ”I need to isolate, ”I feel so small, worthless and empty”. She lives with her parents and lately they have had to calm her down several nights. Yesterday she said she had an urge to kill herself but didn't act on it.

I’m so worried about her and go to bed every night with fear. I feel like there’s nothing I can do to help. I try so hard to talk to her, be there, listen etc, but she’s just pushing me away and saying she wants to isolate. She just said ”I’m gonna isolate, don’t even think about calling me”. A few weeks ago she said she wanted to isolate, and later admitted it was so that she could kill herself ”easier”.

Her thoughts can change very quickly. Earlier she texted me ”is there even any reason to live?” and I texted her a few I could think of. She said she realized how much I love her, started to cry and said ”I don’t want anything to happen to me”. One hour later she was saying suicidal things again. So whenever I manage to calm her down, it’s only temporary.

What do I do if talking to her isn’t enough and if she doesn’t wanna talk? I have her dad’s phone number and have been thinking about calling him. A problem though is that she has said that lately she’s afraid to tell me things because I’ve been reacting out of fear lately, saying that I need to call her dad/someone etc. She said she can’t sleep because she’s afraid I’m gonna send a cop or something to her house. I’m trying to be more calm now so that she’ll feel comfortable to talk to me again, but it’s not enough. What can I even do in this situation? What if I call her dad but things just go wrong? Her parents can be pretty ”special” and controlling. I’ll have to add that she’s +20 years old, so not a minor.

About two months ago she started having therapy sessions once a week (online bc of corona), before that she went less frequently. I’m really proud of her for going, but she seems really mentally unstable and things are just getting worse, doesn’t she need more help???

This is making me so anxious. I’m terrified of losing her and I feel like I need to act quickly before something happens to her.

I’m really sorry for the long text but my main questions are:

1. What can I do in this situation? (keep in mind that we live in different countries)
2. Is therapy once a week enough for someone in her state or does she most likely need more help??? What would the alternatives to therapy once a week be?


Quick summary: My girlfriend and I live in different countries and she struggles with depression and an eating disorder. Lately she has been acting super suicidal. I've tried to talk to her and showed her that I'm listening, but nothing seems enough and she just pushes me away and wants to isolate. I have her dad's phone number and have been thinking about calling him, but I'm very scared things might go wrong. What should I do? And is therapy once a week enough for someone in her mental state?"
1607,I had a few descent days and unfortunately I'm feeling lousy again. The last couple nights I haven't been able to sleep well. Usually I can sleep better than this. I've tried everything to help my mood too. Seems like I just feel bad again.
1608,Just want to talk
1609,"Does emotional numbness make you detach yourself from other people and not ""miss"" them or make you annoyed by them?"
1610,"Hello,

My friend has depression and problems with sleeping.
She either gets 4-5 hours of sleep or no sleep at all sometimes.
She tried to do physical activity like biking for almost half a day, fully exhausting herself but still her sleep is bad.
This has been going since July 2019 and because of lack of sleep she is constantly tired and in bad mental condition.

Anyone here has similar issues?

These are the medications that she takes:

- Zopiclone
- Seroquel (Quetiapine) 500mg
- Oxazepam

What if one of medications affects her sleep negatively?

I was thinking that supplements like these could help her but what if they will conflict with her medications?

- 5-HTP (5 Hydroxy-Tryptophan)
- L-Lysine
- L-Theanine

Thanks."
1611,"It’s me, and thanks for all the support the members on here have shown me. 

Everything’s getting worse. Always worse. Never better. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. Everything I do there’s something negative attached in some way, some negative consequence. I feel about half the person I was once. Joy may come in my life but never lasts longer then a minute. I don’t have motivation to do anything. Everything seems so pointless and purposeless. I’m utterly drained. Doing simple things takes a lot of effort. Interacting with people is extremely difficult. I’m constantly feeling very down and anxious. I need life."
1612,"I'm nearly 24 year old right now. But when I was 11, I had a 7 months living hell. Somehow, I was completely sure that my friend has died even though she didn't. I felt grief, cry every day, I was depressed because ""she died"" but it was all in my head  Everyone had been telling me that she is well, alive and even showed me photos of her in that moment (I haven't been seeing her for a while that year) but nothing changed my belief. These 7 months were living hell for me, I cried every day, became numb. Cried when someone mentioned her. Somehow, in one moment after 7 months, it all stopped and i finally accepted that she is there, alive. I still don't know how. I know it was 13 years ago but I feel I have changed from that period of my life. Later (at 16) i had different sorts of delusions but right now I'm feeling alright. Do you think that it was but psychotic/delusional? I'm afraid that something like that can happen again. Thank you"
1613,"I’m in my last year of uni, I’ve been in a bit of a bad depression since sometime during last summer.

1618,"How do I get back on track after a set back?  For years I coped with depression and anxiety using coping skills.  But over the years with so many hard issues, it felt like it came crashing down in one day.  I feel like the lights were on one day, and out the next, and I have no idea how to cope.  I feel like i lost everything, my family, my friends, my interests...there's nothing left.  This has taken everything away from me."
1619,"years pass by and there is always a hole inside me. I make friends too eagerly, sometimes ignoring my social anxiety trying to give me a meltdown, or the mental exhaustion I get when I'm around people for too long. I cling to them carefully so they won't think I'm annoying yet at the same time desperately because I have no sense of worth without someone as a judge. 
I'm so tired and lonely. I grow tired of receiving social events and conversations. I push people away and worry too much about the ones I care about. because I always care about them and how they see me more than they do. I try to please, to be kind and patient and understanding. but somehow I am not enough and at the end of the day I am still alone. I'm so tired."

1623,"In the past years I've cut my drink down alot. Use to drink 2 or 3 times a week it was somewhat fun but over the year my body started rejecting it with horrible just horrible hangovers with jitteryness, anxiety, feeling like I'm going to die!  I remember being 19 and my friends hangover would shake off after an hour of waking up or they didn't even get hungover but me I'd be lucky to feel better by 5pm in the afternoon! I have drank in a long talk decided to try it last night but I feel I'll today, I almost went to the ER. Tried to throw up to see if it would help but only a little relief. My throat is burning from the stomach acid. I feel deeply depression and every single time that I drink now a days I'll need to take atleast 4 mg of Ativan right in the morning to stop these super unusually seizure like symptoms. Light headed, jittery head tremors, caffiegne also brings on these same symptoms. I barley drink but something about my body has changed and possably it could be IBS or leaky gut? I truly am in need of help ty"
1624,I’ve always had anxiety and I stress a lot about things. In 2018 I had some problems and started to feel very depressed. Last year it got worse and then at the beginning of this year I just couldn’t bare it anymore. I almost told my parents but I was just so tired that I thought it would cause only more stress. I’ve been dealing all by myself but sometimes it’s very hard. Talking helps a lot but I just don’t know what to do anymore and what will happen after this pandemic is over and how I’ll take control back in my life if I didn’t already have it before. If you’ve been through depression before what did you do when you just didn’t wish you should be here anymore.
1625,"I never liked how I looked. As a child I would try push and pull the skin of my face in certain direction in hope of it reforming my face.
There is nothing beautiful about me. My face, my body. Everything about me is disgusting and fucking ugly.
Yesterday I had an endoskopy where I needed to get half naked. I was so uncomfortable and nearly started to cry. If I had the chance, I would have harmed myself. Anything to do something against myself.
As a child I used to cry when I needed to undress for a doctors appointment. Even than I was ashamed of my body.
I will never be happy with this piece of shit body. It is just not enough. And I am forced to be myself for the rest of my life."
1626,"Does anyone else feel fine, then after something happens (which may be small) you feel like grim death again?

I am sick of it. I have been feeling better, mostly, for the past month or so, but every now and then there's a lull. I had one last night and now I am so down. I feel so anxious whenever I do something and if I get a non-positive response from something or someone I cave in. Those horrid thoughts come back and make everything a misery. I feel useless. I think I am useless. I have no motivation, other than to lounge, overthink and feel like crying.

I fantasise about dying, but not through suicide, when I feel like this. I can't do that, the thought makes me shudder and I know I'd be depriving my loved ones of myself. Instead, I fantasise about being murdered, because I get to die, I am not the one responsible for it and I think I enjoy the humiliation of it since I have such low opinions of myself during these times. Through asphyxiation, usually, and always by the opposite sex for some reason. Also, I fantasise about being shrunk, eaten and then digested by the opposite sex. I apologise if this freaks people out, but it's how I feel.

I know this is weird and warped, but it's the only way I can feel some form of contentedness when I am like this. I feel like I am worthless and a failure, that no-one really likes me, so it's escapism. It feels like the ultimate meditation to me, as my life and the worries in it become meaningless and I lose my life. The pain doesn't bother me; in fact I like thinking of being in horrible pain because of the actions of the other person. I like thinking of the thoughts going through their head as they kill me, knowing their actions are causing me pain and the thoughts when I do die. I like thinking of them experiencing sparks of adrenaline when they realise I am dead and they caused it. I realise it's screwed up, but I think my brain escapes this constant barrage of information it gives myself through manifesting the self-loathing I feel onto others. Like I deserve to be treated like that, so someone doing so is pleasing to me.

I fantasise about my friends doing this. I have a female housemate who I get on well with, who's not in the same house as me right now due to being elsewhere since the coronavirus lockdown, and I like to imagine her killing me when she gets back. Every now and then I feel like caving in and exposing my secrets, but I don't and don't want to, because I realise that this is a lot and I don't want to ruin friendships through making others uncomfortable. I trust my close friends, they wouldn't share such sensitive information, but I don't want to impact it on a personal level.

However, it's eating me up inside and I am scared to divulge. I have CBT coming up soon, and I keep telling myself I should tell them about this when it occurs. I still feel shame and worry that they would judge me for this. I realise it's not normal, I realise it would freak many out, so I bottle it up. The sadness eats me up inside. The worst thing is that I feel like I would actually like being murdered in this scenario. It's the feelings of uselessness and self-loathing which get me feeling so bad and then I think about this as a result, and it makes me feel happy. I imagine looking into the eyes of my would-be killer and feeling thankful that they're putting me out of this misery and treating me like the sack of dirt I feel like I am.

I must stress that this is only when I am feeling bad. For the most part I have been ok recently, and coping with my anxieties when I am in a good mood is getting easier on the whole. The issue is when something does happen that triggers my anxieties. If something goes wrong, sometimes small, that confirms my anxieties I get overwhelmed by emotions and thoughts saying that I should have known my anxiety was right and attacking myself for decisions made. This overwhelms me and I am down in the doldrums.

Like I say, I want this feeling of sadness to end, and the only ways which would please me is if someone does kill me or if I can get myself to stop thinking like this in times of sorrow. I realise the former would upset those close to me, so it is not really preferable. However, to combat this I keep thinking I need to be honest with myself and others when I seek therapy, and I worry that I am not confident enough to speak to others, including therapists, about this. I fear that they'd judge me and I would be embarrassed about these strange thoughts."
1627,Why can't I care more about my hobbies? It just all seems so pointless and unengaging... Sometimes I'd rather lay in bed with my eyes closed just letting my mind roam freely pondering over whatever thoughts pop up in my head. But then again even that gets a bit tiresome after a while
1628,"Evening All, 

I'm new to the forum, so forgive me if I am posting much of the same.. I find it therapeutically putting things in writing than speaking the words.

I have suffered with depression for years and probably as most people during the pandemic, I have had issues amplified ten fold. I don't feel suicidal, but do have a sense of 'not wanting to be here', but no feelings of self harm. 

I have been through a lot since child hood, I have lost close family members, seen horrific fighting in the family which literally had traumatised me. All this built up and I need to try and get to the bottom of things and express my feelings.. For years I had seen a therapist and not once did I tell them about issues growing up, because I physically could not get the words out. 

Every day I am eaten away with flash backs and bad memories.. It has left me isolated and lonely over the years.. I just need help and advise to be able to physically say, I have mental health issues and I need help."
1629,I was feeling somewhat better and keeping busy over the last couple days. My mood was a little better and I wasn't as anxious feeling. Then today I wake up earlier feeling anxious again. Hopefully the day gets better.
1630,I feel so depressed today
1631,"Hello lads. It's currently 4 am where I am, and I am lying awake. Not that this is particularly unusual for me. However this time I decided to get up from bed and type out what is bothering me. A bit about myself: I am 24 years old, 25 in a month, and I have been battling fears and anxiety for most of my life, with this awful depression being the latest installment, since about two or three years. I have come to notice that one of the most prominent 'issues' in my situation is the rapid passing of time. I know time is supposed to seem like it passes a bit quicker as you get older, but for me it feels like the years are passing abnormally quickly. Especially the last five years have seem to have vanished for me, I barely have any memories of them and to be honest, this scares me. I never had a relationship, never have found a job that challenges me, a job that really fits me. I am still living at home and I can barely make ends meet right now. I am still trying to work on myself, and fix some of the problems. I haven't smoked in a few days, and I used to be a heavy smoker! That much is good, but it feels like I can't relax, because of this time issue. The urge to fix the whole mess that is my life seems to be under pressure of time. I can feel every second of my life ticking away, and I am just desperately looking for a way to snap out of it. It seems to be caused by me being mentally unavailable for most of the time, as if I am in sort of a trance. I tried focussing on the date each morning, but it turned out that the last time I did this was a month ago. Somehow I have completely forgotten about it in the meanwhile. My biggest fear is that my entire youth will be robbed by time, leaving me nothing then bad memories of my 20s for the rest of my life, and I was not planning on letting my depression crush me in this way. I think it might be useful to note that I have no history of depression meds, and that I am not currently seeing a therapist, though I've seen a few in the last years that sadly could not help me.

Sorry if this whole post is a bit disorganized and written rather rapidly, it is 4 am after all.

To not end this post on a completely depressing note, I think I would be an excellent watch & clock salesman because of my obsession with time! Cheers!"
1632,in bed all day everyday and sleeping well it never right
1633,"The bad days are getting worse and more often. This shits exhausting, sometimes I feel like I can’t do this anymore. I know the bad days end at some point but fuck when. I’m really trying to sort my shit out but it’s like I’m running in circles. I’m seeing a counsellor, on antidepressants, trying to stay healthy and exercise everyday but still feel like everything’s collapsing.

1634,"How long have you been depressed, do you know what triggered it and what drug if any helps you."
1635,"Hi guys,

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I posted this in the depression forum, I'm unaware if this fits in here or not however I am on antidepressants and have been for over a year now due to my overwhelming feelings.

I've been in a relationship with my partner for over 2 years now and I would say on the whole even though we've had a few blips and I've had personal things to deal with we were pretty solid, at least I thought so.

We're from two different cultures however that never really affected us during the time of us being together, apart from me feeling threatened and undermined infront of other women from his culture.

Sadly, his mum passed away recently and it was completely out the blue. She was back in his home country while he was living here in the UK and hadn't seen her for years. It was a friend of his that phoned me and told me the night they phoned out however asked me not to say anything as he wanted to come round and tell him face to face himself. 

The next morning, a squad of around 10 of his friends came into our tiny cramped flat to break the news. Obviously, he was devastated and shocked. I was trying to be there for him as much as I could but it was really hard with all his friends there and people just kept coming and coming into the flat. It became quite overwhelming for me personally as there was all these men in our house that I hardly knew, speaking another language and of course during lockdown I just didn't feel comfortable with it. The flat belongs to him, but I furnished the place and we lived there together with our little kitten (who was also traumatised by the amount of people coming and going.)

As part of the culture and as the only woman in the house, I was expected to make loads of food, endless cups of tea and just when you thought you could sit down - more people just kept coming. His friends kept coming up to me saying 'oh we need another dish' or 'we're running out of glasses'. It was just too much! I know it seems to minor but for me personally at some points I got so anxious and wound up I couldn't catch a breath. I wasn't eating myself, my back was aching from being on my feet from around 9am and they didn't leave until around 2am the next morning. And this was just one of the days! When I thought this was over, they come strolling in the next morning at the same time (the ones that never stayed over) and this went on for around 4-5 days.

Like I said, I know it sounds minor, but as much as I have always respected his culture and friends and family, I just felt really singled out. And I know it's not about me, my partner has just lost his mum - I totally get that, however I wanted to be there for him and I wanted him to... need me? I don't know. Pathetic maybe. It was only a few weeks ago I lost my mum's mum and it was awful as we were so close to her, she just dropped of a heart attack, however all I wanted to do was be with my partner who I knew was there for me - not half of the town.

Despite me making loads of food and slaving away in the kitchen for days, women from the community and part of his culture started coming in with dishes and home made bread and whatever and it just made me feel really... self conscious and worthless. As the only one who drives and has a car, they kept asking me to go pick up more of this 'home made' bread from a house on the other side of town. At this point I just cracked... I said I can't take this anymore, this is just too overwhelming and I don't even know who I am anymore, I wasn't even being introduced to all these strangers coming into my house. One of his friends told me that a stranger said 'have you seen his white girlfriend?' I just broke down after hearing this. I was really angry and felt betrayed. I was doing my best trying to obide by their customs and trying my best to make all the food they would expect on an occasion like this but I felt like a piece of dirt.

I since then have had to move back to my mums and things are just so tense and difficult at home with my mum saying 'I told you so' or 'you need to get yourself sorted' and I just can't pick myself up. I'm hardly eating and having a drink to calm my nerves every evening. I've only heard from my partner once since I left over a week ago... he hasn't called, texted and I just... I just don't know. I tried to speak to him about the situation and how I felt before I left but he wasn't having any of it. I guess he's got his own sh*t to deal with now.

But what do I do now? I feel so worthless..."
1636,"I try to have healthy sleep routine, eat at almost fixed times, do physical exercises,- relaxation exercises and try to get some fresh air every day. (Normally I meet other people. Miss that in these Corona-times). Affirmations are helpful when they are true and I really need them.

For preventing I have thought myself to watch different feelings, sensations or thoughts that can be the beginning of a deeper depression. When I am able to recognize them, I use some sort of a mindfulness skill to get back into the ""good position"" or use distraction skills sometimes.

It has taken me a long time to develop both the healthy routines and to be able to recognize inner ""predicting states"".

:grouphug:"
1637,"Hi. I'm struggling right now or I wouldn't be here. I don't enjoy opening up. Even though it feels therapeutic in the moment, I feel shame afterwards and often worse for tearing off the band aid to expose the ugly wounds below. I'm sorry if I'm too open or if I go the other direction and feel an urge to destroy all evidence of this series of posts.

It will be a series of posts rather than one. I'm going to lay out my life, from beginning to end, since I think everything follows on from the things before. I'm not sure I can write very well now, and I'm fairly certain the tone will betray my current anguish, but we'll see how it goes.

I'm not after hugs or any words or anything like that. I just have that feeling bubbling away inside me and need to externalise the internal to feel some release. A lot of my feelings concerning myself won't be kind. It will all be very self-involved. But I'll be honest.

So....first entry on what will be the story of how I got to my present situation. 

My first conditioning was very early. My Granddad died when I was about 3 and my Dad entered a long depression. He would just sit in his chair and stare at the tv all night, silently. My parents marriage suffered thereafter and my Mum had her depression issues too, often retreating to bed. The early childhood I remember was one of being told to keep quiet and was very sad. It wasn't a place to be happy.

When I reached school I noticed I was different (or was told so). I was quieter, had a bit of a flat affect, and wasn't very popular. Early on I believed that acquiring knowledge was of great use and enjoyed learning but I hated the social side of it all. As I aged the disparity between me and the rest grew.

That will do for a start. I need to sleep if I can."
1638,Everyday I wake up with anxiety and feeling down.Then by evening I usually feel more relaxed. The voices/sounds falling asleep are bothersome. I thinks that's what's making me feel anxious. I even went and had another mental health assessment. I asked about depression and they weren't sure. They suggested counseling and visiting my PCP.
1639,"After going through a long period of depression this is what I learnt about considering your time when treating it.

1. Depression is an emotional pain which can be seen by low moods.
2. To get out of pain people go to things they trust to be their solution and we want to get out of pain quickly
3. These things they trust, if chosen wisely, are normally things that are established and thus have had a lot of time built into it. Why? because established things are the labour of a lot effort and that takes time. Something established and trusted demonstrates quality and thus certainty, safety (hopefully)
4. You can compare this to a secure building sheltering you from a painful storm

I have a question on the above points.

How can I apply the above to help with depression, anxiety and any other pain I am in?"
1640,"Everything was going fine, even perfect I was finally happy after a long time and now it comes back again.
I feel I am so alone and so pathetic by fighting against my own thoughts and I don't want to admit I need help. I have no idea who am i and what am I supposed to do here, I feel like it's too late for everything and time scares me so much I wish I could be a child again and moreover my birthday is in less than a month and I hate to see it happen.
I will never accomplish something great in my whole life I know it. And I even started feeling lonely, something I've never felt before since I appreciate my own company and enjoy being by myself.
I can even feel fictional characters judgement upon me, I imagine them making fun of me every time I cry or do/think something stupid, I am sure they think I am weak and useless because my ""pain"" is stupid and worthless next to real physical pain or other.
I just wish I could die already, every day is a pain again and I can't stand it anymore it's been like that for years it comes back again. I just wish I could have a sign or something like that to keep on living, I feel like even God doesn't care about my poor person.
I don't know why I'm alive.
Thank you for reading, I hope you'll have a greater life than I'll ever do"

Would love to hear experiences of if anyone has went off it after being on it it for 6 mos and how did it go?
1643,"I have met two people in the last week who have said that a person can't be 'that' depressed if they are doing basic stuff every day like getting out of bed, getting dressed, maybe going to work, looking after their child etc.

That makes me doubt my own depression. It took me ages to accept I have depression. But these opinions make me question it. But at the same time, these opinions make me quite angry because when i was in the worst stage of my illness this is what i was like:

I was single, had a full time job and lived alone in a privately rented flat. I had no-one to depend on but myself. In my mind, if i lost my employment, i would lose my income and then my flat and then I would become homeless. So continuing to work was extremely important.

I found it soooo difficult to get out of bed in the morning. So, I obtained 5 or 6 alarm clocks and placed them all around my bedroom set for different times. So the racket of the alarms would force me out of bed.

Then once i got out of the bed, I told myself that all i have to do is go through the motions of getting ready for work. But i promised myself that once i was ready i didn't have to actually go to work...i just had to go through the routine of getting ready...then i could make the decision to either go or get back in to bed.

I didn't have the energy to stand up in the shower. So every morning i ran a hot bath and plonked myself in to it. Watched the clock and then pulled myself out of the bath and got dressed. I put make-up on, because i've been doing that my whole life, so its not difficult. I scarped my hair back into a pony tail.

Because i was ready for work, i told myself, all i have to do now is step out of the front door and put one foot infront of the other in the direction of work. I felt a sense of sorrow and dread. I didn't want to go but i knew i had to....i had to hold on to normality....and if i didnt go i would be doomed! 

As i walked along the street, i looked carefully at other people passing me by, people who were also on their way to work. I believed that all the people i walked past were having the same feelings as me. I told myself ""Nobody wants to go to work. Its just what we have to do. Look at all these people im passing - im sure they would all prefer to be at home in bed. But we have to go to work. Im not the only one going through this. This is normal everyone feels the same as me"". So i continued putting one foot infront of the others and eventually arrived at work.

Work would always be rubbish. I worked with a bunch of bitches who were like vultures around a vulnerable person and i started getting bullied. Think 'Mean Girls'. I would frequently burst in to tears or get into big arguments with people at work. One afternoon, i randomly started crying for no particular reason. This time, i just couldn't stop crying. I ended up sobbing uncontrollably. My supervisor said ""You may aswell go home because you are no use to us in this state!"" 

That evening i felt 100% suicidal. I took an OD and spent a few days in hospital. I was off sick from work for nearly 5 months. 

This was a few years ago and im alot better now.

I just don't really understand the logic that because i was getting up and going to work everyday, some people thaink i wasn't depressed.....and even if i was depressed...it certainly wasn't severe.


...oh, and i was also having persecutory delusions, but the nature of such delusions generally mean that you don't tell anyone, because at the time you believe the delusions are real and the delusions convince you that its best not to tell anyone...if that makes sense?!

So i reckon you can have quite severe depressipn but continue functioning. But not everyone thinks that. Please dont feel obliged to comment. Im used to just expressing myself on here and not getting much response. Thats ok."
1644,"I used to be into self-help gurus and one, in particular, kept saying ""I was creating chaos for myself until..."" And you can figure out the rest, they wrote a book and made the bank. What's missing? Well, I certainly am not wealthy nor am I good at stringing lie upon lie into a cheesy love manifesto. I'm not going to lie and say that self-help books haven't helped, but only a few could reach me. I personally think the book ""The Secret"" is bullcrap. As someone with a mental disorder and perfectionist tendencies, the methods of most self-help books just antagonize my mental traps. I believe all it does is promote self-blame and disappointment to one's psyche. I wish I knew a healthier route to positivity rather than fall back into bad habits. Does anyone else feel this way because self-help is a breeding ground for frauds and kooks alike?"
1645,"Knowing that I won't ever do good makes me more depressed. 
I wish I had a life where I could do the ""self care"" and treat myself nicely to deal with depression instead it just keeps making my life worse? 
Like I'm not in a great environment and if I don't move out quick it'll possibly permanently destroy my life 
And it's so scary 
I hate when people say ""take it one moment at a time"" or ""do a small good thing daily"" 

I'm not saying it's a bad advice 
But it's just not helpful when you wake uo everyday worrying about living an awful life which is controlled my other people and they'll simply force you to do every thing unless you move out and become self independent. Which is hard enough because I can't make myself study to be able to move out for college. 

This will sound so so so shallow but 
I hate knowing I had potential 
I was the best student always 
Both in academics and art activities. 
And here I am 
Failing and with no hobbies. 

It makes me angry that people around me have failed me. 
My parents who refuse to help me and keep blaming me for everything. 
My uncle who once inspired me to be a doctor... Refuse to take my depression seriously dispite being a doctor himself... It was the worst betrayal of all time when he didn't believed me. 
The counsellors I've secretly tried to reach out too 
The doctors I've snuck out to see 
My teachers who I asked for help. 
Every single person. 
Everyone just told me to ""suck it up"" ""it's fine life contains both good and bad moments"" 

Why do asian people freaking suck so much when it comes to understanding mental health and emotions. 
Dispite all of them wanting to be a doctor none of them have any freaking clue what it's about or how to even care for another human. 
All they care about is their abusive culture  and their god awful money and perfect lives. 

I honestly hate everyone around me from the depths of my heart. 

Yet I hate myself more"
1646,"Hi everyone, 

I am new to this so please bare with me.

I have been struggling with depression (knowingly) for about a year now. I have been with my current boyfriend for 2 and a half years and have been living together for about 7 months now. We are currently having some space a part because he told me I need to work on myself to get my confidence and self esteem back. 

My boyfriend has been great with the physical side of dealing with depression, in terms of getting counselling and forcing me to get my family involved. But, he does struggle to emotionally support me. I really think he struggles to open up and show his emotions. I don't know if he's like this because of his own upbringing (his mum suffers with depression too) but I just can't make sense of it all.

I am very much a sensitive person. I have always struggled with my confidence and my self esteem. I think it all started when I was with my first ever boyfriend and we got together in high school and I was with him for 5 years. We were always on and off and it wasn't a healthy relationship in the end. We finally went our separate ways when I saw him kissing another girl in his car - we weren't together but I took the hint that he moved on and I never spoke to him again. 
I took it hard and I felt I gave my everything to try and make it work but it still wasn't good enough and he still didn't want me. It put me in a really dark place and I remember having to go to work on a late shift (I worked in a supermarket) and while a colleague was speaking to me, all I could think about was getting in my car, drive somewhere and take packets and packets of paracetamol. 5 months after this, I met my current boyfriend. I personally don't think I had enough time to spend with myself and to learn to love myself again which I think has caused my depression to get worse. 

There have been many of times where I've just cried my eyes out and just needed a hug to help calm me down and he just hasn't bothered to ask me what is wrong. I bet he just thinks ""oh god, she's crying again?"" 
I also feel like I can't tell him if I ever feel suicidal because he just threatens to tell my family and I don't want them worrying. I feel like he gets angry whenever I cry because he's just so fed up with it. I honestly feel like he is just sick of me at this point and I don't know what to do. 

I think it has got too much for him and he tells me he feels trapped and suffocated with it all in his own home. I know he has got to think about his own mental health first and I should respect that. But I have a fear of being alone with myself because I can start to overthink things (I have currently moved back in with my family after having a depressive episode at his house - I know this is wrong during lockdown but it wasn't healthy for me being at his house). I only ever want to talk to him about my feelings because I don't have many close friends for me to open up but he finds this hard as he feels all the pressure is on him.

I have tried to get counselling. The first time I self referred myself to my local mental well-being hub, but I had to wait 5 months for a telephone conversation. 5 months later, I received a phone call and I hated it. I really struggled to tell a complete stranger without knowing what they look like my deep and darkest thoughts. There was just no rapport there. I struggled to explain as I was just holding back the tears the whole time. He suggested it was anxiety but I knew it was much deeper than that. This made me lose hope on getting help. My boyfriend pushed me to try and get more counselling a few months down the line. This time it was through my university. I got my introductory counselling session to help them understand why I needed it. However, this has been put on pause because of the coronavirus and my university closing down.

This is the first time I've wrote it all down for a stranger to read so I do apologise if it is messy. My depression has definitely got worse while being with my boyfriend and I can't make sense why. My judgement feels all cloudy. I love him but what do I do? How do I even love myself and get my confidence back when I'm always sad about being a part from him and on my own? 

I'm feel like I'm losing him."
1647,"I feel like I have no control over my life but if someone was looking at my life, they would see no reason why I wouldn’t have control. Little everyday tasks seem impossible. It’s like a big part of me wants to die and knows that if I screw up more and more, every problem no matter how small add up and make suicide more appealing.  I think about suicide multiple times a day, everyday for more than 10 years now (I’m about to be 29). I’m so accustomed to thinking about it where the ‘shock factor’ that people associate with actually killing your self is gone.

I really struggle with how I look physically. I’ve always been thin and have never wanted to be the typical macho guy, so I feel more comfortable being small (5’9” 125 lbs). Despite being ok with that, I feel worse everyday looking in a mirror. I have had issues with bulimia and fucked up my teeth to the point where my dentist won’t even see me anymore because she says fixing them is beyond the scope of her practice. I know she is only doing that because she thinks it’s in my best interest but that killed me when she said that recently. She’s the only person that I’ve told about how I fucked up my teeth. I had really nice teeth and now I try not to open my mouth around people.

I also used to have thick hair and it’s been thinning to where I’ll start crying if I think about it for as little as 5 minutes. It’s just getting worse and if I m hate how I look now, I’m just going to hate myself more which is another nail in my coffin.

I’ve always been an introvert, but I’m very lonely, but it’s my fault. I tend to be really private and It’s not that people ever disliked me, but I don’t like myself so I push people away subconsciously. Because of that I never really fit in with a specific group, but I also never felt like people felt that I didn’t fit in if that makes sense. I’m liked at my job and they think I’m funny, helpful, and nice, but it doesn’t help my self esteem at all.
I always hoped things would eventually get better after high school, then it got worse and hoped it would get better after college, but again it got worse, so I hoped it would get better after working as what I went to school for. Now I’ve worked in that profession for about 7 years and I have achieved nothing that I have always wanted that I felt would make me happy. In terms of achieving goals, I’m in, at best, the exact same place as i was right after graduating college.

I have dug myself in such a deep hole that I know I can’t get out of myself, and I don’t have enough strength to get out even with help. No one can get me out unless they could pull me out 100%, but that’s not possible, so I struggle with maintaining hope for being happy.

This is all just a small piece of why I feel this way but for how long it’s taken me too write this much since joining, I’ll never finish if I try to write everything."
1648,"Today I feel tired, more depressed and a touch of anxiety. I don't need advice. I only need accept and understanding for that I have a difficult day today. :cry:"
1649,"After two weeks Pristiq withdrawal, I starting to become a zombie. So I took my med again on last month 1st and added zoloft on 28th until now, I feel my emotion is getting numb. And I don't want to do anything. I told my doctor 'lost emotion experience ' yesterday. He doesn't believe me. My family don't trust me too and just think I am thinking too much. No one trust me. I don't know can I back to normal. I am so afraid that I have got schizophrenia negative symptoms after withdrawal. I am so scare that I can't take care of myself in the future. Emotion numb is that the side effect?But my doctor said that all my symptoms are impossible, He thought that I said is on google wtf. Everyone don't trust me I am getting illness. Am I just thinking too much? I am hard to think about things. My life maybe done by here. I just 18 years old. I don't want to end here."
1650,"So I suffer with anxiety and depression anyway but due to recent events I feel like I’m completely drowning.

I worked as a housekeeper for a couple for a year. I basically ran their lives, travel arrangements, shopping, took care of their kids, nursed the wife after an operation. Anyway, they said due to the current pandemic I’m a luxury that they just can’t afford anymore and made me redundant two days ago. I had absolutely no warning that this was happening. The husband came and told me at 12 o clock and by 12:10 I was on my way home. The wife hasn’t spoken to me at all, not a goodbye, a text or email. Nothing. This has hit me so hard. I feel so lost and betrayed by how they handled it. I know everything is tough for everyone at the moment but they made me do a days work and then I was told ‘ok bye.’ I feel so hurt and I cannot seem to get over it. I am so deeply depressed and can not get out of this black hole. I’m hurting badly."
1651,"I have been severely depressed for the
Last 4 Weeks. My grandma passed
From a Brain aneurysm my
Mom and I flew out to Idaho to care for her while in mist of passing away.
Then on top of that my my good friend down the Road From me passed away and I was unableTo see her before she was cremated. My husband is a drunk so I deal with that on a Dailey basis and get emotional abused, I’m dumb, not Good enough, not small enough, I’m just not. I hate My self so much that, well I wish I was No longer in this life. I just got out of the
Psych unit for Suicidal idea and SI. They changed all my meds and I’m new to the new Ones and iam not emotional or Mentally stable for this change
I should have Still been in the unit.
But the unit I was in was Not helpful at

Ignore you. I do t know what
To do. I don’t feel like eating, I feel numb yet emotional. I do t know what
To do with my self. I
Just want to sleep through this
Tough part right now. Any
Coping mechanism would be nice anyway this
Is My ordeal and I’m struggling:nod2:"
1652,Has anybody tried acupuncture for depression? And if so was it any good?
1653,"I think I’m going through the worst bout of depression in my life. I barely leave my bed, except to shower. I’ve lost interest in pretty much everything I enjoy. I think I’ve become agoraphobic as well. I can barely take care of myself, and I barely put any effort into how I look anymore. I hate myself so much, I literally don’t know another person who hates themselves as much as i do. My life is worthless and I have no future. I wouldn’t wish mental illness on anybody. I wish it was as glamorous as they make it out on movies and tv shows. Just ugh."
1654,"After antidepressants withdrawal, i seem to be developing schizophrenia negative symptoms, my doctor said that I am not.
  Even I took pristiq for five weeks and added zoloft since 28th.Now my emotion is numb. I lost my motivation and my brain is nothing to think. I am so scare now. I ask my doctor, He said that I am not. But my symptoms getting worse. I will meet him 25th this month. My symptoms is that the side effect?"
1655,"Can I say that if you want to get control of your mind then you absolutely have to come into a better understanding of the 2 main types of consciousness states I.e. Autopilot and Manual.You will never get control of your mind until you do.The above 2 types of consciousness sit above thoughts....thoughts sit above emotions.You are not these consciousness states ,you only experience them, nor are you a thought or an emotion.Most people spend their whole lives on autopilot.Coming into a better awareness of the above consciousness states is the key,believe me.Its not a magical solution to all mental health issues but it is a step in the right direction.Once you know what the manual consciousness state is and you are back in synch with yourself you can then learn to train the mind and all the rubbish that goes on within it.You are not your mind either...you just have a mind."
1656,"It is too weird, when I think back to my past, I lost my feelings in my memory. Is that normal?On Pristiq 50mg five weeks and 50mg zoloft three weeks. Is that normal? They make my mind blank and nothing to think. Is that normal? I am so afraid."
1657,After pristiq withdrawal turn me to a zombie and last month 28th add zoloft until now my brain is empty...... I will become a intellectual disability......
1658,I feel so bad. I don't want to be here. Ive tried crisis teams none of them seem to take me seriously
1659,"The 18-24th May is Mental Health Awareness Week in the UK - and I'm sure that you are all aware of it :doh:.

But what about your local MP - is he/she doing anything to mark it?

If not, are you going to write to them and complain bitterly about that?

If not, why not?   Why so many questions - ""Cos I'm mad as hell and I ain't going to take this any more"", as the man once said."
1660,"I've been taking anti-depressants since October. They seemed to work to an extent but recently I felt like I did before I went on them, so I decided to come off them to see if it made a difference. I have felt oddly well in the last week and a half, I say oddly because I usually have some sadness and heaviness even on my better days but that has even lifted. 

The thing is, I know I'm going to feel sad again and it's like I'm waiting for that to happen because life makes more sense to me when I'm in that place. Sadness is familiar but this isn't and I don't know what to do with it, I don't understand it."
1661,"Just looking for some advice, 

Iv'e been getting feelings everyday now of not wanting to be here anymore not because its easier but because all the suffering would be put to an end. I really don't ever see myself getting better (iv'e tried counselling but didn't find it very helpful) and also been on different medications. I have a learning disability suffer from Depression and anxiety and really don't mix well with people which seems to be getting worse as i get older. I'm a very sensitive person who's just turned 25 but hardly have anything to show of it. I know this sounds like a woe is me kinda post and i know we are going through horrid times at present with the virus just wanted to see if anyone else has been in a similar position and can give me some hope. 

Thanks"
1662,"Hi guys, i have been away from the forum for several days, because i'm trying to find a job, and when i felt sad, to avoid what i call a crisis, (a high depressive state where i can't stop the suicidal thoughts), i workout or listen to music but sometimes can't control my head and started thinking on this and suggest myself to ask you guys your experience on the topic. 
Have you ever had trouble getting a job because they found out your depressive situation?"
1663,"Hi lovely people.

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to share my life story with you all and get feedback on how I could improve it etc it's okay if I can't?"
1664,I've been trying so hard to feel better and improve myself. I'm just getting exhausted with feeling down/anxious again. Yesterday was an ok day and then today I woke up feeling bad again. My family has given up on me.
1665,"Since I was 16 years old I’ve been dealing with depression, now 19, it’s been a very rough journey. Trying to convey through text would be impossible so I will just give you the best insight I can into my life. Ages 10-14 I lived watching abuse from various “step fathers” as mine left when I was too young to remember, worrying and a lot of sleepless nights, finally towards my ending of 14 turning 15 I was fairly certain all of it was gone. @16 years old I met my first gf, she was also very very supportive of me and would have done anything for me, she helped get me out of my depressive moods and made me feel amazing but I didn’t realize what I was dealing with until, one night A year later I made a mistake like all young highschool kids do and I cheated, found out and it was terrible all her friends telling to off my self and I’m a terrible person and don’t desserve love ever again blah blah blah, I was young and dumb and actually attempted suicide. Spent a week alone, in the hospital with nothing but my thoughts, no phone or tv no way to get my closure and no way to say sorry. I’m 17 now at this point and well it’s the worst my depression has ever been, dropped from 157 down to 143, became isolated, slept all day, skipped school all the time, started smoking weed and fell into the wrong group of kids. I was trying different drugs, screwing anything I could and this is all at 18... finally I met my next gf, hit it off instantly, shared everything together and never had a doubt of trust in her, we’re together till I turned 19, we were together for a year and in that year I was the happiest I ever was feeling normal again, eating, having someone just right by my side, she always took care of my depressive thoughts and wanted me okay, well so I thought, one day she started getting depressed, I did everything I could do to help and would give my life, well the day after our one year, she left me stating she wanted an “open relationship” so she could have sex with other guys blah blah, basically left so she didn’t cheat on me (ironic right?)
That’s been about 4-5 months,Well now it’s just gotten worse, everyday I feel alone even tho I have friends and my mom and grandfather, I feel like I’m not good enough, I hate my self image and I’m always in pain physically with my chest cause of my condition which will require surgery. I have thoughts of ending my life and already would have done it if it wasn’t for my mom, she needs her kid, but I can’t help to think it’s not fair, I miss work a lot because it’s so hard for me to concentrate and get out of bed, even on the days that I do I still wanna die no matter what I try, I work out and lift and granted during that I feel amazing but once the high from the lifting and endorphins go away I don’t feel anything but numbness, today as I right this I feel numb, I called off work again luckily I have one last excuse to fit the book, I just need help, I feel angry, I feel sad and numb, no true happiness, no love no nothing"
1666,"I’m a lonely 52yr old female who’s never been married, no children.  The only loving relationship I had is with my colleague who recently committed suicide and he’s gay.  He was very depressed because he’s been battling cancer for the last 4 years, and now with this pandemic it got him more depressed which led him to suicide.  I was very lonely for the last 5 years.  I had no friends, the last friends I had stab me in the back.  I’ve couldn’t even get a date, I always get rejected.  I’m now living with my mother and sister whom I got no support.  My mother is very abuse and very senile which is why I’m now saving up to get a place of my own which I should have done years ago.  I’ve been mistreated by my family and by people for years.  My recent boyfriend promised me he would marry me and put me as beneficiary, he promised me a lot of things which never happened.  Now he’s gone and I’m very much alone again.  I’m in deep depression.  I hate my life; I hate this world.  I’ll pray that I will be taken away from this world soon."
1667,"Just posted this in another thread and thought depressed people with financial anxiety would benefit too.

It is good to learn to not depend on the dollar/paper money. It's artificial and so will reduce your experience of time and peace of mind.

You know why people who live in villages seem like they have so much time? They are simple yet some of them are incredible healthy. I'm going slowly down that path.

Below is a battery free mobile solar light. Hang it on your ceiling and do without electricity. Not much different. Can last 50 hours on a single charge. Remember when dealing with financial anxiety sometimes distancing yourself instead of challenging this new world order is actually more beneficial. Everyone has their own style but I just personally find this more pleasing than an electricity base system especially the way the world is going with it's ever increasing slavery. This is how you escape the slavery.

                   




It also has an iphone charger. This is basically the equivalent on saving efforts to make money. A penny saved is a penny earned. And guess what? you can stay at home more hopefully if you follow this line of thinking."

I recently lost my boyfriend, he committed  suicide.  before I met him I was very lonely been backstabbed by friends and suffering from depression for 5 years.  He's been suffering from cancer for 4 years he's been very depressed ever since this past fall and now with this pandemic it got him even more depressed which lead him to suicide.  He was my life the only person that keeps me from being depressed only recently we've been drifting apart because he's been making promises he doesn't intend to keep.  Now that he's gone I'm very much alone again.  My family doesn't care about me.  I'm having suicidal thoughts now.  I'm in deep depression..   I pray that one day I'll wake up dead!  I'll just pray that I die in my sleep and my boyfriend's soul will wake me up and escort me to heaven.   I don't want to live in this pathetic world anymore.  If I had the courage I would have committed suicide and join my boyfriend already!"
1669,"I've been depressed since I was a kid and I didn't think I was capable of being happy. I alternated states in which I was depressed for weeks or months and periods in which I had nothing to worry about but I wasn't happy either. Well, I thought that in those moments I was happy because that was my reality and not being depressed was enough. Considering that being happy, I thought life wasn't worth but I discovered that helping others and watching them being happy made me happy somehow. At that time I was being bullied and that new purpose of helping others got me out of the pain but it was a confusing time and changing to get distance from bullying and to help others somehow got mixed and I suffered anxiety for not remembering my old personality and if I changed it for a good reason or a bad one. 
When I was 15 or so I started reading books about depression because I had the necessity to know if I was somehow damaged and could not feel happiness or I was just doing something wrong and talking with a professional I would. I posted here with 18 two years ago for the first time and it really gave me the courage to seek professional help. I didn't get on with the first one and the second one diagnosed me just by talking to me for 15 minutes. I'm very shy and cannot tell her all my experiences in that time but she didn't care either. I know it's a long process and I have to keep searching but that was the last one I visited because I ended up worse. If you have any tips to find a good specialist or had problems like that I would appreciate if you told me. 
Last two years have been crazy, I think I beaten depression but I'm not sure. Every single time I said that to motivate myself I discovered I didn't. The difference is that in this two years I've been happy. 
It lasted only a week and it was last year but it was refreshing to feel that for the first time! Now I know I can feel it without medication I just need good people around. 
I drunk too much in a party and did something really bad to the most important person for me, one of the friends I shared that week with. I couldn't remember anything, some friends told me her version of what happened and I don't think I would be able to do that but not remembering and really trusting that person I have nothing to do or say. 
Obviously hate feelings came along and it's difficult to deal with the situation.  I don't think I'm going to get over damaging so much a person I care about but I've never done anything bad before, the only thing that brought me satisfaction was helping others. I used to have a lot of suicidal thoughts and on the one hand now I think I don't deserve to die because that would be too easy and on the other one I don't want to die because I experienced happiness and maybe one die I will again. Do you think I'm a bad person for wanting to live afterwards and not before damaging someone? 
I apologise for my English, thanks in advance."
1670,"Im stuck in a never ending loop.
1. I cant get help because of my controlling abusive family 
2. Cant get away from my family if i cant get in college 
3. Can’t get in college because i can’t study because im too depressed for that

Context :- 
I have extremely strict asian parents who dont exactly believe in depression and they already hate me because I’m the black sheep of the family who’s been failing at everything and who stand against their stupid cultural and religious beliefs when they try to force her to do things like they do .

it’s silly but i believe I’ve always been depressed it just never was “too bad”. And i was still functioning and i was support good at school and i has hobbies and everything. It all changed when i move out to a “boarding school kinda thing” i was alone i lost all my old friends and the kids in that place were so bad and mean and awful
That’s when everything go bad i started having panic attacks and self harming and i slept almost ask the time and obviously my grades went from always 100% to always below 50%. My parents got mad at me and kept telling me how I’m wasting their money and I’ma huge disappointment.
I genuinely wanted to get in need school...i still do i love medicine so much and i want  to help people.
But after 3 years of continuously failing to get in plus graduating high school BARELY. Im stuck. I hate life i hate myself more than anything i want nothing more than to die. So i sneaked out last year took my savings with me and saw a psychiatrist 
Mind you were have only one psychiatrist here turns out he was a family friend and was friends with all the doctors in my family and he told them... at first i was hopeful. That the doctors family will make my parents understand but now I’ve learned people here will never change...all i got told was “to be happy”
Here i an about to fail my exam again idk what I’m doing with my life...i just want to die if i fail again my parents will take full control of my life and make me do what THEY WANT 
Study what they want
Get a job they want 
Marry someone they want

1671,"been pretty isolarted the past few months and not leaving my room too much, started abusing drugs again after a year of being sober.. Even on drugs that are supposed to make you feel good i cant sleep and just cry..."
1672,"Hello, everyone. I’m new to the forum.

I’m in my early 30s. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life now. I live with my parents and sister (this is quite common in my country, by the way). Lately, I’ve finally been able to start making some money doing transcription work (I’m self-employed).

It can be hard to stay motivated though, especially when I feel really depressed. Which is why I feel like some words of encouragement from my parents would be most welcome. But no matter what I say, it’s like they don’t even understand the concept. Am I asking for too much? Should I really have to be so emotionally self-reliant that I simply stop needing this?

What’s worse, they both seem to be neurotic and afraid of the future. My dad in particular  seems to be full of fear, “Will you be able to make money doing this until your pension?”

Christ, my pension is like 40 years away. I just want to get on my feet financially. First things first. I probably won’t be doing this till then. But it works for now.

In the last few months, I’ve managed to increase my monthly income by around 150% from what it was last year. They never say a positive thing about it.

Am I simply too sensitive and emotionally dependent? I mean, I suppose I am to an extent (which is part of my problem to begin with). But still..."
1673,I am in a relationship with the love of my life but I am emotionally exhausted from trying to tell him how he makes me feel.   He doesn't listen or blames my depression.   I am unable to tell anyone how unhappy I am and I don't know why.   I just want to be happy!   I'm 67 next week and can't take much more.   Thank you for reading this.
1674,"I found myself in a very tough situation last year. I was in an emotional and sexually abusive relationship. I got out. After reliving the pain of the relationship, I decided it got too much and attempted to take my own life; I survived it.

Since then, I have been recovering with the help of family and friends, counselling. I used to be so happy and professional in the work place. My attempted suicide became quite public after I was found my a member of society passing by. I worked with children, but it wasn’t full time. But I had studied at college to earn this job and worked very hard. I am scared of the consequences of what I did and never been able to work with children again or being hired."
1675,"I really feel like crap today, nothing I do seems right.  Fighting depression for a long time is rough."
1676,"I am 22 and have had a hard time grasping onto life for the past 10 years. I grew up in a dysfunctional household from birth and my parents split up when i was 12 which ended up with me having a mental breakdown that i have not came back from. During the mental breakdown i experienced rage, self harming, suicidal thoughts and attempts, destructive behavoir and extreme sadness with my life ending up in my mother kicking me out to my dads and then my dad bullying me because of my depressive like state. None of my family have helped as both my paternal and maternal families are out of touch and cold with each other, three of my cousins on my dads side have died from self destruction at a young age also. I have drifted between places to stay and have been hospitalized twice for suicidal attempts where none of my family showed up to see that i was ok. All my romantic relationships have been unstable and i havent kept any friends for long.

Symptoms - I feel nothing most of the time, trouble sleeping and waking up, no motivation, mood swings daily, no energy, body aches, drained from any contact, no appetite, confusion (cant think or concentrate), constant anger and irritability, paranoia and  severe anxiety. People say i look dead, creepy, sad and pissed off all the time. Anything positive feels fake and phony to me as all i feel is pure negativity. I think im dumb and ugly, i am very lonely and a recluse as people want nothing to do with someone who is obviously troubled and i dont blame them as i cant muster energy to socialize properly or find anything enjoyable whatsoever. 

I look at these words and tears fill my eyes as i can see the problem staring at me yet i feel as if im too far into melancholic hell to ever think straight again. Only do i feel crushing disparity accompanied with rage and guilt, a blank expression upon my face revealing death setting in and a losing battle to keep fuel into my desires. Loneliness is my familiar friend as is disappointment, anything but negativity is a foreign emotion that i cannot handle and the basic human need for friendship and love is like an endless marathon where i keep running to no rewarding end. What is wrong with me? Ive never met anyone who feels this way. I dont feel real anymore."
1677,"I dont know if this is part of the depression but i feel empty and dead inside, i dont feel things that i think i should be feeling. I dont even know if i truely love my wife or acting like i do because thats what im supposed to do. Its the same with my family members. I lost my father in law, my twin neices, my grandmother and a good friend and when i think about them i dont feel anything. Its like none of it bothers me the slightest. I know it is wrong to be this way but i cant help it, and it feels like im the only person who feels like this."
1678,I dont know what to put. I have been on anti depressants for almost a year now and i still feel wothless. I feel like i have zero emotians and have to force myself to feel things. My wife trys to support me but i just keep pushing her away. I feel empty inside and i really dont know what to do.
1679,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here. 

Don't really know if I have depression and I might be posting in the wrong forum. But I would be really grateful if a few could spare a bit of time and answer my questions. 

I don't have a good self view about myself and my self confidence dosen't exist. I can find myself unknowlingly find wrong with people instead of seeing the good, which make me have quite the negative view and can say mean comments. I would never say any mean comments upfront to a person but I hate that I think that way, just because I don't like myself.

I know you need to love yourself to be able to love other, so I have kept away from dating these few years and I don't need to hurry. I had one serious ""relationship"" if you can say so, but for me it was not that serious, it was just an escape. Not going to deep into it, I ended it after my ex tried to control my life and hit my bunny which was pushing my bottom line. Because no one can say anything bad about my sibblings or miss treat my pets, that's when you step on my bottom line. But when it comes to me, I don't really care how I am treated because I have such a low self esteem. I just think that's what I deserve to be treated.

How do you build your self view in the best way and how can I change all the negative thoughts that keep on haunting me. Most of the thoughts that haunt me are things people have told me for many years. If a person say something positive to me and compliments me I don't believe them, I just find it being a lie because myself can't see it."
1680,Feeling not like myself.... Will it go away? So scare...
1681,"Suffered from severe recurring clinical depression for over 30 years. Have stopped meds due to side effects I can’t live with. Am at end of tether as depression so bad - have tried everything and nothing seems to work long term. Only thing I haven’t tried is TMS. Am I fooling myself that this could really work? Will I spend thousands of pounds and then feel stupid and cheated and even more suicidal if it doesn’t work? Has anyone had TMS for serious depression? What were the results please?

I don’t really want to take my own life but I simply cannot live like this anymore - I am so worn out fighting this hideous illness - it takes everything from you.

Thank you to anyone who responds."
1682,I feel alot more stable on a higher dose of my SSRI. I'd like to work again but I'm feel very slow witted from the blunting effect of antidepressants. I have not worked in years and have no idea how to explain that gap in my life to an interviewer. The antidepressants just make me feel low dopamine and low goal oriented Ted but if I don't take them I have to bad of a mood. How can I stimulate myself and get through an 8 hour shift. I get stressed easily and have a hard time to commiting to a shift and get flustered.
1683,"Hello! Excuses in advance if my grammar isn't great, English is not my first language.🙂 
My diagnosis is high functioning autism and ADD, but that's not really what I wanted to talk about. I've been feeling so low for years. I was at my worst at my 13th (I'm 20 now) I was admitted to some sort of mental hospital for a year because my depression was so severe. I was actually diagnosed with it but now everyone's like it's gone. My therapist says its probably just part of me.. I handle some things better , but it just feels like I'm going to break every moment. I will be done with this one day. I have barely any activities to do, I just don't have energy for it. I lie in bed almost the whole day. And when I come out I start gaming and go back to bed when I'm done. This has been going on for years, while also parts of struggling with alcohol abuse. (I've been clean for like 8 months now), actually a LOT of bad things happened in the meantime, and I almost killed myself a few times. I barely go outside, I have terrible anxiety. Social anxiety but also at home I get bad anxiety. I've tried therapies, medicines but nothing really worked. I'm just sick of it. I wonder what's wrong with me? I've really tried my best to better my life but nothing makes me happy anymore. I'm not looking for a diagnosis and I'm definitely not self diagnosing but I can't help but wonder why this never goes away , no matter what I do? Thank you for reading"
1684,"A reality that transcends ourselves is easy to get lost in. One thing is living the way you want to be and the other is getting to yyou should be. After you have , for example your parents are holding you in their form, you might want to lay back relax and meditate on some concentration tones. For example bi neural beats(a sound wave) on youtube. And instead of responding negatively or to any temptation count joy to joy. And all need to rebel. Put that in your pocket.  The ground of temptation is a relying attitude. (something you don't want) to be able to see things are not pended on that  while maintaining your sanity. You are not bound to conform to anyone. And in the same right when you are allighning this goal never curse until doubt, break free of that lie that you are somehow bound to any exception of who you really are."
1685,"I've been depressed a long time but never as demoralised, isolated and alone as this. I have been rejected by everyone, now I know being miserable all the time naturally pushed people away,  but other than that, I don't see what the problem was. I'm becoming increasingly worried about suicide due to being so isolated and depressed. :low: One day lonliness will kill me unfortunately."
1686,"Looking for help.I’m not symptomatic. I am Bipolar but have been suffering depression since my birthday last September. My last stress trigger was my former therapist K. I used to think that good therapists would want to know my background to understand how I got where I am today? I left repeated voicemails to K so she would know my back story. She never returned my voicemails so She also told me to trust the vocational counselor who misled me. I don’t blame the vocational counselor I blame my former therapist K who has the most experienced and should of known better. So I'm dumping K for an outside psychologist January 20th. My Wellbutrin keeps me from crying and feeling the pain of my depression but it doesn't change my life .My life is what is making me sad. I wanted to work on a way to fix my life. I feel like Rip Van Winkle. I was asleep for 20 years and have woken up to realize that my life is over. I have been spinning my wheels for the past week trying to find other people to talk to in mental health chat rooms.Those chat rooms are no panecea chatters seem to talk past each other and not to each other. I wish there were free online 24/7 professional mental health support chats but they are all fee based. Remember when I made reference to Rip Van Winkle earlier?Well a lot of mental health professionals would diagnose what I'm experiencing right now as a sense of denial.I beg to differ. I believe my life was in a sense of denial up until I finally ""woke up"" and saw how it really was. I told my previous therapist J that I don't want to go"" back to sleep.""I want to keep this little burning ember inside me alive and keep it as hope. So I dropped J and I went to K. Unfortunately K turned out to be worse. My mental health clinic doesn't care if I ever get off disability. To them I am experiencing pipe dreams. My present clinic is not helping me. I regret that I made a major mistake in my life many years ago when I was still young and living with both my parents. My life's never been the same ever since that fateful act and now both my parents are long gone. I keep thinking about how my life would have been if I didn't make that mistake.It's very depressing. I want a plan. I want to be told that I'm not nuts for wanting to get off disability even at my age. Unfortunately I'm no longer a spring chicken.Are there any licensed mental health professionals that visit this site? Both my late parents were religious so I guess I'm searching for a miracle."
1687,"I’m back to feeling low again..
What I hate about this is I feel like I can feel myself wanting a drink when I feel really bad. I don’t drink so much I throw up, but I will take 4 shots at a time because anything less than that, doesn’t really help. I hate having to drink so many beers and things to feel the same feeling I’m searching for, so I do shots.
I drink rarely too.. like maybe twice a month I do this.

Idk if I’m worrying too much but I worry maybe I could be on my way to going down the wrong path. How can I stop running away from my feelings? I know what I’m doing most likely isn’t the best idea. :low:"
1688,"My depressions been extremely active lately and it has caused me to start using self harm as a coping mechanism again. Im so disappointed in myself for allowing it to have power over me like it used to in my early teens. I need to develop healthier coping mechanisms.. let me know if you guys have any suggestions that work for you 
Thank you x"
1689,"I need some advice. Is it a bad to try and  make up with someone that wronged you? I miss my best friend. Don't even know of he wants to make up. Back in December we drank got drunk. He accused me of taking his pills (pain killers) he was more drunk then me. I tried to explain to him I didn't take anything. Tried to walk away back into my apt. He kicked open my door. I pushed him out then he broke my living room window with his beer can. My mom called the cops. He was arrested. Drug charges and criminal mischief. I'm guilty of drunken behavior In the past towards him as well we fight then make up. But not this time. I never hated him for what he did but I blocked him I've been so depressed lately with no one to talk to and I saw him today at the store he didn't see me. But so many memories came flooding back. I miss him, he was the brother I always wanted. I stayed with him when his son was bron.he lived with me for a time.  In my dark times I want to reach out and make up. Not sure if he would talk to me. But do you think is a bad idea to try? It's been 5 months since we talked. He may hate me, I don't know. Seeing him made my depression and anxiety flair up. I miss him I want to try and make up. Is that a bad idea?"

1691,"I’ve been getting a really tough time from my boss lately. My depression has really ramped up because of this and I’ve had thoughts of it being much easier if I wasn’t here. I can’t do anything right at work, my boss shouts at me down the phone, accuses me of not doing my job, talks about me to other colleagues, anything I submit he ignores. He is rude, condescending and makes fun of people as they walk into his office.  When I hear my email alert go off my stomach sinks thinking it’s going to be from him. I’m worried about losing my job, my depression and anxiety is crippling and now my partner is suffering with depression because of PMDD (we think). She has moved out of our house for a few days to be with her dad as she always tells me she misses being around her family when she feels so low. Only I never know if she is coming back. 

It doesn’t make me feel so great knowing she can’t be around me when she feels low. She doesn’t know how I’m feeling as I tend to have functioning depression and can hide it well. She hasn’t been talking to me much, been crying, stand off ish, I’ve tried everything but this happens regularly with her periods, she has been to the docs numerous times and has tried various things. This time when she left, she didn’t hug or kiss me properly, and said ‘what if I leave and go home and I end up wanting to stay and I’m happier through there?’ My stomach sank. I’m losing everything through no fault of my own, including myself. It would be much easier if I wasn’t here. I don’t want to be. My dad took his life when I was younger and the idea for me right now sounds more than appealing. I just want this hurt to end and it’s not."
1692,I’m 21 years old and have never had a serious relationship. I’m not very good at talking to girls. This is most likely do to my low self esteem. Every time I start talking to someone I’m constantly second guessing myself. I have a very negative perception of myself. I honestly have trouble when asked to describe myself in a positive way. Once I say a positive I end up challenging it with a negative. The dating thing has more recently started bothering me because most of my friends were in my same situation throughout high school. But the past few years have seen all of them get romantically involved. Any advice on getting more self confidence? That would probably help in almost every aspect of my life not just dating.
1693,"I have anxiety and depression, but since I joined this forum, I would like to support and comfort other people who suffer like me or other depression issue. I'm comforting them as much as I can. 

Is it right to do like that? I feel like even I still can't recover my own anxiety and depression, why am I helping other people like me? This is make me guilty and lost confident. 

Please advise. Thanks!"
1694,"Why do I feel so empty and numb,life is beating me down at every turn I am tired of fighting this, tired to try anymore, to tired to bother with life, had a thought of how serene life would be if it ended now, all the pain and anxiety just, poof gone, stress devoid of meaning, I have no network of friends to fall back onto that actually know or help or ever talk to me unless I'm the one to make the effort, I'm on medication and it helps alittle, I've done therapy and it doesn't seem to work well. All the motivation and willpower is sapped from me on a daily basis, I feel numb and empty is the only way I can describe it."
1695,"After antidepressants, I starting being like a zombie. But I already took it back 44 days. I seem to be getting worse every day. My brain is almost empty, nothing want, even eat or drink. Although my doctor told me I am not schizophrenia, I don't want to trust him because my situation getting worse. My emotion is numb. I don't know is that because zoloft. I know that here maybe no one same like me, it is so weird."
1696,"I wouldnt say I am the most hopeful person out there. I am skeptical and a cynic by nature. I question everything. I just wanted to say to you all, and myself, to just keep fighting and never give up. Surrendering is weakness and I refuse to be weak. In my last post I stated that I can not generate enthusiasm for anything. Well, my newest decision is to force myself to. Even if I have to feign enthusiasm I am going to. I will learn to enjoy things again even if I have to merely pretend that I am. I will place my mind into that zone of excitement and joy again MANUALLY if I have to. Whatever your issues you must keep fighting. But remember you arent alone. Posting on this forum is definitely helping me to sort out my thoughts and emotions so post as frequently as you must. I wish I had discovered it sooner. My newest goal from here on is to create my own enthusiasm for things, even when it isnt coming naturally. I challenge you to create your own goals and share it here, no matter how trivial you may think it is. Together we can overcome our sickness."
1697,"Its 4am where i am right now and Ive been lying here for almost 2 hours trying to sleep. My mind wont stop running in circles and now it has me feeling so bad its got me feeling especially sad. I dont want to be alone anymore. I wish so badly that I had a family. I wish I had a wife and kids but I have no idea how to make that happen. And I dont think I ever will. I cant even find someone to have ONE date with let alone a real future. I hate this loneliness. This is worse torture than being flayed, that would end at some point. You cant be flayed for 21 years. Why cant I find her?"

So tired and lonely"
1699,"If anyone has reasons... Well. We can cry here together. 

I found myself reaching out to my family. Only a few people answered. Most were abusive mentally, emotionally and even verbally. 

I put a good music playlist that encompassed how I feel. I wanted to speak with some one. Then I remembered my peaceful village here... 


I have left for a good amount of time. Just recently. I had great break through moments. Things that I wanted to share here. But. I had been busy and decided to wait. 

Then. I time traveled here. 

But. This has been a great community of loving support. 

Let me. Share where I am with things. I am currently walking the fineline of the mist... 

Have you ever had one of these blissful moments where... Thoughts. Emotions and reality blur??

Like. Mental growth moments of reflection? 

For example. .. I listen to and old love song. From a specific time of life; dear to me. 

You look at old pictures. And you remember so many things... You reflect on life...

You think so many different wild thoughts. You realize that life is only one... You have to grow up and move on... It makes you think about love.... Life... Our paths... Destiny... 

People move on. .. We move on. But those emotions are still so real... Forever with us... 

No matter how many years pass... You just want to love... Forever. But that love is gone.. 

You have both moved on... You are both in new relationships... 

In those pictures... You see those two people you used to be. .. 

But. We are no longer the two people in those pictures... 

I am a time traveler. 

So. I always wish that we could live more lives. Or for eternity.. Just to love. To hold on to those nurturing moments where you just want to love that person... 


And you just want that person to love you... 

Forever. But in that particular moment.. 

Time erases. You are like in heaven. You are in love... Its beautiful and heart braking all at the same time.  

In the movie Gladiator. You don't want Maximus to die. But you want him happy and reunited with his family. 

So that ending is bitter sweet... 

I wish all of the women that I love in my life.. And even out of my life.. Know how much I greatly appreciate them for being a blessing in my life. 


I pray that they know. 

I am much older. Time traveling ages you quicker.. 

I see old pictures... And I remember that kid I used to be... 

We as adults have to remember to still care for that kid inside of us. 

Is our youth our spiritual selves revealed? When we feel invincible? 

Then. As time passes. We loose that essence somewhere; within our selves? 

I remember the great kid that I was.. 

I look for that kid from time to time... 

As I travel through time. 

I wish people lived forever. Because traveling through time would be more fun. 

I could travel through time forever. Living great experiences over and over. Cloning my existence over and over again. 

To enjoy those moments. Where no one dies. 

I would love to talk to a 400 year old John F Kennedy. 

Or Yoda. Lol. 

This place we call earth. Or life. Sure is a great place to visit... While we are here... 


Those old memories remind me of the women I have loved. And I wish I could travel back in time to love them over and over again. 

Lol. 

Maybe a few times only... Lol. Can't be greedy! 

When I developed time travel. I started traveling through time with a few people. 

But. Its been so long I have been traveling alone.... 

Its hard to communicate through time.. 

Its like back to the future... 

Memories fade like old pictures. 

But. Even as I travel through time. My heart and my thoughts remain the same. 

Like an old pet.. Maybe a crush you had on a singer growing up.. 

I remember those feelings on love... 

Maybe your favorite song.. Your first kiss... 

I loved someone... I still do..

My time machine broke..I got stuck in the past. And could not return in time. 

When I finally returned. She was married..

I took too long. 

She even started a family. 

I am so happy for her. 

But I love her from a far.... I know that we will never be in each others lives. ... 

But I pray that she knows how thankful I am. That she came into my life..

Even if only for a brief time. 

We share a beautiful child together. 

Our love eternalized. 


Sometimes. I remember the first I love you... 

I pray.... 

I know that I will love this person for the rest of my life....

No matter what. 

Why? 


I will never know...

Sometimes. People are so special in your life... 


Its hard not to cry when my daughter asks me about her... 


I wish there was something I can do. 


But God did not grant me that power. 


I can travel through time. As much as I want. And everytime. The same happens... But in a different way... 


Time travel is not about the outside world. 

Time travel is about you. 


Eventually. You accept Gods will. 

I cry almost every day. Some days more than others. 

When someone is no longer here with us. Is it ok to cry years and years? 


It helps me. 

I pray to God that she can hear me in heaven. 

God. Please give me the strength. 


I have a baby to live for now. 

I have to be strong. 


In my heart. I remember every kiss. And I carry that in my soul. With me at all times. 

I can walk on the beach. And feel the essence with me. 

I ask God to forgive me for feeling this way. My tears are like boiling water. 

But it heals me. 

They say... When you are thinking about someone. That person is thinking about you.

Is there a universe where she is crying for me? 


I just want to say thank you to her one last time... 

God forgive me. I may be wrong. 

But in my heart. If none of my other words make it to heaven... 

I just want her to know. 

I can feel her with me right now. 



I had to come here. To be with her. ... 


I had to cry like day one to soothe my soul. 


Thank you for crying with me."
1700,"I am feeling miserable these days. I have bipolar depression and social phobia. I am almost 30 & spent most of my life hiding away at the family house. I haven't really lived. I have no experience. I fear people. I have no confidence and always feel nervous. I wake up and I don't know what to do. I lost interest and hobbies. When I look around and see people living I wish I could be that confident to be able to drive,work,socialize. Having no confidence makes everything impossible. It is a horrible feeling of weakness and useless and hopelessness. I take medication and speak to a therapist. She tells me to do positive self talk which I try. But these few days I feel so weak and like I force myself to sleep because I don't know what to do. I had a thought that life is taking too long and I want it to be over.

1702,"Hello, is anyone feeling this way ? 
While reading fictions, books and watching movies I recently developed some sort of bad feeling that puts me down. I feel very useless, I don't know what am i doing here right now, why I have been hurting all my life for nothing. I feel like I would just die unknown, useless, I will never be the hero I want to be. 
Even though I don't even know what hero really means to me, I just want to make something that people will think is great in this world. 
But it is simply impossible and it hurts so much to be so useless every single day. 
And it's not the fact that I want to be an illustrator that will change something, even though the calm life i have been dreaming of before would make me happy, it is not heroic, I want to leave this world being the greatest.
As days pass by I'm thinking more and more that I am not born in the good period, I feel I just don't belong here.

I wish I could die soon and maybe finally experience another life, world, universe or fiction in heaven if God would let me.."
1703,"I'm not sure if anyone else feels this way. I have a lot of things that happened in life which I have not been able to let go off yet. Every time something new happens, I tend to think of everything and feel worse about myself, which leads to more crying. When I was 12, my mum left home. At the time, we were living with my grandmother, my dad's mom. But my parents separated way before that and my dad was not living with us when she left. There was no sign that she was going to leave. She just packed her stuff and walked out. I always wondered what I could have done so bad? I mean I was only 12. I always believed that if she can leave, there is no one else in life that I can really depend on. Every time something happens, these thoughts go through my head again. How do we let go? I forgave her but I can't forget it. We've never had much of a relationship after. She always hurts me every time I've tried repairing the relationship. Now that I'm older, I wish we had a stronger relationship. I wish she could have been my best friend. I need to find a way let go."
1704,"Hope its ok for me to post this here, I'm brand new to this forum.
I have never felt more alone in my life. Long story short a few months ago I had to move back in with my parents in a town where I don't have any friends, I get along with my parents ok but they have a tendency to minimize my mental health struggles. I was a uni student by distance but I had to defer this semester because I had an episode and was admitted to the psych ward for two weeks. So I'm not studying, I can't find a job because of COVID-19, I don't have any friends nearby and I'm living with my parents. I know how lucky I am to have a family that I can stay with so I feel so guilty whenever I say this, but staying with them is causing me so much shame, I feel pathetic. Essentially I'm 28 I'm broke, unemployed, have very little work history to put on a resume, and essentially just watch Youtube all day. I feel pathetic. Pretty much the only time I leave the house is to go to the psychiatrist or psychologist.

I know that at the moment everyone is feeling more isolated than normal because of the virus so I don't want to be too ""woe is me"" (just FYI Im in Australia so in my area we don't have the same intense lockdown as the US). I know that I should be really grateful that I have a roof over my head and a supportive family. I am grateful. I'm just really struggling, maybe more than I ever have done in my life. Its very difficult to resist self-harming. I just watch the clock, wait for the day to be over so I can sleep then wake up and do it all over again.
I don't really know what I'm looking to get out of posting this. My instincts are telling me that I shouldn't post here, that no-one will be interested. I just wanted to feel less alone for a minute.
I'm also just starting Effexor (I was on Citalopram for 2 years), I'd be interested to hear what others have experienced with it."
1705,"You matter damn it! Dont just think it or believe it. You must KNOW it. You matter, you have a purpose. Even if you dont know what it is first hand you are serving your purpose RIGHT NOW. Even if you dont think youre doing anything...you are. Be it an actual role you fulfill, or the journey you are on that is changing you into who you're meant to be. You have meaning and reason and you MATTER!"
1706,What are some things you are grateful for?
1707,"Hi everyone, a year ago my little brother was diagnosed with depression. His days go up and down, sometimes he hate me and find me annoying just because I’m breathing or pass by his room. So he can wish I never existed, I can perfectly feel when he’s not in the mood. So I always stay away the days he find me really annoying. 

I don’t go after him or act clingy, the days he don’t have energy and I have the energy which is not every day, I will fix his breakfast and lunch. So he can eat in his room and come out when he wants to. 

He have trouble feeling his feelings and can’t come out to my parents of his sexuality. My parents are quite against everything that’s LBQT and our mom can be a bit controlling. 

We had a talk about everything, he told me that he think all his problems comes from observing how our parents treated me when I was younger. Also his psychology think that it comes from that, so they often during his sessions talk about me and how he felt in those situations. My little brother was just an observer or hid in his room, to avoid getting in trouble. 

I feel a bit guilty over it, maybe if I acted better as a sister and tried to help him. He might not had as much troubles and need to struggle so much. We are only two years apart. 

One thing I remember really good which myself feel bad over, was when I was a kid my brother was learning math he asked for my help. Yeah, me as a kid had learnt if you said wrong you get hit, so I did the same towards my little brother. I also had trouble controlling my temper when I was really young and could take it out on my little brother. At least after that occurred it was the last time he asked help with his homework from me and he have never asked help from my parents.

But at least I took most of the blame, made sure to comfort him when he was sad if I could, patching him up if he scraped his knee and many other things. We could get hit if we cried over a scraped knee or we just disturbed my mom. I later filled up my days with hobbies to not be home that often, just to avoid to be hit often. It was a bit biased between my brother and me on how we was treated, because he was my mom little treasure baby. 

Myself was quite weak with my academic and had trouble with nearly all the subjects, because of my dyslexia I often asked my little brother to help me with writing texts and proof-read my works. I know he did it to just make sure my mom wouldn’t hit me for not getting a passing grade which would create a lot of conflict. 

My little brother always thinks he need to be perfect, he need to get perfect score to not get in trouble and so on. The extra pressure and his own self hate, make he feel like he’s suffocating and sometimes want to just end everything. 

I’m quite close with my little brother, so we often can talk about everything with each other. 

I wonder if there anything I can do to make it easier for my brother to cope with his depression. I don’t like seeing him feeling down and not feeling good."
1708,"Hi all.
Iam 26 years boy from india.
I have spent my whole life being gloomy and sad.i spent my whole childhood in mental and physial torture and abuse by my step mother. My father has diabetes for long due to which he oftens becomes aggressive and beat the shit out of me due to any negligence in studies.
My step mother accused me of sexual harrasment with her.but my father did not reacted on that as he knows she is wicked lady.she was always in wait to get chance to beat crap out of me. That was my whole childhood.i grew lack of confidence, anti social and did not share any thing with my family due to fear of getting punishment and abuse.
During my senior school i developed sexual problems like excessive wet dreaming and other ejaculatory issues.i did not told my family due to fear of punishment.my parents always scared me that if you developed any disease regarding sex you will not get treament.i got afraid and went to doctor who gave me big slip of medicines which were expensive like 300 dollars.
I did not had that money and my problem got ignored for like 2 3 years and after that i developed severe mental disorders like depression, lack of concentration, anxiety, sensory motor disturbances.after that i got courage to tell my father started treament of my sexual issues but nothing worked. Medicines work for like during use,when i leave them same issue raises back.
Now iam getting anti depressants and sexual disease medicines for last 3 years nothing is working. The drugs are destroying my kidneys and liver on scans and labs.
But i cant leave them due to my ejaculatory issues.i have developed erectile dysfunction from these ejaculatory issues.due to multiple drugs effects the erectiin was hidden.the doctor told me that if you have reached to me 5 years ago the treatment would have been of 1.month.
Now iam getting haunted from past that i should have inform my parents regardless of results. 
If i have been got treatment on that time i would have more happy life and career. 
Now iam working as doctor in a hospital. I would have been went to usa of i would nit have that issue. 
It has ruined my life, both mentally and physically along with my career.
I think if this disease would not cure i will do suicide.
I am out of options right now.die at this young age. But i cant cope with demons in my mind.
I dont want to be a junkie or addict.i was topper of my district.now iam regretting my life."
1709,"I am really struggling with depression today. Having the worst time getting out of bed. Fearful, worrisome and dark thoughts overwhelm me.
I start most days like this but today is really hard. I just wish I could sleep 24/7. Sleep is my only real escape...😞😞😞"
1710,"I had a very difficult weekend. My psychiatrist is wanting me to taper off of Paxil and start taking Zoloft. Right now I'm taking 20mg of Paxil and 50 mg of Zoloft. For a couple of weeks I've been going through withdrawal symptoms from an antidepressant like sweating profusely during sleep, brain zaps, headaches, etc. Last Friday I started feeling really down and I have no motivation to do anything. This last Saturday I started having dark thoughts like my children would be better off without me and I wanted to do something to end the pain. I have felt like isolating from my family, because they will just think I'm acting like a victim. I've also been crying at least once a day for the last three days. I have not felt this bad in a couple of years. I have a phone session tomorrow with my psychiatrist tomorrow morning. Has anyone else dealt with problems like this? Maybe we can help each other."
1711,"So, I'm 23 female and this is really deep down me. I'm pretty sure something isn't right, maybe had sexual trauma/abuse as a child, but want to tell you this ""red flags"" so you can tell me what do you think about it. 
1) as a child (6-8 years old) I used to have creepy nightmares and sleep paralysis every night for years but thought it was normal because my friend told me (I was naive, she was my age, a child). In nightmares, always some creepy yet caring adult (can't remember gender but think female) voice telling me to not be afraid of her in full dark when I freeze, can't move and knew she/he is going to abuse me and then always do to that point I wake up still seeing her/him scaring me or screaming at me or abusing me (I think it is hypnagogic in waking up) for few seconds. It was same dream every night, different sort of abuse, I was scared to sleep. I even named that voice.
2), I think I'm lesbian because I have liked girls all my life, for boys it was only few crushes and somewhat little sexual desire when I was younger but was afraid to think how much I liked women that way. The problem is, my first sexual experience was last year with my ex girlfriend, everything was fine but when she touched me *there* (I wanted it) I just couldn't relax it is so uncomfortable! Everything was fine touching me, just my V not, I was terrified. When I touch myself I never touch V, it's so uncomfortable even when I'm alone. I feel terrified to do that, just my body can't relax, always start to shake.
2) I have guilt/shame major depression problems from childhood. I was shy, ""good"", never argue as child even with my family
3) I have had acute psychotic episode (as a teenager) in which I believed (delusional) I raped / humiliated/abused some girl (the exactly same way my nightmare voice did to me!), even tried to kill myself twice then. Thanks God that is past now.
4) I'm addicted to masturbating, horny every hour, it starting get really bad, can't focus on anything else... feeling like a robot
5) Deep down, can't tell how/why/am I right..I feel like can slightly recall...that someone (but think adult female) touched me inappropriated when I was child but I repressed it. Here's why - that feeling is really feeling through me - some woman grabbing me hard to not escape while touching me down there and humiliating me for thinking it was sexual. And my guilt/shame  feeling for liking it. I don't know what to do. Right now, I'm keep having problem concernating on my studies, depression, sometimes suicidal thoughts, self harm.
I'm sorry for this long. I'm thankful for every answer. Thank you"
1712,":sorry::panic: I'm ashamed to admit this and am too scared to tell my therapist. But I think I drove a very depressed man to commit suicide. I can't go into details for forum rules. But he was very depressed and had a crush on me. He gave me his number and asked me to call him. I never did. He would compliment me on my strength, intelligence, and kindness. But I am neither of those. He always talked about how lonely and depressed he was. His parents passed away. His children disowned him. He had no friends in person. He said that he wished someone would call him. Then I had a falling out with him. He said something really mysoginist which made me feel even more inferior to men. In self defense I told him off. He looked so depressed and hurried out of the room like he didn't want to be caught crying. Then he died later that day, about only an hour after I told him off. I can't help but feel I'm responsible for his death. I was the last straw that made him kill himself. In a sense I killed a man. I feel so very guilty. Others have guilt but not the guilt of murder like me. I am so guilty. I wish I wouldn't have told him off. I can't ever forgive myself. I hope he okay in the after life.  I just may go to Hell for this."
1713,"Hello. Im 23 year old girl with a major depressive disorder with sort of psychotis history. Anyways, I want to tell you about something I have done and right now feel extremely guilt. I have been talking online with a woman (I'm lesbian, she is too) for couple of days in February, but my ex broke up with me a 2 weeks before that and I was really hurt still.. we we're talking but everything just reminded me of my ex (her style of typing, she was her age too, but I know she is not her!) and it hurt me even more. She get really attached for three days! Stress in my family, studies, break up all in once, I decided to stop talking to her, I felt pressure and sadness. I simply ghosted her! I thought it wasn't a big deal, we don't know each other in reality but she continued to write and I didn't answer. Ever. Even her friend called me, I didn't answer. I was very selfish! I can't recognize myself right now. This evening after 3 months I found out from my friend that she is deeply depressed and was attracted to me! I ""broke her heart"". I don't know how to react. I feel so guilty and bad. Karma need to come to me, like for real. I acted like an as*hole. I'm sorry. What do you think I should do to feel a bit better? Do I deserve happiness? Thank you."
1714,"I've been struggling for awhile, but my mood has shown some improvement lately. Then suddenly over the last couple days I've been feeling down again. My anxiety can be really tough at times too. Sometimes it completely goes away and other times it comes back again. The ups and downs can be frustrating."
1715,"I opened a lot of posts , thanks for everyone helpi me here. This post maybe my last post here. I am going to see my doctor today. I lost my emotion. Even motivation to eat. And my brain is empty.."
1716,"I am being self pitying and I know it's  boring, I just don't seem to move forward and I need to try.

My emotions  are all over the place just now. My mum is on end of life in a care home. I am lucky as I can go in and stay as long as I want, the problem is that I don't want. I don't want to sit and watch and wait. I'm no good at it, it's tearing me apart. I feel grief over losing mum, but so many other things too. Mum was not a very good mum. There I've said  it of my own poor dying mum. How bad am I.

I've analysed this over and over in my head. I was born at the very end of the 60s and she was 34 then. Back then she was an older mum. She wanted a child of the 1950s. Polite, quiet, obedient. She expected these things of both me and my sister. My sister rebelled. I didn't. I was too frightened  of her to rebel. She made life so hard.

Mum used to make all out clothes. Going to senior school in a homemade flaired skirt when everyone else wore pleats or straight..... I was laughed at so much. How I wasn't  bullied more than I was I don't know. I was made to go to church. Even at the age of around 13 I had an 8.30 bedtime. If the girls in my class had known that how they'd  have laughed. I used to have to pretend to have seen programmes on after 8.30 to avoid ridicule. It was a nightmare.

Mum had a really bad temper. If we didn't do what she wanted we would pay. She would hit the roof and go right through. She was immensely proud of hitting my sister so much that she bruised her own hand. What sort of mother is proud of that?

Mum's  hand could hurt, but her words had almost more power. She told me what a clingy child I'd been. She told me  she took my cousin, then around age 18 with them on holiday to get some peace from me. I know this as he married around 19 so definitely didn't go with them after that. Doing the maths that made me between one and two years old at the time and all she wanted was to offload me. She also told me much later in life that she hadn't wanted me as a child. Just lovely. Mum had trouble conceiving and they had already started looking at adoption  when she fell pregnant with me. God knows why she wanted a baby. It seems to me that she wanted children  because  it was the social  norm.

There is a legacy to my childhood  for me. I have never been in a relationship, never really looked for one. I've  never felt anyone would want me so I never tried to find anyone. I struggle to trust people not to let me down so I don't let people close. I put up a million barriers including sarcasm and a cheery facade to keep myself from getting hurt. I know I do it, but I'm terrified of rejection and keeping  people at a distance is all I can do to prevent it. The result is I'm lonely. There's  nothing good in my tail of woe.

Mum is at the end stage of dementia. She won't be here much longer. Despite  everything I'm dreading her death. I will miss her more than I ever thought possible. I thought I was prepared  for her death, but I'm not."
1717,"I don't know what to do sometimes, I have suffered depression since I was 17, lots of different meds, lately I been really down and yesterday I was having thoughts of hurting myself. I don't know why I get so down. I don't know if I should go to a hospital and ask for help"
1718,I feel that my level of consciousness is decreasing.I am eating Pristiq and zoloft now. I feel that my brain is dying. Someone help me. Family don't trust me. I Feel like I disconnect with outside. I am so scare now.
1719,"One year ago I have started to eat pristiq until one month ago I stopped it by my doctor, He said decreased the dose for me is safe. My last dose is 1/4.But when I came off from it two weeks. i got uncomfortable few days after that I seem like disconnect to surroundings gradually.And My brain starting blank every day. I am so scare that I will develop Intellectual disability or schizophrenia or something. I told my family and they don't believe me. Doctor add zoloft for me last month 28th. I have lost my motivation and emotion. And I am feeling like I am dying. And my consciousness is losing. I will ask my doctor tomorrow. Who knows that feel."
1720,"I’m back again with yet another post,posted quite a lot today. Mind is doing overtime reflecting on all my regrets and this big mess known as my life.
I’m 44yrs and still single, never married. Not had a boyfriend in god knows how long. Starting to think I’m destined to be single forever.☹️ Though it’s been that long I don’t think I’d be able to handle a relationship now.
Anybody else have these issues? As I feel like a total freak and the only single woman on the planet sometimes 🥺 now I’m 44 and lost my bloom and the little looks I had, I really feel I’ve no chance😕
Sorry for rant can’t stop feeling sorry for myself all day."
1721,I was wondering if physical affection between me and my therapist is a sign of poor boundaries
1722,"Hi

I feel utterly crap, worthless and like I don't matter.

If I was to disappear tonight, the impact would be so minimal. It would impact my parents and I accept that but beyond that, nothing. I work full time and I feel more of a hinderance than anything. I'm a miserable b**ch who must drive others mad with my miserable-ness. 

I just want to scream and hurt myself

:hidesbehindsofa:

xx"
1723,I’m so edgy and anxious by thinking my brain would have been broken down.  I’ll never be ok.  It’s a horrible thing to have knowledge of mental illness (because of my profession).  I tend to create catastrophic scenarios then have anxiety attacks.
1724,"Ate 38 days pristiq,I lost my emotion experience... I think that it Will last forever? Will it pass away?is that a common side effect?"
1725,"I have suffered from depression since I was 14. I’m now 23 and have struggled at different times of my life through different periods for different lengths of time. Right now I’m going through a time of severe depression and I constantly feel numb. I usually keep this all to myself but recently I’ve tried to reach out. Those I’ve tried to reach out to have turned me away or I’ve had no or little responses. I feel so alone and helpless. I feel the most alone I’ve ever felt at a time like this. I’ve always had people to help me through before but not this time. What do I do when no one wants to help? Feeling like no one cares sets me back further and further and I’m scared there’s no chance of remission this time. I just want to feel like someone cares and that someone out there wants me to feel happy again. Recently in the UK media, a loved tv personality has taken her own life and it’s something that has hit me very hard. I can’t stop reading articles about her. It triggers me so much. Life is hard right now. I just want someone to tell me it’s going to be okay."
1726,"I am so scare now,I am just 18,My brain starting can't use.... And I seem like living in dream everyday. My eye is fuzzy
I lost all of my emotions and lost myself.I will go to ask my psychiatrist on Monday. I scare that I will develop
Intellectual disability and schizophrenia'negative symptoms. Honestly, I don't know what I am going on and living. Who know my feelings ?😭
     I got diagnosed depression and anxiety one year ago. I started to eat pristiq on that time until one month ago. My last dose was 1/4.I stopped it by my psychiatrist. Then the next two weeks I started to feel weird and become a zombie. After this situation, I called my psychiatrist. And I need to start again the dose from the beginning of the treatment. I have taking 50 mg pristiq and 1/4 rivotril until one week ago add half of zoloft and few days ago increased to one of it. I don't know how many time I have left. I can feel that my situation is getting worse every day.And I don't know Can I back to normal. I can tell you that I think that I am same as death and like a zombie now. I seem to disconnect to the world. If anyone try this before. Please share your experience here and we can chat until I lost all of my ability to control my body. I hope it will not happen on me. But fate is always cruel. I still not have girl friend now. It will be a big regret in my whole life. I need to start write daily dairy now. My family think I a normal person, Nothing wrong with me. But I think I am getting trouble.
    My story is sad. I don't know am I wrong or not, I just want to say if a person who is suffering mental health problems. If him or her don't want to die immediately.I don't suggest people to take antidepressants and any sadative. If you want to eat medication to help, please consider carefully. In the coming days, I don't know how can I walk through it. I lost my motivation and hobbies. It is horrible. Like brain death...."
1727,"I'm trying to get through everything going on right now despite my issues with depression, anxiety and emotionally unstable personality traits. I am in a Facebook group with other women who have had a child around the same time as me and it has been a big support to have some contact while being physically so isolated. 
I now find myself getting so angry at people's attitudes that I need to get away from it for the sake of my mental health but I'm so scared of losing this main contact point to actual living beings outside my home. 
Social contacts have been a major part of keeping my depression and anxieties at bay most of the time over the last 13 years and the lockdown has hit me hard. 
Now I know someone thinks me too aggressive for arguing tonight, I'm still angry that too many people share her attitude and I don't know what I should do without the group. But there have been several points over the years when it was clear that Facebook is not a place conducive to me wellbeing.
I deactivated my account for now and I really want to stay away from it at least for a while but it's really difficult."
1728,I am worried that multiple triggers will lead to a perfect storm and decline in my mental health. For whatever reason this time of year is often problematic for me. It has been roughly 10 months since my last hospitalization and that is usually about how long I last. I work at a senior living center in food service. They have been quarantined for several weeks because of many cases of Covid 19 and there have been five recent deaths related to the virus. The facility is planning on lifting the quarantine this week and this worries me for myself and the residents. It has been one year since I quit my job as a mental health therapist. I have tried and failed twice at this career. I will allow one more try but then what? I thought I was ready to go back and applied for 3 jobs and had 1 interview. I am discouraged and maybe don't want to go back. I am worried about losing my health insurance because of an increase of hours and pay at work. The biggest trigger is my therapist leaving. I have worked with her for 4 years and she has been there for me for through hard times and hospitalizations. I start crying when I think about losing her. I had a strong relationship with the therapist before her and she died of cancer. I also recently had a relapse of self injury. It is under control for me now but these triggers make it hard.
1729,"Just noticed I’ve been posting and replying on here for the last month or so. It seems very stunted, a limit of one reply exchange or two. Would like to be more like pen pals if it is people that can relate to what I’m saying. A more in-depth communication. Maybe I’m feeling especially lonely just now with lockdown and living alone,and the fact my family are avoiding me on Skype or phone as apparently I’m too miserable."
1730,"Could i be hurt if me and my therapist hug each other, hold hands and kiss?"
1731,"I  feel so down and out at the moment and there is no one here to talk to, I just need a bit more strenght to carry on."
1732,"So my anxiety was like wildly intense for like two years. It’s pretty much gone now. But now I want to sleep all the time. I realize this isn’t a great default mode to be in but it’s better than the anxiety so I don’t hate just like lazing around my apartment whenever I can. But assuming I should fix it, how can I fix it?"
1733,"My doctor diagnosed me depression and anxiety one year ago. I got cure by pristiq.But when I stopped I started to feel brain empty. So, I ate antidepressants 38 days, but I starting emotion numb and less speech. I am afraid that I will develop schizophrenia...."
1734,"So about 2/3 weeks ago my boyfriend of 2 years started saying that he didn’t feel like himself and not happy anymore and had no idea why, just told me it was nothing to do with me. He asked for space, which I admit I really struggled with and the silence it bought killed me. 
Yesterday I received a text message saying that ‘ he cannot carry on with us as he isn’t in the right headspace at the moment, nothing I’ve done. Just doesn’t want to worry about others Andy drag them down with him’.
I rang him because I didn’t feel like the text was fair on me. Spoke for about an hour. Learn that his mum had tried speaking to him and he snapped, which isn’t him at all. He doesn’t enjoy anything he used to. He’s fed up feeling this way and doesn’t know what’s wrong with him.
I mentioned that GPs are there to speak to not just to give you medication, but whether this went in one ear Andy straight out the other.
He said it’s not fair on me waiting around for him. Which I understand, but he’s my best friend and my world. 
Lockdown has stopped his work, can’t see me or friends, plus we had two holidays booked this month that had to be cancelled. Has it all got too much?

I know he’s asked for proper space and I have to give him that. My stuff is currently stuck at his due to lockdown so has to be collected somewhen but he said ‘Don’t rush’.

Is there a way I can help him from a distance?"
1735,"I feel like my brain is blank and no emotion, is that normal? Too afraid I will develop Intellectual disability.Is that the sign of it working in my brain?"
1736,"today I lost it over a chair, let me tell you about said chair my landlord seems to think its acceptable when she's sitting out on the back deck to leave her damn chair where I can trip over it down some stairs going out or trip over it tryin to get back in my place so after the 8th time of moving said chair out of my way seething with anger I chucked it into the backyard OMG you would have thought I started world war 3, now I've been asking my roommate for about a month now to clean his disgusting hair out of bathroom sink like having this virus would be way more hygenic than the state of the sink i'm suppose to b washing my hands in but it doesn't affect her health so she don't care.... to no avail even told his 2 landlord which has fallen on deaf ears, until she finally relented and came down and cleaned it so I was yelling at my landlord over this stupid chair earlier asking her how the jesus r you teaching him to clean his SHI.....if your cleaning it for him??? like I wanted to yell in her face HELLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DDUMMMMMMY but obviously she's not knocking on this goofs' door telling him off cause he's just like her grown son who's still stuck to her tit that don't pay for NOTHING in the place either, so if that wasn't bad enough she also tells me she moped the floor cause obviously was thinking to myself maybe this idiot can't remember how 2 use a mop since the whole sink thing I refuse to do anything then she follows it up with but he did pick up the chair you threw on the grass i'm like really he couldn't be bothered to clean sink but the chair.... enters the joe pesci slang HERE!!!!! I was holding out hope cause landlord was close friend but now today i'm DONE I finally don't give 2 @)#)@()*($)*(@*)(@ about any of these useless FOOLS they can have one and other, vowed to not talk 2 any of these morons' hopefully until the day I move out of here but until I find a place i'm still stuck i'm still stuck in PRISON here, lets see what @)$*@)(#)*(@#*() I wake up too tomorrow....plz lord jesus"
1737,"I feel really hopeless. I have an empty void that makes me feel lost and alone in every sense, and nothing ever can fix it. I spend a lot of time playing video games or watching videos which are happy to watch, but even after a while I find myself zoning out and not listening anymore. I try to help people a lot because I feel some purpose with that, but a lot of time they are a brick wall and I find myself wondering what the point is.

I even wonder why I am writing this, because as nice as any replies and support would be. At the end of the day, it doesn't change anything in my life or how I feel. I still feel this. Usually I can just bury those things in my mind to a numbness but sometimes like tonight, the hopelessness and aching feelings break out and become overpowering. I would like to just step out into the dark and walk in any direction for so long. But I can't. I would like to have a happy home life. But I don't. And I would like to be just a normal living person. But I'm not."
1738,"I got diagnosed depression and anxiety one year ago. My brain is getting empty and can't use gradually after pristiq discontinue two weeks 
 And I ate 50mg pristiq from April 1st. I starting emotion numb when I took them again.... Last month 28th I ask my doctor Will I develop to schizophrenia or Intellectual disability? He told me no....  I think my situation is urgent.... Is that the med's side effect and withdrawal symptoms on me? I don't know is that my delusion? I am so afraid and don't know what to do now.... I scare that I can't recover and my family don't understand me. I am waiting for my doctor's answer"
1739,"For example when i was on fluoxetine it started working after several months and it kept working for about 5 months and then it stopped working, then it would keep repeating that cycle of working for a while then not working for a while. Its been the same with other antidepressants that i've used as well. I have anxiety and depression.i was told i have traits of bpd too.im still working with a psychiatrist to try figure it all out."
1740,My husband (of only one year) has suffered with a lot of depression (as have I) and now I feel he is using suicide as a threat. My first husband took his life after our daughter died so understandably this is a trigger for me. I am at a loss as to what to do. I moved across the country (with my two toddlers) who only know my current hubby as dad. I feel like I want to cut and run. I cannot go through the same thing again and I know that I cannot help someone who doesn’t want help. We are both nurses so we know options. I feel like my hubby is lost and hopeless and doesn’t want to seek help. I want to be with him but am fearful. I have a lot of support at home and not here. Help pls:)
1741,I already don't know is that the side effects of Rivotril and pristiq. I just felt emotion numb and My brain is empty. I almost can't think. I scare that will last forever and I will develop to Intellectual disability. Who  had this experience before? 😢
1742,"Hi All

I currently have severe depression and mild anxiety and am taking medication to help both of these issues. All of this has been documented at my workplace and they know about all my problems. 

Tonight, as I was doing my return to work interview after being off the past week due to showing covid symptoms (I didnt have it, it was my asthma playing up). My manager said that she understands that I have mental health problems but I need to start pushing it to the side when I am at my work and try to stop staring into space and have my ""face tripping me"" as I need to try and raise morale within my workplace. She then proceeded to say that obviously everyone is feeling down at the minute due to everything which is happening and I am not the only one feeling down and I should be setting an example due to being a Manager. 

My questions is, should I feel bad about not concerning myself with other peoples feelings during this time as I feel that my own mental health should be a priority for myself. I know that other people are having a tough time as it is with everything happening."
1743,"i remember some of it now, remembered during the night
:(

Late in 2011, my then-fiance decided he wanted to play silly games and left to get a new girl (at the time i didnt recognise his behaviour towards me before leaving as being mentally abusive)

I moved back in with family but family decided to take away the one thing i had left (my boy cat Dylan who i still miss)

I wasn't working cause nobody (employers) would give me a chance at that time which made my mental health really bad

family didnt care that i had nothing to stay alive for, professionals didnt care, nobody cared.

some point in the summer of 2012 i made one not-very-well-thought-out attempt on my life cause as i said i had nothing so what was the point in trying to stay alive

counsellor i was seeing cared more about his paycheque than about listening to what i was saying, the psych i saw (despite knowing i was self harming) thought i was wasting her time and was basically doing the self harms for fun

after the summer i remember i put together two more suicide ideas but didnt carry them out cause we moved

the one thing that saved me after we moved was the rescue, i went there to say hello (Mum came with me) and in the second half of 2013 Ebony went into the rescue and they really fought hard to save her, she got the OK to get rehomed just before christmas 2013, but no rescue will rehome that close to christmas so we went to adopt her on New Years Day 2014

Ebony was deeply damaged emotionally by what she had been through which i think is why me and Ebony were (from the start) like fish and chips, she saved me and in a way i did my best to save her

if it wasnt for Ebony i would not be alive now."
1744,"I don’t hate it when people, or online resources tell me to seek help, because i understand their point 100% and clearly that’s what i should do but i wish they knew that i’m virtually helpless.

I’ve tried all means possible to get help. Tried to talk to my parents; they got angry, dismissive, and blamed it on me. Tried to talk to a school counselor; she was very rude and i ended up wanting to die even more. I don’t have friends that i trust. I’m not close to any relative, teacher, or adult.

I was even on therapy for some time, but stopped due to financial issues...plus i simply couldn’t fit in an appointment to my extremely busy schedule (fault on my side, but yeah).

I’ve been constantly relapsing and having breakdowns. It’s so frustrating because i realize that i’m practically beyond help at this point? In my country mental health is super stigmatized. As far as i know, we don’t really have a suicide hotline? I heard of one sometime ago but it’s not 24/7 and it’s call-only.

I know this is unhealthy and bad to even think of (?) but i even feel a bit of envy to people who are able to get help. I feel really alone..."
1745,"Being the only one in my family with mental illness makes me feel depressed. I wake up every morning and I think how different I am than them. This hurts my feelings because I wanted them to know what I was going through this entire time. Despite being the only one with a diagnosis, I do have other family members that experience anxiety and self-harm. I agree these are forms of Mental Illness but I worked in my recovery and saw doctors who subsequently gave me a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder depression bipolar 2 and mania. I struggled everyday telling myself I only had schizoaffective disorder but the Mania I was also treated for during that time with medications. I don't know if everyone experience is different side, effects for medication but mine are horrible. My family would make fun of me for gaining weight, for being to inactive, and for being angry, for being diabetic. The anger didn't seem like a big deal to me the more they pressured me about being less angry, which I wasn't, I felt cornered. Nowadays I feel more enlightened with my situation about my anxiety anger mania  whatever you want to call it but overall the condition I feel the most is paranoia. Paranoid doesn't stem from anything crazy it just has a unique way of giving me anxiety. By unique I would say it has physical side effects, mental side effects and can cause others self-harm. I mean I can be perceived one way that would be taken offensively, I'm desperately trying to be perceived in a new direction. Do people have done this my whole life. I feel bad saying I'm the only one that's worked to recover but sometimes I feel like cheap shots are coming from me and not from them when really it's coming from them not from me. Easy to explain on here because it seems like a lot of people go through similar situations with different diagnosis has, and other anxiety related problems. But this one got me really depressed. I felt disconnected from myself and all the things I worked on in the past. I became indecisive about my daily chores pretty much e-literate by any means and then I found some hope. I know it sounds silly but I bought two plants. It sounds small but I know that it would be a hard job to keep them alive. I've now repotted my one plant three times and my other one twice. But the leaves still won't fall nicely, it's one of those vine plants like a gardenia or something. I'm so proud of myself that I kept them alive for close to two years now even though the ones sickly. Although I might be the only one with a diagnosis but my family does relate to me, they can be intrusive at times but I do enjoy their company and wish them well. So that's my two cents for today about depression and how I woke up and how I feel. If anyone would like to talk about depression or any other anxiety forming symptoms just post here and I'll respond"
1746,"Afternoon, does anyone have any tips or advice on letting things go, as there are a few things that I know are worsening my problems that I can’t release. I’m totally aware of the issue, just can’t fix it"
1747,"So I’m not sure if I place this here but I was wondering.

I have this idea that I’m being punished by God personally. That I have done something that I can’t be forgiven for and no matter what I’m going to hell. That I’m going to be punished for this forever until I rectify my mistake. I’ve thought this for a long time. I could just be reaching."
1748,"Hope everyone is safe and healthy! 

I have a lot on my mind and was hoping for some advice/feedback. 

COVID-19. I live in Central New York and we have the NYS on Pause initiative happening until May 15. I was furloughed from my job March 28 so I've been sitting at home with my mom since then. It's driving me crazy! I need something to do but my depression is keeping me from doing practically anything. My mom was also furloughed, a week before me. The first two weeks we got so much done. Like, scrubbed the walls and ceilings. We have a small house so there's isn't much to clean. We could clean out the front garage but both my mom and I have depression (even though she won't acknowledge it) so we've hit a brick wall with our motivation and it hasn't gotten done. The stay-a-home order could end May 15 or be extended longer. The original date was April 28. That being said, if certain businesses open starting May 15 I'll be too scared to actually go out! I don't want to get the virus. However I really want to get back to work because it's a good distraction from my crippling depression. I work in food service though and the restaurant has remained open through all of this but doing only curbside pickup. They cut their workforce down so much (40something down to 11) so I'm worried they won't need me immediately. I'm afraid they'll open the doors but keep the dining room closed, strictly to-go or delivery. That means they still won't need me and probably won't have a return date. That uncertainty horrifies me. On top of that my mom is supposed to go back to work May 15 when the stay-at-home order ends. If I'm home alone all day I'll go clinically insane. Full mental breakdown everyday. She's keeping me somewhat sane even though she's just as depressed as I am. I'll be calling my job literally begging to come back.

What's everyone's coping mechanisms at this point? Idk where everyone lives and how their government is handling the virus but I'd like to know. Any advice for me for the present/future? How are you handling this and what's going on around you?"
1749,"Some years ago I was paying to see a p-doc in the UK, who had lots of experience and a fair reputation. I told him how my depression was always worst (by quite a factor) when I woke up. He suggested I should take a cold shower and take a dog for a long walk. I never tried it :(. Any similar brilliant ideas?"
1750,"Hello all together,
first of all, please don't judge me for making mistake in my spelling or grammar since I am not a native English speaker.

The last like 3 Weeks I felt, how my Depressions are getting worse and worse. I lost the only 2 friends I had because of video games and me not saying, that something is wrong. 
I often cant fall sleep before like 5 AM and i have to get up at 6:30 AM to get ready for work. And the story continues there. My Boss yells at me all the time, saying all the things I do are shit even tho I am still learning. I only get to do the Jobs everyone ""is too important for"" and have to do them for like 4/5 Days a Week. This was leading to a mental breakdown 2 weeks ago I had. Now I am on Vacations until tomorrow and I am super scared to have to go to work again tomorrow.

But that´s not it. 

I am (while I am not at work) basically only sitting in front of my Computer, without any social interactions, hobbies or friends. And now, even my Dad started to confront me with the aspect of me not having any friends or hobbies, permanent gaining weight and the missing social interaction. To quote him:
""Son I would never have thought your such a no one. You have no friends, you have no hobbies, you have no social interactions and staying in your room and in front of your computer for like at least 12+ hours a day. And your also just sitting there and eating, look at your body how fat you are.""
And now I am really lost. I have no persons I can talk to, I have no hobbies I can come after, I have no talent I could chase. I am basically irrelevant and a hopeless human being.
Additionally there is my sexual orientation ... I see my self as asexually and I am really scared to tell my parents this, since my older sister is the exact opposite of me and i don't want to be compared to her.

I really don't know what to do or how to handle this situation. I am mentally and physically at the end. I even thought about drawing a final line."
1751,"Hello, 

I’m new here. I’m never been on a forum where I openly discuss the roller coaster of emotions that I’m not allowed to get away from.. but here I am. At a breaking point. 

Yesterday was one of those days.. I work in the customer service industry. I deal with people that have just gotten into an car accident. For most, they have just dealt with an unexpected, life altering experience. Most days I can deal with and be empathetic to the attitude, anger, frustration or difficult communication I am faced with from others. Unfortunately, yesterday was not one of those days. 

I was yelled at 4 times; I tried to remain as calm as possible but instead, as soon as I hung up with 2/4 calls I begun to cry. When I get flustered this usually happens and I begin to question myself. Is it me? Am I too abrasive with these customers? Am I not communicating correctly? Am I not handling this situation correctly?

I am fairly new to my job, I have only been here since January. So more often than not, I question my logic, my training, my critical thinking and my problem solving. I feel a lot of pressure to do well. I’ve worked hard to get to where I am and I do not want to fail.

Besides my job, I’m dealing with health issues. Some of which I’ve never dealt with before.. I may or may not be pregnant. I’m now on day 2 of a missed cycle and I’m panicking. All I can do is sit here in regret.Why don’t you think before you do things? What are you going to do? What if you’re not even pregnant and it’s something worse like a hormonal issue? I have been beating myself up for 2 days and because my anxiety is through the roof, I haven’t been able to sleep.

Here I am, sleepless, laying in bed, lurking my boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend’s IG page. Feeling as if I could never compare. How could I? He was with her for 6 years. I’ve only been here for one. How could he ever build a bond with me the same way? She’s skinnier, girlier, and she was his first love.. I’m the second. I cannot compare..

When I get like this, I feel worthless. I want to leave my boyfriend and my body.. I want to feel nothing. How do I feel nothing?"

No one needs me here, so why do I have to stay. Everyone would get along fine without me, and all I do is bother them anyway. Why can't I just fucking leave already. I don't want my life!

I've been with my partner for almost 2 years l, I gave up everything and moved from the US to here to be with him.

Now the other day I found out that he was on a dating website and video chatting with other women AGAIN, i have caught him doing this at least 5 times and on top of everything else, I had taken off my engagement ring out of anger and he said that I I should wait to wear it until HE thinks our relationship is better. 
Then he blames ME for him sexting other women. Says that if I didnt ignore him by being on my phone he wouldn't need to go on those sites, but he can be on his Xbox for 8 hours straight and that's fine but if I don't immediately get off my phone the Instant he wants attention he has a go at me, calling me a lazy slag or worse. 
Stupid me still loves him but when he tells me I'm his one and only, I want it to be TRUE. 
I havent slept in DAYS and I feel like I should just disappear and let him have his old life back 
All he has ever done is lie, cheat and break promises to me. I'm so done with EVERY relationship being like this. I just want to end it all."
1758,"Hi everyone, 

I’m new here and this is my first post, I hope that I came to the right place.
I have been dating my significant other for almost 5 years now and only 3 months into us dating, my loved one was at work when he went to open the safe and had steel boxes fall onto his head. That day everything changed. He suffered from a concussion and after test after test no doctor could really find anything “wrong” but we knew something was off. This hit of his head caused for some sort of imbalance and left him dealing with severe depression, anxiety, mood changes and suicidal thoughts. We’ve since had a child together and he is able to put on a happy face for our toddler but it tears me up inside seeing him deal with what we call the “black dog.” When the black dog comes he bites hard. There are nights where my s/o has left the house and I fear I will never see him again. His love for us is so strong but when you deal with depression as strong as his, no amount of love can make up for the amount of pain you go through each and every day. The pain to wake up and even just pull yourself out of bed let alone be present and active in your young child’s life or to be that loving, caring boyfriend. Our life changed on that day those boxes fell on my boyfriends head but my love for him remains and that is why I am here, to get guidance from you all.
It isn’t easy waking up not knowing which version of him I’ll be getting today but I need advice on how to best support him and make him feel loved while going through his depressive episodes. What are the best things to do, say? I always feel it is me but I know it is just the depression that is talking and I try to remind myself of that. I want him to feel that I understand him and am compassionate towards what he is going through. Please help me in how I can better do this. Thank you"

1761,"For some context, I’ve started to really buckle down and deal with my depression in the last four months. I see a therapist weekly and am taking medication – 200mg of Wellbutrin – and Seroquel for sleep. I have Major Depressive Disorder, which I’ve been dealing with on and off again since I was 18 (I’m 27 now).

But… I could use some advice.

I have a solid full-time job. I workout almost every day. And I’m not abusing substances or anything. I have a good life and a support system I’m working on building. I feel like I’m making progress, even if it is slow.

Regardless, on my worst days, I’ll wake up and feel as if all the color and vigor has been sucked out of the world. On the “best” (maybe I should say lightest) days of dealing with my depression, I feel very melancholy, but I can’t cry. I’m a sensitive person, and sometimes it feels as if these sad feelings will overwhelm me. They make me extremely uncomfortable and it can be really distressing when my day starts off in a low mood. It almost makes me feel like I’m choking inside…. if that even makes sense.

Sometimes stuff will trigger these feelings. For example, I was rewatching an old show I loved as a kid — Inuyasha. It’s pretty pulpy and goofy at this age, but I was having fun with it.

However, when the ending credits ran, a song played that made me extremely nostalgic and depressed, so much so that it ruined my mood for the rest of the day. I tried to go for a walk, but it didn’t really help that much. I’m also with my parents right now because of the whole COVID-19 thing, and I felt too embarrassed to tell my parents that an anime has brought up a lot of difficult feelings for me to handle.

The thing is – it was just a song – I feel as if I shouldn’t be so affected by media and art like this. Yes, art can create these feelings, but I guess I’m really struggling with how to process negative emotions like sadness, etc when they come up. I don’t want to give up stuff that I love and I do enjoy experiencing a wide variety of art, regardless of the tone. I guess I feel like something is wrong with me.

Here’s the song, by the way: 

I guess what I’m asking is

If any of you have felt like this when dealing with depressive feelings that feel like a lot, what do you do to find relief or process them?

Have any works of art, whether be a song or show or a novel, made you feel a wave of depression or melancholy that’s too much to handle? If they have, how do you work through this?

Thank so much for reading or for any advice. Anything helps!"
1762,"I have had concerns that I have depression for a year or two now (I’m not diagnosed) and my mental health has gotten a lot worse over the past few weeks because of school. I have gotten back into a bad habit of self harm and I just feel hopeless. 

I am not usually very open emotionally with my family, but recently I finally told my mother that I was struggling. She seemed to have genuine concern at the time, but now she isn’t taking me seriously anymore. I felt both sick and depressed when I woke up this morning and asked her if I could stay home from school tomorrow. She started yelling at me and saying that I’d already had several breaks this year and that I was just making an excuse. She’s not the type to say that depression isn’t real, but I feel like she doesn’t realize how bad it is for me right now and that I seriously need help.

I don’t know what to do to get her to understand how much I’m suffering right now. I thought that I’d expressed it to her, but she doesn’t seem to care anymore. I genuinely don’t know what to do because I NEED help and if I don’t get it soon it’s not going to be good. I don’t know what else to do besides something extreme as a cry for help."

In the real world my head feels continuously clouded by a dark presence. As if the will to move forward was extracted from my being at some point. My depression feels leaden. It seeps through my bones and permeates straight into the darkest corners of my soul. I am shrouded in darkness. Salvation lies just around the corner. No need to hurry though as  we will cease to exist soon enough. At least I can still forget my sorrows by dozing off. If only I could escape to the past, where days are brighter."
1765,"Hi everyone,

Need some input. I have been on antidepressants for over 30 years. Started in late 20s. Prozac,Zoloft,Paxil,Celexa,and for past 8 years Cymbalta. I just felt numbed out Even though I was only on 60mg. Blamed my weight gain and sexual dysfunction on the Cymbalta. I decided it was time to try life without an antidepressant. I took 8 months and weaned myself off very slowly from Cymbalta. 60 to 30 then opened capsules and started dividing out the granules until I finally was able to completely stop. I have been off for a couple months. In the past I had tried to stop and had horrible withdrawals, head zaps, nervous breakdown feeling, just awful. so I have successfully weaned off with little or no discomfort. So here’s the thing, it’s been a few months and I’m feeling agitated easily, hopeless, bored, no joy, pushing to get thru the day. Still no interest in sex ( my poor husband ) no weight loss, actually gained,even though I’m exercising and eating fairly well. I worked so hard to get off the medication. Should I give it more time ? I’m sure sheltering in place isn’t helping, but I’m in healthcare so I do go to work everyday. maybe One of the newer antidepressants would work better for me? I just don’t know what to do."

1768,"This is kind of embarrassing, but i'm wondering if anyone else can relate?

I grew up in an abusive family/community.  It was pretty much the norm, for many of us in our neighborhood.  We were poor, like everyone else, and made the best of it. And in many cases, poor and physical/sexual abuse went hand in hand.

I discovered books and reading.  And it was then, i discovered what is called Maladaptive Daydreaming.  Fairy tales were my trigger.

I was an ugly fat kid who was desperate for attention, and needed an outlet (other than food and being slapped around).  I think it was when i read the fairytale, Snow White or Cinderella - that i began ""day dreaming"".

That one day, whether it was at home, at school, in the cafeteria, didn't matter.  A knight, or a handsome man would ride up on a white horse or in a nice car, and take me away to a ""better place.""  In my daydreams, i was beautiful, was never bullied, and if i was, i banished my enemies or they rued the day they incurred my wrath.

Over time, my ""trigger material"" went from books, to stories from the Bible, guys in Church (usually pastors/preachers/elders), to finally seeing my handsome saviors on television, music videos and movies.  

Over time, i began to realize that this happened in the worst and even best times in my life.  I could be in the most abusive situations, be it, work, marriage, school, etc.?  But whenever i had that chance alone, or even any down time?  There i was fantasizing that i was someone else, with someone else, in another world where everything was perfect and stress free.

If things were going well?  There was always that ""impending doom"" that happiness never lasted long in reality - but it always ""happily ever after"" in my fantasies.

There were manifestations in real life.  i was becoming absolutely irritated and depressed.  The more i couldn't face life, the more i would fantasize how reality SHOULD be.. my husbands, boyfriends, friends, school, finances, etc.

I even remember being mentally or physically uncomfortable/frustrated/powerless many times - and wondering when that celebrity i always dreamed/read about was going to show up and rescue me. Surely, this fantasizing was leading up to something.  The celebrity/savior, of course, never did drive up in the limo with a dozen roses, and i had to learn to face life on life's terms.

Over the years, i learned it was called ""day dreaming"", ""fantasizing"".. which is for ""normal"" people who know when to turn it off, and on.  But not for those of us who actually use it as a coping mechanism.

For those who, like myself have an addictive/compulsive personality - (especially an over achiever), it was a place to escape whenever i could not face real life.:unsure:

I did notice, that the longer i stayed in my dream-world?  The harder it was to deal with people/places/things.  I even remember, thinking decades ago.. Maybe, just, maybe, that if i stayed in my fantasy world long enough? There might be a chance that i would never come back.. that must be the reward.

Well, it didn't work.  I'm here.  I learned to face reality over time.  And i'm here to tell you, that fantasizing is great, occasionally?  But in the long run, for every second that is used running away from life, the moment we come back?  Life doesn't just ""go away""..

1769,"I don’t know what to do for 2 years I have struggled with depression and anxiety. It’s treatment resistant and everyday is a struggle . I wake up early and have terror attacks in my stomach. I find it painful emotionally and today my head is fuzzy. I’m sick counting the hours until bedtime and I feel on my own. All mental health has stopped and I face a dilemma to continually have the mind torture or suiside. I don’t want either. I force my self to do things but my wife says you have become lazy which it appears that I am. I have had an assortment to tablets none work. I have no mood feel numb and hate being in the house and agitated when I’m out too. For 3 hrs this morning I prayed for relief. I think I need to be in hospital but have a lung condition so can’t. Every morning I force myself up, shower and my wife has started to say find something to do but what. The worst thing is I don’t enjoy anything at all. I have spoken to my nurse on the phone but it doesn’t help. I today and two days ago feel I can’t cope. I want to be in bed but hate that too."
1770,"I have struggled with severe anxiety and depression for most of my life. My depression has been really severe lately, but I have Ben trying to manage it. I recently found out that many many years ago, some of my distant relatives were murdered. My parents never told me because I was too young, and only one of my parents told me just now and I cannot tell the other parent I know what happened in her family. It was a brutal murder/suicide and children as young as 14 died (who I knew). The killer was also part of this distant family. It was an especially heinous crime, where the killer suffered from mental health issues (we suspect, but it is stigmatized in their family so we will never know for sure). No one else is dealing with this as they have known for well over a decade whereas I just found out. I didn't know them very well, but I remember them as a child and it is really hard for me especially since they were kids when they died. I haven't been able to sleep and I feel like my depression has worsened even further. Does anyone have any advice or comments on how I can get through this. I really can't talk to anyone about this, so anything said is helpful. Thank you"
1771,"I’ve been in my first and only long term (8.5 years) relationship with someone who I considered to be the only close person and best friend that I have, but that relationship ended 5 months ago as of this post, leaving me somewhat in a total mental sh*t storm.

Being my first breakup, I am not sure whether my mental state is within a healthy range, but I seem to have lost a certain sense of connecting with others, especially my family and mother, who I feel serious detachment from when conversing, even maintaining eye contact for both of us has become hard, even though both of us don't usually struggle with eye contact in general, and i often feel deep resentment and anger towards them and lash out for what to them appears to be no reason at all. 

Part of me likes to reason as to why i am having these feelings and blame it on their actions, but at the same time I wonder if mind being melodramatic and this is something that can be experienced after a breakup from a serious long term relationship?"
1772,"Ill cut to the chase. I met and have been talking with someone that I felt real feelings for. She doesn't feel the same way. Been crying now off and on for close to an hour. I thought we were forming a real connection. Good back and forth in conversations. Shared values and similar interests. Shared laughter at each others jokes. But then she tells me she doesnt see me as more than a friend and that we shouldnt spend any time together because it would be hard to remain just friends if I like her. Because spending time with her would only make me like her more, which is true. Why does no one ever feel for me like I do for them. Not once in my entire life has anyone regarded me in the same way. What am I doing wrong? How is it seemingly so easy for everyone else to have what I have never been able to find? I dont want to live this life alone but no one wants to share it with me. The irony is I will probably live to be 100 years old and hating every solitary minute of it."

1775,"I have struggled for years in a mentally, emotionally, verbally, and at times, physically abusive marriage.  Fear has kept me here.  At first, it was my only child who kept me here, but he is grown and on his own now.  Because of medical conditions, I stopped working and am financially dependent on my husband.  I feel trapped.  Being together 24/7 in lockdown has only served to intensify the verbal and mental abuse.   
Add to that, my mother, whom I cared for my entire adult life, falsely accused me of theft and elder abuse five years ago, even going so far as to make police reports on numerous occasions.  I had to hire a lawyer to defend myself from her utter, horrid lies.  We were so close before this happened as I am an only child and it was Mom and me against the world when my father abandoned us when I was 12.  What she did wounded me beyond anything I can describe here.  Were we not so close beforehand, maybe it wouldn't have hurt so much.  If I had not taken such good care of her needs before this, maybe I could understand.  All this because I tried, along with police and bank officials, to stop her from being scammed of any more of her hard earned money than she had already lost.  She hates me now and continues to spread horrible lies about me to all who will listen, including family...they all shun me now.  
My father passed several years ago (they had been divorced for years), so now I feel like an orphan without family.  His family shunned me because I dared bury him when he died.  He was the black sheep of his family and despised by all.  We didn't have much of a relationship after he totally abandoned Mom and me...his choice, not mine (he paid no child support whatsoever through the years).  Besides, most of the time I didn't know where he and his new wife were, or if they were even alive.  Both were alcoholics until their latter years.
What a set-up for abandonment issues, huh?  Well, it gets better.  I married right out of high school...it lasted all of ten months - he left me for a girl who was into drugs and partying, like him; I was a stick-in-the-mud.  I remarried and that lasted a year, until I found out he was going to strip clubs and screwing prostitutes in another city when I thought he was working.  Both marriages were abusive.  Thank goodness I didn't get pregnant.
I waited years before getting married again...and now this.  To top it all off, the son I adore and was SO close to when he was growing up, well, he never calls, only very occasionally emails or responds to my emails, never texts, won't video chat (he lives almost two hours away), always has plans when we want to visit, and when he does come over on holidays, he gets here real late, sleeps almost the entire time he's here (when he's not on his phone or computer), and leaves early.  It grieves me to have him treat me this way.  Yet again, I feel abandoned.
So, yeah, I am depressed.  Actually, I am beyond depressed at this point.  I'm just tired...bone weary...tired of everything in this poor excuse for a life.
Please excuse the length of this post and thanks, in advance, for taking the time to read it all if you've made it to this point.  Guess I needed to vent."

firstly i just want too say a big thank you too everyone who welcomed me here its been a really big relief knowing that someone maybe cares or that somewhere im welcomed i really do appreciate it greatly ❤
i hit quite a rough patch over the last year or so, i first experianced bad mental health when i was 13 until i was 16 and i felt like i was starting too get a grip on what i was living with and things were looking good, when i turned 18 i began too too get very down again and i started getting really really nervous of people and being around more then one person, i started isolating myself more and more because i felt like i didn't belong anywhere and that everyone hated me. the only time i would leave the house was too go too work and i would frequently get overwhelmed by the world around me. i carry alot of personal traumas with me that are constantly going through my head and i cant let them go :( everyone who i thought cared or had hope in me is gone and i feel so alone because i dont know who too turn too or what too do, all the support i thought i had is gone everything seems too be falling apart and theres noting i can do about it i feel totally hopeless and lost right now, im really sorry if this all sounds like a big sob story i really am sorry :(

So my sister is an amazing person. but sometimes she can be way too judgmental and self righteous. way too much.
She also judge me all the time and thinks she is better than me because she is more traditional and obeys the family rules.
sometimes I get enough of they way she judge me and people. so I find myself complaining to friends about her.
one time without noticing I ended up complaining to my classmate about her.
But I think my classmate knows my sister, So I felt really bad. It really sucks!

I can't believe I said something to other people that could make my sister look bad. I'm an adult now and even as a teenager I never made such a dumb mistake.

I feel like a terrible sister I feel so bad. =(

I am a 32 years old male.
I am struggling for more than 10 years with a sleep disorder.
What I experience is that I cant reach a deep sleep, so I don't have REM sleep for more than 10 years.
You can imagine I am constantly tired, and have been hospitalized several times for this.
I was working until 2015 as a software developer and stopped working because symptoms were becoming severe.
I know its my fault, I was losing nights working on different projects and worrying too much.
Since then, I saw different psychiatrists and all of them diagnosed me with major major depressive disorder.
I went through different scheme treatments and tried a lot of antidepressants and anti psychotics.
Now I am on olanzapine and cymbalta and it helps me a bit but still the sleep problem is unsolved.

I realized if I do some physical exercises I can relax better but still cant reach the REM sleep.
What are your thoughts on this and do you have any suggestions ? 
Thanks in advance !"

1786,"Hi All!

I have been prescribed fluoxetine a month ago and have yet to take them.

I was wondering (aside from mood) has anyone here experienced any positive changes to their personality after taking ssri anti-depressants?

More outgoing?
Feeling nicer towards people?
Feeling more like contacting people?
Less negative?
More optimistic?
Easier to concentrate?
Calmer?

I know some of those might seem more physical than personality based but they are just some things I hope would happen if I started my meds that I go through. Feel free to enlighten me of other things.

Thanks!"

1788,"This is not the first time a crisis this hard have happened. Someone who has experienced this knows that the day after the crisis you feel tired, dizzy, weak, hungry since you haven't been able to eat anything.

I know I get all serious and maybe stressful for them but it makes it harder to recover."

I can't do any thing right, Its just like I have fallen down a deep pit, I try to crawl out but as soon as I get near the top I'm pulled down again, I am just so pissed off with it all, It has bought back thoughts of suicide and my voices are urging me to do it, I can't eat much and I am getting about 4 hrs sleep at night."

1791,"I recently returned to my dads house, the other home i move between, and i thought i would have a better experience but for the first time in years i find myself wishing i was with my mom. My mom isn't the best person and she definitely wasn't a good influence on me growing up, while my dad always pushed me to be better, but at least she doesn't continuously berate me. Im finding that being in my fathers house, although i know they care about me, is only causing my depression and suicidal thoughts to worsen. I know its mostly my fault, my fault for disappointing them, my fault for falling so behind in schoolwork, my fault for not meeting their basic expectations, and i beat myself up for that. What they don't see is that although i hate myself everyday for the person i see myself becoming, i have close to zero drive or motivation to put in effort to change myself. My thoughts have become almost completely flooded with things like ""it'll be easier on everyone if i was just gone"" and ""they would be happier together without me"" and it hurts a lot because i know that for a time they would be sad, but it still remains true. At this point the only thing keeping me going is guilt and one person in my life who began to mean so much to me in so little time. However both are beginning to become obsolete. I see myself becoming indifferent to my surroundings. And to top it all off my parents are hyper fixating on ""keeping me safe"" and in doing do I've lost my privacy and now sleep in the living room on a mattress on the floor with 2 cameras on me at all times. In addition to that i can no longer contact the one person who means anything to me anymore because my contact to the outside world is being cut off. I'm only able to post here because in on a school borrowed laptop and they don't know I'm here. In any case, if i survive the next few weeks I think ill be proud of myself, and hey maybe i can full catch up on all my work like they so desperately want to force me to. Oh, also, i think the fact that they keep subtly bringing everything up has seeped into my brain because this morning, for the first time in my life, i had suicidal thoughts and such in my dreams. I don't know what that means for me but i guess we'll see. anyways, ill try to post on here as much as possible to provide myself with any sort of form of emotional release.

1794,"Hello all,

I’ve had mental health issues since I was 16 maybe earlier on in my life but my brain can’t seem to recall it.
My main problems at the moment are:
Depression
Anxiety
No Confidence
No Motivation
Diazepam addiction
And many more.

My body is badly scarred due to me not wanting to be here, I have tried to end my life so many times that I can’t even remember how many times at this point.

The past few nights the police and ambulance service has come to my house as my parents we’re scared for my well-being I harmed my legs.

The 2 years I’ve been on a Benzodiazepines called diazepam and I’ve been on it at least 25-40 times in the past 2 years and I’m now needing it more and more frequently and have started to mix with alcohol to one boost the affects and other who knows it might stop my breathing. I can’t deal without it anymore I feel.

I have been through this so many time’s I’m losing hope in my life completely all the therapy’s I’ve been to all the counselling I’ve tried it seems hopeless. I do want to end my life but I don’t have the balls to do it sober!!

I’ve also been to a psychiatric hospital in the past as I’ve been a severe risk to myself and I felt like I didn’t deserve/belong in a place like that.

The only thing on my mind at the moment is picking up more diazepam from the chemist and getting so drunk maybe then I’ll have the balls to do something I clearly won’t regret as my brain can only take so much.

So if a few things don’t make sense in here or incorrect spelling my minds abit cloudy/not in the right place at the moment.

P.S.        Can someone say something that’s magic so I can carry on with my never ending pain"

1797,"I made a massive mistake over a year ago. It broke my relationship, I lost everything.
In present time, my relationship is on the mend I think, tho sometimes it doesn't seem it. I feel my partner attacks me verbally by reminding me and always bringing up what I did. He tries to analyse why i did it. I've told him why I did it. But my answer isn't ever good enough. He wants it to be more than it was. And when he don't get that answer he tries to tell me how I was feeling and what I felt.
As a result each time we argue its over this. And i get to the point where I cannot take anymore. I used to self harm years ago, but I find myself having to self harm again as I cannot handle the situation being constantly thrown back in my face especially when he hasn't exactly been an angel. I feel I've been punished enough, I've very little contact with family, I have very little friends anymore, I've deleted all social media. I'm pretty much a loner so to speak now. But more recently I've been having more and more suicidal thoughts because of this. I think about ending my life, i wonder what would happen if I did. I know i wouldn't have to feel all this pain and hurt anymore. I wouldn't have to go through any of past reminders again. That would all stop. It wouldn't be there anymore. It would all go away. I know it's not the answer. I feel this reminder of my mistake is a permanent fixture. I will always be defined by it. I just want be end it one way or another."

1800,"Hi

Please I need help with finding what type of mental illness I suffer from. I've been suffering for many years, in fact from an early age. I'm grown up now having a family and still suffering.
I'm going to start with an example. I woke up this morning and saw that I have around 20 reflux (stomach acid) tablets left, and I know that when I finish those tablets I can go and ask the chemist for more. However
I started thinking bad about what if the chemist doesn't have any? then I said to myself get it from somewhere else. I kept telling myself that why do you think that you might not be able to purchase your tablet. I then started ruminating for a while until I found another subject to worry about. I have a lot of unwanted/intrusive thoughts as well. For example, when I'm trying to read my book, all of a sudden remember something which has happened 10-20 years ago. And I start worrying and thinking bad about it. Please let me give you another example. I was reading my book yesterday
and then all of a sudden I remembered that someone from the previous company brought an external hard drive to me and said that this is a present for someone, and asked me if he needs to
do anything to set it up. I replied, no these hard drives are plug and play. I'm sure I was right. However, after nearly 5 years it came to my head yesterday morning and 
I started worrying that I might have given him the wrong info. As you can see, I think about the stuff that not important at all and they've happened while ago. I have these issues almost all day, and it is very painful. I think I have a mixture of OCD, depression, and anxiety. However, I do highly appreciated it if someone tells me exactly what type of mental illness I'm suffering from.

Many thanks"
1801,"Hello. I'm new here. I don't know where to start. Recently I've been really struggling, with life, thoughts and existence  
Probably sounds familiar and what everyone says
I say recently, I've struggled since I was around 14 or 15. Self harm helped, I got over it on my own in a sense. Its was always there though, like a craving. It never really goes but like a volcano on the end it lies dormant until one day  it's ready to errupt 

I'm now 33 and within the very last few years I've really struggled. But nothing like this.
I have a family,  one daughter who is my world  and a daughter who has ebd adhd and asd it's a very tough time at home
In the very last few months I've felt very, very down, I think most  may really understand how this feels
   suicide is and has been on my mind almost all of the time which I've become used to, I don't  know of that is normal, or what normal  is to an extent.
My girlfriend knows little about my mental health, I've been to a doctor but feel judged I've tried happy pills. None of which help. I've be judged by people and people cast judge upon my life.
I don't want to seem to be weak or have people look down at me as weak which is why my girlfriend of nearly 9 years still doesn't know everything or why I don't go to my doctors 
I don't know how to get passed this  stage of life at the moment. I feel useless, I feel I haven't unaccomplished I worthless and I feel really depressed, like never before. I have a massive anger problem, maybe because of how  I feel. 
Suicide is on my mind more than usual. I don't think I would ever go threw with it but I keep weighing up everything and the thoughts and ideas get worse each time"
1802,"Not sure what to say really.

I think I might be still depressed following a bout of psychosis which began in February. About two weeks ago I began giving away prized possessions and money. I was ready to do something pretty rash (not sure if I wanted to run away, which I couldn't due to lockdown or if I wanted to make an attempt to end my life - I was very confused). Thing is, I am still struggling with a lot of negative thoughts. 

I take a lot of medications and always although my antidepressant was okay, I take Pristiq 200mg for severe depression. I am struggling with motivation a lot and have been self medicating (I guess for a better word) with alcohol off and on (more on than not). I still exercise, but only because I am forced to by my exercise physiologist. I feel sorry for her having a downturn in business with the COVID-19 saga. 

I hardly speak to my family, my wife and mother in law yes (because I live with them), but any other family members no. I haven't spoken to my Dad (my only member of my immediate family left) in some time. I miss him but he has me on caller block on his phone so there's not much I can do except wait for him to call. I wrote him a letter once, but my stepmother intercepted it before it got to him unfortunately. She is the woman when I was aged just 12, told me to my face that I should do everyone a favour and kill myself. I have never ever forgotten that. 

Sometimes I would if I should do everyone a favour sometimes. 

I cry where nobody sees. I lack motivation. I have erratic sleep (either too much or not enough). My anxiety is always through the roof but that is another story. 

I see my psychiatrist on 12 May. I am going to beg him to do something I think."
1803,Not having anyone to talk to you and understands you is really tough. How could someone cope with it as each event will cause a trauma?
1804,"What was the start that you remember where things went down hill? I had a normal life until around 17 and I was self conscious about my appearance and it started sever depression and social anxiety in myself. I avoided friends, eventually quit work and just wanted to be by myself. I can say that was the start for me how about you?"
1805,"I know I said I felt better, but now I just feel strange and upset again. I was just thinking that I'll never be happy with my life. It's like a constant reminder. I keep saying how things have improved over the years, but I don't think I'll ever truly feel like my life is what I want it to be. I know it's unexpected, and you can't control everything, but nothing seems to be going my way. Even if I try really hard, the results are usually disappointing.

When it comes to school, I never finished high school since I gave up on it. I'm in my 20s now, trying to focus on my education again, and my parents are happy for me because they see a lot of improvement. But I can't help but wonder about how I'm so lost in my life because everyone around my age is ahead of me. Like not very long ago, I saw one of the people who used to bully me at school online on her social media and she's travelling and studying in a great university. She went to a beautiful art school and is doing stuff with animation. That's what I always wanted to do, and I can't help but feel jealous. Back when we were in school, she always seemed to be supported with her drawings while everyone laughed at me for dreaming about being an artist. There were other bullies I saw online too who are now successful. I'm currently trying to avoid seeing their social media and just focus on my own life.

Jealousy is almost always there. I constantly compare myself to others. It's like being trapped in time and watching the world move on without you or something. And you get to see the people who treated you terribly move on and be happy.

I'm so happy I have my parents because I love them both. They always tell me to just focus on myself and my health, and to not worry about someone who I don't even know anymore. I agree that I should do that, but the depressing thoughts keep returning. My parents also support me with my drawings, telling me to continue doing what makes me happy, which I'm very thankful for. I feel so guilty whenever I feel depressed.

Sorry for writing so much."
1806,"The depression we are feeling in our modern world is caused by the void created by the conditions of our existence. Our conditions of existence are based on our mode of production. The way we produce and share our goods and our services. In short: Capitalism. We feel empty and ripped off because the way we ""make a living"" is alienating. Where do you spend the most of your waking hours? at the job. The job is where you ""live"". But here comes the important part. You work only for your survival. Even if you love your job you still work for yourself. Thats the alienating part . Why ?? Because only working for yourself is Not fulfilling. Humans need an higher purpose. Thats exactly what we dont have. All we have is an individual purpose. We do not have a social project. Don't believe me ? Close your eyes and imagine you are a janitor working from 9 to 5 to clean hospitals. Every 2 weeks you get paid and the next week you restart all over . Thats it . nothing more, nothing less. After a certain amount of time you will feel anxiety and depression because there is no higher purpose. Now imagine the same janitor with the same working hours but this time you are working for the glory of your nation, you are allowed to discussed about how your work should be done,  you have the right to truly participate in your productive work.... you feel less alienated...You want to go to work because you feel needed .... You stop thinking about yourself and start thinking about others because they need you....           I struggle with depression and ocd for 23 years. I truly believe that the only way to regain our sanity is by changing this system so that life can do what it is supposed to do : Live."
1807,I’m really really sad that I’m thinking about suicide. I just don’t think I was ever meant to be happy. I’ve been struggling with mental illness for years now and I’m just not strong enough for this world. That’s life though I guess.
1808,"I've been diagnosed with major depression since I was about 13. I'm 36 and still dealing with it as hard as ever. I have issues with addictions that have spiraled out of control several times in the past. Suicidal thoughts occur almost constantly. I am married (going on 13 years) and have 2 girls -a teen and a toddler. We live with my in-laws. That is my mother in-law, brother in-law and sister in-law. Without getting into it at the moment, each and every individual is dealing with a form of severe mental illness and/or trauma. I feel that living with these people -especially my mother in-law is the absolute worst thing for my mental health and it negatively affects my children's development as well. I have zero control in the household. There is a very clear hierarchy and I am nowhere near the top despite being a main provider and the father of 2 children. My wife and I have a great relationship but I feel that this living arrangement (which by the way has been the assumed ""norm"" on and off for the majority of our marriage) is a great threat to us and our ability to build and maintain a healthy family of our own. I have no idea what to do. My wife doesn't want to move because we support my mother in-law and brother in-law (Who cannot work or live on his own) my sister in-law will eventually move in with her boyfriend and my wife and I are expected to carry the burden of everyone else (mom in-law, brother in-law) not only am I powerless in the household and mostly with raising my kids, I feel completely alienated from everyone and very uncomfortable every day. I have nothing of my own. I don't feel like this is my home and I wish it could change. I don't know what to do."
1809,Would like some help
1810,Feel like I'm crashing again and don't want to .. any help please!
1811,"The past month I've been at home in quarantine with my lovely girlfriend and future wife and our pets. My job in sales drives me crazy and I have a stress inducing narcissistic boss. I have been there too long and need to leave but that's a story for another day. While the World was crumbling around us the past several weeks I've been thriving. I work from home daily but the fact I did not have to go into our office at all the place where just pulling around the corner I get gut punching anxiety. It's been so peaceful, free and wonderful at home. I sleep through the night for the first time in years. But....it's now all ending soon and the storm that awaits are all the things that are already beginning to give me anxiety and depression. 

The topic I wanted to ask today is regarding nostalgia. I caught myself doing something today and realize it's something I've always done, even as a kid. I'm not sure if anyone else does but it sure is horrible to do to myself. 

The last several weeks I've taken pictures of my girlfriend, of my pets, of all of us together, of funny moments, of us hunkering down, of our walks, of innocent moments on a weekday sitting outside in the sun, working from the front porch with my computer while our little cat sits at my feet content to be in the fresh air. Normally in a moment like that on a day like that I'd be in that office probably with gut wrenching anxiety dreading the day away. 

When I look at these photos, of course I'm happy and love them but they are painful. I see the dates of they were taken April 7th, 10am, April 11th 2pm and think to myself, god I wish it were still that moment. I wish I still had time to enjoy this peaceful time in my life. I wonder, did I truly appreciate it enough in that moment? I badger myself by saying, on any other day at that time I'd be in the office. This was something that's almost over and it went so fast.  I wonder if our pets will miss us when we aren't here all day. I will miss the friends and family members I reconnected with and a time when I didn't have a job and a boss that make me question my confidence and purpose daily.  I was free for these days and when I see a receipt with date on it where I left mid morning to buy a coffee (something I could never do in the office) I can almost feel the carefree joy of that day when I drove there to buy it. Still weeks left of no worries but that time went so fast. 

I hate how I can take these memories and end up using them to make myself feel awful and sad. I often times have to remove them from my phone and put them on my external hard drive, preserved but not in sight.

Does anyone else do these things? For me it's photos, it's receipts with a place or a date on it that triggers a time period or memory. And I just had a lot of them th past month. 

Kind of weird isn't it? The person who is normally anxious, stressed out, on edge, depressed at time and beaten down by this job and career I can't seem to escape.....found total bliss and peace and a total pause from either anxiety or depression while the entire world was crumbling around me.  

I assume that is my inner soul trying to show me the light. LEAVE THIS JOB.  
I'm certainly going to try."
1812,"Can it recover? I am so scare, I already took pristiq back three weeks And doctor told me to eat half of Rivotril, It makes sight fuzzy, memory gets worst and lost concentration. I scare that I will being crazy. Someone who is suffering like me?"
1813,"For the first 2-3 days I mostly ended up sleeping over all day long because of Bensedin (Diazepam). After that is where things get weird again, basically all 4 psychiatrist I went to prescribed me Zoloft among other things, and 3 of them, my own doctor and internet all claim zoloft isn't suppose to start having effect up till at least two weeks and can often take even up till 6 for it to start working, for me it started having effect right after 3-4 days, up till few days ago I felt great, emotionally/depression wise I felt nearly as good as on low doze of speed, just without all the side effects, my anxiety nearly disapired (although Bensedin probably played a rule in this part as well). Than few days ago effects dropped drastically,  I range from not felling depressed but not  felling happy eater, not felling anything at all, being somewhat depressed, and than there are episodes where I get severely depressed even way more than before, I get serious suicidal ideas, I always had such ideas for over 10 years, but I never had guts to do it as I always had severe fear of possibility of complete non existence since childhood, only wish to end it all, end the suffering that most of my whole life was and is,
during those episodes I get depressed enough that I think it doesn't metier anymore, and yesterday I had full intention to end it all soon, just to take a few more days to do few last thing, I really thought I was going to go thru with it this time.
Those episodes don't last long, usually between 30min-2h but they are really bad, I fear one of them might be my last and I don't know what to do in those situation. Because of Korona public transport is closed down and as I don't own a car I also can't visit any psychiatrist/psychologist and none exist anywhere near me (The closest psychiatry is around 30km away from me). The only ideas I got is ether to take a very small dose of speed when I get those episodes, just enough to make me fell better while they  pass, but I couldn't find much information on what to expect if I ware to mix those two, not to mention other two, to take extra dose to fall asleep and sleep over those episodes, but this would pose problem when I end up not having enough of them for regular use, not  to mention mess up my sleeping scheduled, or to try taking an extra dose of a different medication as while I am prescribe it to take it in 1/3rds to help me with sleep it's main purpose is still SSRI like Zoloft so it might fight of depression from Zoloft, but this is just my own hypothesis, not to mention there would still be problem with not having enough of them for regular use just like with Bensedin, or to take extra doze of Zoloft hoping it would increase positive effect not negative ones just like recreational drugs usually do, but this poses the same problem as taking extra dose of Trittico.
If anyone thinks any of those are good ideas, or has any better ones please do tell me."
1814,I’m not feeling that great at the moment. Life is really hard in lockdown like it will be for a lot of people. Today I contacted a helpline as I was feeling really low and maybe a bit suicidal. The person said they were going to get a crisis team to come and get me. I panicked as I didn’t want that to happen but I know I’m in a really bad place. I just need someone to talk to who knows what I’m going through so thanks to whoever  is reading this
1815,"Hi everyone, I’m new here. I’m Irish and live in the US. I’ve had depression all my life. I’m 45 now and the older I get the worse it seems to get and also the episodes are lasting much longer than they used to.
I was diagnosed with MDD and I’m also treatment resistant. I’ve been in every medication there is. I’ve also had ECT, TMS and Ketamine infusions - nothing has worked. I’ve been hospitalized more times than I care to remember.
This past year has been awful. I was in bed for a lot of it and had to quit working and lost my home. I had to give my 9 & 6 year old girls to their dad because I’m not able to take care of them and that destroys my soul every day but I’m no good to them when I’m so sick. I recently spent 5 weeks in hospital and now I’m staying with family and they have been extremely supportive and are helping me try to heal my soul.

I worry I’ll be in this torment forever. I have very little energy and I cry all the time. All I want to do is be in bed or on the couch. Some days I want to die but refuse to let depression win and refuse to leave my babies without a mother. Maybe some day I’ll recover and maybe I won’t.

I feel so different to other people who can do normal stuff like making their bed or washing dishes and I envy them so much. I’m in so much pain all the time.

I’m glad I’m here though with people who get it because other people just don’t understand and I tend to live in isolation when living alone.

I hope you’re all keeping safe out there!

1816,"I started to feel what I believe to be a quarter-life crisis because I had a moment of sheer panic about what I'm doing with my life, especially with my health. I'm in my early 20's and am what you'd consider being the picture of health, minus lack of mental wellness. Yet, ever since I had that panic feeling from the food I was eating over the weekend, I've become obsessive about the amount of food I was eating. I've quit coffee completely, (about 5 days ago) without cutting the dose, I just stopped. Now I'm back to my non-caffeinated tea each morning or evening. I'm convinced that drinking coffee for 4 days straight and eating chips on the same day would be enough to kill me.

Since then, I haven't been eating as much, only twice a day if I'm lucky. I'm overly cautious about what I eat or how much I eat because I'm afraid of gaining more weight. I feel like eating food can only lead to bad outcomes and I don't want to risk something benign becoming my sworn enemy. This pandemic has made me paranoid about the true state of my health and has made it hard to live day to day constantly analyzing all the food in my fridge. I honestly don't know what to do, but my appetite is gone."
1817,"Trying to keep this short, but after 30+ years of depression, I know also have MDD, GAD, and an adjustment disorder, that i know of so far.
Love of my life tossed me aside and ran away to Cali to be with her ""true love"", I am not capable of performing well at my job and in fear of getting laid off, and i am in severe debt.
Given all of this, when everything in my head is telling me that there is no coming back from this, that the ""life"" i have led is wasted time, squandered potential, and pointless, that theres no point in fighting because just as I have never really been ok, i never will be, that my memory loss and inability to learn is permanent, that i am unlovable, unworthy, and if anything my wife saved herself by leaving.....all of this pounding in my head every second of every day...that its impossible to become whatever i need to be to improve, even just to be able to reasonably function...
Is all of this really the demon disease talking, or at some point do you just have to accept that your life could have been ok and purposeful, but that in my heart i am just too much of a piece of shit coward to dare to even try to fight.
You tell me....is all of that the demon? 
Even if so, isnt it possible that he's right, that he has finally won, that he has utterly succeeded in the goal of giving me just enough to know what happiness is just to make the agony that much worse for having a base of comparison.
I appreciate all of the kindness and platitudes from people telling me it will be okay, but it can only ever be okay if i fight to make it that way, and how can i do that when i am too weak and too much of a worthless loser to effectively fight against the inevitable, absolute power of the demon, the demon that is, in fact, me?
I'm lost in this, sorry to dump this on all of you but I am desparate for any sign that my entire existence hasnt been a complete cosmic waste leading to this dead end of constant agony and self hatred."
1818,Hi everyone. Recently joined the forum and it helped me a lot. Got out of the place I was in and felt a bit better in myself. However I’ve noticed little things about myself and how I act that makes me feel like I’m falling back into it. Hope you’re all keeping safe and well.
1819,"Hey everyone! 

Is it just me or is anyone else struggling with the lockdown now?"
1820,"I just don't know how to get this right,I am really very very depressed one day and fine the other.Ever since my crush broke my heart my dating someone else,I am just not right.I have been taking it really personally.Its good that I have been working on myself and getting to know myself deeply but I really feel like a loser for being single ever since birth.Whenever I do like a girl,I end with my heart being broken.I just feel empty from inside and don't have any passion to anything for my career.

It kills me from inside that I have spent 18(I am going to turn 19 in a few days) years single without being bothered,now it hurts real bad.I think I am a very good guy with average looks but just not loveable.I definitely will get someone in future but too late.I wasted all my teens in studies and for my grades and never socialized and got a girlfriend.
Now I am 19(almost) and I won't have time going after relationships bcoz I am busy in my career.I am feeling jealousy and self doubt to people who are in relationships.
What kills me more is that most of the people get in relationships and lose their virginity in college itself,while I can't do that.I know people have said that It does not matter but ,I hate myself for being a virgin,I just didn't spend enough time after girls.I just hate myself for being single all these years and I think it will be long till I lose my virginity.
I just can't talk to my friends who lost virginity,I kind of hate it and feel that I am just not capable of it.It was ok if they were ""bad guys"" type of people but I see even decent and good guys/girls have got into relationships and then lost their virginity(this just kills me from inside)"
1821,"Hi everyone, this is my first post. I don't know what I expect from doing this but I'm desperate and need someone to talk to. I've been battling with depression for years now but the past 1 or 2 has been horrendous. 

I have a good life in that there are no particular stressors but for some reason I do not enjoy my existence. 

Things have got harder recently as it has started taking it's toll on my husband. This is extremely hard because previously he was such a big support but now his compassion has worn thin ( not with bad intention but just that natural drained reaction that develops when living with someone with depression). His responses to me makes me feel even more terrible and kind of provides my depression with the evidence it needs to prove that i am a burden! As a result I am also closing myself off and not speaking to him about my mental health. I now feel I am pretending to everyone that I am happy and it is exhausting. 

I feel I am only existing because of my family and the damage I know it would do to them if I wasn't here... but I also feel like I am a drain being present. 

Any thoughts are appreciated.. Thank you in advance"
1822,"Hi all,

Just wondering if anyone has experienced this before and any advice if you have?

I am reducing my Sertraline dose gradually and recently went down to 50mg (less than the min dose).

I have notice I now can’t sleep and it is very specific. So I am really tired but in the phase between wake and sleep my mind is hoping from one bizarre thing to the other rapidly until I jump from my sleep in a total sweat (despite not being hot at all).

Now other things are happening at the same time, was in labour/gave birth during these episodes. So the connection Could lie there too.

Anyone else experience this coming off Sertraline. Support would be fantastic! Thanks"
1823,"Ok, long story short, I always had nasal obstruction, due to a deviated septum. My mother had the same problem, and would use some nasal drops containing dexamethasone, a corticosteroid.

I started using too when I was 9 years old, due to the nasal obstruction. When I was 11 years old, I developed a condition called Cushing’s Syndrome, which it was caused by the corticosteroid overuse. I became fat and my growth stopped till 13 years old, which it was the time that I found out that my growth was being stunted and then I developed adrenal insufficiency, due to abrupt withdrawal.

The doctors explained to me the effects of corticosteroids, and told me that the medication had only delayed my growth, and that I would catch up and probably be 5’9 when I reached about 19 years old.

I was exactly 5 feet tall at this time, they gave me prednisone, to restore my adrenal glands function and I grew quickly to almost 5’3. The next year, I didn’t grow one single inch, and then the next one, I grew to 5’5 and my growth plates closed and doctors told me that this was my final height.

I kept living my life with the hope of growing, but when I reached the age of 20, I was looking at my small hands and kinda was thinking why they were so small, comparing to other people who had shorter parents than me.

So I became extremely depressed, because I found out that it was all due to the corticosteroid medication that I took during puberty.

My father is 5’11 and my mother is 5’2, I was always the same height of my peers who attained a height of 5’10, so I guess this would probably be my height.

I was never of similar height again after the effects of the corticosteroids.

To become even worse, I found out after reading an article about lupus, that all the males who used prednisone during puberty, had smaller genitals than healthy patients.

My penis is 5.5 inches length and very skinny 4.5 girth.

How do I accept that I will have a diferent life due to a medication?

A girl might not find me as attractive as she would, if I had a larger penis and was taller. This medication fucked my life. I don't want to whine, but this has been deeply affecting my life. And i'm also very shy, so these two more complexes are making my head explode. I need help.

I raged at my mother for giving me the medication.
And now I think that God hates me for allowing this to happen.

Every time that I get intimate with a girl, I’ll be thinking that she is not looking at my real penis, she is looking at a chemical result. The same thing about my height. Not to mention, that I would have much more muscle mass, since corticosteroids affect bone density.

My doctor confirmed that I’m right and to prove that I’m right, just search “Iatrogenic Cushing’s Syndrome nasal drops”. You will see several cases like mine, with dexamethasone and betamethasone nasal drops.

How do I accept this? I would probably be much more attractive and people would respect me more.
I would never have been called short, and neither my penis would be called skinny.
I dream every night of a girl cheating on me because of my height and my skinny penis. I will never have the experience of having a girl craving for my penis like she would do for a girthy penis.
To add more, when I was an infant, some friends of the family commented that I had a big penis for a baby.
I think about this 24/7.

Just how? I really need help. I am desperate.

Sorry about the bad english."
1824,My SSRI has not worked in forever it's hard to say weather they work or not because they give u this dull numb feeling. I can say the first few months on them was great and than I just felt not bad but not good a numb feeling. Regardless even if I upped the dose. One day after drinking I started getting shaky and panicing and hyperventilating. Use to only happen from alcohol but than shortly even sugary foods or carbs would bring on those symptoms. Been to the doctor for it and EKG and blood tests are fine. It's confusing figuring out what's wrong. So I've been chalking it up to SSRIs no longer working. The problem is I tried 3 other antidepressants and no luck. These days I take .5 mg of Ativan twice a day and that's been the only thing to keep me afloat! Although I was on SSRIs for 10 years now I'm really thinking what they can possably do to ur seratonin production. If they're no longer working and multiple ones don't work I'm sure it's to do with the fact of your receptors trying to block seratonin THATS NOLONGER being produced from the drug. They can help initially but when u stop the reuptake of seratonin it signals ur brain to make less of it. Like it sets out your brain....Ive been looking into doses of 300mg of lithium which appears to be great for the brain in a low dose. Higher doses of 900mg tho can be toxic I'm NOT talking about high doses of lithium. I'll be experiementing with a few things to get me out of this out any input please comment
1825,"Oh and yea, I should probably mention all other mental problems I have/had and their status (Note that those are self-diagnosed, but as mentioned before probably more professional than those I got diagnosed by those ""Specialists"")
- Mild depression since childhood that worsened as I was getting older. (State already described in text above)
- Anxiety that I developed somewhere during age of high-school (around the same time my depression started worsening) that also worsened over time (State already described in text above)
- Life long low self-esteem (with exception of intelligence in witch I am rather arrogant about) that also worsened as I got older (Had periods and episodes of improvement, but currently worse than ever)
- OCD constantly triple-check everything, especially things I have in my pockets witch when out of house I sometimes check up to every 10-15 minutes, always double-checking (Gotten significantly better since I started therapy, probably from relaxation caused by Bensedin (Diazepam))
- Constant random mood changes (Although I would still be depressed most of the time there ware often short episodes where I would randomly feel different emotions, depression it self would often too randomly change in kind and severity, sometimes I would get short euphoric and/or manic episodes as well, usually not lasting for long 30min-2h) and over-emotional responses to everything (Bad, expecialiy lately, aside from mood even my personality and opinions started getting random changes in episodes)
- Health anxiety developed about 2 years ego after I got seriously sick from coffee (Unsure why), had constant irrational fears, especially of poisoning, illness and allergies. (Used to be extremely bad, the worst/most unpleasant mental health problem I had, currently nearly completely solved)
- Sleeping disorder, sometimes I couldn't sleep for days, other times I would sleep like 14h-18h straight every day for no reason, Sometimes I would be sleepy all day long but sleep very shortly when I fall asleep 3h-4h so I would sleep fore few hours than be awake for few hours before going to sleep again and that would repeat for all day/night long, even when I would sleep normally hours wise I would never have a nice rest from sleep and would usually be tired from it. (This lasted for several years but about some over a year ago started drastically improving all on it's own with exception of last one, and that one mostly got solved since I started taking therapy)
- Recently started forgetfulness, while I always had extremely good memory and still mostly do, I would often find myself having ""holes"" in my memory, like remembering something being said but couldn't remember even if it was said around me, in my dreams, if it was part of my fantasy or if it something I heard in some video. Sometimes I would put some item somewhere and immediately forget where I put it, my memory of it would be completely erased even after I menage to find it. Sometimes I would start doing something and in mid doing it temporarily forget what I was doing, sometimes remembering things or thinking felt like strugiling to find thoughts/memories true a fog. It has many similarities with forgetfulness coming from old age but I am way too young to have it being in my mid 20s. 
- Having a pretty severe case of complex of being too old despite being in my mid 20's.
- Having a paranoia, believing people in my physical close aproximetry are talking about me, mostly badly, I can nearly hear them (Up till recently I could easily make a difference between things I hear and think I heard, recently not so much), additionally I always tend to think that everyone around me is working against me (it's an actual fact that people around me are liars, liaing me constantly) and that nobody likes me (Having a personal conspiracy theories regarding my ""social life""). (Recently I can't tell what is real and what not).
- In my teenage years i had something a long the lines of DID, I had away lived double triple lives and had multiple personalities, those weren't just masks, my opinions and views would completely change to fit with people around me. When alone I would sometimes argue in my head between those personalities. (I believed this pasted around the time I entered my 20's, but it turned around it just temporally stopped cause I put all my social life on hold, and once I started having social life again around a year ago some mild symptoms of this started to return).
- I had gender dysphoria for a few years that passed around a year ago when I made few female friends/acquaintances and realized I don't have to physically be a girl to be ""one of the girls"" true I still think my life would be better if I was born a girl.
- I have/had a sense of dizziness, dream like state and unrealnes most of the time in different severity. Ever since I was a kid, growing up come with a sense of losing realness, like the world was becoming less 3-dimensional, less graphical/detailed, less vivid, less real. (This only ever continued worsening thru out my life)
- I don't relate to my physical looks or my life at all, like this is not really me, like I am just a bystander watching my life, controlling it from aside like a character in a video game I am role playing it but it's not really me nor my actual life. In my dreams I am nearly never me, I am eater some completely different character or me from childhood. Sometimes there are periods when I would also run on ""Autopilot"" and in those instances this syndrome would be at it's worse.
- I would often get lost in thoughts, eater thinking or fantasizing/day dreaming for a long periods of time raging anywhere from few hours to several days straight. And when I get in this ""mood"" it's not something I can stop willingly. (This has also improved since I started with therapy, true there  where some slight improvements even before that in a span of the last year)
- After going for long periods without any sleep I would start to have hallucinations, mild hallucinations would usually start around 3rd day without any sleep and worsen from there. Hallucinations would completely disapire after I get some sleep. 



Also some physical/social problems I have/had that definitely affect my mental state 
- As a child I was beaten up by my father and severely trained to be manly, for example I was forbidden to cry, if father saw me crying he would beat me up until I stopped crying (Cause real man don't cry and can handle pain manly), for a time I was crying in secret, locking myself in a bathroom and stuffing my face in towels to help me suppress sounds of crying, until I learned to hold back the tears.
- I was both sheltered and neglected at a same time while growing up (My father was a control freak witch is why I was sheltered and ignorant about the world, but my parents never loved me or really talked to me so I was neglected)
- I never had any privacy during most of my life.
- I was raised in an extremely conservative neighborhood with a very high crime rate.
- I never really had any friends up till just before high-school age, and even than I never really had any real friends I could talk to, just people to hang out with but nobody I was close enough with to have serious talks.
- Around the age of high-school I drinked, smoked, got into fights, and done drugs.
- I never had a romantic partner, not that I didn't flirt and had people show interest in me, I was just always a huge romantic and always wanted to fall in love not be with just anyone (And up till now that only happened twice and nether of those times I could start a relationship with them). 
- I am probably eater Asexual or demisexual, romantically I am mostly interested in girls with few rare exceptions.
- I dropped from high-school in second year cause I just couldn't bother to go to classes. (Originally planed to finish it latter in an irregular way where I would self study at home and just go to exams, but it never come to that). 
- I stopped going out and hanging out with friends at age 18 after witch I spend the next 5-6 years as NEET spending most of all of my time on PC, mostly watching Anime, Reading VNs and playing games and JRPGs as well as hanging out on online forums related to anime. Exceptions ware rare and short family diner gatherings at witch we would usually just talk about a ""weather"".
- Somewhere around mid of that time I also stopped talking/hanging out with people online because of extreme anger and frustration caused by extreme oversexulization of everything often present at such forums. It was also around this time that my mental state started to drastically worsen.
- During this period of 5-6 years I lived in a huge poverty, having just enough money to barely get by, I was often going hungry, sometimes going for several days without having anything to eat. Because of this I would never thrown away any food and eat even things that had clearly gone bad, or that ware previously eaten by mouses, somehow I never got any serious food poisoning. The only time I got seriously sick was when I drinked huge amounts of coffee after not eating anything for nearly a week (As I read online that coffee can help relive feelings of hunger) and that was when I developed a serious case of health anxiety.
- Some year ago or so I met some of my old friends for the first time after 5-6 years, I hanged out with them a few times just for the sake of old times, but I ended up meting one of their new female friends and I really hit it off with her like with nobody ever before. I quickly opened up to her and we become close. It was a first time I really talked with anyone in my life, that I had anyone who would actually lessen to me. This made me start to go out again and hang out with her and true her with my old friends. (This drastically improved my mental health)
- Some 5-6 mounts ago I screwed up and got that female friend really angry at me and it was over between us.
- Currently I have absolutely nobody to talk to, online or offline (Since the last 5-6 months).
- Curently I am still co-owning a yard and two houses with my father with who I am in terrible relationship, we had been trying to sell those houses for years now and go our separate ways as neither of us can stand to even see the other one but up till now we had no success."
1826,Lack of concentration is that normal?
1827,"Went out to the grocery store today and got in line after shopping. I didn’t know this man was in line because he was super far away (more than 6ft), so supposedly I had accidentally gotten in front of him. He told me he was in line in a really nasty way. I’ve been feeling extremely down recently and I feel like it just kicked me down further.
Wish I wasn’t so fragile right now. 😶😔"
1828,"I'm on my 6th day taking celexa I use to take it years ago and I'm on and valium. my anxiety is reduced but I am beyond depressed no will to get up, no interest in anything, I feel dead!!"
1829,dont no y but have not taken my meds for about 3 months. to be honest am just  can't be bothered. just let me have a massive heart attack and dies.
1830,"So I've really have been trying for years to get help for my mental disorders, my doctor can't increase my meds cause I need to get psychiatric help and get evaluated from them but my insurance doesnt cover mental health counseling so I really dont know where to go to get help. Like I've been having breakdowns nonstop for weeks and I just dont have anyone to go to. I just help and someone listen. 

Can yall recommend some things that can help with these breakdowns since my help options are slim?"
1831,Hi I'm 28 and i split up with my partner of 6 years a week ago and have a 5 year old daughter with her. I still live in the same house still but I never see anyone I sleep on the sofa and everyone has fallen out with me  even people I thought was close friends which I classed as family. I can never seem to do anything right I just feel lost inside and lonely I don't want to be around any more
1832,"I'm just coming out of a really nasty depression which left me in bed for most of the day and drinking in the evenings just to try to get the pain to stop for a bit. I was trying to work out what triggered it this time. I gave up sugar last year and have been suffering way less that I used to.

Anyway, the one thing which did happen just before the depression kicked in was a really bad week of hayfever where I live (SW London). Even with the windows closed I was waking up unbelievably itchy and tablets were no help. At one point I was even wearing workshop glasses to stop my eyes itching.

I've heard theories that the hayfever reaction may cause depression in some people because of what goes on in the body during the immune response. It may also just be that it messes up your sleep so badly, I woke a few times with a blocked nose. Just wondered if anybody else had experienced this."
1833,"This may be triggering if you yourself have suffered rape/sexual abuse.
———————————

So today I was watching the news and I saw the story of the guy who’s been spiking drinks and raping a load of men!!! it really triggered me! And that is from the most recent rape/abuse (not sure which to call it) that’s happened to me.

I was sexually abused as child a few times. I had unintentionally learnt a coping mechanism
Which means I had (and still have) a repressed memory growing up into my teens and early 20s. I met my “first love”, who soon became my husband, soon became father of my Children and I was able to live a generally normal life without the trauma or emotional affects of abuse come in (happened very rarely). 

After 10 years, we got divorced I was a little all over the place, I dated, not sure of what I wanted. 

(I should add I’m currently 31, I met him at 16, married at 18 and divorced at 26/7, just to give you the idea of the lack of time I had to deal with the stuff or even learn myself)

Anyway at this time I Thought I should learn life outside of marriage and in my deepest vulnerability wanted to feel love - which very unhealthy and some probably took advantage. But adults both consenting, fine, it’s for my own lessons and reflection what to take away from that, which I really have. But during that time of dating, there were 2 men who I feel saw me as this pathetic timid person and thought they could do as they want. One physically tried to rape me very forcefully and then gave the excuse later that it was because he really liked me. And tried to after manipulate the situation to make it out as if I was making a big deal out of something that just was “one thing leading to another”, I clearly said no etc etc, I managed to fight him off - nonetheless it was still
Horrible. 

The second man, which for
Me is the worse (and the one that related to the news story triggering me). He basically spiked my drink. I was out. Woke up absolutely naked and still have no memory. at the time I had no idea what had happened to me which is a similar case with many victims, he told me some lies that I took my own clothes off, and at the time I believed him and was so confused why I would do this. Then he showed me video clips of myself whilst i was naked and told me it’s ok because he didn’t get “those” bits in. He played as if he looked after me saying I drank too much (I didn’t)... what he said was inconsistent, and I didn’t really know him. But at the time I trusted what he said. It’s only after things connected and I realised what had happened and it made sense why he was behaving as he did when I woke etc. God knows what video recordings he has or where they may be! There’s just so many questions. Like when I left, my chest hurt like I was beaten. I just don’t know what happened. 

It all just makes me feel like there’s some flaw in me that men see and abuse. Like am I that worthless. When I was a child these kind of men targetted me and manipulated the situation to make it seem as if I had no right to be upset and not go near them, telling family member “I don’t know what’s wrong with her”...I got married to a man who had no respect for me (while he never hurt me physically or sexually; he deceived me and manipulated the situaiton) to then after leave him and just be there waiting for these kinds of men that are attracted to me. 

I don’t get it. It’s depressing. It’s sad. Because all I want is love. I’m just a kind and caring soul and all these things (there’s other stuff) are thrown my way and I think if I was a friend of me , I would feel so sorry for her.  I still have to get up and be this strong person for my 3 children.. when sometimes It’s  just me who needs the emotional work while I’m trying to teach my 3 people the best way to live. It’s hard, because I bury so much and then something triggering happens and then it’s either deep sadness or anger that sets alight. 

I’m in between just hating who I am and just trying to run away and be different (easier said than done) and then just accepting myself, this is who I am and That I’m worth it and it’s just the right person hasn’t been along to appreciate it. 

Ugh I get self destructive too, thinking maybe that’s all I am worth. Maybe I should revert to old habit and just date to feel loved for a bit even though I know there’s no connection or  they’re not actually interested in “damaged goods”... you know having 3 children is like a curse. 

So many emotions that broaden out into different aspects of my life through this trigger!!!

Sorry this post is long. I needed to let that out. I hope someone has had the patience to read through my painfully worded paragraphs of blurted feelings .

How do I cope with like a million and one set backs. Constantly at battle with something or the other 😞😞😞"
1834,"I’ve been really struggling lately with anxiety and depression. My therapist told me to start doing little things to be more productive but I can’t bring myself to do anything because I’m so tired from the depression. Any advice would be appreciated, I am at my wit’s end."
1835,"Hi guys 
A little story of whats been going on, so late 2018 i lost my mum to an almost 2 year battle with cancer (lived with her so saw her go through everything) straight after or possibly when she was dying my partner of now 10 years decided to start an affair with someone at his work which led to wreckless weekends no replies to see if/when he was coming home also taking drugs at this low point in his life while im sat at home just wanting a cuddle still grieving anyway 5 months down the line which is when I confronted him about it he then chose me as you can imagine an awful rest of the year with emotions, fast forward to finally being happy we then end up in lockdown, we live with my dad who i dont really get on with and basically spend most of our time in our room we also have a 7 year old daughter which this lockdown has extremely tested my patience with her, 1 week into lockdown i find out im pregnant which i knew instantly i couldnt keep it, im not in the right housing situation to raise another child and quite frankly still not over this affair that ended last year, so i had the termination last weekend which was an awful awful experience hormones are currently all over the place then find out my partner spoke to an old school friend to “catch up” and he told him about his affair and they basically had a laugh about it as you can imagine ontop of going through the abortion ive now been knocked down even more by this, my daughter can be a handful and ive decided to give up with the home schooling as its just too much stress i cant force her to pick up a pen and write 
I feel like im at an extremely low point in my life i cant talk to my best friend as she thinks her problems are worse when infact they seem pathetic to my reality 
I do love my partner and we do have some great times but i just wish he’d pull his fucking finger out and stop making me feel like shit ive been through enough and had enough 
Even writing this has made me feel slightly better x"
1836,"I’m fucking done. This is the last time I say anything but, I really can’t take this. Thinking these are my last days on this hurtful earth"
1837,"Hey everyone, new here, so please forgive me if I'm posting in the wrong place. I need some help with what more I can do to help my girlfriend through a very difficult time she's having, so here's the full story.

We've been dating the last 9 months roughly, and this is a bit of a long distance relationship where she lives 90 miles away. Every weekend, she'd come over to my place and we always met in the middle to make the strain of driving in her less, and I'd drive her back to the city with me. She's 24, and I'm 23(M).

She told me upfront that she had depression and anxiety issues, and I didn't back away because I don't believe that those are reasons not to love someone. She's had a few panic attacks and breakdowns while she's been with me each weekend since we've been dating, and I've been able to console her each time, but this time it's much worse.

We ended up breaking up in late January, and she explained to me later a week later that it was because it felt like she was disappointing me, which I reassured her that wasn't the case at all. It was largely (in my opinion) her anxiety and depression beginning to spike. We end up getting back together a week later, and things are beginning to go back to normal, but she wants to take things slow and see where it goes from there. Around February 20th-29th, I could tell she was acting differently, not being nearly as responsive or wanting to communicate with me, and not putting in as much effort in conversation as she normally does, and I began to worry. Several days go by where we would have one text message exchange between the two of us, and then several days of no communication, which is extremely out of the ordinary. 

March 3rd, she tells me that she isn't well, is being watched by her family, and is suicidal, and that the following day, she's seeing her psychiatrist for treatment/medication. She's been medicated since she was around 16, and isn't a stranger to meds, but hasn't told me anymore about how she's doing or what's going on. I expressed my concern to her early on and that I was proud of her for seeking treatment and having the courage to tell me, and that I would always be here for her and that I'm not going anywhere. She said that she appreciates it and just needs to take things slow, but hasn't done much more past that. Flash forward to now, I haven't been reaching out as much because I don't want to overload her with social interaction since she's anxious about these kinds of things. It's been 5 days since I've heard from her, but she's read my messages via snapchat and didn't reply to them. It's going on multiple days passing before she even reads my messages.

To add insult to injury, she works for the school system and with COVID19, she's been stuck at home for the last two weeks, and I'm sure that isn't helping her mental state. She's surrounded by people that care about her, and that's important, but it's also taken out the consistency/schedule she needs to help with her recovery. She isn't checking her phone or making efforts to respond to me, and I understand that depression sucks that energy out of you to do that, but the uncertainty of not knowing how she's doing is worrying me.

Is there anything more that I can do to help? I miss my best friend, but I completely understand that this time she's taking is the most important thing for her recovery. If anyone has been through something similar or could provide me some insight, I'd greatly appreciate it."
1838,"I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression for many years. Being home right now isn’t helping what so ever and I find myself slipping through the cracks. I had such a light before being closed in at and I go everyday seeing that light dwindle I have never been on medication, and before I could start my treatment my insurance was taken away. So I’m stuck and really just need to be around people who understand what I’m feeling...."
1839,"I am just not doing well tonight at all. Although a pinch better as I write this. At least I am free to go to bed now, although I'm not sure how much or how well I will sleep. Anxiety is creeping back, lonely feelings, and depressed thoughts. Thoughts of harming myself even because I'm just so frustrated and stupid at how I thought I could keep myself from complaining today and yet, here I am, feeling close to my worst. 

I don't  even know! I'm ...I'm just wasting time now. Can't think. I'm just so stupid. argh!

...oh, I guess I just feel so stupid because I said last night that I was going to maybe be different, but the thing is, I didn't expect my mood to go all haywire like this in one day!! And I mean, I was even feeling positive...now I'm just feeling very scared and hopeless. Well, I only get a few hours of sleep, so I'd better go try.

Goodnight."
1840,"My mild depression has slowly spiraled out of control to a concerning dependence on alcohol an un healthy relationship with OTC pain meds and and an SH issues that have come from now where and escaping my control.

None of the above I feel like put my life in danger atm and I feel like with the whole strain on the NHS I shouldnt add to the burden with some thing that is not life threatening.  Am I doing the right thing or should I ask for help ?

1842,"All,
I am in the midst of the most acute bout of depression in my life, and there have been several.  Was having chronic episode for about 2 years, but about 2 months ago my soon to be ex wife, whom i thought i would be with forever, informed me she had been carrying on an emotional affair with an old flame, and basically blindsided me and said she was done.  I was in total shock for days, at one point thought i was having a nervous breakdown, and desperately clinged to hope.  I have come to a place of mostly accepting that shes gone (literally moving to the other side of the country), but with the double depression, struggles at work, and financial troubles, i just dont how i can possibly get through this....meds for about 2 months now, bupropion then added lexapro about a month ago, and started therapy..maybe the meds have numbed me out a bit but i still feel completely worthless, hopeless and that my life has no meaning and has served no purpose.  
Long intro, sorry...but does anyone have any advice on how to want to get better when in the deepest depths of depression hell?
Just want to sleep forever...
Also any advice on how to create a belief that things may actually ever be something other than miserable when there seems to be no evidence of anything but failure and a broken, pointless existence ahead?
Thanks for reading, any input appreciated"
1843,Hi everyone . Been feeling so low and lost and everywhere feels like another hole . I just want to feel happy again and am lost on how to get there . I'm so tired of this . I want to win this fight but feel myself slipping . Any suggestions . I'm currently on sertraline and I'm not sure if it even works . I try not to take lorazepam but at least it helps me sleep and avoid the world . Any suggestions would be wonderfully accepted . Thank you all
1844,"Feeling low and just need to chat, having issues again, well they never seem to go away really. Have 3 kids of my own and two step sons. Ones 16 and doesn’t want his dad to be with me and happy, the other step son has a psychotic mother that plays pathetic games. Our relationship has been put thro the mill on more times than I care to remember, partner started talking to women on a dating site, then he had a mental break down, I nursed him back to health, I had a miscarriage and still his eldest son is playing games, wants his dad but doesn’t want me or my kids. At the moment the eldest step son doesn’t speak to his dad, refusing to respect others. My partner wants to be with me and we want another child together but his family are doing my head in. My partners mum text him saying I have issues, that I’m a bad mother, that I’m too hard on my own children but to be honest my kids aren’t the issue. If the step son had a little more discipline in his life, rather than spoilt rotten, got everything he wanted then maybe he’d have respect for others, then he wouldn’t steal from me and from others, which every nearly ended up with a criminal record of it wasn’t for the good will of the man he stole from. In his eyes (eldest step sons) I was only good enough to have around when I’m the one buying him stuff he needs, all his new bedding, accessories for his room that one of my kids gave up so he had a room that was his. I’m good enough when I’m paying for his food, the electric to charge his mobile, cooking and washing his dirty clothes but not good enough to be part of his dads life with him. 
my partners mum has now pushed her nose in where it’s not wanted yet again. So fed up of others telling us how to bring the children up, she’s had her life bringing up her kids now it’s our turn and she has to stop telling us what to do. My partner won’t tell his mum to back off as he doesn’t want to upset her but I’ve told him if she says anything about me then I will have it out with her even if he can’t as I’m not having someone slag me off and is all nice to my face. Partner suffers from depression too and I see him go backwards every time an issue is made or brought back up by others. Just wish they’d F off and leave us be. Sorry for the rant just gets me down!"
1845,"Day in and out I have sever GAD and the depression is just as bad or worse ....no interests, don't care about a thing, I have this terrifying sense of fear lingering in my mind ALL day. This has gone on for a very long time now. The feeling off you jumped off something really high in a dream and you get that sick to ur stomach feeling and than wake up. I'm so worn out and I can't take it I need a solution. I was started back on Zoloft and I've been on it 4 days now. And i feel even more depressed since I got on it pls help"
1846,"I'm feeling the best I've felt in decades for the most part, but I'm having what kind of feels like a traumatic experience or something. My mood drops to rock bottom in a couple seconds for a minute or two and I have severe suicidal urges. Then my mood goes up a fair amount over a few minutes and then slowly creeps back to normal after around an hour or two. I should probably make a mood chart of it, but I'm not in a great mood right now. I guess I should call my psychologist and psychiatrist tomorrow. It has gotten progressively worse and might be triggered by even the smallest amount of stress some times. I had some repressed memories for around twenty years about being molested, they came back as nightmares when I took escitalopram. I haven't had any very recent medication changes. Does anyone have any insight or had similar experiences? I think it's more intense and noticeable than it used to be because my body was so used to both of those things basically being constant. I hope I don't have to be hospitalized especially because of the current pandemic. I won't be alone for the next few days so I should be safe for a while."
1847,"Hi All,

Last time I posted was in 2015, where I worried I wouldn't find anyone who liked me, and had the constant underlying feeling that I don't want to exist in this world.

2020 comes around and here we go again. I've had highs and lows throughout this time but I have managed to keep myself engaged, not thinking too much. I met someone who did like me, was happy with them for a good 3 years and now after 5 I think it's best if we part ways.
 
I can honestly say that for a lot of this relationship I felt like I had truly found happiness, she made me so unbelievably happy, and I gave absolutely everything to her. As a result of this, I ignored others around me, and neglected the chance to make other strong friendships, knowing that she was all I needed. But now all I can see is the end of us together.

Now if I do this, I will have no one who I would truly call a friend. No one who cares for me, and no one I care for. I have my family, who are care about so much, but no one who I feel I can truly open up to like I could with her.

It's entirely my fault, I've never let myself make friends or try, as I didn't want to pretend and fake my personality to please someone else. I've taken that to extremes and just ended up falling out with anyone who I ever have a chance to get close to. Now, I wish I had done exactly this. Gone against my morals, drunk more, taken drugs just so I could fit in with those around me.

Now with no friends and no hobbies, no one to open up to and nothing to look forward to, in a job which gives me no route to starting fresh, I think I am finally done. I've always hung on to people online telling me it will get better, but it hasn't. 10 years and nothing has changed. I still feel the exact same draining feeling that tells me I can't do it, there is nothing for me here and I don't want to be a part of it. The same feeling that I've had since I was still a child.

I want to say I'll get over this, that it will all work out, that her and I will make up and go back to how things were when we first met. I want to tell myself that I can be happy, that 'everything will get better', and that my life is worth living. But with this everlasting feeling of sadness, underpinning every mistake or hard time that comes my way, I don't think I can.

As I said in my posts 5 years ago, I still don't think I would take my life. However, I am sinking deeper and deeper, and I worry that at some point soon, things will change.

I don't know what I am looking for on here. I think I get something out of typing it down and knowing at least someone will see it.

Maybe I'll post in another 5 years, I expect even then, after 15 years, things will be the same.

Sincerely,

Steven"
1848,"I want to die now



It’s been 10 Years of stress and pain, everyone telling me how strong I am for freaking with my struggles, today my gf broke up with me. The girl I fell deeply in love with to then be told I’m not who she wants to be with. I found a new happiness with her, we were great, and then the lockdown came and things changed. She now wants to follow her travelling dream. A dream I’m not part off, and I don’t think my mental strength is enough anymore. I want to give up now. I want no more pain and no more struggling pain. I’m scared off death, I want a painless send off. But I think the quick pain will be awarded with an eternity of peace and solitude.  She was everything I wanted in a person, I found myself looking at hope in life, wanting nothing but happiness with her, but now that time is up, and I feel my time is as well."
1849,"Hey, everyone.

To keep it brief, in the past few years I had a mental breakdown in August 2017, which I believe was a result of losing my father in law 2 years prior. Then during recovery, January 8th 2018 my dad has a massive stroke. Wheel chair bound. Can only say one word. I still continued recovery and by August 2018 I was back to being me again. Then in December 2018 I relapsed if you like. I haven't been the same since. So 15+ months I've been a nervous wreck, who's scared of life, intrusive thoughts 24/7, Depersonalisation aswell. 

What this post is about is, has anyone got any advice for the loss of a family member and also with my dad. Yes he's still here but I have lost who he was and that kills me everyday!"
1850,"Right now I'm going through what's a classical depression episode for me.

I wake up in terror and it passes within a few minutes. I have about a two hour gap where I feel kind of okay and can do stuff. Then I just crash and feel like I can't move a finger. I do my best to stay awake...

I have a nap (if you can call an hour and a half of sleep a nap) and I feel better. I can even work a bit. I read a lot of stuff on naps but no one explains what is the chemistry behind that lift in the afternoons.

My therapist calls it typical for a depression episode but still has no specific explanation about what chemically happens.

My idea is to reverse engineer it if I can and get more out of it. If I fail to find out what happens chemically, I'll think I'll just wake up very early and take that nap at noon so that I can have more of a normal day.

I did that already and it does work.

Anyone has any idea about what that nap does in people who feel better after it?"
1851,How do you get out of your own head an thoughts. I just cant cope with it anymore 😰
1852,just thinking that looking at tv is a big killer for depressed people. it so not right everything is perfect on tv this is so bad for us
1853,"I often cry for practically no reason. For example the other day I spilled a cup of tea over my lap and just burst into tears. It wasn't even hot, I just felt hopeless, like I couldn't do anything right. I mean it's only tea fgs.

Like to know if anyone else does this."
1854,"Is it normal to feel like I'm having a pity party for one? 

I feel like my mind is going crazy. Like I have so much on my mind and I'm so down and feeling like my world is about to come crashing down. 

I live with my cousin. He's more like my brother. We had a lot of changes in the past two years between moving houses, jobs etc. 

Another cousin of mine was also living with us. Just as we got settled in, the other cousin moved out. 

Now it's just the first cousin and I. I'll call him M. So M has just started seeing someone. His partner is always at our house lately and everything has started changing. It's M's house which I'm renting in. 

For the past week, I've been feeling like my whole world is about to come crashing down. He's changed. Home has changed. And I know soon I'm going to have to leave. 

Am I selfish for feeling this way? I feel like I am but I can't help it. How do I stop myself from feeling sorry for myself? It's hard when you've been through so much in life. I'm at the point where I just wish everything would fall into place and I could actually settle into my life. 

Is this part of depression? Is it wrong that I sometimes think it's easier not to be in this world? It's difficult that people come and go in our lives and we just have to adjust and deal with it."
1855,"Ive been isolating myself for years. Scared to leave my house. I couldn’t bare it honestly but now when I was starting to go out at least two times a week I’m back inside. I’m not crushed or anything because I know it’s insensitive. People are dying. Me leaving the house isn’t important compared to that but My step dad has been even more abusive now that he’s not in work too. It’s torture. I’ve isolated myself for too long I can’t stand it anymore. Sitting in my room all day listening to my ears ring, feeling my joints ache and crack, waiting for him to start trouble (trying to throw me and my mother out. Calling us names) is driving me insane. I should be used to it but the more I think about how much I’m wasting my life away the more suffocated I feel. I hate being woe is me but I’m sure others can understand to some extent."
1856,Nothing brings me joy. 43 years is enough to live. I sincerely wish I could give my remaining years to someone who is chronically ill.
1857,"Heya, 

Just thought I'd post this beautiful poem, written in 1869 - Reprinted during Spanish fluPandemic, 1919 

And people stayed at home  
And read books  
And listened  
And they rested  
And did exercises  
And made art and played  
And learned new ways of being  
And stopped and listened  
More deeply  
Someone meditated, someone prayed  
Someone met their shadow  
And people began to think differently  
And people healed.  
And in the absence of people who  
Lived in ignorant ways  
Dangerous, meaningless and heartless,  
The earth also began to heal  
And when the danger ended and  
People found themselves  
They grieved for the dead  
And made new choices  
And dreamed of new visions  
And created new ways of living  
And completely healed the earth  
Just as they were healed.

1858,"Hello my Name is Emelie and I am new here. I wanted to talk about something, because I feel really alone with it. I have depressive episodes and this one is really bad. It happens without warnings: sometimes its so loud in my head. There are not voices, I've experienced hearing voices before so I know that its not that. But all of the sudden I feel like there are so many thoughts in my head. They are just so fast and so loud. I cant tell you what Im really thinking about. Its just like there are so many thoughts in my head at the same time. And they are so fast and so loud. I cant controll it. Its like there is a ticking time bomb in my head and my head is gonna explode every second. Or like there is a fire in my brain and everything burns. The thoughts are racing and I dont know what to do. Its not overthinking, its more extreme. All of these racing thoughts, that I can not controll. I feel like they are so loud, that they are screaming at me. Thank you for reading this. Maybe you have some advice? Emelie"
1859,yes it's they depression as soon as I open my eyes in the mornings it's like a demon just waiting for me
1860,"Hi there, 

this feels really alien to me right now but I don’t know what else to do.

I’m really struggling with my mental health, depression and anxiety.
But I’m also going through some really bad crap with my middle sister.
Long story short she’s has accused me of sexual abuse over 10 years ago and I’m currently being investigated by the police.
What’s worse is that I still live at home, with both of my younger sisters and my mum and step dad. I’m not aloud to be left alone with either of them, or go into their rooms or them in mine. Me and my youngest sister are or should I say we’re extremely close. I feel like that’s been snapped away from me.

ive got to a point where I’m struggling so much that I’m having thoughts of not wanting to be here. There is no possible what I would do anything to my sisters EVER!
But I want to know if me being here would make her happy. 
I want to know if my friends would miss me or if they would even be bothered that I’m no longer here. But how do I even ask them? I don’t want to worry them but I still want to know.
I’m on antidepressants but I feel like they’re not enough at the moment to keep me from downing. But with the current pandemic going on how can I be selfish? How can I ring and speak to a doctor when they could be helping save someone’s life from this virus. I’m so confused and hurt and angry and feb up with everything."
1861,"My husband and I were having some relationship issues and I decided that having an open relationship may help spice things up. Well one of the men became everything to me. I lied to my husband and cheated on him and this new guy who we will call Dave made me think he would give me the perfect life. He was married as well and was in a rocky relationship too. We decided that we would start a new life together. I gave up my job, my house, all my possessions, one of ky dogs, my friends. Everything. Turns out Dave hadn't fully left his wife and was still going back to her to work things out and was sleeping with her still. I also caught him talking to other women. I had enough and ended it. I went back to my ex's for a few days and we spent some time together but it was tense. I went back to my new house and Dave promised he would end things with the ex and not talk to her and I would have full control over any interaction between them. Since then there has been constant lack of communication, making me feel like I'm crazy for showing any emotion, every time we fight he says he is done and is breaking up with me to the point he has packed all his stuff and left several times. He pushes me to the point of being out of control and I feel like self harming when I get like that and have lashed out at him physically too. He keeps promising he will be better after we fight and then things go back to the same. Fights over nothing, not being able to express anything with out it being told my anxiety is out of control and I will never trust him so he should just leave. I have been trying to reconcile with my ex. He wants none of it. I have begged I have asked to go to counselling I have done everything I can to get him to take me back. I feel like even though we had our issues and maybe I wasn't totally happy I wasn't feeling like self harming and like I was totally out of control. I feel like i have totally ruined my life and I feel like i can't do this anymore but I don't know how to make it better. I guess I just need some space to vent and people to talk to because I don't really have anyone. Sorry for the long winded post."
1862,every day I'll think depression go away .used to feel down years ago then I do something like clean the home or cut the grass paint a bedroom then that give me a lift. but now it hard work to wash and do my teeth. if I do gardening or painting and it need doing the first thing that comes into my head is that look depression
1863,"So, last summer i was offered a new job, a god send, life changing and it seems now life saving.
I was fine in the interview, in fact the job was probably mine before I even walked through the door as i'd been recommended to the recruiting manager and I possessed a good deal of knowledge in what is a fairly bespoke industry that isn't easy to come by.
I turned it down after what I can only describe as being ambushed by anxiety and or panic attacks. Irrational thoughts of failure overwhelmed me.
I was given time to rethink my decision and then accepted the role. It was by far the best package i have ever been offered or ever will. Office hours, good salary, company car, interesting work, great team of people.
Upon handing my notice in with my current employer, those doubts began to play havock again.
After two weeks of sleepless nights, weight loss, more and increasingly irrational scenarios, self doubt, FEAR, i retracted my notice.
I have spent every hour of every day for the past nine months regretting this. I actually knew as I pressed send on the email retracting my notice that it was a mistake. 
I knew how wrong it was of me to turn it down again having been given another chance.The regret I felt after my initially turning down the role drove me to then accept it when given the second chance. That should have been enough of a taster of how I feel now for me to have avoided this frankly hellish existence.
I am now stuck in a role whereby my skillset is being dismantled and my duties are changing into an area I have absolutely no interest in. On a hard rotational rota, which has taken it's toll on my work/life balance and physical health for a good many number of years. 
I cannot come to terms with what I experienced at that time, don't understand it, have never experienced anything like it and as the ramifications of what I have let slip through my fingures continue to mount up, i'm in slipping further and further into a desperate and depressed state. I have another 20 working years to face where I could and should have been embarking on a new and life changing, once in a lifetime, well earned career. Instead I am fighting my way through every day. I have lost all confidence, pride, self respect and desire to live. It's unsustainable, career suicide.
I have been using anti depressants for a number of weeks, changed meds and increased the dosage, tried therapy all of which isn't helping at all. The whole episode feels to me like a surreal nightmare. I see the work I would have been doing every time i'm in work as the company that offered me the job are our main subcontractor. I feel hideous around my colleagues who've watched me gradually break down to a shell of my former self, all from a job offer that anyone else would have snatched up. It just doesn't make any sense to me or them. Opportunities arise at the start of a contract and you take them. Many people have made a lifelong career from humble beginnings this way and i'm the one that failed to do so. I cannot get a break from the feelings of ridicule that I experience when I see anybody that appears content as I now feel I never will be. Blown my one chance of a career i'd of thrived in, which encompassed all the things I've enjoyed about the industry and historically gone out of my way to get involved in. Blown a healthier lifestyle off shifts and blown the chance to work with a good bunch of people that I could learn from and grow with.
This might seem trivial to some, it seems to have to a couple of the therapists i,ve spoken to, but it's just the worst thing i have ever experienced, done, and I really can't even start to move away from it mentally. It's literally all i think about all day long every day and when i try to stop it comes back stronger. I know staying in my current role is not viable now and of course it's not going to end well as I have all but stopped involving myself in any of the activity, i literally turn up and sit in a bubble as my pride, interest, and anything any employer expects fades away.
I have had a handful of episodes whereby rage has overwhelmed me as I of course can only be mad at myself. No one has done wrong by me, I wasn't the victim of a crime, a deception, no traumatic event occurred, I just literally talked/ scared myself out of what was the best thing that could have happened for/to me in a very long time and that I was lucky to have been offered. It was a godsend and I can't accept what I did with it or whats left. 
How can I even attempt to forge anything like a palatable life now?"
1864,this is deppresion? voices in my head putting me down .I think back when I was a bit happier years ago and had no voices in my head .ive been told today I could make a lotto winner depressed not nice
1865,"I've had this obsession with researching suicide methods all morning and I just can't stop. I've never had this feeling in my head of not being able to think of anything else. Everytime I out my phone down, I pick it right back up again. Everytime I think to go do something I end up just picking up my phone to do more research. I've never had this level of obsession over anything and it feels very uncomfortable in my head"
1866,"Not what I should talk about on here really, but want a fresh mental and physical relationship with someone.

Have a partner (has no interest in me anymore) and 2 young children whom I adore, they need me x

I want the fun of a new relationship again without f@king up my kids lives, standard stuff for a middle aged bloke I guess. (Think you call it an affair)

Call me what you like, but is how I feel right now x"
1867,"I'm not entirely sure what I mean by ""give up."" I'm just so tired frustrated and angry at how depressed I have been for the last few years. I have a form of depression that is hard to treat. I guess I'm tired of feeling guilt and shame I have because I can't do my job. I spent the mornings this week napping on the couch instead of working. I really shouldn't be allowed to work from home but i like it because I'm not around people. I'm just not functional.

Anyway i guess what i mean by give up is not work and let someone else take the reigns."
1868,"This is something I’ve been wondering for a while and can’t find any solid information on it. I’m sure because there are still unknowns. But I am open to discussion.
So with anti-depressants “balancing” or “boosting” seratonin: if right now my levels are shot, gone, does that mean if the medication brings that back up or to normal, will they go back down as soon as I’m done with medication? Or will they stay there if I have learned new ways of coping with stress, worked with a therapist, etc.?
I am not against medication, I just cannot justify side effects and the weaning part just yet. I have taken Zoloft, Celexa, Wellbutrin in the past. Thank you in advance for any insight."
1869,"People, doctors, therapists, mental health professionals, ministers, priests--they think they can help.  They think medication, therapy, prayer, spirituality can heal me.  There is nothing that can heal me, nothing that can take away my fear and despair.  They all think that the main think is to keep me alive, but what determines that keeping me physically alive is worth more than the anguish I live with every day?  When I disclose how bad things are, therapists tell me to go to the hospital or see my psychiatrist.  When I tell a doctor how bad things are they want to medicate me and get me into therapy.  Doctors send me to therapists and therapists send me to doctors.  Religious people think they can help me with prayer until they realize they have gotten in over their heads with me, and they tell me to go to the hospital.  Everyone sends me to someone else.  No one knows what to do with me, and I still somehow manage to elude being hospitalized.  Death is the only solution.  Death is the only way out of my pain."
1870,so depression is winning and evil its got me .it will not let me do enerthing just getting out of bed is a big task
1871,"Hello everyone, I'm new here and I need some support. I'm diagnosed with major depression few months ago, but I've been feeling really bad for few years. I'm taking meds, they helped me a little bit, but now they don't anymore. last few days I'm feeling like I'm totally loosing It, I'm having suicidal thoughts and feel broken. I don't have anyone whom I can ask for help and support. No real friends, parent's can't help me, and I think they don't really care. I am utterly alone in this hell I'm living in. I'm constantly experiencing feelings of teror. No one's on my side. I'm so so so so tired. Tired of life, even though I'm only 20. I'm on my first college year and I can't study because of my condition. I'm scared I'm gonna fall. At the same time I'm so scared, tired, exausted, lonely, numb and weak."
1872,"Hi. I’m looking for some advice after years of feeling depressed and anxious with life.

For many years, my now wife and I struggled financially to the point that we were borrowing around £1000 a month from parents/loans etc to keep up. We dug ourselves into a big hole and we were always miserable and stressed. The only time i felt happy was at work. I loved my job working in events and even though it was a 3 hour round commute, it made me happy.

After a few years we decided to relocate closer to my parents to try and fix our money problems. Unfortunately that meant leaving my dream job and starting again career wise in my mid 20s, as events jobs don’t really exist where we moved to.

it took a few years but we cleared our debts, got married, bought a house and now we have a 1 year old daughter. I love the life we have and our financial security makes life much easier but... i hate my job. I’ve changed jobs 4 times in 5 years moving to different industries to try and find something i like. I’m paid well in my current job but i just hate being there and all i want to do is leave but i’m 32 now with responsibilities and i dont feel like i can keep moving around.

i just can’t seem to find content and happiness and seem to have to sacrifice one thing to gain another. I know it sounds like i just don’t appreciate things enough but i have been truly depressed for so many years now that i can’t remember what it’s like to be happy and to just relax and smell the roses, and i’m amazed that my wife is still with me to be honest.

it’s nice to vent this all out but i’m also hoping i can get some advice on what it takes to just be happy and enjoy life cus i can’t get out of this mentality that i’ve had for so long now. Thankyou."
1873,"Does this misery ever go away? I've been struggling with depression for 2-3 years now, i used to self medicate with weed but i stopped, i am currently taking antidepressants and xanax. But my question is does it ever go away? will i ever feel alive again?"
1874,if u were to win the lottery like 50 million would depression go away?
1875,"Hi everyone.  I haven't posted on here in a while, but today just kind of made me remember about this forum.  I struggle with anxiety and depression on a daily basis and part of my depression is just feeling alone.  Recently I developed a dumb crush on a girl I work with.  I would talk to her any chance I got about anything work related or non-work related.  Today I finally had enough courage to ask for her number and she told me she would rather not because she has a boyfriend.  I guess it was pretty obvious I liked her and she didn't want to risk being with her boyfriend and getting a text from another guy.  Understandable and her personal choice which I respect, but it still hurt and I spent several hours just laying in my bed sad when I got home today.  This is the third time in a row I've liked someone who was already taken.  I just don't get it.  I've been single for so long I don't even remember what it's like to be in a relationship and today just reminded me more of that and my mood really sunk for a while.  Has this happened to anyone before and how do you deal with it?  And in general for anyone who's been single for a long time but wants a relationship, how do you feel?"
1876,"I am try to distract myself, I am suffering."
1877,"I feel like ive lost my mind. Like, i really think i have. I dont even know if this will make sense. If someone can help me make sense of this, maybe help me figure out what to call this? That would help alot.
Basically, this all started after extreme nihilism i had going on. I obsessed about the point of things. I eventually let go of any objective meaning to life and focusing on being happy and making others happy. I focused on love. Because our experiance matters an life doesnt need a point. Thats how i thought then anyhow.
I started really focusing on my inner world. Before i could easily say, ""i deserve to feel good and have a good life."" But i started focusing on emotions so much. I began not even being able to comprehend what these things are anymore. I see these emotions i am feeling but its like they are just...there. When i focus on how it feels, i question ""What is this? Why does this feeling feel good?"" or ""Why does this feeling feel bad?"" Good emotions i cant even say i want to feel anymore? Its like they dont matter. Like, it doesnt really affect me anymore. All emotions feel empty and i cant even want anything anymore. I cant LIKE the feelings i used to crave. In fact, liking something hardly registers as something i want to feel. I cant feel love nor do i understand why i want to feel it anymore?
Before this, i was obsessed with thinking after my nihilism that feeling nothing is the same as feeling good because by feeling nothing, i wouldnt feel the bad stuff, then realized no because feeling nothing isnt feeling good which is bad. Point is, i realized that yes feeling good is better than feeling nothing. But now, since i started questioning what these are and why i want to feel them, feeling anything good, even peaceful seems pointless or like it doesnt actually benefit me or something. Emotions dont even seem to be a part of me right now. Like im observing them. I keep thinking maybe im experiancing emotional numbness? But i have no clue."
1878,"Every time I call one I just seem to feel worse. That is, if they even respond. I'm usually on hold for so long that I give up.
I just feel hopeless. Someone reported me to insta bc they were scared I would harm myself. I am tired and I feel like there's no place to go for help.
I can't go to hospital and risk exposing my family to the coronavirus.
I just wish there was some way to stop hurting."
1879,"Hi all, hope you are well.

Normally my mood is quite stable throughout the day. Yes, I’m depressed, but it’s stable. I cry for an actual reason.
For about a month my mood has been much more changeable and I’ve been experiencing extreme mood swings where I’ve suddenly started crying for a minute or so and then resumed normal functioning (at this point I’m totally dissociated so I don’t remember how I felt after the mood swing other than that I was upset). Part of me wonders if they’re flashbacks, but I can’t tell what’s what...

My dissociation is either more intense or I’m noticing it more often, who knows at this point, and I’m sleeping more disgustingly than usual (it’s 3am).

I’m also experiencing bouts of paranoia that fluctuates daily and gets worse at night.

On the other side of things, my SH is so much less frequent as I don’t feel like it helps me cope (again idk if that’s good or bad) and I’m feeling alot more capable and experiencing less of a drive to be hungry.

I’ve got a nagging feeling of just wanting to die that’s popped up, but at this point I feel so disconnected from these emotions that they don’t even seem like my own anymore.

Then again it could be an alter who’s feeling like that and not me.

I can’t tell if my mood is better or worse. I’ve become so much more numb and I guess that could be a bad thing but I’m not really feeling much emotion atm. Idk. Sorry. If anyone’s got any thoughts it would be much appreciated.

[also, I have a therapist however I have social anxiety so struggle to bring these issues up with her as I am not completely comfortable or confident or trusting around her - I’ve only been going for 6 months or so.]"
1880,"22, passing into adulthood - Feeling very empty and lost interest in life

Hi everyone, I've never really talked about personal problems here or any other forums but I don't really know what to do now. 

Recently I've had the strangest feeling - I've had times feeling pretty depressed and miserable in the past (my parents' divorce, most of my adolescence, times feeling lonely at uni) - mainly caused by my shyness and loneliness growing up, but now it feels different. It's not a feeling of abject sadness I've had in the past - now I feel really empty and hopeless about life. I can't feel any passion or excitement about anything anymore - I used to love reading, films, music, History, politics, cooking, travelling abroad but now I can't settle down to do anything or talk about anything with interest - which has made making new friends really difficult. After graduating from uni and recently moving to London and entering work I now feel incredibly insignificant with no real hope of feeling fulfilled and happy again.

It's difficult to pinpoint why as a lot has happened to me over the past year so I thought I'd recount:

Throughout school and uni I felt that I had different problem of social anxiety and shyness - of not having many friends and finding it really hard to socialise. I was really focused on work - I was fortunate enough to go to a very good uni and do very well academically - although I missed out on developing myself in other areas, including relationships, and felt unhappy. The summer after I graduated (last year) I had a life-changing experience volunteering abroad with a group and found myself much more relaxed and sociable, and briefly happy for the first time in my life. Unfortunately I came back unemployed and looking for a job living at home for a long while (with Mum absent most of the time travelling for work) which really took its toll after having such a great experience, plus as I was volunteering in international development I felt a lot of guilt and anger at many of the things I saw and experienced. 

In January I was really pleased to get onto a graduate scheme I liked but had a very long wait to start in September. I had a very bad experience this summer where I went back to India to volunteer and ended up for two months in an isolated refuge centre in the middle of nowhere. Although I didn't feel noticeably miserable and took the loneliness and challenges stoically, the isolation started to get to me. To deal with it, I became increasingly detached from reality, almost like I was living in my own mind. Last summer I felt that my life was turning around but now suddenly I felt that this had been an illusion and my self-confidence dropped off a cliff. I had briefly conned myself into feeling that I was happier, more self-confident, a changed person with a purpose in life but the whole experience left me completely broken and disillusioned.

Ever since I've got back, I've found it really difficult connecting with family and friends and I still feel like I'm living in isolation even though I'm seemingly going through life normally day-to-day. I've started a new job that is very well regarded and what I've always wanted to do but there are high expectations and stress which I don't feel like I can deal with in my current frame of mind and lack of confidence. Before I started feeling like this I probably would have relished it but now I feel like an impostor. Although I still like them, I've grown apart from my friends at uni and I don't really have any close friends, bar one who's far away, to confide in and share life with anymore.

On top of this, my brother who I was close to growing up had a mental breakdown (given my Dad as well I think mental health issues run in the family) and suddenly without prior signs became very abusive towards my Mum and me and then disowned us earlier this year - which has led to a really awful sense of grief as it almost feels like he has died. 

In short, I've hit a real sense of disillusionment and restlessness with life and can't see any meaning to my life anymore. For some strange and disturbing reason I almost want to fail in my job just to have some certainty and some comfort that I can't hack it as the more confident and stable person I thought I could be and resign myself to a simpler life. I know this seems like abdicating responsibility although given my terribly sheltered upbringing I'm not sure I can take greater responsibility. Perhaps this is just part of growing up but it's really tough.

Sorry if I've bored anyone who's read through all of this, I hope it makes some sense."
1881,Someone like me? My brain is blank
1882,"Hello, does anyone also suffer from tinnitus in your depression? My depression is so bad, in terms of physical and mental pain, that the medication I'm taking can only partially give me relief. Without the medication I'm literally unable to function as the stomach pain is too strong. That together with the tinnitus and negative invasive thoughts make it unbearable, Thanks to the meds, I find some relief, but the tinnitus is still there as well as the pressure in my chest. Those things just keep on reminding me that the underlying depression is still there. It makes me super anxious...Anyone experienced something similar? If so, how long were you able to cope with it? Did the pain ever go away?"
1883,"My boyfriend of a year and a half just broke up with me. We live together, have a 60 gallon tank with fish together. Another tank with turtles, a cat, and two dogs. I go to college here and it’s online now because of the virus. I’m completely depressed and stuck with him when all I want right now is to be alone."
1884,"I’m new here... and in a real new crushing crisis...
Naturally I feel like I’m the only one who’s ever gone through this and understands

Anyone ever feel like they can’t wait for the day to end? I go to bed earlier every day just so I can stop my head from torturing me
And the worst is when I wake up ( if I sleep) 
In a second or two I have to start all
Over again

Seems like it will never be in the past
Mike"
1885,I don’t feel like doing anything all day. I can’t focus on one thing. I starve myself and am not drinking enough water because I don’t even feel like doing that either. I have a sore back. I feel so frustrated and want to die badly. I don’t want to tell anyone and never have told anyone. Everyday is pain and frustration. No human connections. Just anger and boredom. I’m gone and there’s no fixing me. It’s why I think so much of suicide. What the hell am I meant to do if I can’t even get out of bed?
1886,Since I've relapsed back into depression and anxiety I can say I'm in a worse spot than when I first took antidepressants. I know depression causes brain fog but I'm having a very different symptom and it feels like I'll collapse. When I try to learn or figure something out or even just write what's on my mind I have a VERY stressful  time doing it and I find it so hard to think about what's on my mind and write it down! It often results in to much stress and I shake my head like a twitch or tremor and lose train of thought! Just using my cognition on simple things is giving these bouts of amnesia with panic I'm not sure of the description of what this is but hopefully u get the idea please help me I'm really stressed to the gills and I can't take this mental torture pls any info
1887,"I am new here and this is probably gonna be a long read so I'm sorry for that.
I am 21 years old, will be 22 this year. 
I'm just gonna go straight to the point, I live in subhuman conditions. It's a long story but basically my father got a really bad deal and bad luck and the house we ended up staying in should NOT even be functional. 
I have been hiding this secret my entire life. Imagine what it's like to not have a single friend, or a girlfriend, because they simply can not visit my house. I've been making up excuses my entire life. 
What makes it worse is that from the oustide, the house looks fine. Which is even more annoying because people think i live a normal life. 
I still share a room with my sister, she's 25. We have absolutely no privacy. We don't have well functioning pipes. We don't have well functioning power plugs, someone is bound to fucking die here. A few years ago a piece of the celling fell on top of my head, only reason I got no serious injuries was because part of it fell on top of a floor lamp and it took the damage.
I have a few online friends. But hey, guess what. My internet is absolute trash. My mom is embarrased to call people to come here and fix things. When I meant I live in subhuman conditions I wasn't joking. My bathroom has a big hole in the celling and it rains inside. It rains right on top of the toilet. Hurray. I can't take proper showers because the drains don't work. Hurray. It rains inside my room. Hurray. My sister takes up the room so I have to stay in the living room on the computer, it's great when I want some privacy. My parents are about 3 meters away from me. My mom can't cook properly, the kitchen is falling apart. HURRAY
I can't have a normal life. I am in college and for the first time in my life I was living in a good house. 
Covid19 strikes. I'm stuck in this hell house. I am very, very scared this will lead to a suicide, very soon. I don't think I can handle staying stuck in this house. I have absolutely no conditions to live and no privacy. I am curently typing this as my father is watching television right in front of me. I am also directly below YET another hole in the celling. It's really great, you should give it a try.
And then when I complain about my life being bad, people tell me ""but there's people in africa that don't have food.""
Yeah, ok, those people live in even worse conditions, but guess what? They don't have to pretend. Everyone they know lives in the same situations. I live in a big city in a big neighborhood and my house looks normal from the outside.
I have to lie to every single person I've met. I am UNABLE to make friends or Have a girlfriend, because I could never invite them to my house. I don't think people understand how serious not having a proper house is. I'm telling you, someone is gonna die here. The plugs are all fucked up. One day I'm gonna turn on something and I'm gonna die. Do I care? I don't fucking know, I want this to end. I want to have a normal house. I wanna have my own fucking room, I wanna be able to take a shower anytime I want. I want to be able to invite people over. My entire life has been molded around this one thing. My entire childhood has been destroyed, my years in college have been destroyed, I will have mental problems for the rest of my life. I am certain of it. Even if one day we manage to get the money to get a proper house I will forever have these 21 years of pain and disgust inside me. This house is not made for humans. I can't even take a fucking shower when I want to. The house is cold, it rains inside. I don't have my own room. We don't have proper tv, phone or internet services because that requires someone to come here and install a bunch of crap. My mother doesn't want to do any of that. I am losing my mind, covid19 has made this situation a million times worse. I am now completely stuck inside this hell house. I am gonna do something crazy one day, I'm telling you. Aren't people always asking why mentally unstale people never ask for help? Well I'm asking it right now. I am almost certain if this lasts for 1, 2 , 3 months I will end up taking my own life.
My mother can talk to my father about this, and vice versa
My sister has told her boyfriend. He's from another country so it's not like it matters anymore, she vents to him
And I have nobody to talk to. I hear them taking the weight of their chest often. My sister mostly, let's not forget I sleep in the same room my 25 year old sister does. We sleep in a bunk bed How fun! It's awesome having my 25 year old sister sleeping 2 meters below me. It's really fucking nice.
I have had this weight for 21 years. I can NOT take it anymore. I am telling you, I'm gonna do something crazy one day, and that day is coming very soon. I need professional help. Please, please please please help me
i am sorry for all the spelling mistakes, i am typing very fast and I am VERY VERY VERY stressed"
1888,"Hi I’ve been discharged by CMHT although I have severe depression, anxiety and PTSD. They said my GPs care is all I need but they don’t provide enough support. Surely it’s the CMHTs job to look after my mental health. Who will look after my depression now?"

1890,"Hey, so im maisy. I have depression, ive had this episode for about 4 months. Some days are better than others. I want to know if anyone wants to chat, especially during this lockdown. Maybe we can help eachother

I like

Music - rock, metal
Swimming - i teach
Lots of tv and films - i watch loads of films at the cinema

Let me know what you all like"
1891,"Hey all

I kinda need some advice.

I suffer really bad with anxiety - thankfully for me it comes in waves so I can be fine for months and then have such a horrific time! I’m grateful for the good times! But with that, I have some knowledge on (my own personal views of course) how bad the down times can be!

My partner has 2 businesses. One he works in full time, and the other he has staff at. It’s been such a rollercoaster for 2 years where staff don’t get on at all. There’s been so many issues with myself and one of the staff members who he is good friends with.

Recently, I lost my job. Literally one week before the pandemic so I have been home every day. My partner is lucky enough to still be at work (lucky for money, not so lucky to interact with others!). I’ve noticed the last few weeks that he’s having a few drinks every night (he’s not a big drinker), he’s staying up until 4am and he’s so angry. I know he’s suffered in the past being in a bit of a ‘black hole’ but he seems to be taking it out on me. He’s since told me to go and stay somewhere else.

i havent done anything to warrant the behaviour from him (honestly I have racked my brains!) and the way he’s speaking to me is horrible. 

On Friday night, it seemed as though his friend who also works for him had done something to annoy him and he quit a group video call and she then begun messaging him - he took his anger out on me when I asked him a general question

im wondering if he’s potentially suffering with depression - I don’t believe I have ever suffered and I appreciate everyone is different!!

he’s such a closed book so I know he won’t talk to me about it. What can I do? Any help or advice would be amazing!"
1892,"Hello everyone,

When I was a kid everything used to be bright, colorful and exciting. Experiences and activities moved me in a special way I can't really describe. One day in early 2017 when I was 15 years old, all of that was just gone all of a sudden. I have no clue why. I was on the school bus in the morning listening to music when I just realized something felt ""off."" The music I love, the music that moved me in a way that nothing else could wasn't as exciting anymore. Little did I know that this feeling would last for years with no stop.

Every single day since that moment nothing was as exciting as it used to be. I have been extremely tired 24/7 since then and it has been years since I have been truly fully awake and aware of everything. I can't focus on anything anymore because my mind is cluttered with so many thoughts of nonsense that it's like I'm not even a part of reality anymore. I don't even remember my thoughts once I snap back to reality because I can't even focus on my own thoughts, it's just a blur in my mind. Everything is dull and boring and all experiences are the same, like everything kinda just blends together if that makes sense. Like my whole life is one long flatline.

I think many would consider my life to be great. I have tons of friends and own everything I could ever ask for and have a good family with pretty much no issues at all. I love the people in my life and consider myself lucky to have them and they mean the world to me. They make me smile and laugh a lot but the emotions are just another experience like everything else in life.

I would be the happiest person in the world if I just didn't have this constant feeling of emptiness on the inside. Sometimes I just sit and stare at the ceiling trying to be aware of what I feel and everything is just a haze.

There is nothing I can think of that really triggered this whole thing. Nothing traumatic happened to me so it has to be something just wrong with me. I started medication and therapy back in February but nothing has been working yet so far. Currently I am on 15 mg of Lexapro and there haven't really been any good or bad side effects other than rare nausea about once a month and it is harder for me to get out of bed every day now.

This feeling has already been unbearable since it started but now I feel like it's becoming more unbearable just from how long it's been going on for. I am willing to do anything to feel the way I used to feel again.

Is there anyone here who can relate? Has anyone been in this situation and was able to feel normal again? Any words are appreciated. Thank you so much for reading."
1893,"Today I felt like I was no longer making sense and wasn't being taken seriously, so now I feel like giving up. I'm done telling my family what's going on with me because I feel like it's getting me nowhere. I've been shy, loud, and now I just don't care anymore. Reaching out to people has become exhausting because I mess up every time. I'm getting sick of searching for a place where I'm wanted because frankly everyone seems to misjudge me. Is it just bad timing or bad luck? I'm just ready to retreat back into my shell and call it quits. 

I have imposter syndrome as well, so that also adds to the difficulty of developing relationships with people. I don't know how to be a part of this planet and overstaying my welcome at the same time. Plus, being in quarantine with my family has made me slightly more irritable/anxious."
1894,"Ok I need to vent. 
So I'm aware than in my case, my depression is caused, at its root, by negative thinking patterns which led to wrong beliefs and then to wrong actions or rather, paralysis from overthinking. It got me into a huge slump. 
In other words, not trusting myself and my Higher Self/intuition, and instead getting caught up in overthinking led to anxiety and eventually a huge paralysis and the worst depressive episode in my life so far. The mental, emotional and physical pain that ensued was terrible and caused a complete inner fragmentation and breakdown. After my body and brain went into complete shutdown I spent 2 months in bed, as it was simply to painful to wake up and even to get out of bed. I'm now on antidepressants. I don't like taking them because I am aware they are just a chemical fix and do not address the underlying problem. However, I'm thankful that the medication lifts my mood and relieves the pain sufficiently in order for me to be functional at least on a basic level.
My frustration and battle now lies in fighting against the still present negative thoughts in my mind. Things like ""It's too late"", ""You missed your chance in healing"", ""No point trying anyway because you're too far off your path"", ""whatever you do, it doesn't change how you feel"", etc.
I'm fighting these thoughts and I'm trying to work against the tendency to simply give up and into the entropy and weight I feel in my body and mind. It is SO HARD to catch yourself thinking a negative thought and to replace it with something else. Yet, I know that is the only way to change the course of action....I have to accept that I'm in this state, but what I CAN change is how I react to it, i.e. pity myself or beat myself up for it, or think/do something loving/productive for myself.
BUT IT'S SO HARD!!! Given the low energy, motivation, anxiety, real physical pain, lethargy, etc that come with the depressive state.
How are you guys going about this?? How are you dealing with your negative thoughts...thoughts of giving up your power?

I'd appreciate your input. UGHHHH. Sigh"
1895,"I was on SSRIs for years until one day they stopped altogether. Tried a few other SSRIs and I wasn't any better. So I stopped taking them to see if maybe SSRIs were causing depression ( had no real belief they Were causing depression) all and all I still feel depressed and no improvement there but I noticed I have more feelings and I can cry again. Antidepressants really can numb ur emotions. Currently try a host of suppliments from ginko, omega3, to magnesium etc etc. Trying to figure out why in my case depression started. Anyone take accutane?? I think it's possable it has alot of bad effects"
1896,"THIS IS A LOT AND I AM SORRY 
Hi all, I started seeing a therapist recently, I started therapy to save my relationship, I have abandonment issues, help my anxiety I suffer from anxiety attacks and now possibly depression or bpd but nonetheless my mental health is affecting my relationship. I don't want to lose my partner after 6 years and I want to feel better. I have no drive or motivation to do anything I don't enjoy the things I used to, I barely talk to my friends I pretty much work eat and sleep, sad I know. I recently had a birthday party, I have always been outgoing and crazy not afraid to speak my mind or change to win anyones approval this attracted life long friends into my life. At my birthday dinner all of my friends came a guest list of 20 people.. I also got a cake decorated something I have wanted for the past 10 years but could never afford.. Seeing all of my friends, getting gifts, having the cake you would think I had the time of my life but I didn't and I was confused I thought I would normally thrive in this environment and talk about the night for days even weeks.. But no, I left that night feeling actually quite sad and a little. This was when I first realized something isn't right.. I also just recently put thousands of dollars into recording equipment (im a singer) and a camera so I can start a youtube channel.. I haven't even used the equipment and Im too insecure to record myself, also something I could never afforded in the past I thought I would go crazy and be caught up into it for hours on end but no, this didn't even make me happy.. I haven't told my therapist these stories but for other things she found during our sessions she thinks Im depressed, my quality of life has gone from 80-90% to now probably 10% and thats only bc I have hope that there will be brighter days... My therapist asked if I would be interested in taking medication.. Not sure whether or not I should. My life has just become so little and dim... I could exercise for 3 hours at a time I ate healthy I sang all of the time I could talk to friends on the phone for hours, I loved being outside, cooking, baking and long boarding and shopping and going to restaurants and just doing anything with my friends and my boyfriend (we share the same friends) and now I order delivery food pretty much every night, I hate going anywhere, I feel awkward talking to my friends on the phone Id prefer to text and even at that I barely ever respond, I pretty much lay down all day on my phone wasting time, its just a cycle nothing interesting ever happens in my life anymore and I have hated the person I am for letting myself go and gaining nearly 100 pounds, not excelling in my music career bc I have no motivation to even try.. I know this was long and Im sorry I just really want to convey the full drastic change my life has made. Do I sound like I am in a deep depression or something that can easily be changed if I continue the therapy, I don't know anyone who is depressed or have been depressed that I can go to, would someone in my state normally take anti depressants? I want to take them so I can have my life back but I don't know if I even need them or if I should."
1897,"Sorry for all the threads.

I am just wondering why I am feeling so down lately and was pondering whether it could be due to lack of sex as my sex life has been pretty much non-existent for almost 2.5 years and not through choice. 

Luckily, I haven't experienced loss of libido much over the years and have a high sex drive, but no one is interested in hooking up lately and it has been playing on my mind.

Is there a link between sex and depression/low mood?"
1898,"Hi All,

I've been suffering from Depression and Anxiety for over 10 years.

I just feel super empty at times, I continue to go on like it's normal but people don't see it, I hide my mental issues by putting a fake smile, I'm quite the jack the lad type I am the loud mouth of the group of friends my personality is smiling, having a laugh joking around when I'm out with my friends.

When I'm all alone all the feelings rush back to my head and I feel like ****, lying down crying on the bed, feeling the need to hurt myself, I've tried to top myself 3 times.

I'm 33 years old, live in West London, never had a girlfriend or a female companion of any sort - I frequent escort services to fill the void and spend thousands on this activity, my most resent escapade was 3 weeks ago.

I was clearing out my room and found a journal where I wrote my feelings from 2007, it's scary that I was writing about my feelings back then, A few lines are below.

""Funny world this, tensions arise form all angels, at times you feel like a old man who wants a walking stick""
""Another Day befalls, you are feeling empty, you wonder will my life ever get any worse or in my case any better""
""Arguments, depression feeling sad, breaking down, failure of all aspects in life are the causes in depression""

The above was written in 2007 the resemblance of what I'm feeling now is uncanny.

I was a cocaine user for over 5 years when I use to work in the banking industry - that life consist of Drugs, Alcohol, Hookers and lavish parties, I quit that job then went into rehab for 6 months, the last time I used cocaine was 2 months ago but I want to do it everyday but I resist it.

I have found a new career now working in the IT sector, my parents are very wealthy and I am the only child, you know what goes hand in hand with being a only child is being well spoilt, my dad was in the banking industry and got me my job in banking my mum was a lawyer, I use to get £3k a month from my parents as pocket money and you guessed where all that money went, at the age of 18 my parents gifted me a apartment in the city and it addiction of drugs, achohol, and sex workers went into overdrive.

I don't go counselling I just keep it within me, I sometimes write things down that's still not enough.

I hope I haven't bored you with my story.

Thanks,

Lance

1899,"Heya, 

Anyone also on Pristiq? What has your experience been so far?
I noticed that my heart rate is up more than normal - that's what it feels like at least."
1900,"When I stopped it around two weeks, My brain gradually can't use, Now I already took it back two weeks. But seem to be not get better. I am seem to be lost my thought ability to the surroundings. But I still can give respond to others. I will update my SITUATION here every day."
1901,The daily battle with anxiety and feeling down gets exhausting. I just feel like I can't feel positive about anything anymore. I've tried everything to feel better. Sometimes it helps and other times I feel like I'm back to square one.
1902,"I am in college and about 6 months ago started to date my stepbrother,he is the same age as me, and we live in the same house as our respective parent,(who are not aware that we are going out), at first i thought it was a good idea to date, because he knew about my depression and everything was going well untill the beginning of April, i fell into a depressive episode which causes me to feel numb essentially, it is as if though i feel nothing for him anymore i hate it when he touches me,and in all honesty i am beginning to question if i ever had any real romantic feelings for him, and now i am starting to act distant and i hate myself for it, it is causing me to feel angry at myself,and i just feel so overwhelmed because is what i am feeling right now normal feelings of falling out of love or is it the depression, also what should i do, should we brake up?, but if we do i lose a person who listens and accepts me, as well as the fact that it is going to be very uncomforatable living in the same house as an ex"
1903,"Hello everyone, i'm new to this kind of things, i've read several posts from other people on other forums over the years but never thought of sharing mine. And now since i'm feeling a bit better, i'm confident enough to share with you guys how i feel hoping that your feedback will help me throughout my journey.

So i've been writing this document on the span of several months during the last year, since i've found out that writing my thoughts help ease the pain a little bit and it structured my thoughts better. Over the months that i've been writing this, a lot has changed in my life, and in my way of seeing things, although most of it i still think is true and i believe it. And i couldn't write everything describing my depression, my experiences and my anxiety.

I'm sorry for the language used in this document, it was meant to be my private writing and for me only to read, but i think it makes it more expressive. and i'm sorry if it's a bit long.

I am a 27 years old man, I’m struggling with depression. 

At this point, I don't know if I can trust anyone, I’m not sure if anyone cares, or if anyone is there, to listen or to understand, maybe there are some who care, but I’m not sure if it's from an entirely altruistic point of view, everyone is looking to satisfy some deep need inside of them, and they don’t care about what I need, so I go along and fill their void, I go along and share what they perceive as happiness. They end up happy, and I end up miserable, pretending to be happy, pretending to care, because I don't, I really don't. I don’t have the will to even think about someone else. I can’t think or care for someone else because there's no place in my head for that, there's no place in my mind for them, only for me, I never feel safe, I never feel peaceful, I never feel happy, I’m always scared, I’m always on alert, I’m always on edge, and I don't have anyone to protect me from that, I only have myself, I have to protect myself by any means, it's the natural thing to do, my mind is struck by countless streams of fear and agony that I don’t have the time to think about anything or anyone else. 

The feeling of loneliness is so overwhelming. It's a very dark place. Every meaning of life does not exist here, all colors are desaturated to an impressive degree , this life with all it can offer is like an ocean of happiness I cannot baptize myself in, the window to the other side is so tightly sealed, but I can see it, the other side , I can look at it, sometimes I feel the breeze coming from that window, for a slight moment I can feel a relief from that soothing stream of air, only for it to disappear suddenly. stripping me of the delusional feeling of happiness that I was so craving for, I don't know if this is what it means when they say life is unfear, I have many things in my life that others dream of : skills, material possessions, financial ease, a ""family"", friends ... yet the unbalance is so strong, the numerical equation results always in a number precedented by a minus, always ! No matter how large the positive number can be, it's always a large overwhelming negative number that I get for a result. I believe the elements composing the equation are wrong, I believe that I was offered the wrong elements to work with, or maybe I just suck at math, no matter the option, I couldn’t find the good results, and so the thoughts of ending this test became very familiar to my mind, what if I was not meant to succeed the test? What if all of this is a cruel joke? Because it surely feels like it, a big fat cruel joke. 

My family never made me feel safe, the only entity that is supposed to do that single and only job, they failed at it miserably, with all their insecurities and misunderstandings of life, they made me feel like I can never rely on them, they made me feel like I can never trust them, they made feel lonely. 

They made me crave attention, they made me lose every ounce of self-esteem and confidence in myself, and they produced a nonfunctional human being. 
I inherited their thought process, I inherited their insecurities and their life misconceptions, and when life struck, it stuck hard. A feeling of loss and emptiness hit me, I had to learn how to function on my own, when it was fairly late for a change. I craved the attention of the wrong people, I couldn’t trust anyone, I didn't know how to address people because I felt like I am inferior to all of them, I was scared of them, I was scared of their judgement, I didn't know if I’m allowed to make decisions, I lived in the shadow of others, I told myself that I wasn’t good enough all the time, that I’m the one who's wrong all the time, that I was the one who should apologize because I’m the faulty piece in the system, with all my strengths and my good qualities, this brilliant individual is the broken gear in the engine and this said individual should always be the worthless broken piece that cannot fit anywhere. That is what I’ve learned from my family, these are the life lessons and the gear my family provided me with to face life. 
So I went on living like this , I lived like this looking for that safe place that my parents didn’t know how to provide, or didn’t even consider important or they were stupid enough not to think about it. I’m still looking for it, I’m still lost, how am I going to fill a void that is so fundamental to a human being by myself? Where am I going to find a proper family? A proper feeling of security when no one is there to provide it, should I make myself feel secure? All by myself? I do not know how, I have never known how, I have never felt another feeling other than fear.

All my life I have felt anxious about the smallest of things : what if that thing happened? What if that person thinks this or that of me? What if my art does not please people? What if my voice is bad and people are pretending to like it? What if a policeman stops me while I’m driving? What if I say something wrong during a meeting and everyone thinks I’m stupid? How can I meet that person, they are higher than me, smarter than me? I don’t want to go outside because I don’t feel comfortable, I feel like every single person is looking at me? And the list goes on long enough that I don’t believe it can be put in text. 

My family never showed me any sign of affection, I’ve never felt that, not in their words, not in their eyes, not in their behavior, they don’t know how to express it, they believe that money can buy happiness, they don’t believe in communication, they don’t believe in opening up, and descending to their child’s level, they believe that they are “the parents” they hold a higher status, and this is shown in the very small details of their behavior, no respect for the child’s opinion, because it’s a younger person than you, no respect for the child’s decision and a tendency to point out how much it is wrong, because it’s a person younger than you and “you know better”, no respect for the child’s privacy since you own the damn thing you can barge on them in their room as you wish without permission, you can speak loudly and make all sort of noises while they are sleeping, because only they should respect you and be quiet while you’re sleeping, you can decide what they should wear, where they should go, you need to know detail by detail with whom they went and when they will be back without putting any trust in them or at least pretending to do so. How can you lower yourself and apologize to your child when you’re clearly wrong? You are better than them, you should never have to apologize or to teach your children some basic human interactions, you should never let your child learn from you by opening up to them, telling them about your life, your experiences, give them advice, you know? Make them trust you and tell you their problems? no matter how little they are to you? you should never make an effort to think structurally how to teach your child the ways of life, a way of thinking, teach them how to make their own decisions. Instead point out every wrong thing they did, instead don’t let them do anything by themselves and step up every time feeling like a hero to do the right thing by yourself and they watch you helpless, not knowing whether they are wrong or they are incapable of anything, you should always look perfect from that high position of yours. you should lash out at the slightest disagreement they have with your opinion, why would your ego let a child win an argument with you? They should be punished for even having an opinion ! They should be told that “I wish I had an abortion if I knew you would become like this” because how dare they have a single thought for themselves? How dare they be themselves? How dare they love manga, and draw characters, and have ambitions to become a great artist? How dare they live up to an image that you did not imagine for them to be? How can you lower your standards, sit with your child, and listen to them? How can lower your standards and say I’m sorry? I believe the fall would be even harder and more hurtful for you if you said: 
“I love you” … and you hugged them. 

I am writing this on the span of several days, all my ideas are all over the place, nothing is under control and this is a very disturbing feeling. Nothing is ever clear except this burning sensation inside my chest, this feeling of fear and isolation, and the watery eyes I have out of pity for myself. 

Sometimes I wish I could hug myself, sometimes I wish that this feeling would stop, that this screwed up ill mind that I have would miraculously heal, and function normally, but it never does, this macrorganism is messy this biology is messy. It’s not perfect like they say, it has never been, and if there was a creator, he owes me, and billions of other conscious creatures, an apology for his fucked up work, if anyone is responsible for this mess, my rage towards them is indescribable. 

Growing up I felt like I was in a prison, mentally and physically. The overprotective nature of my parents amplified my anxiety; they held a tight grip on my freedom during my childhood, my teenager years and my college years. Instead of exposing me to the world, they sheltered me from it, to the point that it seemed like a horrific place to be in. I understand that the world is not a safe place to throw your child in, but at least be there for them to introduce them to it sometimes, and leave them on their own other times, I believe this would allow them be familiar with it, and gradually learn to function in it on their own.

My father never took me with him outside to show me the world, never gave me an advice, never sat down with me and tried to communicate. I don't know anything about him other than he is a kind of a stranger who controls me as he wishes, I don’t know what he likes, I don’t know how he thinks, I don’t know his past, how he lived and what problems he confronted. He comes home after being with his friends or whatever other places he goes to, and he isolates himself to watch ""his TV"" and  use ""his computer"" and his ""couch"" that no one is allowed to go near them, a perfect example of a selfish person. FUCK MY FATHER, fuck that asshole my anger towards him is indescribable, now after 27 years and because he’s retired and always home he’s trying to get in touch with me when he was absent all those years. He was physically there but he was always absent fuck him. He’s toxic and unbearable I despise that fucker !! 

Back to the prison that my family unconsciously built. I wished that my parents taught me how to think instead of what I should think; I wished my parents respected what I had to say and didn’t make me feel that my thoughts had no value. I wished my parents taught me that education is not the only road to success, and that I didn’t have to realize that by myself, I wished they didn’t put that pressure on me : either I succeed in education, or I will become a failure in society. They still do to this day, with the excuse that they want “the best for me”. You did not prepare me to deal with the world, so why are you expecting me to do so? Or are you ignorant enough that you do not realize the errors you made? To this day I’m barely allowed to spend a night out of the house. Or to express what I think without feeling that I’m wrong, or to decide what I do with my life without them telling me that I’m fucking wrong! What if I was wrong?? I want to be wrong, because I don’t know how it feels to be wrong and deal with the consequences, I was always kept in the shadows and people solved my problems however small they were. I want to fuck up my life the way I wanted. 

Sometimes I wish I had never been born at all. I strongly believe that if you do not have what it takes to raise a child, you should never have one. I believe a child is a responsibility that you should structurally think about, a project in which you have no right to fail.                                                       
Not some blessing your god gifted you, or a step in your life that you should surpass. I believe that once you have a child, and the whole process must be carefully planned and intended, you should dedicate most of your energy to supporting them. And by supporting, them I mean supervise them, and give them the necessary tools to be functional without you. And definitely not frame their whole life inside strict boundaries created out of your insecurities. Try to understand why they behaved that way, or said such thing, or made that thing. Analyze them to try to understand them better and to know the right thing to say and to do in a difficult situation. But most importantly, be their friend.
Be there for them, so they can look up to you, your child is the reflection of your behavior.

Oh FUCK the god or gods listening to me now if they exist!! Oh the rage and anger burning inside of me for whomever or whatever made me this way !! Oh, I will shred them apart to pieces; I will skin them alive and burn every inside of them, I will pierce their hearts with a rusty nail pushing so slowly for a maximum pain. Oh I will fucking find out their worst pain and inflict it on them for an eternity, OH FUCK YOU GOD, FUCK YOU AND YOUR GAMES, FUCK YOU WRITERS OF MY STORY, FUCK YOU EVOLUTION, FUCK YOU DARWIN, FUCK YOU GENES AND SOCIETY AND MANKIND AND FUCKING EXITENCE ITSELF; FUCK YOU UNIVERSE, FUCK ALL OF YOU !!! FUCKING BURN TO ASHES, CEASE TO EXIST !!! DIE !!! 

I believe it’s done for me, i dunno if this is gonna be my suicide note or just a burden release, I keep fighting this thing in me alone, I keep getting these painful feelings all day long and I don’t have anyone to talk to, I don’t feel like anyone is actually there for me, I just want to end this suffering, I feel unwanted and unloved and hurt and battered and weak and clueless.


I keep seeking the attention of my old professor who is a father figure to me and all my efforts are in vain.  I keep craving that father in someone who is indifferent towards me.
 I keep looking for the love of a father in every older man I see, to replace my actual father that never were there for me. The father whom presence terrified me, the father who was never supportive of me, the father who put me down several times, ridiculed my opinions, ridiculed my passions, ridiculed who I am for the sake of sounding funny or for the sake of disciplinary methods.
 I keep trying to get in touch with my professor but he is never interested in me, or he feels bothered by me whenever I reach to him. I do not blame him, there is nothing to be loved or interested in to be honest. 
I love that man like he was my actual father, he was kind and gentle and took me in and taught me the ways of life and work, and I repaid him with all my emotional bursts. Because I’m not balanced because I’m scared at times, because I’m emotionally unstable. I wish if I could go back in time and change all this because I fucked up so bad. I pushed someone I love away and now I feel so guilty and sad that all my efforts to fix this are not paying off, all my efforts are In vain and I feel like I’m a source of annoyance for the only person I love. Now I feel unwanted and I’m terrified that he will die someday with that image of me in his mind which is very likely. 

I feel this shallow confidence that happens to me from time to time after a major depression episode, it feels like a fragile shield that is waiting impatiently for that little poke to brake and fall into pieces to reveal the ever burning sensation of extreme low self-esteem and anxiety. 

I consider the man to be the father I never had, my biological father is still alive and well, but no man had made me progress in life like my professor did. No man had  patience with my twisted personality as he did. My father did not show me the ways of life while I was growing up, he never gave me a responsibility or pushed me to take responsible acts, he never showed me how to tackle life problems, or to think like an adult. He’d always interfere and treat me as the child who can never do anything by himself. My professor always pushed me to do things out of my comfort zone, he knew I’m a failure and I can’t handle things. He knew I was a coward, he knew that I fail in social interactions but he kept testing me anyways, over and over until I started to think like an adult, I started to act like a responsible adult, I still have fears and doubts and anxious thoughts though, but I evolved.

My father never shared his thoughts and problems with me but my professor did, he did share his thoughts with me, he did ask my opinion on matters when he thought I could help, but my father never did. He always thought of me as a kid whose opinion didn’t matter and had no value. my professor did confess to me his deepest feelings, his joy and his sadness, his problems and his experience in life and work. my professor was there when I needed an ear to listen to me, when I needed someone to help me. I was having suicidal thoughts, and he was the first person that I’ve told about it, and he actually offered material and moral help. I had many a laugh while he was telling me his stories about his friends, about his rivals at work, about his family. He even asked me to be his partner in a business project, (but i blew it cuz i'm fuck up). I was sad when he was upset, I was upset when he told me about his struggles with debts, I got depressed when I learned about his health, I defended him when someone spoke badly of him. But honestly after 4 years knowing him I don’t know how he feels towards me. I’ve wronged him many times, I’ve said stupid things to him, I had negative thoughts about him, i said stuff that hurt him, i behaved in a bad way many times, but It was all because I was depressed and had no pleasure in life, and I did not appreciate the positive side of things in my life. I didn’t mean to do or say anything bad to him, all I wanted is his attention, all my actions are based on that. All my actions were based on love, but from a narcissistic point of view, I was selfish, I was stupid, I wasn’t authentic and genuine with him, I tried to behave in ways that I thought would make him appreciate and respect me more but I ended up screwing things up, I ended up making him dislike me and avoid me, I pushed so hard that I damaged the relationship to the point of no return. 

My professor is my teacher, is my mentor, my friend, and my father. I wish I could express this in real life or to make him see this and understand this, but I blew it and I couldn’t fix it. I wish that I could change his mind. But I think it’s too late.

I find myself lately watching videos of soldiers coming home and being hugged by their family members so passionatley, i find myself watching shows of broken families that solves their problems together and love each other, and my eyes gets watery my chest starts burning and i fall into a sea of melancholy. I think about how my friends are with their families and it just tears me apart, when i see how my friends parents treat them, when i see the relationship between my boss and his son to an extent i thought impossible between father and son, and how he's so gentle and warm with his daughter, how X's father is so supportive of her and how Y's mother befriends him, how F's father shares drinks with her and M and his brother are so close and united. That's everything i wanted, i wanted to love and feel loved, all i want now is to come home and feel that warmth instead of the cold and frustrating environnement i go back to every evening after work. I want to share a laugh, share a moment, share a thought, all i want is to be able to trust my parents, to tell them about my secrets, my joy, my pain, my fears and my ambitions, but they are not trustworthy, and they are judgmental, and close minded, my mother is very passive and has a low selfesteem and very little experience in life, and my father is a tempermental selfish asshole, i tried to love them, but i never could, i did love my mother in my younger years but that faded away years ago. And now i don't love any of my family members, i imagine them dead and it doesn't move a single hair in me. I don't love them, i don't anything towards them, except for my father that i hate, and i think it's too late for me to start developping feelings for any of them. 
So now I'm craving a family so bad that i try to fit myself in places i don't belong to ... and that hurts ... it hurts so bad to live among people that makes you feel lonely. 

I am sitting here uncomfortably trying to write down on text my inner desires, my fantasies … my sexuality. 

I have built my sexuality over the feeling of lack of security, my mind subconsciously created an imaginary safe land based on the most basic Freudian theory about sexuality and sex preferences. My mind was looking for a kind of a father figure and somehow merged it with arousal and desire, sexual attraction and at some point it became an obsession.
My grandfather was an authoritarian figure, a strong controlling man with his long macho mustache and his deep voice that shakes the deepest of souls. But he had that soft spot that shows when he is with his grandchildren, it reveals a deeper personality and a spectrum of emotions that contradicts the rough strong unshakable image that he projects to the world, it shows that the mightiest of mountains have their vulnerable spot. 
At the time of writing this, I strongly believe that this exact image is what initiated my whole sexuality: “Seeing an authority figure, that represent a father figure, at his most vulnerable and weak moment” 
I have fantasized about every authority figure in my life, teachers, fathers of my friends, other random older men that I imagine as a potential father figure. I have fantasized about situations in which those men feel weak, look and act weak, a moment of being tired, or a moment of physical or emotional pain, I would imagine them in need of help to feel a relief, to feel pleasure, and to surrender themselves to that vulnerable moment. And it would be more arousing for me if I was the reason for their well-being, to the point of submitting myself to whatever they need. 

This is one of the major factors in my depression, i don't enjoy having sex with an older man, it feels demeaning, it feels tastless, and i don't find myself attracted to women, i'm only arroused by seeing an old man in a weak state and that's all, and this makes me think, am i doomed to live alone ? I can't even have a family of my own, i'm scared that if i start a relationship with an old man he would pass away way sooner, or should i try to start a relation with a woman even though i am not attracted to any woman and i've never had my whole life? 

on the 2nd of april 2020 at night, i cried my heart out, for hours, i didn't cry for years, but that night was so intense that in the next day i felt battered and weak, i felt like my chest got beaten all night, i was shaking the whole day, and i had a different kind of burning in my chest. It was like a sore muscle. Then at night i cried again, not as much as the night before, but something happened, i snapped somehow , and i stopped feeling pity for myself, i stopped feeling anxious, and depressed, i don't know how, or why, but i felt like i went into self discovery territory ... it feels bittersweet, but has a lot of sadness in it, mixed with self acceptance, i no longer feel depressed, i just feel like i'm starting to learn how to ride the dragon."
1904,"Hey 
I’ve picked up recently but the past couple of days I can feel myself dipping down a bit. Sort of numb and down. Anyone have any ways of coping or helping themselves? 
thanks."
1905,"Hi 

I'm wondering if someone can help me.... I am trying to make sense of my suicidal thoughts.... and what to do with them.... I will be honest I have struggled with these for a few years now... gradually getting worse and not better as the years have gone on, to the point now they don't stress me out as much as they used to as its almost become a way of life. I was given medication to take from my GP a few years ago which I guess has helped take that edge off the anxiety around it, but ever since then I have never been able to fully shake what's felt like a huge dark cloud over me. I sometimes wonder if this could be the medication, or if once you go to that place you never fully come out of it? Its all felt really heightened since going into lockdown, and that's probably mostly due to loneliness. But I have all of these questions around my suicidal thoughts.... like if I haven't done it already am I really serious about it, and why have I started a new job if I really have no intention of being here? I'm just wondering if anyone knows where I should go with these questions? And if there's never going to be anyway to get out of this place in my head, then maybe I should just go. I've tried my GP but don't feel like I get anywhere, and with Covid 19 I'm not even sure its possible to go back, but I also know that I shouldn't probably go to the GP for anything unless its an emergency. I not even sure I would be brave enough to take my own life, but I know sometimes I wish more that ever that I was brave enough. I just don't know what to do about it anymore. I know we can also get free counselling through work but I'm 1. Too scared to phone about it, and 2. Pretty sure I am too far gone into negative thinking for that ever to be changed. Writing this doesn't even help me feel more positive that I am reaching out for help, it just makes me feel worse that my life has gotten to this point. If someone cant help me find a positive way out... maybe they can help me find the courage I need to take my own life and finally be happy."
1906,"I am 25 and never had a girlfriend. I've been on POF and OkCupid for 7 years. The women on there talk with me for 3 months then they agree to a date only to cancel it 24 hours before it happens then blocked me with no explanation. I am afraid to talk to women in real life because of my Asperger's. 

But anyway I have major depression and have to see a therapist now because of this."
1907,"After antidepressants withdrawal, I thought that my brain gradually can't use. Now I feel numb and empty,My sense of self seems to be disappear. But I already took the meds again thirteen days. But it still not get better.Is that  depersonalization? I ask my doctor am I schizophrenia, he said no, But I think that I have because of this symptom. Antidepressants withdrawal is possible to happen depersonalization? I am so hopeless 😢"
1908,"I kind of think that I wasted my time in school & highschool cause I was just totally focussed on my studies and really missed a chance to get a good gf of my type.
I mean I regret not trying and now in college I think no girl is of my type here so kind of worried that I would end up single in life and its disturbing me.I don't know why I am worried these days,never ever have I ran after love like this but seeing existence of 40 year bachelors worries me
All of this is making me depressed,I never have been so affected by this because I see all of my friends getting in relationships,while I really feel lonely and looks like no one likes me,I don't even have good friends except some.Plz help,I waste hours and hours thinking this and being sad

I also have OCD and anxiety issues from years...."
1909,"so she had an infection in her leg 3 weeks ago ,was in hospital for about a week had lots of anti biotics and there was no sign of a blood clot ,she has a history of these
the district nurse only came out twice and said she wouldn't come anymore as she wasn't a priority-the nurse was supposed to change aunts dressings

so my aunt is in pain tonight and her leg is weeping and swollen
im upstairs with my puppy star while aunt and hermit wait for a doctor to come out

am so worried she will have to go to hospital-will catch the virus and pass it to hermit and they both die
sorry x"
1910,"I had a relationship that didn't last too long, we weren't anything official ever. It lasted about 3 months and it has been my first and only relationship. She lost interest in me when my best friend came to visit and had feelings for him. I'm pretty sure they are together now and i still just can't accept it. I feel betrayed by both of them.

This happened a year ago and i am still angry about it. It feels like it only has gotten worse over time. I've begun to cut people off, some have called me insane and i honestly am starting to believe it.

I haven't made progress in recovery because i'm stuck between two states of mind, one where i am angry and hate both of them, and another where i miss hanging out with them and all the good times we had. I go from Jealousy > Anger > Missing Them > Anger. I have insane mood swings and there almost isnt a time where im not thinking about the whole situation. 

I have a skin condition also that i've been dealing with for the past year. It is Psioriasis which is basically scales or lesions across my body. This started shortly after she left me, and i believe that they did this to me. They put me so low mentally that it caused my body to react this way.

The Psioriasis seems to only get worse with time, i hate seeing myself in the mirror. I don't know if i'll ever find anyone to love me like this. I waited 24 years to find someone, and i don't think i'll ever have another shot. My body is tainted and would stop me from ever moving on or finding another lover.

This traumatic experience has affected my entire life. The way i view friends, my mental and physical health and my self esteem. There has been a constant phrase that has echoed throughout my mind the past few days. ""Be Nothing, Feel Nothing"". I don't know how it got into my head, or how i even thought of that phrase, but i assume the phrase means that the only one to stop how i feel is if i'm dead.

I believe people don't actually like me. They say one thing but their actions say the opposite.
I miss being able to trust people at their word. I cannot name one friend who i legitimately have faith in.
I've been reaching out for so long, but people don't take me seriously."
1911,I’m really struggling today. I do most days but today just feels worse. Depression just doesn’t let up or leave you alone. Is anyone else feeling like this too?  I don’t know how much longer I can do this for. But I know there are lots of caring people on this forum who are also in pain so hugs to you.
1912,"Like seriously, what is EXPERIANCE. Its like i no longer comprehend what experiential emotions are. When i think of peace, its like i no longer understand what it is or why i WANT to feel that. Its like im just existing. Floating. Im nothing and these things im capable of feeling no longer make sense to me. I do everything automatically...When my sister makes a joke, i smile, maybe fake laugh but i cant feel it. I dont mentally grasp the point of feeling good anymore? I think about happiness. About desires. Desire to be happy. Or ultimately, the ability to LIKE something. Anything. For a long time, i desired happiness, to be able to enjoy things, to like things. Now i dont after too much rumination on feelings and not feeling, im in a strange limbo where i keeping thinking that i need to be happy but i dont understand why now? The feeling doesnt appeal anymore. NOTHING appeals anymore. Again, its my ability to LIKE something is gone. It happened suddenly too. After thinking about emotions and stuff. I cant like being happy, or being relaxed. Is this depression???

I think ive gone insane..."
1913,"I usually balance my mood by socialising 3 or more nights per week. I no longer have that option and it is taking me to a dark place. 

I'm struggling to hope, to imagine a time when I will not be full of grief for a life not lived, a time when I will not be full of sadness, pain and loneliness. I struggle to imagine a time when my mind will give me peace."
1914,"Just registered yesterday,so glad to find some online support. Really need to vent with my anonymity intact.
I’m 44 yrs now, and resigning myself to the fact I’m always going to end up back at rock bottom being depressed. I feel so frustrated,life has passed me by and I’ve literally achieved nothing! Just now I’m particularly depressed with this UK lockdown(as I live alone),but I feel pretty isolated most of the time anyway. The depression has caused me to withdraw and this has caused me to loose friends;leaving me feeling isolated. I am annoyed with myself giving into it but don’t know how not to.
I can have spells were I am fun but then I’m plagued with anxiety. Have a new job starting that was postponed with the Coronavirus but dreading it. Scared I mess up yet another opportunity.
Looking for some pen pals that can relate. I like to vent but I’m not a total pessimist either😗"
1915,"Thats what the crissis team all ways ask me, on some days I would like to say , of course Im bloody not safe I want to end it all, on other days I can cope with my depression and hearing voices and want to live.
Like today I have been on a long walk with my PA and felt ok, but as soon as I got home the voices started being nasty to me again, I can cope but only just.
So what can I say to the crissis team I am suicidal, Im copeing, I am just fed up with the same old question, this is just a rant because I am down right angry at every thing."

Im losing hope, I've tried exercising and meditatition, I'm also on anti depressants."
1917,"Sometimes I don't know what takes over me but “depressiveness” takes over for a minute and I literally have to myself out of it before I start thinking about dark shit, even when I'm happy my whole mood just goes down I mean it's not like I don’t think about constantly killing myself or harming myself but you know most times I'm chill with these feelings.  But sometimes it gets too hard to manage and I end really dark places."
1918,"Took some time to free write what I feel when I am alone and feeling a little down. Please just see any strong assertions as me just trying to rattle anything out of my brain I felt was stuck.

I don’t know why I seem to be addicted to sadness. I spent so much time alone, it was my safe place away from all the chaos. Deep down I don’t trust people, they will use me, hurt me, lie to me, or worse: expect something from me and it won’t be good enough, or it will disappoint them…. Or worse, they will become ecstatic and love me or what I give them, and I know it’s not me, or it’s overvalued. I don’t like to let people in, and I love to keep to myself. I like being alone, and I hate being alone. I crave solitude like it’s an addiction. Being in a house by myself is the most “me” I ever feel, but I don’t like me very much. I spent my whole life with people not understanding me and I love being able to hide behind any mask I want, but I also crave deeply for someone to know me. I think happiness annoys me, and comfort makes me sick. The happier people are around me, the more depressed I feel. I think I want to minimize happiness… I don’t want help because people are stupid. They don’t understand and they always think they do. They think they can figure me out when I am simply a mask. There is nothing behind the face, nothing but chaos, pride, pain, and loss. They always say the same thing or give the same derisive look. They think they can tell me what I need to do or how I need to think, but I have been telling myself all their “sage” advice since I was a little boy. A game I love to play is to tell someone the most truthful, uncomfortable thing about me, just to watch them squirm, laugh, think I’m joking and play it off as nothing while I slip back behind a mask once again, forever alone, forever unchanged.
The only cure I have found is to get lost, stay away from “me” for as long as possible, but then I will crave the solitude, I will crave the depression, I will crave the loneliness and find myself once again face to face with what I am: an indescribable problem with no solution. I don’t want to be fixed, I don’t want a solution, I just want someone to do what even I cannot do… I want someone to understand. Simply understand I am broken, simply understand parts of me are unhinged, chaotic, in disarray and out of control. But I know you don’t understand. You can’t. You haven’t walked in my shoes, you cannot comprehend being a little boy who is at once hated and rejected by his mother, and also lauded on as lovely and perfect. To have a life of excess filled with toys, and friends, and hobbies and laughter while mixed with continual chaos, stress, loss, pain, abandonment and violence. To be the teacher's pet and a lost boy at the same time. For now I will let it all go. Let go of the pain, let go of the loss, let go of the madness, the anger, the emptiness and embrace the work before me, to put on the mask of service, the mask of fatherhood, the mask of husband and dance in the light while missing the dark, missing it because it’s there I will always be, where I was all along… Silently Screaming in the void…."

There are various reasons why each of us get depressed. Most of us have noone to talk to. So if you are feeling really low today, perhaps you would like to tell us about it here on this thread so that others can help you in any way they can. I too will chat to you too.

Thankyou"

1924,"Recently (19.mart) I was at psychiatry and prescribed 1X 50mg Zoloft in the morning, 3x 10mg Bensedin (Diazepam) a day, and 1/3 150mg Trittico (Trazodone) before sleep. I was prescribed this mainly for depression I had for years and a sudden mood swings (Usually to anger/irritability) that started in last few months. At psychiatry I was also given a one time injection of liquid Bensedin (Diazepam) witch is why I stated with therapy on 20.mart.  This is the first time I ever started using any medical narcotics prescribed by specialist, although it's the 4th time I went to psychiatrist thru out the last year and a half and prescribed medicine I never started using any of them out of unsatisfaction of how I was received, all 4 times I went to different psychiatrists, and all 4 times a season lasted for less than 15 minutes. The second time I went to psychiatrist I was told that full therapies don't exist in government healthcare system of my country and that all they can do is briefly lessen to me and prescribe me meds based on what they hear, than see me for check up once a month to again briefly lessen to my reactions on medicine and change something if they think necessary, and that if I wanted something more I would have to go to a private clinic, witch is not something I can afford. Among those 4 times I was diagnosed with 1rst time: personality disorder, OCD, Depression and Schizophrenia. 2nd time with Depression and Anxiety disorder. 3rd time with Depression and possible Bipolar disorder, 4th time with Depression, sudden mood swings and instructed to go to a clinic for people with drug addictions (witch I don't have). Personally I consider those diagnosis less professional and on lower level than self-diagnosis, but I started with therapy anyway cause I was left with no other options as I reached a limit with how much I can help myself on my own and with self-medications I tried. 

After second time I went to a psychiatrist (20.jun.2019) I decided to try self medicating with street drugs using my previous experience with recreational drugs and information I can find on internet as I considered it a safer option than taking meds I know nothing about prescribed by a clearly unprofessional psychiatrist, and this way I could at least see effects imitatively rather than after months. Before this I didn't do any recreational drugs for about 5-6 years nor did I have desire to do them, so I wasn't going in this for a fun.  I started with low doses of marijuana as I read that in low doses marijuana can help reduce anxiety and from experience I know it can relax you and make you sleep better as wee at least temporarily put your depression on hold. I occasionally used it for about 2-3 months, mostly ether before sleep or alone in nature. While it would often if not most of time make me paranoid at start of having an effect even in  low doses after that it would relax me  and even after effects pass my irrational fears would lessen. After 2-3 months my irrational fears have nearly completely dissapired and my anxiety has somewhat lowered (Although some big positive social changes in my life during this time probably had a rule to play in this as well), after that I found smoking didn't do anything for me any more in a therapeutic way so I stopped. On the negative side it made me start smoking cigarettes again, this is probably due to fact that in my country weed is always mixed with tobacco. After that I smoked weed only a few times up till now when I was feeling really low, similar to how some people drink when they feel bad, just in my case weed has more positive effects on me than alcohol. 

Some 5 moths ago due to some really bad social happenings my depression and anxiety have significantly worsen, I tried smoking weed again but it didn't help, I tried drinking but it didn't help eater, I was at a point I couldn't do anything anymore, I even stopped taking care of myself like shaving or changing close, it just felt like nothing mattered anymore, like it's  all over for me and there's no hope left, and I feared to even think of hoping. I would just do nothing but think all day long, just repeating the same negative thoughts true my head every single day all day long. Than I come at idea of trying speed, it took some time to manage to get my hands on it but I managed in the end. I started with a low doze, 2x around 0.2g for a day. The first time it really helped a lot, I cleaned house, washed clothes, shaved, got dressed ad net, started thinking highly positively of the future, my anxiety nearly disapired and in the end I went out to a rave and had a great time. Surprisingly I didn't even get high depression you are suppose to get when effect of speed wear off, I just went back to the same, if not even better state than usual, probably due to fact I actually had some fun for a change and out of feeling proud that I managed to do so many chores I neglected for months. I did feel physically tired the next day due to parting all night and skipping a night of sleep, but psychologically I felt relaxed and happier than I had been for months (Exuding while I was under effects of speed). I planed to  make a break for a few days and and do it again, but as I catch a pretty bad cold I didn't do it again for 2 weeks. When I started doing it again I did it for 3 nights strait with the same dose, 2 x 0.2g dunning night while a made a break during day so I could get low enough that I can eat something.  Again it had very positive effect on me both while I was on it and after that, it did miracle for my depression, I even managed to make myself go job hunting that I really needed but couldn't force myself to do due to depression. After that I run out of speed and I couldn't get my hands on more for a whole month, when I did I both a higher doze 5g so I would have it for a while, I planed to stretch it out thru a month so I can constantly function properly, witch is not something I could do when I was strait. But things didn't turn out as I planed, for start a doze of 0.2 this time didn't do anything for me, so I took another one, I started feeling something but but effect was still very low, only after  I took around 0.8g in a span of 2h did I get a desired effect I got from 0.2g the last time, still, that night turned out great like last time, but the next night, it took me the whole 2g and even then I didn't get desired effect, even worse when it was stopping to work, It had very weird effects on me i never experienced before, colors got way brighter, I started seeing things and shapes, felt super tired but super relaxed at a same time, among other things. I suspect that speed I took this time was eater very week, or it was mixed with something else, or both (weirdly, everyone else I know who  took it claimed it was extremely strong). The next day after some sleep I was back to normal, witch means depressed. fearing the remaining speed won't have effect on me I took it now I decided to take a day of break and push thru a day somehow, witch was very hard as I was starting my first day on job that day and with depression when not even feeling like getting out of bed having to work was practically a torture. The next night I had to take speed again if I wanted to get thru the next day at work, knowing how week the speed I have is I took a higher dose, about 1g right away, psychologically it did absolutely nothing for me, physically on the other hand, I was sweating excessively, my heart was beating like crazy, I was super confused, tired, I am guessing I got what I later learned is called serotonin syndrome, or something close to it. Worse, knowing that even speed can't help me anymore with my depression I  felt like there is no hope, I got super depressed, and because of feeling sick some of the fears I got rid of thanks to weed started to come back. Not knowing what to do anymore in the morning instead of going to job I went to my doctor and explained a situation and asked if there is anyone I could turn to, I was hoping to be locked away in some mental institution where I would be monitored 24/7 as on my own I simply didn't know how to live with myself anymore, it didn't help that I had absolutely nobody to talk to ever since incident about 5 months ago that left me completely alone in this world, witch increased my depression. Although my doctor adviced me to wait a little and try some other mental institutions first as this particular one, while the only one where I can be admitted to 24/7 without needing appointment for a future is also a last step when nothing else works  she still give me an open appointment at a biggest and most popular and serious mental institution in my country specializing mostly in heavy cases of serious mental illnesses. Unfortunately they turned me away from my request to be hospitalized at their institution clamming I am not serious case enough for them,  not that they bothered to even lessen to my story, if anything they heard me out even less than at previous 3 institutions I went to, didn't even bother explaining to me what medicine they prescribed me for is. Thru this might be partly because of Korona outbreak and an out of order state of my country that is currently happening, they even claimed that at a moment they only accept emergent cases and only let me in out of good will cause I went such a long way from home to come to their institution despite the current situation."
1925,"So, I've never truly opened up about my mental health. I half did to my GP last year but I never gave the full story, enough to get me prescribed Sertraline, but after some recent soul-searching I realised, despite always thinking I was doing the right thing...I'm a bad person and I've been left with nobody, living on my own in a flat with my two cats who I feel I don't even deserve.

I'll try and keep it brief, but at the same time I'm going to go right back the the beginning, where I think my mental health problems started. When I was 18, I was happy, my Mum was seeing a man called Dave and they were engaged. I had struck up a good relationship with him and began to see him like a second Dad. Then one night he got into an argument with my Mum, attempted to harm himself but failed and ran out of the house. At this stage I came downstairs, followed him outside where I realised he was trying to harm himself using his truck which had a crane on the back. I stopped the engine, he fell and ran off. He eventually turned up in hospital, but my Mum wanted no more to do with him and I never saw him again. At this stage I didn't realise I was effected badly, I moved on, went to university, met a girl, Jamie.

I went out with Jamie for 9 years. We went through university together, first full-time jobs, rented our first places together. But it wasn't completely smooth. In the beginning I messaged other girls (wrong, I know but I was young and stupid) but when Jamie found out that's when my mental health showed. I'd threaten to kill myself, I'd harm myself in front of her, I'd beg and plead for forgiveness until she relented. I know now I was wrong for this and I hate myself for it. This happened a few times, and Jamie stayed with me (probably unhappy).

When we finished university we moved back home when Jamie had family problems, her 6 year old sister wasn't being cared for quite as she should be by their Mum, so we took her in as our own. This caused some problems obviously, arguments with Jamie's Mum, stress for me and Jamie, this was when we both ended up going to the GP and getting put on Sertraline. But Jamie's sister was happy, we had cats together and a flat, I was the little sister's only father figure and she saw me like a Dad, and I saw her like a daughter.

Then came Christmas Day last year, I found out Jamie had met another man about a week before and had been meeting up with him. I was obviously heartbroken, but it got more awkward because we had paid £3000 to take the little sister to Lapland over New Year, I'd also bought an engagement ring for whilst we were there. I couldn't let the little sister down so we still went. Whilst there I tried my hardest to convince Jamie to stay with me, to the stage I still proposed despite knowing what I did. She said no. She said I was trying to trap her, I never perceived it that way myself, to me it was more like desperate hope, but maybe it was sub-consciously a trap.

When we got home Jamie said she was leaving me for this other man. I struggled with this. Jamie wasn't very fair with moving out, wouldn't let me know her plans, collect all of her stuff or hand over keys, I still wanted to be a part of her little sister's life which Jamie said she wanted too. I also panicked I was going to lose the cats, the only thing I felt I had left, so I changed the locks. I also met another girl, in hindsight too soon, but I felt happy with her and I had fun and I didn't find myself thinking about Jamie anymore. Life was pretty good, but then Jamie told me I couldn't see her sister anymore. We argued and things were said probably neither of us meant. But I continued seeing this new girl and life felt pretty good, I felt happy. But I obviously still had underlying issues, I became needy and possessive. After just a couple of months I struggled to cope not spending time with her and couldn't give her space. It's like I felt if I gave her space she would think I didn't care and leave me for someone else...but actually my neediness made her leave me.

And now I'm alone, and after taking this time to look back at the last 10-11 years of my life I've realised...I'm a bad person. For some reason I really cannot cope with the idea of people leaving me...to the stage I've pushed everyone away and now I have nobody, broken a little girls heart, fetched a girl into this who didn't need to be a part of it and then hurt her. I don't know what to do anymore. I always thought I was a good person because I never thought about all the things I've done like I've just done, but looking back I've been horrible to everyone who has cared for me but I don't know why. I just feel lost now...."
1926,"So my gf of almost 2 years has had a rough life but she is mega depressed and stubborn as hell. I try my best to be there for her but she constantly refuses to get better or get help. Anytime she calls me halfway through its I'm not here anymore and I'm hearing running sounds in my room....must be a spirt. At first I went along with it and told her I sent a spirt to watch over her and I thought that helped then she starts saying the spirt is hurting her. Shes stressed out but over the simplest of things....she once even wanted to drive drunk becouse she spilled something at work. Idk what to do, I love her but she goes from 100 to 0 so fast my heart hurts. I know it sounds like all I want to do is fix her and I get that depression is a long time fix but she refuses any help and just accepts it. It's like she wants to be with the depression forever. Any advice is appreciated"
1927,"I don't now what to do now. I just started therapy. They told me I would only have to pay $37. Now they changed it to $100 because she said and I quote "" your mental problems. Are not a big deal"""
1928,"So I posted this in a different forum, but I thought it might get more views here. Plus, it's an ongoing issue, so i might add to this from time to time. It also ties into my insecurity about being annoying because I'm bored and I come here and vent all the time. Sigh! Well, anyway, here's the post.

Not sure if i should post here or make a new thread. My mind is racing. i mean, i'm preoccupied and can't stay in my present reality. i'm thinking about all the stuff i do online (like for instance this forum), stuff that makes me feel like a person. I'm not really a person at home sometimes...like, i'm just a wife! i dunno. feels stupid...no, not stupid. i...well i guess i feel stupid because i don't know how to change my life for the better...like right now i feel guilty for being online and will flee as soon as i finish this post, but i can't stay focused on real life. it's boring me!!! and that makes me depressed. sigh!

little update: I did manage to ""live in the moment"" for a little while tonight, but I still kept sneaking off to visit my online sites and post here and there. Sigh! But at least I have some good moments."
1929,"How do I improve my social skills and develop my personality,I mean it really hurts when my so called friends don't even remember my birthday 😔 and elsewhere I see people wishing their friends at 12 AM,its not that Im a arrogant person,hard to bond with(I am a pretty good and patient person) yet I see people don't become close friends with me,How do I overcome this as it is taking a toll on my confidence"
1930,"What does it mean?Does my brain get some diseases?Some people said that I am experiencing antidepressants withdrawal,but I already retook them nine day.But seem to be not getting so well.Anyone can help me?Or share some of your experiences, I am scare that t I will develop to schizophrenia?I asked my doctor twice.He said that i am not.I am being at a loss,If I am not schizophrenia.So that,I am depression?But I am not feeling sad or depression.I miss the days that I can think clearly.I am 18 years old now.I hope that I will be fine.But I always thought that I am getting worst.I think my cases is very bad.I hope that I can get some help.And hope someone can understand my difficulty."
1931,"So I am due to be re-evaluated this week after years of not getting any better with my depression and anxiety. Really hoping that I can find more peace in this re-evaluation as I’ve been struggling to fully express myself in therapy because I’ve recently realized behaviors about myself and the people in my life weren’t actually as normal as I had thought. I struggled immensely socially, said out loud that I wanted to kill myself out of immense boredom at age 10, and was overall not satisfied with myself (image wise and personality) . Below is just one example of what’s got me re-analyzing myself.

I grew up in a household that used physical punishment as a form of abuse. I also grew up in a house that never said sorry and would yell and shout. And my parents were the type to fight in front of their children constantly.  I always thought it was normal because that’s all I saw. I also thought emotional manipulation in the form of “family is family no matter what” type of mentality was normal despite the harmful behaviors “family” was inflicting on me.

This quarantine has been rough on me. I am a twenty something who still lives at home with my parents and my older siblings. It’s so hard to escape my emotions and past actions. Like they are the type to say they love me and in a way I still love them too but I can’t shake off childhood memories from them. I can’t tell if I’m the one at fault or if they went about parenting me wrong.

I keep ruminating on a memory from when I was about 12/13 years old. My parents and I and my older brother went to a family friend’s house. My parents usually drink and smoke at these places and leave late. They dragged us because we were still young and I usually went with them to places like this. When it was time to leave, I remember being quite sleepy. I brushed off saying good bye to the family friends ( a couple) and I remember my parents telling me to kiss and hug them good bye (a cultural thing) and I guess I tried to be cute and brush them off and wave them away with my hand ( I know, very rude). (Side note: I remember acting this way to my parents at home and they laughed but since it wasn’t home, it came off as completely rude). So anyway we leave and as soon as we get into the car (my mom driving, dad in passenger seat, my brother next to me) my dad starts yelling at me (combination of anger, embarrassment of having to raise a kid like me and alcohol, most likely). He starts yelling basically screaming at me for embarrassing them and puts his fist on my knee. He would say something like “ YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING LIKE AGAIN, DO YOU UNDERSTAND!?” and I was bursting tears already and I would mumble a “...yes” but because it wasn’t clear enough he pounded his fist on my knee and said “DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!”. So I had to cry out “Yes.” He asked me more questions and would pound on my knee until I gave him a firm “yes” quite a few times. I don’t recall it hurting but I just remember being incredibly sad and hurt. Wondering why my dad had to go about disciplining me the way he was. I can’t help but think my trauma as a child made me think about this memory. I remember for years to come, he would remind me of the disrespect I showed even when it was like three years on...he eventually hugged me that night but I still can’t shake that memory off..This wasn’t the first time he was angry like this at me. I think in some ways I was a rude kid but I truly believe the punishment didn’t fit the crime as they just went straight to yelling and I never really got a calm explanation of what I did wrong. (I think there’s some undiagnosed mental illness in my family) I remember being 5...a very young age and he threw a disposable camera at my forehead for not keeping quiet. I recall him beating my brother with a belt on a Saturday and I could hear my father yelling and the door shaking and my brother screaming.

And don’t get me started on my mother who I think about in the same way I think about my dad...

Anyway..
I don’t really know what the point is but this quarantined climate is making me reflect a lot. The way I’ve acted toward people (I was a pretty shitty younger sister, yelling, screaming, hitting my brothers...we barely have a relationship now despite living under one roof) and the way people have treated me (bullied.,etc). Am I just an overall horrible person? I don’t know but these memories are making me very angry at myself and the people involved. I happen to live with these people...ugh. I also can’t believe I can’t move on from memories that happened a decade or so ago."
1932,"I literally hate myself. I dont even know what im doing here. I wish i was brave enough to overdose and finally disappear. I do nothing but cause issues anyway, so why would i remain alive. With each and every day i get more convinced to actually commit suicide, im just so tired of everything including myself. I want this to end."
1933,"I'm having trouble getting back to sleep. I'm still concerned with how I've been feeling. It has been several months of anxiety, a depressed mood, trouble concentrating unwanted negative thoughts, fatigue, etc. Some days are better than others. I still keep busy everyday with activities and it helps some. I just don't feel like the same person anymore. I hope the restrictions from the coronavirus are lifted soon. I need to see a doctor and go from there."
1934,"I just feel so tired and it doesn’t matter how much sleep I get, I’m still tired. 

I have no motivation to do anything— just forcing myself to write this is a struggle.

Things I used to love, getting outside, yoga, art, working hard, developing goals, no longer interest me, and I feel too tired and too drained to think about them.

I absolutely hate my job— I hate going into work everyday but I don’t know what other job I would do or where else I would want to work. Honestly, nothing appeals to me, and when people say things like “just think about what you like doing for fun” and I can’t think of an answer because I’m so tired and my brain is always so foggy. The only thing I like doing for fun is sitting on my couch or sleeping.

I used to be an extremely ambitious person but now I feel like I have no ambition for anything in life, I can’t think clearly, I feel permanently burnout. Even just the simplest of tasks are hard, doing laundry, cooking, cleaning, even just taking a shower. It’s all a struggle for me, and I tell myself this is normal for people, I’m just being lazy… but it feels much worse than that. It’s like I physically can’t do anything but be lazy and I hate it.

I don’t feel overwhelmingly sad, or emotional, I really just feel numb which is why I never thought it was depression. I don’t cry myself to sleep or have any visions of harming myself, I have no visions at all I just feel empty and lost. I don't know what to do to get my life back."
1935,"Im really in a bad place and I’ve told my wife all about it. She’s really supportive and is doing everything she can to lift me up, but I can tell that it’s really hard for her and I’ve started feeling guilty about effecting her."
1936,The most frustrating thing about being me. Is I can’t kill myself 😫😫
1937,So today was pretty normal for me. Everybody is “social distancing” but for me it’s been a life long metanoia experience and I hate it! I hate what I’ve done to myself. I’ve grown to be imprudent about the future. I was so shy growing up it cost me everything😞.
1938,"I am 20 years old and I never felt like there is a worse time in my life than now. I have severe ADHD with some Aspergers, I currently live with my parents and have no job, my brain and body feel much weaker than it did since I was 18, I rarely leave the house and I just feel like an overall loser.



Let's begin with my ADHD and Aspergers. Ever since I was young my ADHD has affected my life so much to the point I feel mentally disabled at times. I do not know my IQ but I have a feeling it would be at least in the double digits and I also wouldn't be surprised if I was close if not disabled for a low IQ. I remember when I was in school I would have such a hard time focusing in class that I almost forget everything that the lecture had and sometimes when I was studying on a study guide I would not remember a large portion of what the unit was about. I feel like I just was never meant to learn anything nor do I have an ability to learn. I never correct my mistakes because I felt like I could truly learn from them. For example, when I was younger my parents forced me into a swim team despite the fact that my motor skills are horrible and I wasn't meant to be an athlete. They just wanted me to be active or to go outside of the house. I remember almost if not every time I did the breaststroke I would DQ because I would mess something up. I thought I wouldn't do it the next time but I always messed something up. I just think that some people can never learn and understand from there mistakes even if they actively try doing so. I am just too stupid to learn from anything and do not understand how to learn from failure. I don understand how can I learn from something. Lastly, I also cannot stop comparing myself to other people. Maybe I live on the internet all day but this goes back to I cannot stop doing my mistakes. I feel like I am self-aware of my problems I just can never feel like I can fix them.





I also have Aspergers as well. This does not affect me as much but it does still affect me a lot if not it is possibly getting worse. I feel like my social skills are getting worse since last year since I do not leave the house very often. I don't have many people I am friends with although this has gotten better over the past 2 years. Sometimes I get the feeling when I do communicate with other people and I have messed up on something socially people think I am an asshole because I might be doing something wrong. Lastly, I just feel like I could never get to have sex because I am too autistic. I just do not understand relationships at all. I almost feel like I am almost an incel because I personally think the reason why Women date men is because of how successful they are.



I live with my parents and I just don't know what I want to do. I only graduated high school and I dropped out of community college because of how much I was failing classes. I am too scared to get a job and also I am afraid to get one because it could impact my mental health even more. I don't know what job I could even do besides some shitty retail job because of my high school degree. I understand those jobs are short term but I feel like that I never really could find what I want to do in life. I am afraid I could never leave my parents and I have to feed off their money for the rest of my life. I am currently at a career college where it helps the slightly-mildly autistic to get a job. I have no idea what I want to do. I'm sure at this point they are convincing us that even dying in a Chinese sweatshop is a job and that's good. I thought about something from home that I can do since I have the internet but IDK what jobs I can do from home. I feel like in today's day and age the amount of ways someone can make money especially in America is a bit overwhelming to the point where I do not know where I should go. I always feel like working some sort of 9-5 job in a professional setting wouldn't work for me and I feel like 9-5s are an outdated concept too. It just feels like people around me only think of jobs/careers as a typical job that doesn't have much to it.





My body and brain feel overall weaker. This is a more recent problem that is getting worse for me. I feel like I do not have the same energy that I had about 2 years ago. When I was 18 or even 19 my body felt better and I could think more clearly. Now I am 20 (I turn 21 in march) and I have gained a lot more weight and my brain has felt weaker than it was in 2017 and 2018. When I first graduated high school I weigh around 180 pounds and I felt amazing. Ever since then I gained so much more weight to where I now weigh about 225. I think I could be eating less but I been trying to work out lately. I feel like my problem-solving skills and my focus have been impacted the most. My ADHD has gotten worse but I am trying to exercise and meditate to make sure it isn't as much as a problem. My problem-solving skills have gotten worse because of the fact I do not understand how I can work my way out of the rough time I been having. It also has gotten worse due to the fact I feel like there could be so many solutions and I do not understand what is the right one for feeling better. a lot of this could be because of my weight gain or the fact that I eat lots of junk food.



I rarely leave the house mostly because of my social anxiety. I just feel too comfortable at home to the point it is driving me insane. I really do nothing at home and I just need more structure outside of my house. I do not feel like I want to get a job outside of my house though because I feel like it would be something that would require more discipline and the fact I can sometimes be inconsistent with my sleep. I have been thinking about going out to a local card shop to play the Pokemon TCG at a local card shop, but I do not plan to play that until I have a decent income so I can afford cards and save money for later. Either way, I just do not know where I want to go.



I overall feel that I am an overall loser that doesn't know what I want to do in life. pls, help I just want to feel better again.



TLDR: I have felt like a loser ever since last year and I just want to feel and be more successful in life."
1939,"Hi, I've never really done anything like this so bare with me. 

I've struggled with depression for around 6 years since I was in school. I had quite a hard childhood with an abusive parent, at the time I was a child so I did not realise the consequences it would have. Now as I've gotten older I feel it's worse, mostly because of ignorance when I was younger. I didn't think about what it might mean in the future, but now I'm older, I don't see light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. I've lost hope that I can really be happy, I'm a very pessimistic person and I could be described as antisocial. I no longer enjoy socialising, talking to people makes me angry because I don't like how people can be, I feel constantly judged and I feel no one understands me. Worse of all is that I don't care about other people anymore (except my brother). I know this isn't a good way to live and I'm looking for something that might change it but I just don't know what to do anymore.

Every morning I wake up and the first thought is that I don't want to be here. When I express those feelings to my mother and brother they tell me its selfish to think like that as how would they feel if I was gone? And granted I understand and because of that I would never do anything to put them in that position. But is it not selfish for them to think about their own feelings and not mine? I don't think they understand the pain I'm in every day. I know it's my twisted mind playing with me, but I don't want to be here, I don't like society, I don't like people, I don't like the idea of spending another 50-60 years doing this. I will never have a child for the sole reason that I would never want to bring a life to this world if there is even the slightest chance it will feel the way I feel.

 I've been through CBT several times and it never works so I guess I'm looking for some kind of understanding. Please discuss how you feel, feel free to ask any questions you may have, and if you have anything that might help me with this feeling, please share.

I don't know how this post will go down, just hoping some of you can relate and know you're not alone."
1940,"Hi there, 
Just wondering if anyone is living with mayor/severe/clinical depression, that includes psychic pain and physical pain, and how you manage to cope and not lose hope? I've survived a year now with this, but don't see the end of the tunnel, i.e. my feelings won't change and the pain is just constantly there...I'm too old to be living at home, but I do, and if it weren't for my mom, I don't think I'd push through. I'm terrified...and just don't know how long I can bare this state..."
1941,"Every time I try to talk to my mom about my depression she turns it around on her and in the end I have to help her feel better. No one helps me feel better.I do it on my own. I know she's not doing it on purpose it's just the way it works out. But I'm left feeling alone. 

I'm always the one making people feel better. When is it my turn? When my friend is depressed I'm more loving and caring but when it's mom I'm more annoyed."
1942,"This is a long story so get comfortable! Questions at the end! 
 
January of 2019 I found out I was betrayed by a close friend. 
Me and my husband have a group of friends including us there’s 10 of us. All married. Some of us have been friends for 10 years. We’re a sarcastic group and a little wild. We make sexual jokes with each other frequently. We push the boundaries I guess you could say. But all done in fun and usually when spouses are present never in private. 
This story has to do with a good friend of mine (let’s call her M) M is married to my friend (let’s call him J). Me and my husband and J have been friends for 10 years. M use to work with my husband (he actually got her the job)
Anytime we all were together she’d always try to talk with just him and I felt was flirtatious. I’m not bothered by flirting. It can be fun and innocent but hers was always directed at my husband and it was pretty frequent. I talked to my husband about me being bothered and he had a hard time believing she was actually flirting with him but would be more careful around her. Me and M became close being married to my long tome friend J. I was a bridesmaid, helped plan her bachelorette party, shower, wedding, baby shower, offered multiple Photography sessions free of charge, had multiple venting sessions when her and J got in explosive fights etc. M had a baby at the end of 2018. She posted a picture of herself to her Snapchat stories and my husband messaged her telling her she was looking good! They then messaged eachother back and forth a little bit, joking, flirting and she then decided to send MULTIPLE nudes to my husband. Snapchat isn’t something my husband goes on daily and a few days went by before my husband even saw she sent pictures. Since he didn’t immediately reply she got nervous and tried to back track. Saying that what they were doing wasn’t fair to me and J, it was a joke gone too far. My husband told me later that day what happened. But she chose to hide it from J. Now don’t get me wrong. My husband wasn’t innocent in this. He put himself in a situation where something like this was possible and I was very upset at him. But what really stuck with me was the pictures, I can see taking words too far joking but going, getting undressed to secretly take pictures and send to a man, theres no way she could have been doing that as a joke. 
Weeks went by. J had M’s phone and found the pictures and that they were sent to my husband. M called my husband crying breaking the news and that J left to go to a hotel.
Couple days go by and J has calmed down talked to M and started to blame himself?? That he wasn’t paying enough attention to her 🙄
He decided he wanted to forgive and forget and continue the friendship with my husband. So I felt I needed to do the same to keep J’s friendship 
The rest of our group was told by me what happened when this all happened because we all get together frequently, I had a big birthday party coming up that everyone was supposed to be apart of and at the time assumed the friendship between us was over. 
All of 2019 was a rollercoaster, I went through different phases with M. Trying to forgive, trying to pretend it didn’t happen, breaking down and being so hurt. Anytime we talked about it she would put as much blame of anything else, J, my husband, postpartum depression etc. which made it really hard to heal and get past because I don’t think she was sorry she did it. She was sorry she got caught.
Things got really bad and I got into a really bad dark depression. My husband sat me down and we decided I needed help. I’ve since gone to therapy and it has helped but it’s still a struggle. My therapist said that, that betrayal was a traumatic experience for me and that I get triggered and brings me back to day one so it’s been really hard to heal. 
I distanced myself from M at the end of 2019. Sure she could be apart of the group but I just kept my distance for my own mental health. It’s been really hard to have a someone betray you and still have them intertwined in your life. 
One of my triggers as lame as it sounds was seeing her posts or anything like that on social media. So I unfriended her. Few days later she found out and things blew up. She got her and her husband to leave the group texts start their own and not include me and my husband.
We got no explanation from either them just basically got cut off and heard it second hand from my other friends.
It’s been a few months and things are going ok. But I still get triggered because all my friends still interact with her. Including my SIL and BIL. (Who I forgot to mention are part of the friend group) M is actually the closest to my SIL in the group.  They all know what she did and how she treated me (I haven’t included everything in this post) but still choose to basically let her get away with murder because she’s married to J.


How do I talk with my friends about this? Do I need to give an ultimatum? Her or me? Am I expecting too much for loyalty from my friends? It’s been 14 months and it’s still so hard for me."
1943,"It makes me feel numb and my brain is blank, at 
first, I feel anxiety about it but now it becomes nothing for me but I already took it again eight days, but it still not in effect, I am very scare that I will become a zombie."
1944,"I'm not a very social person and the only thing that really gets me out of the house is school and my doctor's appts. Now that COVID has spread and I've been confined in my home, I feel like I'm getting worse. It was good at first, but I feel like my fuse gets shorter and shorter and my sleeping is getting worse. I'm getting more and more annoyed and bored by the day. Since I do not go out, my days consist of completing any school work that is issued, eating, sleeping and carrying on doing whatever I find appealing, but even the things that help keep me pacified are becoming boring to me... I just feel worse and worse every day. My already standing depressing doesn't help either. Laying wide awake every night and being completely exhausted.

I catch myself sighing and just shutting everything down. I don't wanna talk and I don't wanna do anything. I feel like a zombie."
1945,"Hi 
firstly Thanks for reading
So basically I am part of a group chat consisting of people from work, recently some info from the chat was leaked to another team at work (the team were sagging them off) and some how I've managed to get the blame altho I've been off for nearly 2 MONTHS (My partner works on the opposite team so I think this is y) 
The thing is I haven't sed anything and now am receiving horrible messages on the chat and being talked about (they are not specifically saying me on chat but have made another one with out me where they are all discussing this) and being made to feel really uncomftable to the extent I no longer want to go back into work.. I have been told that I am no longer wanted on the team and Noone is to talk to me altho most of the team think that this is ridiculous some r actually going along with it, 
It just making me feel so down and it's really waring. 
I'm not sure what to do please any advise would be great

Thanks"
1946,"Okay so I’m the mom of a 21 year old daughter. She dated her boyfriend from 15-21 and they go to university together. He was a son to us. He has a very bad home life (both parents are alcoholics, mom hard drug user and rehab, emotional and psychological issues etc.), he did literally everything with our family for this entire time. These two were inseparable 100% of the time up until a month ago. Absolute best friends. He told her he was going through something and he had to do it on his own. He will not talk about any of his feelings...and he has a lot from childhood buried deep. Very emotional. He’s gone from telling her it’s not her fault he should have dealt with it earlier when it started...and please I need your help to get through this. Now he’s angry and rude two weeks later and making demands about silly things and doesn’t really want anything to do with her.

He says he has no feelings and hates his life and feels like a disappointment to everyone.  That’s all we can get of him...he won’t talk at all.

What do we do? We’ve encouraged and loved him and pleaded with him to get help. He sometimes won’t respond for five days at a time. He has come for a couple visits and it’s a nice visit then won’t text for days. I’m grieving so badly I just don’t know what to do."
1947,"Hi,

I have never posted on a forum before, but it’s got to the stage where I could do with some advice.

a couple of months ago my boyfriend of 7 years was diagnosed with depression. He is not medicated, has been advised by the doctor to do the things he enjoy, to stop drinking, and to self refer to counselling.  He hasn’t stopped drinking and hasn’t referred himself to counselling.

since he has been diagnosed, things have gone completely down hill in our relationship. He just isn’t the same person anymore. He can be really mean and spiteful to me. He goes out all the time, drinking with friends and his family, but won’t do anything with me.

He does nothing around the house anymore. I have to do everything

 He tells me it’s not my fault etc, but he just keeps pushing me away. He won’t talk about what’s going on at all. We end up rowing every time I try and talk to him about it and encourage him to go to counselling. He just won’t have any of it, and ends up being verbally abusive towards me and leaving the house, and then won’t come back until the early hours, and will ignore any contact from me. He “hasn’t got the energy” to put kisses on his messages to me. He won’t return any calls, and barely responds to texts. He won’t kiss or cuddle me anymore, or even make any physical contact such as holding hands etc. I get sex being the last thing on the mind at times, but I really don’t understand what is happening in our relationship.

I’m sleeping in the spare room now. It’s just so horrible to be in this situation and I really don’t know what to do anymore.

I feel really annoyed and frustrated with him, and then guilty in case I’m not doing enough. I just don’t know what to do.

I have thought of leaving. I don’t want to, but I also don’t want to live like this anymore.

does anyone have any advice please??

thank you x"

However recently I stopped taking them for eight months which was the longest ever.i was doing fine all through this time managing with out them.

1954,"About a month ago, I lost my virginity to this guy on tinder. We’ve hooked up a few more times afterwards and last week on the phone he tells me that the coronavirus is messing things up for him. He complained about that self isolating is making him think of his past and he was feeling anxious over starting a new job later than he anticipated. A couple of days later, he admitted to having struggled with depression at times in his life and was going through it again. He told me he was going to his hometown for a couple of days we’d see each other again and to keep texting him to keep in touch.

Well I’ve sort of fucked up. I wanted to give him some space so I waited a couple of days and asked him if he was feeling okay.

Him: Yeah. You?

A couple hours later..

Me: Yeah. I know we don’t know each other well but I understand what it’s like to be depressed. If you need anyone you can talk to me.

Silence. The next night (Mistake #1)

Me: If I made you uncomfortable. I apologize.

Nothing.

The next day, I sent about 4 or 5 messages, nothing crazy, just a little anxious over his lack of response (Big mistake #2). The last thing he texted me Monday was “I’m okay. Everything’s fine.” I asked if he wanted me to stop texting him. Nothing. The next day, I didn’t bother him. The day after, I asked if he was awake. A couple of hours later, I told him to call when he could because I needed to talk to him (Big mistake #3). Nothing. I told him I didn’t know if his silence was because he wanted me to fuck off or because he was depressed. Nothing. I called, it rang all the way through, no answer. The next morning I texted him.

Me: This will be my last message for a while. I’m sorry for being needy. I’ve been really emotional because I felt I threw my virginity away. (Long story)But I understand you’re having a hard time and can’t talk right now. I’ll check on you in a couple of weeks or so. Hope all is well with you.

Now I’m feeling regret because I KNOW I shouldn’t have been selfish and panicked when he didn’t respond the first time. I made the mistake of confiding in others and they told me that his depression is probably some bullshit way to distance himself from me. But he’s so nice and very chill and he sounded very troubled on the phone. I don’t truly believe he’d go that far. So all of these crazy things are running through my head and I want to fix it and make it right. It doesn’t help that I’m dealing with my own issues with depression and severe anxiety. Now that I’ve sent him this last text, I will actually have to go a couple of weeks without contacting him or risk looking like an overemotional lunatic. In the beginning, I told him that if he didn’t want to hookup anymore, to let me know and not ghost me. He said unless I see or hear those words from him mouth, we’re good. We’re also still matched on tinder. Did I fuck up beyond repair? Can I redeem myself?

Please help me. I feel like he wanted me to text him normal things. Not frantic texts wondering if he’s alright, if we’re cool etc. I want to do that for him, just be chill, send him normal texts showing support regardless of whether or not he replies and not take his silence personally.

I’m tempted to text him in a couple of days telling him that I want to support him while he’s in this funk but I feel like it’ll look bad when I already told him I’d check on him in a couple of weeks. Say I do wait that long, do you think it’s long enough to repair the damage I made from appearing too clingy? If I should text again in a few days, what would be the best and most succinct thing to say?

What would you want someone to do if they carried on like I did."
1955,"I can't do this anymore. Everyday feels like a waking hell. My thoughts are crowding my head, i could burst at any moment. I clench my fists and ask for the anger and sadness to stop but a tear down my cheek and it feels like all is lost. I feel so lonely here. This house is eating me up alive. I swear I love them, they are my friends, we live together, but why do I just feel like running away from here? Why do I feel sad everytime I hear them interact without me, laugh without me... I feel like i'm the last option. i want love I really do, but I don't feel it here. Do they care about me? It feels like when I'm sad they don't. Do they care about me? Most of the time it feels like they don't. I want to run away, far from here, start anew. are they toxic to me? Am I the toxic one? I don't know. All I am sure of is that I care, I love, i give my all but no one does that with me. I wish I could dissapear, hear them praise me when I'm gone, I wish they still needed me, but who actually does? 
I am confused
I feel hopeless
How could I hate myself so
Do they love me or do they not, I will never know
In the meantime I cry in despair, life feels hopeless 
I cry as I try to catch a breath of fresh air"
1956,"On 200 mg/ml whatever you wanna call it of Clopixol every four weeks and 40 mg (2 tablets) of Fluoxetine every morning.

Thing is, I haven't been taking the anti-depressants, and have felt fine until last night. I was worried about the virus (no symptoms) but just self-isolating and watching TV shows like BoJack Horseman, Smallville, Penny Dreadful etc. However, suddenly my depression came back last night and I slipped into my old obsessive habits and now I can't concentrate on my tv series and movies and am just torturing myself by worrying about my attributes and comparing myself to others.

Honestly, with COVID-19, and the state the world is going to be in if and when it is over, I am about ready to check out. I don't really care if I die (although I'd rather not die due to the virus, as being breathless is something I hate). I just feel like at almost 38 I have been through enough due to my mental illness - torturing myself up until the last few years when I got a bit better, no girlfriend, eating disorders where I was underweight, and now being overweight due to overeating from the medication, no job, I do have a uni degree, bad sleeping pattern meaning I can hardly get up in the morning so couldn't hold down a job or volunteer position even if I had one. I also have to wear dentures because the eating disorders rotted my teeth and implants are extortionate so I am trapped with this low quality of life of removing false teeth all the time, and it's another thing to worry about with potentially meeting women. Then there are the sexual side effects of the meds, from low libido to erectile dysfunction. Then there's the fact that many women don't seem to like me anyway, even though I think (false teeth aside, and they do look fine when in) that I am reasonably attractive, intelligent and a good person. But I couldn't even provide for a female and my mental health issues have totally destroyed my life.

It just all seems so pointless.

I've just had enough and wanna check out of the game but I don't know how to do it, no way of killing myself looks appealing, but I can't be bothered living anymore, especially not in a post COVID-19 dystopia."
1957,"Kind of a rant

Me and my wife currently live with her sister in law her boyfriend and two kids. We initially moved into help them with their bills. Now it’s been about a year since we’ve moved in and I hate it. My sister in law hasn’t worked in months due to bed rest and losing her job. Her boyfriend is a stay at home dad. So the bulk of supporting the household falls on me and my wife. Not once have I heard a thank or we appreciate what your doing. All I ever hear is passive aggressive bullshit. A few weeks ago one of the dogs attacked me and they argued with my wife about how it was most likely my fault I got bit. How I know that the dog doesn’t like me so I should of been careful. My sister likes to walk around the house naked and gets mad at me for wanting to walk freely around a house I pay for. I’m tired of being here I want us to move out but it doesn’t seem like that’s ever going to happen. I want to say something to get off my chest but all it will do is cause a fight. They’re not the kind of people who like criticism. They don’t even respect me enough to come to me with problems they go through my wife. I’m tired of it. I’m tired of putting our lives on hold for other people."
1958,"I (F21) have been in a long term relationship with my partner (M26) for 3 and a half years. We have bought a house together and were looking to get engaged later in the year. I have been on antidepressants most of that time but around 6 months ago, the psychiatrist I was seeing kept upping the dose of Zoloft I was on to 200mg, which is the highest dose someone can get prescribed to. I have been on this dose for about 4 months now. I am a short and small girl. I gained about 15kgs on this medication.

Beside Zoloft, I also got prescribed Seroquel, Valium, and Xanax.

This has made me emotionally numb.

I now have no feelings for my boyfriend and when he traveled for his mum's surgery back home, I slept with 4 different guys in 3 days, since I didn't feel I had love for him and didn't enjoy being intimate for him anymore for about 2 months. I slept with them not because I wanted to find another relationship but rather because I had no self worth and just wanted to feel something.

He still really loves me and I feel I do love him too but it is just numb. Everything is numb, including my feeling towards my parents, friends and other social groups.

I found using weed every day in extremely high doses would be the only way I would feel things.

My daily routine would be to sleep until about 2/3pm and then go to work if I felt like it, otherwise I'd call in sick. I would then just smoke about 4 joints straight green, then spend all night watching YouTube videos until I fell asleep. On the night he caught me cheating, I had 9 joints just to feel something, because I didn't regret it or feel sad about it.

We both really want this relationship to continue and he is prepared to forgive me but recommends I lower my dose and follow up with another psychiatrist.

We are now back to our home town. At the moment, I am in my country with my family and he is in another city with his family. We want to work on ourselves during this time. It is really hard to seek for professional help at the moment due to the lack of health care in my country. Since I live in a small town, there is no psychiatrist in my hometown. I cannot go to bigger city since I am on quarantine. People see mental health differently in my country too.

Would this numbness be because of my antidepressants? Should I gradually decrease the dose by 50mg each week and see how I feel?

TLDR; 200mg of Zoloft, I don't feel like I love my boyfriend anymore so I cheated on him with 4 guys during one night stands."

I'm new to this site but it's a little late and i'm a little sad I have a history of depression and before quarantine I was doing so well but now that my routine is gone and i'm at home all day sitting around i can feel myself falling back down the hole. Since i've had clinical depression since I was 13 I didn't really feel what it's like to be healthy until last summer which was many years later, but now that i have some more life experiences i can recognize when i'm sad more easily. I had my life on track for the first time, but the quarantine has taken a toll. I usually cope day to day by my routines and i'm an active person so I'm either at school or working, but because of this, i can't do that. I'm noticing that i'm irritable and i've been doing a lot of crying lately and i don't know what to do or how to cope. I'm trying not to go back to my old coping skills like self-harm because my boyfriend who loves me wants me to stay clean and i do it for him, but lately its been tough.

1965,"Hello everyone. I’ve been suffering with depression for as long as I can remember. I’ve never been able to talk about my emotions either. So it’s very difficult for me to even think about making bookings to a therapist. I do not even feel comfortable talking to my own family.

I have a number of problems which I feel contribute to my depression:

I don’t feel comfortable around my family and don’t like exposing myself to them
I am underweight and feel weak and tired a lot of the time
I have a ringing in my ear and I don’t know what is causing it - annoyingly I am too frightened/anxious to go to a doctor.
I don’t enjoy any of the things I used to. I don’t want to do anything all day except lie in bed. It takes too much energy getting out of bed.
I can’t focus on anything because I am so distracted by all of these problems (it’s hard for me to list them all but I listed what was on my mind at the time)
I feel like my social anxiety is a direct result of my depression
My depression has been so bad that sometimes I think about how I am going to commit suicide and I cry my eyes out in the bathroom.

I was hoping you could lend me some advice. I am wondering if there anything I can do to treat this by myself as I really don’t know if I have the ability to face my severe anxiety and call a doctor. I don’t even want my parents knowing so it’s either call now or wait until I leave home. Not to mention the risk of seeing a doctor considering the current health crisis, so I’d be waiting anyway.

Thank you very much for reading."

1968,"I want to begin this post by saying that i am not currently suicidal (i don't think anyway whatever the definition of that is these days) and i do not have a plan for this. I have extremely disruptive suicidal ideation and i cannot stop thinking about it. At this moment i am not planning on hurting myself. I have 2 pets and my gf that i have to go to work for and help take care of and love.--disclaimer

I have a history of suicidal gestures and attempted suicide. I have mental health problems mainly concerning anxiety and abnormal mood swings that are disrupting my life. That problem aside, i just want some advice on what to do when these thoughts become overly intrusive - not to the point where i will attempt anything, just how to focus on other things i suppose. 

Yes i do have a psychiatrist who is treating me with medication for my anxiety disorders and ADD but i have gone off all other medications and have been antipsychotic free for almost 2 years. I was originally diagnosed bipolar non specified back around 2008 or 2007 at the earliest. Went with the diagnosis and the treatments on and off as i was advised would more than likely happen as a symptom and sign of the illness etc etc until 2018 when my family and i moved out of state. The medication laws in my area are extremely strict and i attempted switching to a local psych several times, 15+ and all of them either wouldnt even start a convo with me or halfway through, upon realizing the type of medication i am taking, would advise me to quit taking it and call them back when im off of it because its ""too addictive"". And the pharmacies here will outright refuse to fill certain meds due to liability. 

So i have been having to drive 8 hrs to see my old psych in another state to get med refills so the catch is i get very little time to speak with my psych and because ive seen him for so long and i know others who see him as well, i feel a bit afraid to talk about my suicidal thoughts due to the possibility of being reported and committed again. 

Im afraid to tell anyone about these thoughts and ive lived with them for almost 20 years. Medication has never improved my depression, talk therapy never really did, CBT therapy never helped and i cant talk about these things with friends or family because it will either upset them or make them frustrated because they dont understand how it feels to walk around or drive around and feel this apathetic about life.

Recently, ive suffered multiple losses. My cat of 20 years passed away the first week of march. This cat and i grew up together so before anyone slightly responds condescendingly to that, no thanks. My great uncle passed a week ago. This week i found out that although my job is deemed essential at this time due to the rising number of cases of COVID19, the workload has been a fraction of what it is normally and that theyre going to start sending a few people home early everyday from now on. Sounds like a dream come true until youre the only source of income in your household with 3 other mouths to feed. I literally cannot miss even 2 hrs of work right now.

I want so badly to talk to my close friends about these feelings but im afraid theyll say something or disown me or ghost me...its all happened before everytime ive confessed to feeling like this. I dont want to be committed again but this is a true struggle. Thank you."
1969,"You might not understand this.

I tried to hide my ethnicity. But for important reasons, I have to show it. I'm Korean-American. That's right.

You know what's tiring? I have to obey authority no matter what the cost. Even if you're not in the situation, I have to obey it. It doesn't matter if you have important matters. Even if you're in a serious health conditions, you have to obey it.

When you go to work, your boss forces you to drink with colleagues after long work hours. If you don't get drunk with him/her, you'll be fired. It doesn't matter if you're sick, or of your family member died. You'll definitely be fired of you don't obey- you might even have to risk DUI! If you are a Korean, and live among Koreans, you have to abide by their rules. I had to do this to survive. Ain't no non-Koreans give you a job, especially in America. Like I said, I have to live among them for survival! In fact, lots of Asians go through this, and there ain't no help for them. Their western friends are too busy with their own lives to help. No matter how much they can help, they have limits. They just draw their boundaries to keep you off. While I have to unquestionably obey.

It's a trap. You're born with it. If you manage to escape it, you'll go homeless. Ain't no stupid therapist can help you- they'll accuse you for being having identity crisis and no one can help you. They'll assume that you're struggling where you're Korean or American.

Heck, there's not what I meant. No matter if you're Korean, American, French, Latino, African, or whatever, there's no excuse for this type of lifestyle. It's mentally taxing, and sometimes can be dangerous! But I have to mingle among my kind to survive... It enrages me..."
1970,"I cannot go on living. I cannot live with my ugliness anymore. It’s beyond normal ugliness. Nobody looks the way I do.

I’ve got a “way” about me that is just ridiculously strange. It is beyond description. My skeletal structure, my face structure, my hair type, my hair-loss type, my skin, my overall shape and essence. I’m just top to bottom ugly and jacked-up looking. I don’t know any other way to explain it.

I know people here will downplay what I’m saying, and tell me some stock platitudes. I promise, you don’t understand. You CAN’T understand unless you see me.

I don’t even think I’m human. I don’t even look like a normal human. The way I walk. The way I move. The way my mouth moves. It’s all fucking weird! I look at other people, and nobody else has these problems. I don’t care if they’re ugly or good looking. Most “ugly” people are ugly in conventional ways. They still look normal and fit into some form of mold. They don’t look ridiculous, or have this weird way about them that I do.

There are no measures that will fix it. Nothing I can do. No clothes, no workout regimen, no surgical procedure will alter this. 

I’ve tried working out/dieting. In fact, I’m in the middle of doing so right now. Sure, I’ve put on muscle. But it doesn’t matter. NOTHING looks good on me. It looks like you threw muscles on a 160 lb turd. Same with nice clothes and a better haircut. Looks like you threw nice clothes over a big turd. These things NEVER have the effect on my appearance that they have on everyone else’s. If anything they just serve to highlight my ugly features.

I can’t stand it anymore"
1971,"Hi,
 
I'm new to this site but glad for the luck stumble. There seems to be a raft of well-meaning places that one can visit, but I liked the positivity of what I read prior to joining. 
 
My tale is so normal its almost humdrum, but I wonder if anyone else has found themselves in a similar situation and if at all they found any long term resolve.
 
I have for as long as I can remember suffering from a sense of deep sadness. It has come and gone over the years, but by and large, plagued me. It has affected relationships, work and made me come to hate myself at times; not to mention everyone around me. When I was younger I was able to channel much of the negative emotion away from myself. I was in band and filled my world with creativity. This allowed me a place to hide away from all the desperation that was tearing me apart. Sadly, the older I have become the more I struggle with these demons.
 
A couple of years ago I met a wonderful person that instantly saw the sadness in me. I thought I was happy but it was short-lived. Soon I fell back on old mental hunting grounds. Trips to see therapists opened up possibilities, but not being armed with pots of cash, irregular sessions only opened wounds that could not properly heal. A raft of medications did little and left me feeling empty and numb. 
 
I stopped taking meds as they proved to be nothing more than a waste of money, and I hated the side effects. A chance read led me to micro-dosing marijuana, and as I had enjoyed the weed in my younger years, I figured what did I have to lose. I vaped it instead of smoking as I hate the smell and taste of tobacco, and found it almost an anaesthetic. It’s not really a case of getting high, rather just slows everything down. There is more of a science behind the chemicals that make it work, but for me at least, it worked.
 
At least, kinda.
 
The trouble is my mind races, and when it’s in full chat, well, it CHATS, loudly. When I’m in this mode I have no control. I can’t think straight, I can’t rationalise simple ideas and everything becomes utterly muddied. I go from anxiety to depression and back in a heartbeat, and if I’m brutally honest, it’s exhausting; for me and every poor bugger around me.
 
So why am I here? This will be familiar with some of you and for those that it is, how do you manage? I really dont want to take meds. My micro-dosing marijuana is irregular and my only other fallback is a packet of valium that’s half full and I use when I absolutely have to. Meditation, mindfulness, exercise et al are all things I do, But I can’t cope with this endless capsizing feeling.
 
I really look forward to your responses and future chats I have on this forum. I have a feeling it’s going to be most rewarding."
1972,"Hi guys
I’m currently struggling a lot with the thought of suicide and I’ve been self harming. 
unable to see a dr or anything because of this shit virus and I’m not really sure what to do. 
anyone got any advice? 
I don’t want to add anymore stress to the nhs and shit like that I just don’t know what to do"
1973,I thought talking with a Counselor would help me feel better. He just made me feel worse told me everything was my fault.
1974,"It's just occurred to me that I could have been infected by the ""Can't be Arsed"" virus (CBAV) very many years ago. Judging by many of the posts on this forum, such a virus seems to have been going around.

Now, Corona either leaves you OK after a couple of weeks, or does kill you fairly quickly. However, CBAV ""messes"" you up for decades :scared:."
1975,"Hi all

Just felt like I needed to tell strangers on the internet what is happening right now I guess.

So I ended my relationship recently because he is divorced and my mum has major issues with that and won’t accept him or be a part of anything to do with it. She has been absolutely horrible about it -her reactions involve screaming, shouting, being ott dramatic and saying awful things. She’s upset because of her own experiences which I’ve dragged up and are hurting her. I get that I really do but she’s projecting onto me and failing to put my happiness before her issues. I live with her so I’m surrounded by the tension and atmosphere it has caused daily. She’s only today speaking to me again properly; she really went into a rage on Tuesday and it’s really traumatised me.

On the other hand I’ve broken the heart of a good guy who loved me and only wanted to make me happy. He’s wonderful and really showed me what a great life I could have with him. He’s desperately hurt and I feel incredibly guilty and bad.

I’ve hurt them both and myself and what have I achieved? Diddly squat. Just heartache, sadness, despair, tears, anxiety and no will to live.

I dared to dream of happiness and life firmly put me back in my place.

Yes, I know I should just do what makes me happy and be with him but it’s complicated. I can only do it with the acceptance of my mum, I don’t want to it any other way. I can’t.

I’ve sacrificed but really don’t know how to live life like this now. I’ll never have pleasure in anything because I don’t want to move on. I’ll be alone and unhappy forever-and it’s all my fault..."
1976,"I live in the states (IL) and everything has been shut down for the last 3 weeks. The shutdown will continue for at least another month.

This means no doctor visits unless you are critically ill, no dental visits unless it is a major emergency, and no psychotherapy visits period. Some psychologists and psychiatrists have been doing consultation over the Internet, but only like 20%, and none are accepting new patients. 

Everything is shut down where I live, and half the restaurants and bars have already gone out-of-business. We are losing tens of thousands of jobs everyday, and 50% of my friends are now unemployed.

I am now full-on clinically depressed and I have nowhere to turn. Aside from talking it over with friends over the phone,I don't have any options. Likewise, I can imagine what alcoholics and drug-addicts are going through: no AA or NA meetings, no access to therapy, and isolated at home. 

how is it with the rest of you?"
1977,I'm so angry and sick and tired of parading around like everything's okay just to get by in this society. I've been forced to shut up about my grief and threatened with legal action if I speak out. I have to watch my story and his story get twisted and I am past my limit. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm angry and scared and this world is making me sick right now. I just want to be with him and anywhere feels better than here. He must be in a better place and I don't want to live without him anymore because he was a piece of me. I hate how cruel this place has been to me and I don't want to do this anymore.
1978,"I know my ex girlfriend for 5 years, we have been living together for 3 years . We went though a lot of things. Especially me, she sacrificed many things for me. The thing was that I cheated and after that this crazy psycho behavior of hers started to blossom up.. She started controlling me, acting differently, saying nasty comments regarding me cheating and sometimes bullying on me just to get back on me. Which I understand, I wasn’t honest with her and should have been better because she really did everything she could to be there for me, even my family hated her. So nothing was easy for her. Then now recently she got pretty sick and we both were worried she had cancer and went to hospitals many times. During this period she became so weak, lack of sex between us because of her pain, stressed, worried and mean. So I couldn’t handle it anymore. I felt I did everything for her but she couldn’t be thankful or appropriate what I do. We had an argument, I tried to tell her she should help around more in home, then before I even knew it I called her bitch accidentally but on purpose still somehow.. She freaked out and hit me. Then I left her and never tried to even hear her out, she tried to reach out to me to apologize and talk out about things but I just got so feed up and was scared she wouldn’t listen to me or understand me. Now being alone for some weeks I have to admit I do  regret leaving her especially in the way I left her in. She was always there for me, she was just being worried about her health condition would get worse so she acted very aggressive lately by freaking out.. I’m not in denial, I have tried to talk to friends and family but since they never knew or liked her they don’t see the whole picture. Off all the wonderful things she actually did and how lovely she can be. I would like to give her a second chance but ofcourse I would lie if I didn’t say I was scared she would continue this bad way. The key to a successful relationship is to talk to the partner about the issues. And that’s something I never actually did. I just left her with no warning. I would appreciate if someone could help me to tell me how to reach out to her but in the same time make her understand that this is serious and have to be obeyed. I’m not doubting she won’t change it’s just that I made such a thing of it .. I told everyone what happened. But that shouldn’t matter I shouldn’t be worried to get judged by them for going back. Thanks for taking the time to read this!"
1979,"What really is loneliness? It’s something I feel but it’s hard to tell. I have friends, family, and I know I can count on them and so, but I just feel lonely. I didn’t feel that when I was with my first love, but now that he’s gone I’m just empty inside. I know I’m not supposed to be depending on someone and that I should be feeling “full” with myself. But I’m just tired of carrying this weight on my shoulders. I share with my friends, a lot, I’m not having trust issues, I just really don’t care. I love my friends, but it all just doesn’t have deeper meaning for me, maybe I just need this deeper meaning. I feel like I have nobody even though I have. How to describe that?"
1980,"Hi,

I’m really struggling with feeling like I don’t want to be around anymore. I’m not sure if I just feel like I don’t want to ‘exist’ or if I’m actually feeling suicidal.

I get everyone’s mental health at present is heightened what with being on lock down. I’ve felt like this for such a long time and it’s just getting worse.

My partner isn’t particularly supportive right now. He has a female friend that has no idea on boundaries. And he allows her to just make me uncomfortable.
im at such a loose end it’s horrible :(
Any help would be great! Not even sure what to say to get help?"
1981,"I'm trying everything. Got so much support but I just dont have any other idea of what to do. But I can't do that to my bf, mom, family and friends. But I also cant keep putting them through all my shit. Suicide just seems like it's my only real option right now. Cant pass my work probation for my first job. Can't seem to do anything right for my mom or myself. Dying is fucking scary to think about but continuing on is a hell of a lot scarier I think..."
1982,"Since some years ago I started registering in forums like this, I thought would be a way to meet other people who deals with the same, loneliness, any other here doesnt have any other to talk (people over 26 old) ? I dont, and it really stress me, and makes things hard. Any other joined for the same ?"
1983,"I just started 10mg Trintellix but I’m concerned that it’s going to stop working in a year or two. I’ve been on 10mg for two days and I’m also wondering how effective will this be. If you’ve been on any SSRIs can you please tell me which one, and what dosage. Most important I want to know (if it’s effective for you)  how long have you been on it? Also would like to hear the same about SNRIs and Wellbutrin."
1984,Yeah I know I'm a bother. Been told that my whole life. I just  sit at home wasting away. I've applied for 21 jobs and only get one interview. And still I don't get the job.  but my friend can get a job in 4 days. I give up. On every thing I'm done.  I'm worthless and useless.

1987,"Never thought I'd be doing this but here I am. Also, I can type essays when I am feeling sad since I am just trying to express my feelings. So I know what I have written below is a lot. Sorry for that in advance.
I have been going through a rough patch with my family for over a year now and my mom and my oldest sister play an important role in hurting me. I am 18 and my mom hates me. She says she loves but I think I should admit that she hates me because she still goes around saying shit about me. I have a small circle and only 4 friends but even with them I am embarrassed to share how my mom treats me. She doesn't want me hanging out with my friends. Last time I met them was 2 months ago. She wants me to do chores around the house and yet she still finds something wrong so she can argue with me on that specific thing. She tells me she is ashamed to have a daughter like me since I get bad grades (my grades are always around A's and B's), I fight with my sisters, I don't respect them, I sleep a lot, I ""hang out"" with my friends a lot (last time met them 2 months ago). My mom always say that I will understand her value when it's too late. But has she ever thought it could be the other way too? Maybe my mom will understand my value when its too late since I get thoughts to kill myself everyday. I am halfway there, maybe close to death because I hurt myself a lot. My mom says I got nothing to do expect sleeping and taking showers all the time. But I sleep so much because I am sad and no one talks to me in my family since she tells my sisters to not talk to me. I take showers when I have to cry because I can't cry in front of them. Mind you my mom knows I cry in showers yet she doesn't care. My sister who is five years younger then me says to my face that I am ugly and no one loves me and that my mom is tired of me.  don't blame her for saying that, she is a kid and since she knows if I tell my mom about her, my mom wont yell at her and that doesn't bother her because she knows she will get away with it. Also my sister who is 1 year older then me contributes to 50% of the fights I have with my mom. She exaggerates everything in front of my mom and tells the story in a bad way which makes me appear bad all the time. And of course my mom believes her because she is exactly what my mom wants me to be. She is perfect in studies which makes me appear dumb, she doesn't go out, she does chores at home and she is like my moms fav daughter. I can never be the way she is and so my hates me and wants to change me which I cant. My dad on the other hand just agrees with what my mom and sister say so he is like them too.
I am worried and I am scared of myself. I hurt myself a lot and I don't know where I am headed in life and I am lost and I am stuck and I feel hopeless and I feel worthless. I am scared I will end up killing myself one day.
I cant emphasize enough but I HATE MY MOM AND MY OLDEST SISTER WITH ALL MY HEART. They can go to hell for making me feel like shit."

1989,"Not sure if this goes here or into the corona virius thread but it's nothing to do with the virius more how are people managing with the lockdown and lack of routine.

I've been on lockdown for 2 weeks now due to being classed as high risk luckily I can work from home with full pay so I am fortunate to not have any money worries etc.

What I have found is that because I dont have to see anyone or leave the house all self care has gone out the window. Not that it was much good before. I'm spending up to a week wearing and sleeping in the same clothing without showering or brushing my teeth. I've missed several days medication as I cant be bothered to take it even though I know this is bad.

Wondering if anyone else is having the same issues and how they are counteracting it. I live alone which unfortunatly makes it much easier to get away with slacking off"
1990,I feel so alone. I'm setting here wondering if I have any friends. I'm always the first one to text they never text me. To see how Im doing. When my cousin lived with me he was always calling and texting people. Spending hours talking to his friends but if I text him I I got 1 maybe 2 words. Same with my other friends. I'm just someone no one wats to talk to. I posted I'm alone on Facebook and one person. Asked if I was ok
1991,"I think im done. Im done feeling. I dont know why but i dont want or even see the significance of feeling good. Of feeling happy. I simply just do not want to feel anything and not exist. Good feelings dont matter anymore. I know they feel good but i simply dont feel they are worth it anymore. I think about feelings and emotions so much. I think about how the negative ones are painful so obviously i dont want to feel them but the positive ones no longer seem worth it. I dont want to enjoy anything, i dont want peace. I dont want anything. Im in a weird middle ground right now. I feel nothing and also want to BE nothing."
1992,"I’ve just started a new job, my first one even. But I just suck at it. Everything stresses me out because I just can’t grasp on what certain terminology means and how I should go about performing in my job. I cry every morning, it really hurts. I used to try and keep all my emotions in whilst at the workplace, but now I’m working from home, everything just rushes out. I can’t go a day without crying. I can’t figure out if I’m just an idiot who can’t perfirm their job, or if the job really isn’t rightful me. 

Either way it’s insufferable and I just want everything to end. Although I’m scared because I’m not sure anyone will consider hiring me after such a short time here. I’m so emotionally worn out but I can’t just leave because times are really rough right now. 

Please, if anyone could give me advice I’d be extremely grateful🙂"
1993,I wrote this today inspired by my depression and hopelessness. Tell me if you like it and can relate.
1994,"Literally hate nearly every aspect of my life. I did not used to, and I do not feel like its my fault.

I got handed crap beyond my control like multiple diseases that ruined my life. Like chron's disease, and a psychotic disorder.

There is almost nothing in my life, most of it beyond my control such as disease I would literally not erase.

I am beginning to question this whole being born thing as something worth celebrating.

So I have had delusional voices in my head, and that is pretty much what I hate more than damn anything. It literally taints everything in life, and makes me want to die.

If I could kill one thing in the entire universe it would be this psychotic disorder. I feel like that is the root of my life being utter crap, and it will never change unless I get rid of this terrible damn affliction. Which I have been trying to do for years.

There are positives to my life. like I am in a BSN program, and doing pretty well. That pretty much ends the list, but it is a big positive.

Everything else is absolute trash, and its the fault of this psychotic disorder."

Even with all these so called meds my mood is blue, grey, black never white,
The need to to end it all is getting worse and worse, I think it is because I no longer have a break from home, being stuck away from the shop was devestating for me, all I have now is listening to music and going on my laptop."

Now social distancing guarantees I won't meet anyone online and I'm stuck with my thoughts all day. I have been at online dating a lot and almost never get matches, and most women seem disinterested when we do match. I have only gotten 2 dates out of it over the past couple years and both times were catfish. I don't want to make it to 30 as a single virgin.

2000,"Yesterday I woke up to my boyfriend saying ""we need to talk."" We agreed that he would come to my place after work to talk. my boyfriend came to my house with a very puffy and swollen eyes that night obviously he cried a lot. He told me that for a while now he feels as if he has suddenly fallen out of love of me and he has no idea why.

Even before dating my boyfriend he told me the reason why his past relationship ended was because of this as well, whenever he gets into a relationship while everything is going well he would just slowly fall out of love without reason, he never really talked to anyone about this before but he honestly thinks there is something wrong with him.

anyway, my boyfriend told me he feels like he has fallen out of me and that he doesn't know why and he feels like he just wants to be alone. he said he still likes me and still cares for me it's just he feels like there's just no romantic feelings anymore and he said he is so confused and he is so upset cause everything was going well and non of us has done anything wrong. he keeps telling me for a while now that he thinks there is something wrong with him and thats also why he thinks why he has fallen out of love and just wanted to be alone.

I did not agree to break up with him and told him that base on his reasons I think he needs to see a therapist and that we can work things out, i told him I am not agreeing to the break up because i think he needs someone to support him and that i believe we can still work things out especially if he seeks professional help.

when I first suggested for him to seek professional help he hesitated and said his pride wont let him but after talking for a while we agreed to stay together but set up boundaries for now since he feels the need to be alone and away from me for awhile and wanted some space, and he also finally agreed that he thinks he needs to see a psychologist and is actually looking for one right now.

Has anybody experienced their loved one falling out of love or feel like they dont love you anymore because of depression or does it feel like he really fell out of love with me?

Ive been really sad lately, i cant help but cry all the time, we still talk like usual but i just cant help to be sad thinking someone i love suddenly feel like they dont love me anymore. but on the other hand im happy that he is willing to seek help and try to work things out.

i just feel like if this has happened before and if history kept repeating itself and he hasnt done anything about it its because he has never had someone there supporting him and its because he had never tried seeking help relating to this issue."
2001,"Hey guys,

I really need your advice and support, I would really appreciate it.

A couple of years ago I was in a very stressful job, and I developed panic attacks, which I could control. Then about 4 years ago I developed depression because of that job, and attempted suicide. That's when I realized I was really burned out. I kept on going until 2018 when I quit because of being too burned out, only to learn that in fact I had another medical issue, which my parents had to pay for, as I had quit my job. When the medical issue was discovered, my partner of 8 years left me because he felt 'it was too difficult on him to deal with the idea that I might have cancer.' It was hard on HIM! Anyhow after undergoing surgery I developed agoraphobia, so my official diagnosis is depression, panic disorder with agoraphobia, GAD, and PTSD.

I have been put on several antidepressants but unfortunately I have serotonin syndrome, so I can only take atypical antidepressants. Now I can only go out if I take Valium, otherwise I am housebound. I've had at least 4 psychotherapists (many places rejected my case as it was too complex), and no one has managed to make any progress with me. I've had several suicide attempts, and I only stopped for now because of fear of failing again and being sectioned. 

The people who suffer in this situation are my parents, because they do not know any longer how to help me, and I do not want to be a psychological and financial burden any longer. I have a sister who is doing very well financially but hates me with a passion, because she thinks I’ve always been the preferred kid in the family, and went as far as saying I should just commit suicide and not be a burden on the family.

I have truly lost the will to live after giving this person so many years of my life and trying to build something when he had other plans. The break-up also messed me up professionally, and it pains me to see how much my parents are suffering indirectly because of a jerk. My mom ended up in the ER herself after one of my attempts.

Have I tried enough? What am I living for? My only thought is to take a more radical approach and end this because I feel I will never put back my life together now that I acquired agoraphobia...

Thank you for all your thoughts and ideas!"
2002,"Not sure where to post this. But I'm scared and worried I'm a guy and I had sex for the first time witb a guy  A couple days ago. We don't use protection. And I was with another guy last night. Again no protection. I so scared I got hiv or something I don't really have anyone to talk to. 

I thought once I had sex things would change. I was wrong"
2003,"i am currently attempting to use CBD oil to help with my depression without the use of an anti depressent from the pharmacy such as lexapro. i have a 1000mg 30ml Full Spectrum(has trace amounts of thc) CBD Tincture oil. the recomended daily dosage was one dropper full which would provide 33 mg of cdb per day for 30 days. i tried that for two days and i think it was too much , i was crawling in my skin and in general just felt like shit.  in the following week i eased back to ten drops daily taken twice daily 5 drops at a time.  i am no longer having that awful feeling from the larger quantity but, i am not getting any relief from the depression. can anyone recomend a dosage from their own experience AND has anyone gotten any relief for their depression from cdb oil alone."
2004,"For a very long time, the medics have regarded sleep problems (e.g. insomnia) as a typical symptom of depression.

More recently, some medics have asked whether we have it the wrong way round; could sleep problems be a cause of depression?

Even when I was a kid, I was always wide awake late at night and half dead in the early morning. That got worse as I got older. Finally, a couple of years ago I was diagnosed with a circadian sleep disorder, generally referred to as Non-24 or just N24.

With these types of disorder, there's little you can do about them, and if you are forced in working 9-5, as we nearly all are, then you are ""well up the creek"" and perhaps that could that be a trigger for depression?

Anyone else in this neck of the woods?"
2005,"This is going to be a bit long if anyone decides to read it.

I had a couple “suicide attempts” a few years back and I ended up spending some days inside a hospital for it. I didn’t injure myself or anything I just felt like maybe it was the right thing to do. I took it for granted. I took as a joke. I didn’t capitalize on the help I could of gotten. Now I’m sort of paying the price. Everyday it seems like I slip a little bit further into a complete breakdown. I argue with myself constantly. It’s like theirs people in my head all vying for attention but it just ends up being random thoughts jumping into my head. Most of them telling me how stupid and worthless I am. My younger years were full of abandonment and abuse both physically and mentally. And now I’m an adult trying to sift through the rubble and it’s too much. It’s just too much. I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. I feel like God is punishing me for something that I’ve done. I just want it to stop. I’m tired. I’m so tired. I don’t know what the world wants from me. Sometimes I think it would be better if I just disappeared into the wilderness to die. I feel invisible. I don’t feel like a real person anymore. Some days I’m cold and distant from the people I love. Not on purpose but because I feel like I have to be. So I don’t disappoint them and they don’t disappoint me. I’m a hypocrite. I’m selfish and narcissistic at times. Self centered. I hate it. I hate me. I’m just soooo tired of it."
2006,"I have some type of psychotic disorder doctors cant agree on which

Nor my mood disorder though I think its depresion not bi polar since I never seem to be manic

I drink heavily it makes it worse

Ive decided to take a break from alcohol perhaps its time to permanently quit

I am one of the top scoring students in a BSN program despite my condition

THAT RIGHT THERE USED TO BRING ME JOY performing well. 

Video games used to bring me joy now they feel like a chore

It no longer does I have stopped caring about everything and anything.

I no longer hear voices like I used to, my delusions are gone, but there is still this one negative voice in my head constantly putting me down, suicidal ideation is a constant in my life

Ive always been on the depresed side of life, but i used to feel joy at times even though it was rare. Now I never feel joy at anything even the things I should

Just misery and the idea I am better off dead, or rage pure unadulterated rage at the diseases I was cursed with

The psychotic tendencies began well after the deppresion began. It started with me thinking the radio, books, movies were sending me telepathic messages I was diagnosed with depresion with psychotic tendencies, but the delusions persisted for years

I entered remision, and then one day bamn I start hearing disembodied voices claiming to be supernatural, and that was even worse. I didnt think it could get worse, but it did.

Now there is just this one voice I fight with on and off in my head. Sometimes its nice, but I cannot forget what the voices have done to me so even when its nice I give it the f bomb

And now despite being mostly voice free/delusion free which I told myself would be the day I finnally would be free to be happy again, and doing well in a very hard school program

I feel nothing but misery

I tell myself once the alchohol clears my system in two days, Ive only gone a day without a drink I will feel better maybe the anti depresants will start working once the depresants are gone, but that seems so far away and unlikely and right now I am miserable."

Not even enjoying it or anything. A typical day for me is wake up look at Google for how to get out of depression and anxiety. Watch YouTube, try going for a walk come home still feel like nothing. No soul, no stimulation. I feel like ive become autistic, or brain damaged. Day in day out just wasting time until bed time. Don't feel like talking to anyone.

2009,"Hi everyone, 
Ive had a period of depression myself but the shoe is on the other foot this time and its hard to handle. My husbands cousin (my best friend) who I've known as long as I have known my husband has somehow ""changed"" and I think he may be depressed. Now when I say ""best friend"" I dont say this lightly. We would talk everyday about anything and everything, laugh, joke etc. basically channeled each other. If i had a headache he had one - if i was thinking something, seconds later he would say it out loud. He was always the happy, funny guy. He loved his life, loved being single, loved not being tied down and never thought he would have any kids - it just wasnt his thing. Over the last few weeks he slowly started to change. He got behind on his mortgage (i helped him get caught up) and then all of a sudden it was like he was a completely different person. We dont talk, he doesnt laugh or joke, very seldom to I see a smile on his face, hes always irritable. Sleeps. Argues. Anytime we do see each other its always some kind of argument (mainly becauase this person is now a stranger to me). I let him know that I was there for him and that if he needed anything to let me know. His response was ""I dont know what I need. Maybe im tired of being alone. Maybe im not. Maybe I want to have kids of my own. Maybe I dont. I dont know whats wrong with me all I know is that I am not me and I have to find me."" and one point he even said ""I wouldnt do it or anything but like whats the point of me even being here?"" 

Now naturally this breaks my heart to hear. I want my best friend back. I told him if he needs some space I understand and il would give that to him but he replies ""no i need you, i cant do this without you""...so im there...and then 10 seconds later is back to silence and ""i dont know what i need i dont know what i want""

He doesnt seem to act as bad around anyone else - or maybe I am overthinking it because I do know him so well...idk.

At this point I dont know what I can do or SHOULD do to help him and save my sanity. The person who was my best friend - is now becoming the person that I hate."
2010,"Fore-warning; incoming wall of text.

So, I met this woman about a year ago in college (I know, this is starting out so cliche), and we've been friends since then. Not too long ago, we hung out outside of school or work functions for the first time. For the most part, I was able to prevent myself from acting like a complete fool, and we both had a good time.

Well, during the rest of that week and the following week, I was going to campus every week day (I work three twelve hour shifts on the weekends) in order to work on homework and lab reports. Our spring break was extended for an extra week because of COVID-19, and I thought it would be a good time to perhaps get ahead as it were. It's also easier for me to get my work done on campus due to the fact that there are too many distractions at my apartment. That, and I was going stir crazy.

But I also had the ulterior motive of seeing my friend. When I went to the campus, I'd park outside the building where she usually spends her time doing her work. This isn't out of the ordinary for me since I would usually park there anyways, but I was hoping to potentially catch her as she was leaving just to say hi and see how she was doing. I even walked through the bottom floor of the building on my way to the library on a few of those days with the same hope (she spends her time on one of the upper floors). When I was leaving the Library on a couple of those days, I took a walk on one of the pathways that circles the campus to clear my head and to waste some extra time for the same reasons as above.

This sounds innocent enough, but there's more. I sent her three texts in a seven day period with no reply on her part (this is nothing out of the ordinary for her; she gets focused on what she's doing). But I was starting to feel insecure, and I was starting to feel afraid that perhaps my texts gave the impression that I was trying to hard. From a rational standpoint, I knew there was no need for me to feel this way, but for whatever reason, I did.

Then last weekend, after I was discussing this with a coworker, I realized at that point that I acted like a fucking creeper. I was feeling insecure because of a fear of rejection, and that was one of the driving forces for me to want to see her. It was also due to the fact that I didn't know if it was simply because she was busy or if it was truly because I fucked up. I also realized at that point that the building in question has a lot of windows. So I thought it likely that she might have saw me enter the building. Since then, I've felt like a piece of shit; she has a history of other guys being creeps to her, and here I was acting like one. As such, I sent her an apology earlier this week via text. I pretty much said I'm sorry for trying to hard, for potentially making her feel uncomfortable, and that I'd promise to never bother her again. I truly meant that last part, and I didn't expect a response on her part. Surprisingly, she did reply and said she was sorry for not responding; that it's been an issue for her for a few years.

But I've also come to the conclusion that I need help with my feelings of insecurity before they get me into more trouble. I'm also not going to try and make contact for a while for both of our sake's. We've gone months without talking before since we're both busy individuals, and it didn't effect the friendship.

One of my other friends has told me that I'm overreacting; She said that I didn't go to her house unannounced, and I also didn't go through the entire building searching for her (In fact, thinking about doing those things makes me sick to my stomach). But I still acted in a concerning manner, and I plan on seeing a counselor for my self-esteem issues. Another potential variable to consider here is the fact that I do have feelings for the person in question. But she's not interested in a relationship right now, and I have no interest in ruining the friendship. Since this likely contributed to my behavior, I've been spending the past few days trying to modify my thoughts and feelings about her.

So, now I have a couple of questions; I'd like to hear other people's perspectives.

1. Am I overreacting? Was I acting like a creep?
2. These actions also likely stemmed from years of unresolved emotions. I've been single pretty much my entire life, and I'm having a midlife crisis (kind of) with regard to this fact. I just turned 30 not too long ago, and I'm starting to worry that I won't find a relationship at this point. I have a strong desire for intimacy, and I have no outlet. What can I do to better manage these emotions so they don't get the better of me? My usual strategy is to internalize them, but I know that this is not a very effective strategy. I just don't know what else to do with them."
2011,About 2 and a half years ago one of my friends made some comments hinting that she might be suffering from depression. For whatever reason that I still don't know I didn't follow up to see if she was ok. About a year later another mutual friend told me that while on a night out this same friend told her 'I think might be depressed'. Is it too late to reach out to her about these comments? We both go to different colleges so we don't see eachother as often anymore. I know I could check up on her to see how she's doing but I would also like to apologise for not being there for her when I should have.
2012,I have some pretty severe depression and I just started taking Trintellix a year ago. But hearing that I’ll be depressed within a year again got me thinking that I’m a lost cause.
2013,"Well I never thought I’d post here but why the hell not, I could use some help. I am 25 years old and began dating my girlfriend during my senior year of college, when I decided to also move accords the country  to Florida. i had a job in place and I was lucky enough to have her come with, even with a very unsupportive family who resisted her to go. Yet she came, we lived together in small studio apartment for 1 and a half years and made it through and just now upgraded to a beautiful new place. Everything should be perfect, we have a dog , life should be good but I have clinical depression and it is beginning to ruin our relationship.

I have outbursts and get upset so easily over stupid fucking shit, like just not important things and I yell and get so angry, but then am able to function normally once again and we are happy during those times. There is a cycle that I am trying so hard to break out of but i think I’ve finally given Up. I take Wellbutrin, and trintellix and occasionally Xanax when needed (been needed quite a bit recently) but i don’t know what to do. Everything has been my completely my fault because of my messed up brain, it is just not normal.

After my most recent outburst over just a stupid email at work, she says it is finally enough, and you know what, I do not blame her one bit. Sure she has pushed my buttons and upset me but I am not normal and does deserve someone more stable as much as it hurts. But i want her stay so badly, she just can’t take the instability. We have had all of the discussions about how I would improve and how things would get better but it hasn’t, there are small improvements but no matter what I just don’t think I will ever be better.

I just need a little help out there and if anyone just has any small advice or anything, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
2014,"I am a male. I am back on generic lexapro after 2 years of taking nothing for my depression.ive had good luck previously with lexapro relieving my depression.its been about two weeks and I am seeing a tiny improvement in my depression but I also have noticed a huge decrease in my sex drive.i had been on it before and noticed the same issue. Does anyone have experience or advice on a med that helps depression and doesn't cause sexual issues? Maybe even another SSRI , or maybe not. I know each drug effects everyone differently,just was hoping for some input or maybe someone had a similar side effect from Lexapro and tried something different. Thanks paul"
2015,"What the title says really.
I'm not sure what words to use.

It's from Depression and Anxiety. 

I just want to hibernate and sleep all the time, every interaction is an effort, I don't know what to say, I'm mostly silent.

It's been going on a while, but I've only just today realised it for what it is.

Has anyone else experienced the same? Any ways of shifting things?

2016,"Hi all, 

I am writing to look for advices.
I have been struggling with major depression for the past 3 years. I tried a few therapists but nothing available in the country where I live seem to be helpful. Unfortunately options are very limited here. 
I am currently unemployed, struggling with finances. I understand the importance of therapy, but I really do not know how and where to start. 
Do you know any effective service online that could help?"
2017,"why is the mind so controlling. Mind my own business, try to keep busy but from out of the blue for no reason I get flashbacks and also thoughts of ending it all. i don't what else I can to keep these thoughts at bay

2018,"I've come to understand that you can't talk about your (mental health) problems because it's a burden for other people. It makes them feel bad and I feel like the paint me as a villain. ""How are you?"" Isn't a question to be answered. It's a statement saying ""I am present in your life."" 

So I cannot ask for help when I need it. I tried the other day to open up a little and just ask a friend about the concept of telling someone ""I had a bad day"" and he was quick to remind me that I'm a burden to people. It kills me to be so alone but of course I can't tell anyone that.

The people around me don't know anything about me or who I am. But they think they do and feel good about themselves so that's the life I live but it takes a huge toll on me. Maybe it isn't fair for me to ask a friend to shoulder some of the weight I carry but people always say ""I'm here for you."" That's a lie and it hurts being lied to. So instead the weight will crush me .

I want to die for many reasons but one of them is to finally be able to say ""I'm not okay"". And yes, I am a monster no matter how I say it. But at least this way, I won't be around to care about people blaming me for being so dangerous. 

I'm not dangerous and I don't mean to hurt people. I'm just in a lot of pain."
2019,"I'm wasting away from this depression. I spend day in day out in a state of anxiety, fear and sadness filled with thoughts of loved ones dieing, seeing nice old people driving by and then thinking they might pass away soon from there age, thoughts of my dog passing away or thinking of some of the family members I've lost or getting intrusive thoughts what if I lost my mind and injured myself or someone else and stuck on those horrible thoughts and feelings that make u sick to ur gut. My mind is so targeted and latched on to this depressing state. I use to take an antidepressant but I find it only worked for a few years. I've had a few prescriptions of Klonopin but honestly they just make me tired and don't help my mood. I can't even go to a job interview I'm stuck inside I hate to be so down but the switch in my brain is off! I tried taking Klonopin before a job interview thinking it would help me not get all panicky but it didn't do anything for me mentally and I just said screw it I can't work I give up. I just turned 29 and this misery has not gone away. So what should I do clearly my brain is not getting any healthier I might as well pick a drug weather it's a pain killer or whatever so I can atleast not feel this guilt and horrible sensation. I've gone 4 while years and every SINGLE day was just depression and anxiety that's no way to live why not do drugs.... Like I have anything better going on with this life."
2020,"I don't get it why do I have to suffer? Why does this life have to be difficult all the time? I'm so miserable. 

That's ok I'm good at being miserable I have been for years. I feel better from time to time but lately I have nothing but unhappy self centered loathing and complete dread. 

Work is too much for me yet I go. I try to do my tasks between avoidance. I'm paid more than I'm worth that'll get me fired. I have savings because I'm so scared to lose my job.

I'm a total piece of crap. I'm worthless.

Thanks for letting me vent.

2021,Hi I know everyone is in same boat and there are people who are worse off and have actually died but I feel so sad and depressed not being able to see my bf or friends or just go on train like I used to for day outs due this coronaviruis.i has no idea what so ever I would be in this situation ever.i kept working long hours going in even when felt I'll because I knew I had my holiday break and than last week got cancelled was deverstated and I thought well I just go on train somewhere now can't even that.i feel so depressed that I just feel like lying in bed all day not getting up have nothing to look forward to feel heartbroken and upset really hate this world wish this could have been prevented and didn't have to happen
2022,I am brand new here so I am nervous. Long story short is that I am in such a deep depression that I don't know what to do anymore. I have zero friends. I have a job where I am alone most of the day so there is no interaction. My second job is as a server in a restaurant so right now I don't even have that. I have a boyfriend that I think is falling away from me. All we do is fight lately. The only person I had was my sister and right now she isn't talking to me for some reason. When I try to find out the issue she will not respond. I hate everything about my life at the moment. I go home and literally cry until it is a decent time for bed. I have been through counseling and have tried various medications and nothing has worked. I am not new to depression but this is the worst it has ever been. I am so lost.... Sorry for the ranting. Helps to at least type it out.
2023,"Even though I'm stuck at home now, i still get up, shower, get dressed (usually clean, nice yoga pants and hoody) put my contacts in, a little makeup on and fix my hair a bit.

2026,"One teacher found out I got sick during AS year and kept staring at me after he found out because it was severely impacting my work. He usually makes everyone feel stupid and I have self esteem issues so it fuelled my depression, anyway after he found out he was complimenting the class and stopped making people feel dumb and I didn’t know he was looking at me but I shook my head at myself and he said “some of you don’t see yourself like that”, I looked up for a second and then he says “YOU’VE had some issues, and because of that, you feel like you’re going to fail everything. You’re not okay? See yourself like that” was I attention seeking when I didn’t even know he was looking? It’s like I made that about me and I wish I didn’t react. Does this mean my teacher still believed in me despite messing up so badly?"

2028,"Hey everyone,

Basically I was doing a SCITT course for teacher training. Lack of support and a newborn baby as well as a disabled wife and my family all piled on myself and I started crying at work, basically having breakdowns and it was impacting my performance (I have struggled with anxiety/depression for over 15 years and now at 30 years old). I got very anxious and realised I was having serious issues, so I went and saw a doctor and got signed off work for a month with depression and anxiety and given my meds to retake (I came off of them last year, a few months before I started the SCITT). I absolutely despise the SCITT but I want to finish it so my time isn't wasted.

Here in the UK the coronavirus has shut down all schools so it looks like I won't be going back at all, as it finishes the end of June. My question is, I have started taking the meds again a week ago and I am getting awful side effects as usual but I am no longer sure I need to take them as the SCITT course is no longer an issue. I genuinely don't feel like I need to be on these tablets, but I genuinely believe they are making me worse (they usually do for the first month or so) and I don't want to be on them if I don't have to be. So that leads me to the question: Should I be on them?"
2029,"hi there,
today i watched camp rock on disney + as i’ve never watched it and i love the jonas brothers so wanted to see it. i binged both 1 and 2 and near the end of 2 i started to get noticeably depressed. this isn’t uncommon to me, i get really depressed after watching good movies. i really don’t know why. i think a reason is that i don’t want it to be over. i also miss the times from when it was released, even tho i didn’t watch it when it was released, which also makes me feel slightly like i’m missing out which i don’t understand at all. also the fact that i was seeing the young jonas brothers and i wish i’d been fans of them then and knew of them then could also be a factor. actually i’m pretty sure that’s quite a huge reason in this case and i can’t explain why, it’s an indescribable feeling. also definitely jealous of all the relationships in it but that’s not a huge factor. so overall i’m really depressed and it happens with so many movies and i don’t know what to do because this depression is something that could either last a day or a few months, any advice? anything would be great.
thank you,

2030,"Hello, everybody. I'm an adult. I take care of myself. I live alone and I have no friends. Other than that, I'm pretty okay. I can work and manage responsibilities. I had a childhood that was full of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse. I found a trauma therapist and did 2 and a half years of therapy that included EMDR. I've tried really hard to change my negative thought patterns that were a poor coping mechanism. I quit drinking. I've changed my diet. I use CBT skills. I'm learning how to get better.

I have struggled with low moods for most of my life but over the past two years it has been difficult. Previous to this i was obsessed and enjoying mixed martial arts. It consumed most of my time alongside university and i had been doing it for 6 years. It was the only thing i could see myself doing for my life. At the time it was my everything. it fullfilled most aspects of my life. Then about two years ago almost overnight it was over. I got a head injury and had to be hospitalised. I had to make a decision based on doctors advise to not continue the sport (but i could have continued). i made the decision not to continue based on rational thinking and medical advice. I did not realise how much this decision would effect me. The last two years have been empty and tough. I have tried to move on but cant seem to. I am trying to develop other passions. It is tough everyday waking up. I just want to work hard on something i love and be happy but cant quite get there at the moment because now i dont have an idea of what to do."

Back in June 2019, I had an abrupt break-up with a friend of almost 8 years. We were close in our middle school years, then split up once and then became friends again. It wasn't until my friend came out as a transgender male. Of course I embraced him with open arms because I found nothing wrong with it, quite the opposite, I accepted him almost immediately! During our friendship, there were times where we frequently argued and I always had this defensive take on what he'd tell me. I didn't respond well to confrontation, especially with experiences with bullying/teasing. There were also times when I'd act lowkey ignorant/manipulative towards him. It wasn't pleasant due to the fact I guilt tripped him a lot. Over the years, I've grown attracted to him and wanted to date him, but it wasn't natural. I could tell he didn't feel the same about me, but I pushed it on him. I grew openly jealous/possessive of him, which came from depression as well because I wasn't able to see him. Our friendship finally came to a grinding halt in October 2018. I had been holding on to a collection of crystals/tarot cards he sent to my house until I could give him his package. I diligently watch his items over the summer and opened his package to make sure nothing broke. Finally, a small crystal convention was being held at a nearby college where I could hand over his stuff, but unfortunately, I forgot them at home. When I arrived and told him after I noticed they were missing, he seemed calm/forgiving towards me. Not long after, he tells me that he'll be busy and won't talk to me until May or so. May comes and goes, no friend. I decide to message him on June 1st and an hour into talking, we bring up going on a camping trip with his boyfriend. I talk about how him, his boyfriend, and I will have a fun time but I forget his boyfriend's non-binary. I make the mistake repeatedly and then he messages me saying that he's had it being my friend and that doesn't want to talk to me again. A day later, he makes a twitter thread about me while covering my profile pic with a clown emoji. He exploits me and says I have ""multiple mental illnesses"" and claims I am a abuser, a transphobe, and a thief. I was mortified and had trouble sleeping that night, but to this day it makes me like hot garbage nobody wants. I have trouble making friends and feel paranoid about what people already think of me.

Thanks for reading, sorry for the long post. Goodnight."
2049,"Hello,

I am in a really bad spot and shut down for a while. I am suffering from health issues everyday concerning my stomach and head. I am always sick and it made me feel really depressed today. I cried and all I wanted was someone to hug me. My husband goes on a full on rage and threw things around and told me to stop crying or he is leaving the house. I went downstairs to be alone and he came down and told me that he is unhappy, thinking about sending me back to the states, and contemplating divorce to me. (I am currently living in his country right now due to emotionally abusive family).
I completely shut down. I began losing my vision and seeing only white. I felt so numb and my body felt so heavy. Finally when I get myself together and tried to talk to him, it did nothing. It just came to me only being the bad guy, saying he wants a partnership, not someone who is depressed and sick all the time. I informed him that before we even got married; I am mentally ill and that I have depression, PTSD, and anxiety, having to be in treatment centers my whole teen life. He is the reason why I quit medication because he said it will ruin my internal health and now that I have no insurance that works in the country I live in, I cannot even go back on medication even if I wanted to. He told me he wanted a partner in this relationship, but refused to acknowledge that I wanted a support system that could help me become a better wife. I constantly feel alone with my depression. I am not even allowed to vent to friends due to his ex doing that, not seeing a therapist, and I feel so damn alone.
He expects me to change, but doesn't want to try to change and try to be a support system for me. I am absolutely alone. I messaged my mother and told her I hate that I've been born into this world having depression conquering my life. He has no history with depression in his life nor family, but he literally makes no effort to be understanding. I bottle everything up and if I break down once within a few weeks, it's instantly him telling me I cry every f*cking day and that I am only known for my depression. I really cannot even explain my emotions right now. They are unexplainable. 
I literally told him ways that could really help me, like just a hug or giving me motivation, but he refused and said I need to change, BUT HOW CAN I CHANGE WHEN I HAVE NO EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND NO MEDICATIONS! I AM NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THIS ON MY OWN!"

All of this have brought me back to a deep existential crisis. Nothing about this world makes sense to me anymore. We go to work everyday just to try to make some sense of this mess that is the society we live. Money, power, politics, I'm tired of it. I can't help but think that we are all just animals locked in a farm, controlled by ou leaders, with no influence or free will. I feel so insignificant. Everywere I look is just war, violence, tragedy with no escape. I dream of a world were love and the wellbeing of others is what our goal is, but our world just doesn't work like that. I feel like we are trapped to feel only agony. I'm just tired of overthinking it. I don't understand why everything must always be like this, and I just don't have the energy to try and build up hope anymore. Death and misery is all we get. I'm on a really bad spot right now, I'm anxious and depressed and I see no reason to continue with my life if this is all I'm ever going to feel."
2051,"So I dont have friends, quite literally. I had a breakdown a couple days ago and decided to isolate myself from people. Not my family or my support system, just keeping myself from pursuing other relationships because I constantly become disappointed and sad. During my breakdown I went to try to call someone or turn somewhere and there was literally no one. It got to the point where the only person I could talk to was a suicide hotline. My fiance tried to help, but he doesnt understand. He has so many friends and people that he can turn to and I have no one. I mean I have him, but hes my partner. I cant bitch or gush about him to him. So I decided today to go through my phone and delete the numbers of people I haven't talk to in the last 6 months and conversations where they haven't talked to me in literal months. Im so lonely and I literally dont know what to do. I know that choosing this is bad, but I cant help it because in some twisted way I think that if I choose this and make this my new normal that eventually ill be happy."
2052,my depression is so bad. the only thing getting me through this is my mom’s company but my fam is so dysfunctional and because of the current events we’re stuck in the house together. I‘ve ruined every friendship I have by finally stopping pretending I’m okay or masking my feelings with humor (and I understand because I’m difficult but it still hurts since its fresh). I have nobody and nothing interests me. thankfully the crisis text line has been helping me for the past couple of nights though thats a positive. how are u guys coping through this all?
2053,"i don't really have words for what i'm feeling, but it's partly described by the song Redundant by Green Day.
it feels like i've completely shut down, i feel unable to even speak, to move, to do anything... i feel like i'm gone, i've disappeared, i'm not a human being... i'm just a photograph, or i'm stuck in a world made up of paper dolls, everything is flat and dimensionless.

i've had depression for a long time now, and partly i'm just naturally quite quiet and introverted. i always felt like all anyone ever valued me for was my entertainment value, and partly because of mental illness and partly because i'm just a quiet person and prefer to watch and observe and find out what's going on in others' minds, i feel... useless...

because all i've ever been valued for was entertainment value, i was just an object, never a human being... so i learned to create this 'entertainment' person in order to survive, but now that survival mechanism is no longer necessary, but i still feel 'entertainment value' is all anyone would want from me... i struggle to imagine anyone would want anything to do with the quiet, wordless, 'empty' person i actually am...

i just don't want to have to 'entertain' anyone anymore or try to be a certain way, or have to speak or joke around or 'fill empty space', i just want to be quiet, i just want to sit and observe, i don't want to be anyone's entertainment, i want to be a full human person.
i want to not have to entertain anyone and not have to face abuse if i don't.

'now i cannot speak, i've lost my voice,
i'm speechless and redundant,
i'm lost for words.
choreographed and lack of passion,
prototypes of what we were,
went full circle 'til i'm nauseous.'"
2054,"I have been dating my bf for 2 years. His depression got serious 6 months into our relationship, so he has been in it for 1.5 years. He tells me stuff along the lines of: 

-I am indifferent, I can disappear from the face of this Earth or don't, it doesn't matter. 
-I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy. 
-I hate myself. 
-I am exhausted, numb and indifferent. 
-I don't know how to love anymore. 

Can you guys please advise me on what I can say or do to help? I asked my bf if I can do anything, even run an errand for him or anything at all. He doesn't know what I can do to help him. I've learned about depression, built my own support systems (friends, family, hobbies, career), and I generally feel happy, positive and driven until I meet him, I also learned to give him space. But he's still in a dark place and sometimes it's even worse when he doesn't share his thoughts (because he's tired of being vulnerable, opening up about his depression and crying). I love him and I know he has a good heart. 

I want to build him up, help him restore his confidence, love himself, be happy. 

Anyone?"
2055,"I am 19 but I am exactly the same size as my 11 year old sister due to having a rare form of dwarfism. My sisters friends don’t believe I am 19 and they say “how can you be a full grown adult and look like that?” I fucking hate looking 11, I want to die because of dwarfism. What 19 year old is 4 ft 8 other than those with illnesses? What 19 year old still looks like a child? When I am 24 people will still think I am 11."
2056,Hi everyone.  Any advice on how to explain what depression is and what it feels like to people who don’t suffer from it?  Is there a way to make others understand rationality and perception get distorted and it isn’t a question of ‘what happened to make you so sad and crazy?’
2057,"All through my eight years when I was first diagnosed with depression.at the start of it I was given sertraline 100 mg to take.my story is that i never use to take my meds properly,all threw these years I was taking them on And off I would take them for two months then think I'm well and then stopped taking them untill my depression would come back like after a couple of weeks. I'm back to a depressed state for like 3weeks then go back on them to get back to normal. That was cycle all rhi"
2058,I'm so lost. I want to give up. But I know I can't. My cousin/best friend/roommate lied to me he was missing for 17 hours. And doesn't understand why I'm upset. Then I found out he never ever cared about or loved me. I was just a free place to stay. his ex told me he thought I was creepy and weird. He went so far as to lie about being raped. He wasn't raped he willing had sex with the guy. I'm so lost and hurt. I don't know how to keep going. I lost my best friend only to find out I never had one.
2059,"My workplace is closing due to the virus. They are allowing some to work from home and some still can come in.  And then there are others that just can't work at all. It seems like it just matters who you are. 
The stock markets have crashed making interest rates zero so what I have saved is getting less and less.  
I support myself and have no one but me to rely on.  Being forced not to work is getting me upset especially when others are allowed to work.
Everything is getting to be a mess and it seems to get worse everyday.  A lot of people have two incomes in their house and I don't.  Other people get benefits from the government and I don't.   I've always had to fend for myself and I'm sick of this thing."
2060,"The only place I felt safe, I dont know what I am going to do to fill the time or find another safe place. :low:  :low:"
2061,"ik I’m not “special” for feeling this way about myself and sadly its become normalized especially with my generation to be unhappy with ourselves in one way or another. I hate that I am so difficult. I want to isolate myself from everyone, especially the people who claim to love me regardless, because it hurts to know how much extra dramatics I’ve brought to their lives. I have no friends near me anyway so it’d be easy to kinda fall off the face of the earth in their eyes. I try so hard to do everything to better myself. My mom has spent so much money for me in therapy and my medications... I am in college despite the stress it gives me... I spend so much meditating... the apps and forums and websites I’ve looked through.. all to grow and change and I’m still so burdensome. I‘m sad because theres no way I can live a fulfilling life no matter what I do anymore and I hate bringing down everyone around me. :( I want to apologize to everyone who knows me lol. its sad but true"
2062,"So, pretty much everyone's lives have been turned very suddenly upside down because of this virus, and I feel a bit guilty for being upset because many people have it worse than me. I am a university student and I just found out recently that my university is transitioning to fully online for the remainder of the semester. I have friends who are seniors who may not get their college graduation, my high school aged brother might not get his first prom this year, and many people are losing their jobs or are having their jobs drastically altered. I am unemployed currently and still have a couple of years of college left, but I can't help but feel like I am losing an important part of my life. I really enjoyed my classes. I loved participating in meaningful class discussions and having a chance to get out of the house and away from my hometown. But now I am stuck in a town that I hate and even though I can still do online instruction, it isn't the same. I feel lonely and a bit lost. I finally got to a place where I was more comfortable being around others. I finally got to a place where I enjoyed social outings, and now that is over and it happened so suddenly. I didn't have a warning so I couldn't prepare myself for isolation. One day everything is fine and proceeding as scheduled, and the next everything is shutting down and grocery stores are being cleared out at record speed. It was chaotic and scary trying to get groceries and seeing only empty shelves and lines all the way down the aisles. I know that others have it worse. There are the people who have contracted the virus, people who died or lost family members due to it, people have lost their jobs and graduations and proms, people who have no food or supplies, and here I am upset because I can't do in-person classes anymore. I know it sounds dumb but I worked so hard to go back to college. This was my first semester back after taking some time away, and I was confident and prepared to go back. I was ready. And then this happened and even though it is temporary, I feel that old, familiar depression settling on my shoulders again. That weight that drags me down and tells me it's hopeless, that something always happens when I allow myself to be happy. I keep trying to think positively about this whole situation, like how it has given me more time to do things that I enjoy but didn't have a lot of time for before, but I feel so alone. Sometimes I like being by myself, but I don't like having to be by myself, if that makes sense. I am an introvert but I like to have the option of going out. I am grateful that the internet and social media have given me the opportunity to stay connected with people that way, but it isn't the same as being in the room with them. I can't hug my friends or shake hands with my church family. I know it is only temporary but with all of this uncertainty I am not sure how long this will last or how much worse it will get. I feel bad for being depressed because this is affecting everyone and not everyone feels as depressed as me, but I can't help it. My entire routine for the next month and a half was changed all of a sudden and I am having a hard time coping with that. My college campus was where most of my socialization occurred, and now I have no campus to return to until the fall and I am struggling with that a bit. How are you all holding up? Are you handling it well or having a hard time? What are some coping strategies you use to get through this? Hope you are all staying safe and well. We will get through this, but until then here is a group hug for you.:grouphug:"
2063,"As a new member, I would like to share a little about my background.  As a female in my 60s, I became depressed after two life saving major abdominal surgeries three years ago. I had been seeing a psychologist, and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.  I believe it began with my horrible chronic adhesion pain.  After a month, I ended up in crisis, and was hospitalized after considering suicide.  I still see my psychologist regularly.  I had refused antidepressant medications, and have managed to be in full remission and recovery from depression without the drugs. 

It is my hope to meet people in this forum that have been through a similar experience."
2064,"Hello

I'm new here and don't know how all this works, been reading a few forums and stuff to see how it works but hoping I'm posting this in the right place. I'm just not sure what is wrong with me. I know I've been suffering with something for a long time now and consulted a lot of so called professionals about it but never really came to a solid answer. I know that depression and anxiety have a part to play but a lot of the time I think that something else, something more serious is present that has never been addressed. I have never felt confident in anything I ever do and second guess all that comes my way. The only time I can remember being truly happy was when I was a kid, all sunshine and rainbows for me, us, back then. I've never felt I had a real place in this world and question my existence often. These feelings have now turned into suicidal thoughts and tendencies and I am slowly becoming worse. Some days I can be right as rain, the thoughts still in the back of my mind but I'm able to continue with my day in a healthy way. Lately those days have become less frequent and the place I'm in now is not a good one. Just hoping someone could have some input I guess.

Thanks."
2065,Hey no pity patty I had great life but abrupt change 10yrs ago now just daily bad news I am done just hanging on cause of my dogs
2066,I’m a 20 year old male who can’t stand the loneliness anymore. I haven’t got any (literally) any friends and I have 2 family members. I work 12 hour shifts any day of the week and it’s my only source of human interaction and I despise my job. I’ve spent 3 or so years completely alone in my room watching movies and being isolated. I’ve tried to make friends but I can’t because I have nothing in common with anyone since I literally don’t care about anything anymore. I guess this is a cry for help but it’s all I can do. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and I was placed on Zoloft which worked but the side effects of the drug was not for me. I recently passed my driving test and I’m now driving but I feel literally nothing because I’m so empty. I can’t remember the last time I was truly happy. I’m thinking about leaving soon if things don’t get better which I doubt they will. No one looks at me no one wants to be around me. It’s so hard to see people with friends and something to actually do other than work. I haven’t done any thing with anyone in so long it’s difficult to remember what it feels like.
2067,"Been feeling lonely lately and pretty isolated, I spend alot of time in my bedroom. I have friends yet they can be tricky to reach sometimes and they live far away. I spend a lot of time being lonely and it's like I feel separated. I try and distract myself with YouTube videos, and TV and movies to take that edge off my loneliness. I get depressed being on my own and can feel not cared about. I get alot of anxiety too as I worry alot, most of the times its irrational yet it still effects me."
2068,"Sometimes I have better days and feel more hopeful, which is good and a relief after having a bad time. However I often have this sense that I want to feel sad again. Which is stupid I know. I think the reason is that if I'm doing okay I'm just okay. I'm invisible and nothing. So I'd rather have something where I can go ""I'm not okay! Look at me, give me attention!"" I don't see how I can ever get better and have a decent life while I feel like this, so it's definitely something I need to get over. I certainly won't admit it to anyone other than my counsellor. Does anyone else feel like this?"
2069,"I feel I am stuck at one moment and can't move onto the next by myself. I am a stay at home mom , was working but husband went overseas and I was stuck with household chores,  it's unrewarding and I hate my life."
2070,"Hey all - 

I hope everyone is hanging in there as best as you can during all of this corona madness. I truly hope you are staying safe and healthy and I'm truly so sorry for how many people it's affecting due to workplaces shutting down. The time alone I've had now has been giving me time to reflect on things I've been avoiding, and I suddenly realized that I have a pretty intense case of abandonment issues that has stemmed from my childhood.

I've developed a bad case of clinging on to people who only want to use me for X, Y, and Z, and I cling on to unhealthy relationships. Once someone becomes bored or uninterested in me, even though my gut tells me to drop them, it's really hard to fight the urge to cling onto them even more - because I cannot physically and mentally stand the idea of being abandoned. 

I hate the feeling of being unwanted more than anything. I want to be wanted and for some reason, it leads me to the wrong people, and I become addicted to this same, unhealthy cycle. I don't want to lose any connection I've made with someone if they have seen a piece of me. It just feels unbearable and keeps me up at night. I'll think about who they could be with instead of me and who the more ideal person is, and I'll do anything to get that spot.

I do want to seek therapy once I'm able. In the meantime however, does anyone have any words of advice? Has anyone else gone through this or is going through this? Thanks in advance."
2071,Wondering why I should even keep going. I've been depressed for 5 years and no it hasn't got better. What is the point. I don't know what to do anymore. Considering really ending it. I hate being alive so much.
2072,"So after a walk today I got back and got into an argument with my housemate. When I got back he asked me to take my shoes off in case they were muddy when I walked through to the back door to take them off. The soles were clean, which made me not think about it, but I didn't appreciate the snappy tone he had.

Then I accidentally brushed past him and he snapped again, before I muttered something and walked off. I then went to get some laundry and needed to remove some of his stuff from the washer/dryer. I didn't feel like talking to him after his tone earlier, so I put them by the side. He then stormed through and said ""you could have asked me to move them!"" in another aggressive tone.

I then went upstairs for a bit in a foul mood, with the voices berating me in my head and felt like utter shit. I then went down for a drink and he came out of his room heading straight towards me. I interpreted this as him deliberately trying to cut me off, but I realise it could have been him not seeing me, but I shoulder barged him out the way. I probably shouldn't have done this, but I was in a foul mood, and wasn't thinking. This led to another argument and I blew my lid, saying how he moody he was when he was blabbering about how I nudged into him and didn't say excuse me. I said how I thought the gap was big enough (which it was), but stumbled into him by accident. He said I could have apologised, I said I didn't have time since he then was moody, and I didn't feel like apologising afterwards. He said he wasn't moody and said it was me being so.

This has pissed me off and I have done something I now regret. For the first time in my life I have self harmed. Only minor, but it has shaken me. I don't know what to do now and I feel awful. I am not apologising for things I should apologise for (the shoulder barge, being thoughtless with my shoes maybe) until he makes an effort himself for how he acted himself, but I don't want there to be a schism, especially as I have another housemate who heard the argument and urged no shouting. I am also anxious that she thinks less of me too.

I wish I was someone else and wasn't this useless sack of meat who fucks up at everything."
2073,"I’ve been on Prozac 20-40-60-40mg currently for 8 weeks.  No major relief yet.  My depression is so severe with dissociation this time.  
I started looking for TMS therapy that is costly. But my insurance should cover it.  But it’ll take time.  I have little energy.  Nothing is easy."
2074,"I fell and love in high school with a beautiful and intelligent classmate.  We dated and eventually pronounced our love for one another.  Upon graduation, I was committed to attend a school on an athletic scholarship about 600 miles from home.  She was accepted into state school about the same distance from me.  Several times of the first 2 years, I suggested that maybe we should break it off, because it was so hard to be apart all the time.  But she fought, and transferred to keep us together.  It was not the best situation, because she had no friends but me, and I'll admit, I spent most of my time with teammates, practice, and neglected her somewhat.  We had a big fight, and i stupidly had a 1 night stand and was overwhelmed with guilt, so admitted it to her.  We both went home for the summer, and struggled to keep it together.  When it was time to return to school, she announced she wasn't coming back.  i told her I would give her all the money I had made to offset the tuition and board costs, but she said no.  So we went back to long distance.  7 month later, i thought we were doing OK and she asked me to visit her on a long weekend. 1200 miles driving for me.  Anyway, we had a decent weekend, then she handed me back my ring and said goodbye.  We stayed in communication, but began seeing other people.  I didn't go home for the summer and we saw each other only briefly at Christmas.  Anyway, we both graduated 14 months later and she came to visit.  I had broken up with a girl i had seen briefly, but sublet her apt when she went to Europe to work.  She came back to surprise me, while my true love was there, and things blew up.  The short of it is our lives went in separate directions, a failed marriage for each of us, now 40 years have passed.  We began talking again, long distance, and my emotions all flooded back, and i told her.  She denied having any emotions and claimed to only remember the bad things.
I have been crying over TV, walking down the streets at all hours, unable to sleep, and have isolated myself from everybody.  i don't know what to do.  i think i should tell her not to call me anymore, which she could easily do.  But I'm scared to not hear her voice.  I have loved her from afar since early 20's, and i'm 64 now.   I don't know what to do."
2075,"i know alot of people need help and the typical solutions by doctors is either talk therapy, phych drugs and ECT and TMS. now clearly benzos DO cause dementia and brain damage and even pych meds have shown this. few phychiatrist are coming out speaking about the danagers of drugs prescribed and even ECT! the seizures induced in the brain have left alot of people with bad memory and they forget ALOT of things and are confused... i know some people say ect helped them butttttt...... its risky. alot of people are against phych drugs but i can admit they helped me. ages 17 to 22 i had severe anxiety and depression and i tried to get over it on my own but it would NOT lift. it wasnt until i tried an SSRI and it did help ALOT. i wasnt freeking out all the time. it helped for quite a few years but of course now its wore of and no ssri seems to be helping... what is the answer?? phych drugs seem to cause a dulling of the brain and rebound effects becuase they block chemicals so your body responds by trying to INCREASE more resceptors to absorb the excess chemicals inbetween your brain synapses. thats why we get tolerence.... sigh i dont know what the heck to do im only trying to ask for opinions and also educate people so we all know what is happening to are brains and if its negativley effecting us down the line"
2076,"Uhm I've never done this before so...please bare with me! (TW; Self harm)

Recently everything feels so meaningless or like it's a bad thing. It feels like everything I do will either bite me till I bleed or completely numb me. It feels so surreal. Even a minor problem, such as a pencil breaking or a payment not going through, will either make me go into a frenzy of emotions or just completely numb me out. Its terrifying.

I have no will to go out anymore, socialize anymore. I don't even wanna get out of bed to help me live a normal life (Eg Eating, showering, ect) and it makes it worse. I used to go to one of my friend's about all my problems but I don't want to anymore because we got into a fight about whether this girl which always draws me dirty looks likes me or not. That girl is my best friend's friend. I had written a lengthy post about a thought overload I had, which involved a lot of dark stuff that, quite frankly, should have raised concerned. Yet she sent me a stupid picture of her taken by the girl who draws me dirty looks. All im gonna say is, after the fight I felt extremely toxic and like I barely could trust her with anything anymore. She sent me a picture of said girl of them hanging out, despite me clearly saying that I think she doesn't like me and that I don't want her mentioned in our convos...

And school? not any better. I've lost so many friend's because of a breakup I had and honestly, some of them were really good friends. Ive gone to pastoral care so many times to try and get them to stop a girl who has SH scars on her arms (she has a hoodie and has permission to keep it on, yet she rolls it up despite her knowing that SH is a really bad trigger for me) to try and help me get over it, or to try and reduce risks of me having a breakdown in class. Ive asked three times and have received no response. In one of our classes she rolled up the sleeves and asked me to help her put her bag one and if I didn't, I know she would talk about how rude I am like she usually does. 

I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. I've relapsed so many times over the past few months and I just don't know how much longer I can go without caving in. Any advice, anything positive, just anything at this point giving me pointers as to what to do next. Thank you so much, Sincerely Vinnie."
2077,"I dont see the point of anything. I dont even see why i should live for the good things. I just want to end it at this point. Ive basically forgotten what good feelings even are. And i feel like im fighting a pointless fight now. Living seems absolutely absurd and unbearable. Everyday, id have thoughts like ""whats the point to any of this? Why feel anything?"" and try to go the whole day, or whole week even trying to think the opposite. And now it all appears meaningless. I know many people would miss me if i killed myself and some would be absolutely destroyed like my mother and im so sick of having to stick around just so i dont hurt anyone who cares about me. I know i deserve happiness but i dont even know what that is anymore. I feel like im losing my mind recently. Ive thought about positive emotions so much and trying to make them the reason to live but im grasping at straws now. I dont know what to do. All the things i loved dont make sense to me anymore, i dont feel anything, i keep intellectualizing my feelings, esspesially when i do feel them and i dont know how to stop."
2078,"I don’t have friends. I spend all my free time watching YouTube videos, anime and gaming. I hate my body as I’ve gained weight and feel that my physical abilities are pathetic. Recently having my college classes go online has worsened my isolation. Whenever I try to tell my family about my struggles I am shut down, belittled and dismissed. I don’t want to see a therapist because they are fake and I don’t want to talk to someone just because it’s their job. I feel really bitter and constantly just wish I had been born as someone else and the only way I feel alright is if I forget who I am."
2079,"I feel like I always get so stuck because my motivation and my action can never work together.  I can want to do something so much in my head and just can’t get myself to do it, it’s infuriating and enforced a lot of negative self talk.
Has anyone had success getting over the motivation hump? How do I get myself to participate in the things I want to participate in? 
I feel like I need constant rest to just exist, it’s so hard to do anything. I have been stuck here for years."
2080,I’m so tired of being alive and I have reached a breaking point. I don’t think there’s any reason to keep pushing. I’m planning on ending it and I’m so fucking done. I always postpone this but why? I can’t keep going like this. I’m so done.

2082,"So after a year of taking 10mg of citalopram, i decided that a few of the ongoing side effects i was facing didn't warrant me being on the medication anymore. My general level of happiness has always been somewhat low, but i felt i wanted to tackle this now being medication free and my god...

The first 3 days were fine, no symptoms, felt slightly lower than usual, day 4 i felt a weird headache which i just could not shift accompanied by some dizziness.

Day 5 has been hell. I've felt a constant feeling of dizziness and my anxiety has creeped back as well as feel constantly tired and drained. As 10mg was such a low does i thought it would be a doddle compared to some of the other horror stories i've heard but heck this feels bad. How long does this typically last? I really don't feel like i can carry on going to work right now whilst going through this!"
2083,"So last night I didnt sleep and I feel euphroic full of energy and a zest for life.
but I know this wont last as I usually come down with a bump, my voices will get worse and so depression sets in, this is some sort of cycle I get in some times are worse than others, and my down time is usualy longer than my up time. Do any of you feel the same or get this euphoric state before crashing???"
2084,"She is convinced there is a god.

I am convinced i am crushing on her

And i told her

And she was like aww that means a lot

My mind is left in the gutter

I told her my feelings about her and her response was to call me.


Perhaps my life is not such shit

But my mind is in the gutter where i left my previous lovers


I find i am just glad to have her as a friend.

I am an atheist convinced there is no god.

She is convinced god has a plan for us all

I am like fuck the godamn plan"
2085,"Today I came close to ending my life, I managed to stop myself though. I have been able to stay on the surface and control my thoughts for the last 10 years, but today I just fell through. I´m turning 30 soon. I have been trying so hard to get by, day by day, faking every social interaction for so long, and all my attempts to make my life better and break through have been a failure, all because of this crippling disease, or whatever it is. I have been bursting to tears the last couple of days... I really want to live, I want to live so much but I cant. I cant pull through in my attempts to sort out my life. I recently lost an opportunity for a relationship with a wonderful woman, this too went down the drain because of my hollowness and insecurity, I can´t be open with people, I have to hide the depression, it makes me nervous that they´ll see through me. I can fake social interactions for a couple of hours, but soon enough people start to see through it, the hollow part of me, that doesn´t project any joy or happiness out in the world, insecure and no confidence, it´s just awful... nobody wants to be around a person like that. Everyone turns stiff and uncomfortable around me, even a part of myself, it´s as if the depression is another person inside me that I´m constantly trying to keep from taking control, it´s so obvious and clear, has it´s own identity... if I could just get rid of it I would be normal functioning human being. This loneliness is the worst part, I have been lonely all my life. The depression is heavily fueled by this. How am I supposed to even overcome this if I can´t make friends or have a relationship because the depression is fueled by loneliness? It´s a vicious circle of negativity that synergises. It´s not Autism, or Asperger, I have done tests. I was thinking about going to therapy but I have enough self-awareness to have a conversation with myself. It´s just so hopeless. Can´t even get proper sleep because of horrible nightmares, waking up soaking wet. I´m worried about tomorrow... right now I´m feeling ok, but I´m worried about feeling like I did earlier in the day, that it´s going to come back, I´ve never felt so much despair at once. I believe the fact that I blew the relationship with this women made me realize certain things about myself, the fact that this is going to be the rest of my life, I can´t endure that."
2086,"I am on the schizo spectrum. So Often I feel the need to kill myself. I am in an accelerated BSN program. I feel like I do not belong there with my condition., and if I don't belong suicide is the best option. I am getting 4 Bs and an A but I feel like that is not enough like suicide is preferable to this pain.

The anti psychotics are really  controlling the voice in my head very well, but the anti depressants seem not to be working as I still feel like killing myself.

I just restarted therapy like 3 weeks ago, and I know it may take 4-5 weeks for the drugs to take full effect, but I still fee like fucking dying.

By the way I have no plan or intention to kill myself its just that suicidal ideation is a constant in my life, and I wish it wasn't.

I have no intention of doing so but my feelings cannot be controlled and i wake up every day and ask who wants to kill me today."
2087,"Hey!
I’ve been going to theraphy or something like that for few months because at my school I went to the school psychologist because I was feeling not well and I selfharmed. 
Today I had a consultation with a psychologist (usually deal with nurses who are specialized in mental health) and she offered me a medication for my unwellness. I’m just wondering if I should take it. Sometimes when I feel really bad I selfharm and I would like to get rid of the havit but I don’t know would the medication help. I think it’s like SRRI antidepressant but my dad has the prescription for it so I don’t know the exact.
The psychologist said that it would help to lessen the peaks of my anxiety and unwellness but I don’t know if it’s worth it.
I don’t have a diagnosis for anything (at least yet) but she was talking about depression reaction when I told about my symptoms.
Can someone please help or maybe share their opinion in this?"
2088,i was on celexa and effexor for 10 years which entirley stopped working. i tried zoloft which didnt work and now lexapro is not helping either. i dont know why ssri's helped me before but it seems no matter which one my body isnt making use of it. blood tests say im fine but im not. is it possable that i have been misdiagnosed? what if im actually bi polar and ive got wrong treatment all these years? antidepressants made me feel somewhat more happy and calm but i still had this careless kind of impsulive and offensive personality! which leads me to beleive maybe i should try a mood stabalizer instead? please any ideas besides diet and exercise?

2090,"Hi,

I'm a newby on the forum, but an old timer regarding depression.

Many of you will know that about a year ago, the Americans licenced a form of the drug ketamine for use as an antidepressant. Ketamine has been in use for a long time as a powerful sedative for severe injuries. The trade name of the product licenced for depression is Esketamine.

In November of last year, the EU followed the US and approved Esketamine for depression. However, for any drug to be used by the NHS, it has to be approved by the UK NICE agency, and come January 2020, NICE rejected the use of Esketamine in the NHS.

Before making this post I did look to see if this has been discussed previously on this forum, but could not find a reference to it.

As far as I can tell, this decision was made without anyone questioning it or raising any objection. I wrote to my MP in January - still don't have a reply. Am I the only person who is bothered about this? Surely, the many people suffering with depression in the UK should be raising hell over this?

2091,"Over the past few weeks I was starting to feel more like my old self. I've been fishing, getting some excercise on my bicycle, sleeping better, etc. Then out of nowhere I start to feel anxious and just not feeling like myself is flaring up. Hopefully things improve again."
2092,"One thing I notice about my depression, (well, I only really notice it after I've recovered from a period of depression), is how music has minimal effect/impact on me when I'm in that low state.

2093,"On the outside looking in, you would think we have the dream life, the dream marriage. And on the surface, we do. Everything is almost impeccably perfect, unless you were the four walls we live in. I can’t talk to anyone about it because it goes against my morals of being a good wife. I feel like I am breaking some ancient rule that abides trust and confidentiality in a marriage. Even talking to you about it, it feels like a dream I have where I’m naked in a crowded room and everyone is staring at me.

Let’s just get to it already.

My husband has depression. It comes in waves. He will be good for a month or so and then bam, the smallest thing will happen and he is ruined and overtaken by it. Literally, the smallest thing. Stubbing your toe, buying the wrong size screw for a project, getting soaked in the rain, spilling water on the floor, whatever it is, it’s always so minuscule how it sneaks back into our life. During his good time, I almost forget that he has depression or I think that we conquered it for good.

Truth is, I had depression from the age of 13 to my early 20’s. I know exactly what it’s like. Therapists, pills, suicidal thoughts, hopelessness and nothing to pinpoint exactly where the demon is hiding. Call me lucky, but I found a way out. I couldn’t even tell you how if I wanted to. It was after taking Lexapro for a good time and seeing a dark shadow ready to take me after I had my pills spread out in front of me with a glass of water in hand.

I get it.

But I also realized that every depression is so different and what worked for me, doesn’t necessarily work for him. He finally saw a therapist after years of trying to persuade him. He actually enjoyed the visit, but it was during the time where he was on a high. He already wants to quit now that his demon is back. He somehow forgot how beneficial and helpful the first visit was and how we talked about it for hours on the things she pinpointed and the tips she gave him.

I named his demon. I needed to because I was so tired of thinking of my husband as this depressed, sad, moody and sometimes mean person. I married this man who was romantic, happy, witty, loving, faithful, ever-so-forgiving, and strong. Just a whole-hearted good man. To everyone. I knew of his demon when I married him, of course. But it’s grown and gotten bigger since marrying.

I think it really sunk in over 2 years ago when the demon got the best of him. He dropped the open box of cereal one night and cereal fell onto the flooring and it just overtook him. He got so upset after having one of those testing days (where nothing goes right) and just crashed. He slammed, he yelled and he threw everything in sight and ripped off the back door. 

Guess who cleaned it up? Me. Because he needed to cool off. I will say, since then, he has not ever done something like that again. I also should clarify he would never hurt me and I’m not scared of him. I swear. His demon is his alone and it never crosses that line.

It’s never gotten that bad since, but it has gotten worse emotionally and mentally for him. I remember him trying Lexapro after that. It was great, but he stopped as quickly as he started. He said it made him feel numb.

Since then, we had a beautiful perfect baby together. Things were really good while I was pregnant. We were back on this high. After the birth of our son, we realized how hard a newborn is. With lack of sleep and re-routing your routine, it made it easier for his demon to find a weak spot to enter back in. I will say, he is the best father out there. He is hands on and he might have possibly changed more diapers than me. The work was 50/50 and I never seen his depression fail our son. It was hard on our marriage though, till we got into a better routine. All the hard times of a newborn have since faded and we are trying again for baby number two. Although, sometimes I wonder if we should.

I guess I’m realizing how hard it is to summarize my marriage with him. I want you to know the man he is. I don’t want judgement of him. He is a good man. His demon is not. I feel like I’m a good wife. His demon doesn’t make me feel that way though. I leave love notes in random places to bring a smile, I draw a bath and light a candle for him on those tough days, I do the dishes so he doesn’t have to, I let him sleep in when he needs it, I make sure the house is tidy even with a 13 month old, I overly use the word “sorry” and I take the blame a lot, I surprise him with gifts and a 10 minute massage before we go to bed. I try to be the best supporter, but it’s gotten to me.

I swear he is a good husband and the best father ever. He does just as much for me as I do for him. He is perfect when the demon isn’t around. But when he is around, he isn’t himself. He is finger-pointing mean person. It’s always my fault.

My problem isn’t my husband, it’s the demon.

Without giving too much away, he also is a firefighter and has seen some of the worse things in life. With that, he drinks. I hate to say those things because I feel like I’m bad talking him, but I need to paint the whole picture. He was married before me and she cheated on him with another firefighter that he knew. She wasn’t supportive of his depression and I think it got to her after so long. They were together 10 years. It’s something I’m reminded of constantly, how “women tend to cheat before men ever do”. It’s insulting to me when he says that. I feel like he doesn’t know me and he thinks I’m going to become like his ex-wife.

Anyways, I’ll pause for now. I could really go on and on about it, but who is really listening?"
2094,"I have so many good things in my life,
a great wife, lovely kids, a nice home, 
good friends, yet I’m still sad ! Surely this is stupidity rather than depression? why am I not satisfied, content and happy at this moment in time. I don’t deserve to be here, there are many others in worse situations than me. I am therefore stupid and an idiot. Need to get myself out of this mess and quick !"
2095,"I think I'm reaching rock bottom of my depression. I'm trying to think back to where it began. I've had other depressive episodes in my life, but this one just seems so much darker and harder. Maybe it's because I don't remember how bad things were, or maybe this is just my worst time period. I guess around the time if began was after I had my baby. This was actually my most amazing point in life, but I struggled with my boyfriend (the father) to get support and help with our baby. He was the one working and he believed I should essentially be fully responsible of all care of our son. Getting a break or assistance required begging, arguing, I was always made to feel like a bad mom for needing help. Sometimes he'd help, but make comments like ""maybe you just can't handle being a mother"" or ""youre tired of being around your own child"" or whatever and those words cut deep and I began to feel that way. I began to feel like I should be able to handle this on my own and I'm lesser for needing help. So every time I did become too tired, too hungry, too stressed I beat myself up for being a weak mother and not being able to handle it. I was still overall happy, but the issues lingered. Over time with the lack of help and with the stemming relationship problems which caused arguments and that lead to tension and that tension lead to more unrelated arguments until my boyfriend and I were just on thin ice 24/7and arguing very often. I feel trapped. He pays the bills and makes the money and work hard and I feel like I can't do my one job without getting overwhelmed. I've still always maintained a great relationship with my baby. Never gotten frustrated towards him, always managed my stresses well around him. But lately I've become so anxious and depressed that it's hard to get up every day and be a mom and handle the occasional crying fits. I have intrusive thoughts and minor things make think ""did I brush my baby's teeth long enough, what if he gets a cavity because I didn't and I'm a terrible mother, what if he has to get sent work because of me, why can't I do anything right, he's going to grow up and resent me for being a useless mother, I'm too young, he'd be better off with any other mother""  I'm still patient with my baby, but I'm beginning to become detached. I'm emotionally isolating myself and emotionally exhausting myself to the point where I don't want to socially interact. This feeling makes me feel like even worse ofa mother, I begin to feel guilty and my anxiety gets worse and worse until I swallow myself whole. And I have no one to talk to, no support, I feel so alone like nothing but a burden. And this is a cry for attention I guess as some people might call it that. I'm desperate for a little support or sympathy. I'm losing a battle with my mind all alone and I need to keep myself together for my little one"

2100,"Hi all,

I'm interested in your experiences of Risperidone. Has it caused tiredness, lethargy and depression?

Following a long psychotic episode, I've been taking 3mg of Risperidone daily - my pyschosis has gone, but I feel incredibly flat, really tired and my depression seems to have worsened despite taking an antidepressant daily also. 

Before taking Risperidone I ran about 30 - 40 miles a week, now i find it hard to find the motivation to walk up the shop. Additionally, I just can't seem to find the will to do anything and I just want lounge on the couch all day.

I want to stop the Risperidone because I feel like all the life has been sucked out of me, but I'm terribly fearful of the psychosis returning. I've been told i have to stay on the drug for a year but I just want to feel like me again. I start a temporary job on the 3rd January for three days a week and I'm worrying how on earth I'm going to manage the awful side effects from the drug.

I've read from non medical sources that Risperidone causes a reduction in dopamine in the brain, which might account for these symptoms, and i also read it is a depressant. As I say, it has cleared up my pyschosis, but I am fearful of a recurrence if I stop taking it.

Has anyone experienced similar?

My official diagnosis is Paranoid Schizophrenia by the way."
2101,"Hi there,
I'm struggling with my family today.  There's a high school graduation for a relative a plane ride away coming up.  I don't want to go.  I don't want to travel this year with the new virus out, and I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a 3 day trip.  I expressed this to my family, and said that I would rather visit later when I could come for a couple weeks and have a longer visit with everyone on that side of the family, and avoid the risks with traveling right now just as a precautionary measure.  I let my graduating family member know that I will send a gift of congratulations to ensure her that I do recognize this milestone accomplishment in her life, and that I do care.
It feels like I'm getting some flack for saying I'm not coming to this event, and it feels like my family is trying to override my own decisions for myself and manipulate me into doing what they want.  It feels like they just want what they want, and don't recognize my choices as me doing what's best for my health or my finances.  Sometimes it seems like they think only their way is right, and I have to fight them and deal with the mess because I stood up for my own needs.
Any thoughts anybody?  Struggles with family members is emotionally hard and I don't want to fight or be dislikes/unloved by them, ya know?"

2109,"Just over a year ago I moved from my home town to a big city (it's not that far away, about 4 hour train / 1 hour flight). 

it's been quite a big adjustment to be honest, and because this was my first proper job it feels like a lot was happening at once; responsibilities, career, new city, EXTREMELY expensive rent etc. Last year I was quite miserable and was going home a lot.

Now that things are better, I feel like my family and some friends back home are constantly guilt-tripping me if I'm not wanting to come home as much. I know that this sounds really trivial, but it's really starting to bother me. 

I make quite a big effort to stay in touch with my family/friends back home on WhatsApp, Skype etc... and even though I'm not going home as much as last year, I still go home pretty regularly: I was home over Christmas, was back home at end of January and will be home at easter. But it just feels like it's never enough, and I don't really feel like they appreciate the effort I'm making. The city I've moved to is notorious for being very lonely at times and difficult, and I feel like I really need to put the effort in here to make a life for myself, maintain friends and have a good social life and I can't do that if I'm constantly going back home all the time."

One of them tells me what I say is wrong, I need to do this etc etc. which is an approach I don't particularly like. She's trying to help but she doesn't understand at all. I've been wondering ever since if she's not giving me the support I need or if I'm being too stubborn and need to listen to her. 

I know these things:
-No one can give you all the support you need
-I am responsible for my mental health and my life
-People can't ever understand your experience fully because they are different

I think whenever I've reached out in the past people tend to tell me I'm wrong and it's my fault. At this stage on my life where my depression is at its worst, I think I just need some kindness, some at least trying to understand and definitely someone to listen and not judge.

She said she doesn't want to tell me what I want to hear. That is good because I want honesty but can that be done without meeting everything I say with an opposing opinion? Am I asking too much of people?  I'm trying to get some clarity, so anyone who is also going through depression might be able to give some wisdom? Sorry for the ramble, hope it makes sense!"

2112,"Hello,

So to put things simply, I am a man and I fell in love with a lesbian.

We work together and first met around a year ago. I was in a relationship at the time for almost five years, as was she. We very quickly became good friends as we both seem to have a lot in common. I had been unhappy in my relationship for a long time, and wasn't sure that I ever loved my girlfriend and often felt as if I was just settling. 

We started to see each other out of work and spoke a lot about everything. A couple of months down the line, she split up with her girlfriend as she felt the relationship was lacking and started to pursue someone else. As my feelings began to develop for her, I began to question my own relationship which really put a strain on my mental health. I felt guilty as although I don't feel I was in love with my girlfriend, I didn't want to hurt her feelings. But I felt that I couldn't carry on with her, knowing that I could develop feelings for someone else so easily. 

We continued to spend time together outside of work, and it often felt like there was something unsaid between us. We'd spend evenings together, share a drink, share a cigarette and have sleepovers. Around July time, my mental health deteriorated further. I'd find myself constantly breaking down, both at work and at home, longing for this girl. My girlfriend and I were about to move in together, and it was at this point I felt like I couldn't carry on the relationship any further. I told her how I felt about my friend, and I began seeing a therapist to try and work things out. As you can imagine, we broke up soon after.

I continued seeing a therapist and also saw my GP and began taking antidepressants. My relationship with my colleague became stronger. We shared our problems together, spent more time seeing one another. People at work would often assume that we were together. She eventually broke up with the girl she began seeing after her breakup with her long term partner. The two of us went on holiday together in December, shared a bed, but nothing ever happened. It was the happiest I'd been in a long time, but it had serious consequences for my mental health. When we got back, I hit the bottle every night for about 3 weeks. I'd often wake up in the mornings still drunk from the night before, despite working that day. I couldn't hold my feelings in any more, and had to come clean.

I spoke to her one day after work and told her how I felt. I was worried how she would take it, but fortunately was very understanding. She told me that she loved me, but had been in relationships with men before and it had never worked out, and that she was gay and that's who she was. She said she didn't want our friendship to end, as we'd become so close and she didn't know who she would talk to about her own mental health - we'd been through a lot together.

The drinking continued, and one night after a lot of whisky, I attempted to end my life. I don't know whether or not this was the alcohol making the decisions or myself. I'd just become so fed up of hurting for so long. I spoke to my friends about this night, and I also told her. I didn't tell her she was the reason I felt this way. Our relationship continued as it did before, and we've never really spoke about my true feelings for her since then. We spent NYE together, and again shared a bed. That night seriously made me evaluate my life. I took drugs and I knew I had to stop drinking.

Since then, I haven't touched any alcohol, and I'm continuing on the antidepressants and with therapy. But I don't feel any better. I get in from work, chain smoke and just feel miserable. Occasionally the dark thoughts still creep in. We're planning on going away together soon, and I'm not sure if it's a good idea. I feel like distancing myself from her is the only way to curb my romantic feelings for her. But I don't want to damage our relationship as we've become so close. We care about one another so much and I don't want to lose her, but I'm not sure how to go on feeling the way I do.

Has anyone else been a similar situation, and how did you deal with it?

Sorry for the essay."
2113,"I do not have depression. Or maybe I have high-functioning depression. I am fine during my day, I can go to school, get things done, feel good around my friends. The second I get home, I just fall into myself. I can't get my work done, I can't workout anymore, I prefer to just go to my room and sleep till 7 or 8 when I then wake up to eat something. Is this something that can be helped? Is this even an issue?"
2114,"Hi! I'm a 27 years old guy from Hungary. I'm shy, introverted, I'm afraid to go to new places, meeting new people so much so, that I spend most of my day at home. I never had a girlfriend, I didn't even had my first kiss. I don't have any idea what to do with my life, I don't have plans, I just feel hopeless at this point. I was a very open, cheerful, energetic kid, but my parents didn't have too much money, so I was rejected by my classmates. I was also ridiculed because of my height: I was always short, I'm still just 165 cm. I was/am very skinny. Even though people say I'm good looking, I don't believe them. When I look into the mirror I only see things I don't like. All of these thing lead to me beign alone in my entire childhood, save for a very few close friends. Through puberty I turned into a silent, introverted person. I watch my friends on facebook have relationships, families, good jobs, and I look at my life and I feel terrible. I'm on medication for a year now (Citalopram) and it helps a bit, but not in a big way. I don't have suicidal thoughts, I will never resort to that level, but I don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to be happy, I want to feel normal. This, what I wrote, is just the surface, and I can't put into words, what I feel, but I hope it will suffice."

2116,"I'm starting to understand why people going through there own battles don't talk to people about it.

For quite some time now I've been battling with my own issues but over the last year I've been struggling more and never really talked about how I feel on a day to day bases to any of my close friends or patner about them. Yeah they know I deal with anxiety/depression but they just let me get on with it which makes me feel alone alot of the time.
So this year I sat down with my partner and tried to talk to her about it and how I want to try and get some help with it and would like to try and talk to her about it a bit more.
Nothing to in depth just how I at times feel like I don't have anyone to talk to but would really like to work on things.

2121,"Hello,

As I made my introduction post, which I will post link of below, I wrote that I am struggling with a lot of mental illnesses diagnosed by doctors, one being depression.
This one is consuming me everyday. I lost all interest in my hobbies and literally doing anything. If I try to draw and it looks bad or it gets bad criticism, I breakdown and then I shut down. Same with gaming. If I do bad at games, I shut down. My husband isn't really the best with handling my depression and actually gets extremely mad at me when I cry. To add, as I also said on my introduction.... I am unmedicated due to lack of insurance now, but also my husband being against me taking medicine due to what he was taught is his school about how it can ruin your organs. It gets to me because I bottle everything up and then explode and shut down for hours and hours. I feel like I have no one. My family doesn't even respond to my messages much or when they do, they tell me how wonderful they are doing and do not really acknowledge me.
My husband is a great man and I love him. We do have cultural differences as he is from Trinidad and Tobago and I am from the states. Depression is very taboo in his country and they do not really care too much for the mentally ill in Trinidad from what he told me as the majority of homeless people are actually very mentally ill and not receiving care because lack of care. One of the biggest things that is seriously making me contemplate doing something stupid is my parents (my father and my step mom). They are being so HORRIBLE to my husband due to one lame joke he told to my sister and refuse to acknowledge him even though he and his family has really done more for me than they have done. Like this joke was stupid, but not to the point to shun someone who helps their daughter so much.
The joke: My sister asked my husband who was my boyfriend at the time (We were LDR at the moment and speaking through skype) if she could have a minute with me to straighten my hair and he said 
""I will, but you must let me see her(my) tits afterwards.""
That was the joke. She went and told my father, then everything just blew up. It was stupid. I wasn't underaged either if that is what you'd first assume when seeing that because it would be understandable if I was underaged or something like that. I was 21 and he was 26. I am about to be 25 now. My sister is beyond a troublemaker and even tried to flash my husband while we were all on skype together on different computers and didn't think I could even see it due to playing a game, but I did. All I could think of for her starting this was due to her anger of his rejection because he was really upset when she did that.
Anyways...
While staying in the states with my real mother, my step mother tried every possible thing for me to leave my husband while we were engaged that is unreal. She even had the balls to say that all Trinidadians molest their children and that he will molest my children, which is BEYOND horrible and is quite prejudice to me. She even tried to emotional black mail me by telling my brothers are not allowed to meet him. Remember, this is over a stupid joke. This joke was not racist, prejudice, hateful, nor anything of the sort. To add on, my step mother is a therapist and she is acting like this to me. My husband is a bit insensitive to my depression because I am literally the only person who he has experienced with depression. My husband has even sent apologies to both my father and my step mom so they could get along, but they just blocked him. I get so damn depressed because this man has taken me out of an dysfunctional environment and saved me from myself. I literally was to the extent of taking a route that no one didn't want me to take. I planned everything out and here comes this man who made me want to demolish those plans. I literally was doing absolutely nothing in my life as well and he gave me motivation to do the things that I needed to do.
I literally sit here and shut myself down over this. I love my brothers so much and they will never meet the man I love so much. It makes me beyond depressed. It's to the point where I feel like if they really don't want my husband in their life, it will be very difficult for them to have their grandchildren in their life. They are probably the biggest thing that makes me so depressed right now other than my PTSD. 
My mom's side accepts him. The only issue is my dad's side.
What should I do? I really am thinking that if my parents (dad's side) cannot accept my husband and just treat him like human, then would it be best to just not have them be in our children's life because I really don't want my future children seeing them treat him like he does not exist.
 
(And yes, I know my husband needs to learn more about depression which would be a good reason why for him and my dad's side to contact each other due to them knowing more about my mental health as they were the ones who got me to doctors to get me diagnosed with my issues and when I return to the states, no matter what anyone tells me and when I get insurance, I AM GETTING BACK ON MEDICINE.)"
2122,"i never thought i would be on here in a online discussion group. im not very good at expressing myself in writing but with how severe my depression has got i just really needed to vent since i have no support system(ie family and friends). i apologize in advice for the bad grammar and if i ramble on. im not sure where to start. i have suffered with depression pretty much my whole life. growing up i always felt alone. my mom was very unloving cold, stern. i always felt i had to try harder to fit in school. pretend to be who i wasn't to have a chance of having nay friends. that feeling pretty much carried with me throughout my whole life. because of the loneliness and isolation i resorted to unhealthy habits to deal with the pain.

i always wanted to feel normal. to have a normal life. 3 years ago i thought i would have that opportunity. i meet the person who i thought would be my life partner. me and her clicked on so many different levels. she really seemed to understand me and loved me for my flaws and all. to cut a long story short my personal demons got in the way and caused me to sabotage the relationship. my jealousy, control and total fear of failure caused our fights to get out of hand and even physical. it was like a demon had taken possession of me. ive never been the type to react in any way with anger. when i was younger i would always run away and stay away until i was calm. but she had a way with words that would trigger something in me. i tried to leave the relationship but she asked me to stay every time and the good times we had kept me in the relationship.

we eventually got engaged and it started to feel like i had everything i ever wanted. i felt i had someone that was always going to stick by my side always. she would always tell me she would never leave me and made me believe it. eventually the fights died down and it seemed like we were going stronger. to cut a long story short again my demons just kept coming back in small ways then one day she up and left me.

this has made my life long struggle with depression even more overwhelming. i just want to die. im to afraid of pain to do it myself but i go to sleep every night hoping to not wake up the next day. i feel so worthless. i can't believe my one shot of a normal life i fucked up so bad :(. if i had known in the midst of the toxicity i would've got help or did anything to save the relationship. she gave me a purpose and a reason to get out of bed in the morning. now im back all alone. i have tried therapy and while it's nice to have a compassionate person to vent to. i know my life has no purpose and i don't want to go on. im a failure and im just tired of living with this pain :(."
2123,ive been having alot of shortness of breath for over a year and ive been trying to figure out the issue. i am 33 and 200 pounds 5'9. i cant go up stairs or exercise or even walk without laboured breathing. even at rest i have laboured breathing and i find it difficult to breathe as well when i sit or lay down. standing is most comfortable. i did a lung test to rule out asthma i get the results in a few days but man i was lightheaded during the test with all the breathing exercises they had me do. 2 hours later im still huffin and puffin from the test. i do have anxiety and depression but i think something more is going on. if anyone can ask some questions or shed some light on possable ideas thank you!
2124,"Does anyone take these? 
I was on sertraline for 12 months, but still having bad anxiety and panic attacks, also terrible insomnia. But I was stable (ish) and could, in the main, cope.
After telling my GP about the panic/anxiety and insomnia he's put me on 15mg mirtazapine. 2 weeks lower dose sertraline then on the new meds. It's only been a few days but crikey, am I angry! I feel like I want to seriously punch someone, so tense and wound up, also sleeping heavily with wild vibrant dreams.
I know I have to give them time but I'm all over the place yet again. Makes me sad. 
Anyone have any positive experiences on this?

2125,"Not sure where to post this but I really need some advice this is stressing me out I'm not sure how to handle the situation. 

Last year  my mother and I babysat our neighbor's 9 year daughter. after she got off the bus she would come here. In exchange her dad would take us to the store. No big deal. I didn't see any problems with it.

Well now I have a car, I don't need rides. And the girls Aunt moved in so the kid doesn't need  a babysitter any more. But the kid still want to come over and play and hang out. Almost every day. She has become very clingy doesn't respect personal space , last time she was here she basically tried to sit in my lap. I told her to stop and got up and left the room. 

 her dad and her Aunt don't see any problems with her coming over. 
I was walking her home and one neighbor accused me of trying to touch her butt. Which I would never do 

  even though we are never alone together my mother is always in the living room with us and the front door is always open.  nothing stops her from saying I tried to do something. And that scares me. Plus  It's not normal that a 10 year old girl want to hangout with a 34 guy and his 70 old old mother.

2132,"Hi, so here’s the thing. In 2019 I was struggling with anorexia. I’m not exactly sure why I got it, but I got it shortly after my boyfriend and I broke up. Anyway, it didn’t last for long because after three or four months I realized I’d lost a lot of weight and somehow I made myself eat more. After a few months I went to a club with my friends and we were drinking. That night I drank a lot and got very drunk. Eventually I got so drunk I started vomiting and I passed out. The next morning I woke up in a hospital and my mom told me I was in a life-threatening situation because of alcohol intoxication. It was all unreal to me because I didn’t remember anything. I only remembered waking up and I was vomiting. I was REALLY scared because I have a fear of vomiting. My friend told me everything that had happened because the whole night was totally blurry. After some time I noticed I’d started binge eating. It was rare at the beginning, but as the time went on, my overeating began to occur more and more frequently. Today is almost 6 months since I’ve first noticed the symptoms of binge eating disorder. I think that maybe it started because of the alcohol intoxication that night, but I really don’t know. I tried talking to my parents a million times, but they don’t understand me at all. They think my overeating is a matter of willpower, but it’s far more complexed than that. I always tell myself that I’ll start eating healthy, but I just think it’s not food that is the problem, but my repressed “trauma” of that night. I feel helpless and hopeless and I really don’t know what to do anymore."

2137,"This is my first proper post here.

I discovered this forum after doing diffrent google searches to try and help me with the issues I'm going through.

I struggle to put my thought down so i hope what i write all makes sense.

To be honest I dont really know where to start.

I am the eldest (43 now) in a family of 4 boys. We grew up together on a farm with my mum and dad.

From a very early age I struggled to have any kind of relationship with my dad. Although he was rarely physically aggressive to me, he seemed to have a grip on me mentality. Any kind of interests that I had or friends that I had were constantly a source of amusement to him. He would degreade everything or anything that I tried to do, be any toys i played with or TV shows i tried to watch, or jobs I tried to do to help around the house or farm. Everything to him was a source of amusement. 

Because of this, my confidence all throughout my life has been severely affected. I didnt pursue my choice of career when younger, I lost contact with all friends that I once had, I find it extremely difficult to mix when in social situations etc.

In 1999 out of pure spite, he fired me from the family farm, telling me that I was to go out and find a job and that my younger brother would be taking my place. I was absolutely heartbroken and it just proved to me that this man thought absolutely nothing of me.

However little did i know, that he'd actually done me a favor. As I went out and found a job at a local supermarket.  And it was at that job that I found wife. We got married in 2002 and have 4 wonderful children. 

Unfortunately my joy was to be short lived as in2003 I lost my mother to leukaemia. She was absolute rock and the one person in my life that I felt I could always turn to.

Since she has died my dad has plodded in being his same old self. Before my mum died he swore to her that he would do anything to support us, but he has done anything but! Infact he has found a new woman who he treats far better than he ever did my own mother and the only thing he shows support for is the farm and my younger brother.

Hes had 2 direct grandchildren and 2 step grandchildren from me and as much as I have tried, he knows absolutely nothing about them.


To be honest I dont know what I expect to gain from writing any of this. Maybe I just want somewhere to vent, i dont. I could go on and on but i just dont have the time.

All i know is that as much as i have a family that i love very very much, i just find life getting me down. I lack motivation and confidence. And it shows when you walk into the house that my wife and I are trying to do up (we took on a barn conversion).

I've tried counselling several time but got nothing from it, pretty much due to the fact that I have no idea how to explain what I'm going through.

Perhaps theres nothing wrong with me, I dont know, i really dont"
2138,"Antidepressants have saved my life twice, once when I was a teenager and again last year, after I had weaned off my medication for a little over a year.
I am hearing a great deal of research and hearing a lot of talk saying that medication for mental disorders either dont work or ultimately cause more problems longterm than they solve short term.
I am tired of sorting through medication after medication in search of a good fit. I am scared that it's not even the right direction to take with my mental health. Last year there was no other option available to me; I couldn't get out of bed, therapy and a variety of wellness methods were ineffective.

2140,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been posting almost exclusively on the Self Harm forum, as it tends to be the thing I struggle with the most. I have a terrible anxiety disorder (panic?) which leads to the SH. But I also deal with extreme lows or bouts of depression. I see both an MD managing my meds, which has helped significantly, and a therapist whom I’m not 100% is right for me, but has led to some decent progression in my understanding.

The reason I’m writing today is to ask a question about something I find myself doing “occasionally” (one or twice a month - 3 times at most). That something I’m doing is finding myself acting out a “MOCK” suicide, without intention of actually acting in that thought. Clearly I’ll not go into detail, but the way I’m doing so is 100% safe - never hurt myself during these episodes nor is it during my anxiety/ panic attacks.

Is this “normal” behavior? If I were to tell my MD would I suddenly find myself confronted by a Safety Assessment Team / test? I’m absolutely NOT going to bring this up unless I’m completely certain I can’t be held for evaluation or that due to its “suicidal” nature the doctor will have reasonable reason to break my Doctor/Patient Confidentiality.
Many thanks for any thoughts or opinions.
Kind regards. W."

2142,"Hi, 

I just turned 30 last week. Im working as a call center agent. I met a girl at work. She is in her early 20's but she already has 2 kids. We started chatting and we established that we like each other. Our relationship was not confirmed yet because I did not court her. I just felt so sure with her since I feel that we are already dating. She told me details about her previous relationship. She said that the father of her children cheated on her twice and that they are no longer communicating. I felt relieved and sure that this is going to be the one and almost sure that she's ready for another relationship. We continued dating, until recently her ""ex"" started chatting me saying that he will propose to her. I wasnt worried because I am sure that she is committed into me. Then she starts saying that we should stop because she is judged by her parents knowing that she is seeing another guy. I finally was able to tell her that I love her and I want her to be my girlfriend. I was rejected. When her ""ex"" proposed to her she said yes and I am devastated. Now I feel that I am left hanging. She is now happy with her fiance, but dont get me wrong. I am happy for her. Im just feeling down because i have no one to fall back to. Now I feel empty and depressed. I dont like to do the things like I used toike before. My primary self medication is alcohol. My cigarette addiction also worsened. I feel like im in a downward spiral and cant move on.

Thanks,
Kyle"
2143,"I’ll start by apologizing first. I don’t mean for this post to get long but in case it does, I’m sorry. I just needed somewhere to get my thoughts out and someone to talk to who might actually be willing to listen.

I am feeling so lost and alone lately. What concerns me more is that I’m feeling lonely while married and also having my family check in on me. I just feel like they don’t truly know how I feel or think and what I’m still going through.

I suffer from depression and being Bipolar. Last year, I even tried ending my life. I’m thankful that I didn’t and that I got help with new medication and therapy but I can’t get rid of the thoughts dominating me almost every day.

I love my wife and want to work through all our struggles. However, our relationship has not been the same for years and I feel we’re no longer the same people we used to be. It’s hard for me to see what we still have in common other than being parents to our son.

Her and I both grew up with divorced parents and neither of us ever wanted to place our own children in that situation. I still feel this way. I don’t know right now how to feel when the affections between my wife and I aren’t there anymore. It seems that after I got out of the hospital last fall, no one treats me as if something happened. Even my own family treats me as if I’m wounded or injured but as if nothing happened to cause it.

Outside of my wife, parents and sister, I really don’t have any friends. In fact, keeping friends was always hard for me as I kept moving back and forth between parents growing up. I’ve only kept in touch with one person from high school, a girl who I’ve known since 6th grade (now more than 25 years).

The other day, she got ahold of me to inform me that our 20th high school reunion is coming up this summer. I haven’t even been back to my old hometown in 8 years. I also never went to any other reunions. Now, I’m tempted to go back because my only friend from high school moved back there 3 years ago and she asked that I be there this time for the reunion.

Im ashamed of myself. I have nothing special to show my classmates or my old friend of my life. Yes, I have a family that I care for but personally, nothing to prove that I did something with my life.

Since I left home, all my attempts at getting an education or keeping a career has been foiled by me allowing my mental illness to take control and letting it ruin things. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere and that people don’t understand me anymore. I’m not who they think I am or want me to be. Even I am starting to not recognize who I am.

So, like I said, sorry for ranting. I do find it easier to write than to talk and needed to get this out somehow. So, if you read this, thanks for listening. Hopefully, I can find some comfort soon."
2144,"Hello! 

I've been reading a lot of threads on this forum and it seems like a bunch of members are very experienced. I wanted to know if anyone who takes medication for their depression has been prescribed scary meds like I have. I take normal antidepressants but I also should be taking pills that supposedly will help with my suicidal thoughts and make me more ""menagable""(that's what my psychiatrist said). The thing is it's meant to be used to help sufferers of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Plus the side effects are kind of terrifying, but that's not a surprise. I just wanted to know if anybody has had any similar medication to mine. 
Thank you to anyone who responds!"
2145,"I just want to get some insight or something. Or vent. I don't know, I just had a really bad day yesterday. Today is a little better.

I was raised catholic and used to have this wonderful outlook on life. I thought that good things would happen to those who believed in good. But man catholic school was terrible. I was pretty scrawny growing up, and being in a school of maybe 60 people, it made me pretty easy to get picked on for the first 8 years of school. Every day was a fucking struggle wondering why these kids acted this way. What was wrong with me. Everything was internalized, and I didn't have anyone to talk to. My dad continually told me to stop being a pussy and fight back. I tried to do what he said one day, and I tried to punch this one kid that was the source of most of the bullying. But every punch he just laughed at me. That was when I realized I couldn't fight, and never picked a fight again. I remember another time i kissed a female for the first time, and was made fun of for it. Apparently she was gross, and didn't shower or something. IDK. I liked her. But I never talked to her again after that. I'm sorry, I should have done the right thing and told them to fuck off.

I went to public school for high school and was pretty much, except for a couple incidents, left alone. I remember one time I was talking to this really nice chick on the bus, and this dude came up behind me and strangled me for some reason. It really hurt my neck and feelings, and I never talked to that chick again.

I don't know. I've been weird around women my entire life. I think it's because I overshare, or because I don't know how to read their faces. I also have really bad approach anxiety.

I almost died 9 years ago. I joined the military at 19. When I was 22, I was deployed. My job was relatively safe compared to many other jobs that people can do in the military. But this one day a friend and I were coming back to the barracks from eating lunch, the incoming warning siren starts going off. We hit the ground as an RPG came flying overhead and hit the ground maybe 5 feet from us. I remember the smell of that fucking dirt so clearly. It was a dud. This was the first time I should have died.

I met someone on a dating site a couple years after that. She seemed nice at first, but because I hadn't been in a relationship ever, there were a lot of red flags that should have alerted me she was a bad person. I believed that no one is truly bad. We were married and moved to another country with her two kids to my new duty station. Things started taking a turn for the worst, I'm pretty sure she was cheating on me the entire time we were together. I remember some dark times with this person. She was emotionally abusive and I just continued to work on the relationship with little to no good communication coming my way. She sold my favorite car, an old f-body, a real white trash car that I loved and put a lot of work into, behind my back. She was supposed to ship my stuff overseas, but the stuff that made it over was ruined, and left my other car back stateside so her friend could drive it.

I gave up on this relationship right before my enlistment was up. I almost died again. The house we were living in at the time, exploded. I should have died again. I can't prove it, but I'm pretty sure she lit a candle in the kitchen and left the gas on. I was taking a nap on the couch when the kitchen EXPLODED. I remember waking up freaked out. I stood up and could see right into the kitchen through a large crack in the wall. I went to the bedroom, put on some clothes, got my stepson out. He had hid my dog in his room so it would be safe, and I know he thought he was doing the right thing. It's not your fault little dude, if you ever read this. If anything it was that neglectful woman's fault. I went inside to look for the dog, but I couldn't fucking find her. I ran back out and some guy was calling the fire department. I could do nothing but stare as my entire life burned to the ground.

The little bit of hope that I had left, died that day. It was the final straw. I loved that dog, I truly loved that fucking dog. I borrowed my wife's phone since mine was in the fire, and found a bunch of messages from her and a shit ton of dudes on a dating site. She had to have been doing this the entire time. Sexts from her the week of the fire. What a fucking disgusting thing. I gave up that day. I gave up everything. I am convinced that she was trying to kill me in that explosion, so that she could collect on the fucking insurance money. She did not give a shit about those kids. I remember her homeschooling them, but she was just filling out the paperwork for the kids. They fell way behind in school. I hated her. I left the military the next month or so. The last thing she said to me, when I took her to the court to get divorced, was ""Well, hope you learned your lesson""

I did. I fucking learned that there are evil people. Not people, demons. Pure evil, risen from the depths of hell. Put on this earth to walk this flaming and wicked path of destruction upon everything that they touch. There are so many problems in this world, so many bad things that have happened. I don't know what happiness is. People are fucking mean to each other, I don't know why. I wonder sometime's how such a wonderfully advanced species can cause such fucking destruction. Why? We should be a fucking team of humans. We should help each other. This is what I believe.

So now, 2 years after that. I don't know. I struggle with reality. I should have died twice now. Why am I still alive? Why am I suffering so much? I cry myself to sleep some nights wondering why I am so alone, I blame myself for all of my problems. Approach anxiety, I can't talk to women anymore because I feel like I'm just going to be used again. I remember all these experience of people just cheating... Deployed dudes and women all cheated. Is that what people do? Is there no integrity? We should do the right thing because it is the right thing to do. Because we have to be better than our predecessors. One dude told me that men are lions, we should spread our seed. I don't believe that. I am a dude, and have no one to share this with. I am not supposed to show my feeling. Suck it up. Stop being such a fucking pussy. I don't even have anyone saying this to me, my head is the one doing it.

I hate myself. But I get tired of thinking these dark thoughts all the time. I recently started trying to encourage myself. I've been working out a lot and repeating to myself that I am attractive and worth-it, and a good person. Text that girl, I'll be proud of you. Say hi to this person, you're doing a good job dude. It's going to be alright. But some days are darker than others. I am an empty husk of what I was before.

I wake up every day, and my goal now is to make sure that NO ONE feels this way. I wake up and put this fucking happy face on, because my life isn't as bad as others. There are people that have it worse than me. I have to be this shining beacon of hope. Because no one should feel like I feel. NO ONE. I text friends that don't always message me back, and I want them to know that I care. That if I can continue trudging through this dark mess, that they will be alright. I pick up trash that isn't mine along my path to throw it away. I remember someone shitting on the road a couple months ago in front of the neighbors house. It sat there for a few hours before I went out with a shovel and threw it in the trash. I saw the neighbors laughing at me. I let people merge in front of me in traffic, and generally go the speed limit. I should be safe as not to injure other's. I care about little things, put my cart back in the corral. Acts of good to offset the enormous amount of evil. It is the right thing to do. There is so much hate in this world, I must be respectful and good. For everyone that is not. There has to be other good people out there."
2146,"Struggling so much. I'm in so much pain, I feel like I've hit my limit and can't go any further. Life is too hard. I've been so strong for the last 2 years, telling myself everyday that things will get better because they have to, even if at most times I didn't believe it. Life just gets worse and worse, and depression just gets worse and worse. Nothing has gotten better. I don't want to live through even one more day of this. I can't, I need to be free."
2147,"Hi

Never posted on here before. Just looking to see if I can get any help from others past experience.

Im 29 and had a bit of an issue with cocaine. Drinking mainly lead to me taking cocaine and it got to stage it was really damaging my mental health. I was laying in bed for days only getting up to binge eat. Was affecting my overall health and relationship.

I tried to stop a few times and never could. Eventually a bad drug experience and an incident with the police led me to really go get help. 

I went to a counsellor and also opened up to my family about my drug problem. 

Happy to say im 5 months clean of drink and drugs however ive started recently getting into a rut again mentally and struggling to get out of bed and motivate myself for anything at all. 

I find myself having major anger issues where anything can set me off to point im ready to smash things up etc not something ive ever experienced. 

Is this something that will pass as i stay longer off the drink and drugs or maybe an underlying issue? I thought all my problems came from drink and drugs and it has definitely helped stopping that but feels like a massive set back this past few days and worrying me as i thought quitting drink and drugs would have me back to normal.

Thanks"
2148,I can tell that I’m in an episode from my behavior yesterday and how I am handling it today. It sucks because mine follow very little pattern and I don’t ever really know how long it’ll last. I’m in college and I have so much work to do so I really hope I get it together soon. I have anxiety as well so I’m worried about failing... which is ridiculous because I have good grades right now. I just have a lot on my plate and I don’t want to mess anything up more than I already have. My hope is that I get through this soon and it is more of a quick one but I don’t really know :(
2149,"Hello everyone, this is a question I have on my mind for quite some time now. For the record, I'm a 22 years old male. It all started as a teenager when I realised I was gay. Coming from a country where being gay is still a bit of a taboo, I was terrified that everyone would hate me. Then i started noticing salient physical characteristics I had which I despised. I felt embarrassed and hated myself. I would alienate myself from everyone, keep distance from friends and spend all day alone in my room. 

Then came family issues, my dad lost his job and would become abusive towards my mum. He'd say and do awful things in front of me and my brothers. I never had a good relationship with him, in fact I was never proud of him. He has always been this ugly awful dad. But all that made me hate him. And out of my brothers I am the son who looked like him appearance-wise. I didn't tell mum or anyone about how awful I was feeling because everyone at home was going through hell at the time and I didn't want to add to it.

After I finished my obligatory national service, I started getting panic attacks. I chose not to skip my national service but the environment back home was much more stressful than the army (army wasn't that bad, yes it was stressful but I got to meet and hang out with people there, I once felt part of a group). So after I finished was when I seeked help. I would get panic attacks every night and I'd cry myself to sleep. I had to constantly distract myself as it was too intense for me to manage. I saw a psychologist for about three times, got on antidepressants and moved abroad for university.

Things were getting better but I was still alone with zero motivation in engaging in any activities, making friends or meeting people. Then I met my ex, a man quite older than me who I fell in love with. Relationship lasted for two years, a sexless relationship with minimal affection from him towards me. He said he couldn't get sexual with me because of his strong medication which affected his libido. I accepted that and loved him nevertheless. At the end I caught him cheating and I broke up with him. During the relationship I felt worthless and ugly, as there was no intimacy which I craved for. I also went through some bad periods during the relationship and had to increase medication too. But after the breakup things got much worse, I would spend a huge amount of time in bed, I would not eat as much, my academic performance decreased. 

I finished my bachelor's and I am now doing a master's degree. I recently increased my medication again after a bad period of a couple of months. I still isolate myself from everyone. I still have no motivation in making friends. I still feel suicidal at times where I'm on the edge - but the sentiment of ""I wish I was dead/ I wish I didn't exist"" is always here.

I still feel worthless and I still hate myself. There are times I feel just so awfully depressed. I feel exhausted everyday for no reason. But I don't know if this is depression or if I'm ""faking"" it. I don't know if I'm just being lazy. I tell the doctors it is depression, something which the psychologist I visited back in my country told me and even the psychiatrist who prescribed me my first medication. But is it really depression?

I don't know. I don't want to label myself as having depression when it could be just me being sad or overcomplicating matters. I know I sabotage myself and I often seem to punish myself by being alone so that I would not annoy anyone. I suppose I feel like I deserve to be alone? Or that I deserve to be unhappy. I know that stressful situations such as dad, ex, army contributed to all these feelings, plus my own insecurities. But, I'm trying to work on things, e.g. I try and go to the gym to look after myself u
but that's about it. 

How do you guys know it's depression and not just sadness or something temporary? I didn't try therapy apart from those few meets with a psychologist, and I think that has to do with me thinking if I'm just faking depression.

Thanks for reading the backstory to my question."

2151,"Hi,

Im looking for some advice. I have panic and generalised anxiety disorder with bouts of depression (currently not able to leave the house without having panic attacks) and Im only getting 1-2 hours sleep at night and Im absolutely exhausted. Ive tried most SSRI medications in the past, currently only on diazepam when needed as Im generally prone to side effects from drugs. I was wondering what you medications you guys have found helpful for sleep and anxiety? Preferably ones that help but don't leave you feeling horrendously hungover and groggy the next day.

Thanks

2153,currently im 33 and ever since i was 20 my sleep has never been steady and i cant beleive i learned to accept it because its hell... ill start out going to bed at 12 midnight and wake up at 8am like a regular person but the following night ill end up going to sleep around 12:30am and waking up at 8:30 am etc and etc and before you know it im waking up at 4pm in the afternoone waking up around 11pm and my days and nights are mixed up. i never can fall asleep on the same time its always delayed and slowly but surely ill be going to bed at 10pm and waking around 6am and of course it will get mixed up again.... i cant even keep doctors appointments because i cant argue with my body and force it to sleep OR wake up so i miss appointments usually it is truly miserable and has a huge impact on me. the weird thing is i always seem to get atleast 7 or 8 hours sleep which is good has anyone ever had or heard of someone with this?? why does it happen? i have plenty of friends who are currently unemployed and have nothing to wake up for in the morning but they ALWAYS go to sleep around 10 or 11pm and rise right at 7am! im so confused it really does not help my depression thank you for reading!
2154,"Sometimes I feel like everything is off, but it's a very different feeling now. I used to just be afraid that everything I know is a lie, but now I feel it in a more central core way that even if everything I know is a lie, the truth would be pointless as well. I don't understand why I should have happiness or contentment in life, or sadness and pain either. Usually more difficult issues in my life would be blocking this feeling because they were more intense. And I have issues like this still, but now they just exist alongside it and it makes me feel like I shouldn't even solve my problems. The only thing that makes me want to live is other people, and also that I'm not sure why I want to not live when I am feeling that way. I don't understand it, and I feel like if I don't understand the core of my existence I don't understand anything else that is coming from that. I don't think that death makes life pointless, I don't think that living forever would make life pointless either. I think that if life is pointless, it is pointless by itself. But I don't feel like that's the truth either, and I can't just decide the meaning of my life because everything I do feels like the wrong choice. It feels like I can never do enough, and I never do enough either. The things I enjoy, art and music and animation, I'm ashamed of liking those things because they aren't that ""important"" to the world. But then I think of doing other things I care about, like helping the environment and helping others, and I feel like those things are important but still not fulfilling. For some reason I just can't see myself as anything that matters, even when I hurt I think, oh well. Like I try and fix it but I'm only fixing it because other people will see on the outside that something is wrong. I don't want to hurt anyone. I pretend to be okay because even if I'm not okay underneath, if no one knows about that, it should be fine right? No one cares if they don't know. And I'm not saying that because I think other people are mean, I just don't understand how things work. I care about how people really feel, but I will never see it unless they choose to be honest, which I see as the best possible outcome is that we are all honest. but i'm not honest, I can't be because I know how hard it is for other people to deal with their own problems. I feel like such a burden because I have so many problems, and many of them cannot be solved at this point, especially not by someone ""saving"" me. I need medical help with my body but I haven't told anyone because it is something they may not understand and will be so hard for  them to. And I just want to be normal, but the truth is that I'm not. I don't know why I care about being normal, or care about fixing my problems. Why do I care so much, and why does it also feel like I'm incapable of caring?"
2155,"I feel the symptoms of pretty low energy, I don't feel rested after sleep (got my sleep checked there's no issues), standard blood tests are normal, I sleep maybe 6 or under hours other times over 8 hours and in between its not consistent but I feel the same either way from my observation. I'm also in my 20s and don't feel the energy to be active, I can be but cardio stresses me out more than feeling benefits I would say. everything comes back as normal, so I would assume I'm normal but don't feel normal..."
2156,"So I don't know if you've read my previous thread from a week or so back, but I finally did meet with a psychiatrist who prescribed me some Prozac-adjacent medication (in 10mg per day, lower than the standard 20mg from what I understand). They initially wanted Zoloft, but I was really concerned about the potential nausea-inducing side effects of it (I've been to therapy before for vomit-related stuff and I really would like to not throw up if I don't have to) and switched accordingly. It feels so weird because I've never been prescribed medication for anything besides some strep throat I had when I was like 10 or 11. Now that I finally have a tool that could be helpful in addition to therapy, I find myself kinda freezing up in fear at the thought of starting to take them tomorrow and overthinking a lot of the side effects, especially the nausea, weight gain, appetite increase, and suicidal thoughts increasing aspects. It's not entirely unfounded either since my best IRL friend died of suicide in our second year of college when he had been on Prozac for a couple of months, and he had very noticeably gained weight and was overeating, sometimes to the point of vomiting. My mind keeps bouncing around between ""just try it, and even if you get sick it'll be worth it in the long run"" and ""it's not worth the potential side effects"". I mean, I know pharma companies have to list a ton of side effects to basically not get sued, and I really am desperate to make changes to fight off depression, but I'm feeling this weird sort of apprehension. I guess what I'm wondering is if anyone else here has had a similar experience and how it turned out for them; hearing these will probably help me to stop overthinking it. Many thanks."
2157,"Forgive me for a bit of rambling venting, please. I’ve been out of work for almost a year now. I’d been able to manage my anxiety and depression so that I could marginally function for more than a decade. My first job out of grad school and I literally crumbled. Fired 6 months after starting. Had to stop meds and counseling and move back with my parents.

Tried multiple interviews and realized a trend of panic attacks, in the middle of interviews. I finally gave up. I haven’t left the house, or felt any desire to do so, since October. Against my parent’s tearful wishes, I found and took a course to learn how to do a specific freelance job online.

All of that completely irrelevant background aside, I’m back against an old enemy. I feel like a fraud again. Like someone will realize I don’t have enough skill to do this new job. Like I’ll not be able to make it work enough to dig upwards again. Not sure if it’s imposter syndrome, exactly. Something similar at least.

It’s debilitating. I need to function. I need to be able to make a living. I’m already screwed-up and useless enough. I just don’t know how to silence myself so that I can have some agency in my own life.

I’m not some great brilliant person. I don’t think it’s really possible for me to brag. I have accomplished some things that seem great when I hear that other people did them. When I think about having done them, they seem like nothing. It feels like I somehow fluked or cheated my way into them.

I’ve been through enough CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) to know that how you think of things helps shape them. I’ve given myself scripts and stuck to them for years. It didn’t make any difference.

I managed 3 degrees, one of them post graduate. I tutored or taught almost the whole way through. Why are classmates I helped scrape-by able to succeed and thrive while I self-sabotage everything? It is so frustrating. I keep coming back to why on earth I’m prolonging this torture for myself and everyone else in my life?

Aside from meds and counseling, which I can’t pay for yet; some sort of script for myself or moving forward and doing it; does anyone have any methods to work around my ‘imposter syndrome’?"
2158,Has anyone gone through or know someone who went through a depression making u sick and I'll?? I'm not talking the blue and u can still manage to go to work and live with friends etc I'm talking u feel sick to ur stach with guilt and generalized anxiety. I can't function. Going to get groceries is even a tall task. I wish I was bi polar atleast I would have a time eventually where I felt good and not sick with depression!  Its 24/7 extreme guilt and worrying thoughts and it's really wore me out. The only thing that worked was medication last time I fell into this but effexor wore off now I'm trying lexapro for 3 and a half weeks with no luck. Its defeating and hopeless because on effexor I was dug out of this feeling in 2 weeks! What if SSRIs no lo get work??
2159,"I don’t know if I’m suffering from depression but I’ve been in a state of sadness and emptiness for almost a yr. My happiness is short lived and I can’t help but overthink about almost everything.

2160,"Hello, uhm,
I'm sorry if i did any mistake while posting my thread. I just wanted to share my thing and ask for advice from you.
So, I'm 19, almost 20 (male), and I've been suffering from depression for more than 10 years, since my childhood. I have tried to commit suicide twice, of which one was critical, and the other was not. I feel empty everyday, I cannot seem to do anything right.
Just to mention, I've taken anti-depressants and that stuff, but never worked, so I don't bother taking medication anymore, nor talking to a doctor.

I have a few good friends and never had a girlfriend, and that's something I think I've been missing this whole time. But who would like to hang out with a failure like me, right?

I'm sorry if the text is messy, but my thoughts aren't together, so I don't know in which order I am writing.
My question is, is there any hope for me? Getting better, not overthinking, meeting new people?
I mean, I can read, I can study, I can get good grades, but I cannot seem to be good in SOCIALIZING, I just cannot do that, and it's bothering me. I'm spending all my time alone. It's not that it  bothers me to be alone, but I feel like I need someone to be with, like everyone around me, even in college everyone has someone who dates with. Like, I've never kissed a girl, never felt anything of that.

I'm sorry for my bad English and my bad choise of words. I'm just lost. I'm sorry."

2163,"Im not sure if i can go on like this anymore, im sick of suffering everyday im tired of being mentally and physically weak. I see the world as a horrible place and just dont stand a chance of turning it around. I know theres more to life than this but i just don't know how to really live it."
2164,"Hello, I'm new to the forum. I wanted to come here to see if other people with similar experiences can offer some advice. I've been taking mild anti-depressants for around 4 months but while I feel they have helped a bit, I think they are making me numb. It's like I know the feelings I had before are there but there's something blocking it. I don't like it and think I would rather be sad. It's making me want to come off them but maybe I should stick it out a bit longer?"
2165,"I'm tired. Tired of heartbreak, of my life now. I really wish I was in coma and I could suddenly wake up in year ago, when I was happy. I was soo happy. I mean, the happiest I've ever been. I just feel like my ex is dead. Like, he's so rude to me now, I mean I don't have any contact with him but after our breakup he started to be rude. But he was the one who broke my heart. He's like this other person, like this person I knew a year ago, this man who would do anything to make me happy, is gone. I don't blame myself for that, I don't blame him, maybe his depression, but it's not his fault. I lost most feelings for him, but I didn't lose any for this person I knew, this ""good side"" of him. This caring, loving man becoming cold and distance till at all gone. 
I just needed to write that.
I know sun will come up. 
But I really wish it all would erase and we would be like back in a year ago. And stay that way. 
Well, there's nothing I can do about it, all I can do is to live my life, and forget.

2167,"Hello everybody...!

My ex and I broke up a year ago. He dumped me. We had been together for a few years and had to go long-distance because I moved back home to regroup - my depression had been getting worse and worse for the previous 4 years, I was beginning to get suicidal, so I needed to be near family and friends to lean on. While we were long-distance he started to feel the weight of my depression, nothing he would say would make me feel better, and eventually he got tired of it. He said he couldn't feel any of the joy of the relationship anymore.

He had been my only support while living in the UK those two years we were together, so not having him in my life was a huge shock. At first I thought he would change his mind, have second thoughts. What we had was so beautiful and he loved me so much once. We would talk occasionally, but he seemed resolved not to get back together. He didn't want to have a long-distance relationship (he said it'd be too taxing even for two healthy people, never mind people suffering from depression). He didn't want to move to where I was, as he wasn't sure his own shaky mental health could withstand it. I couldn't move to where he was, as I was really in a bad shape and needed the support of my family and friends. 

Even so, we would talk every so often and he would hint at how much he missed me, missed what we had, how he was grieving. This gave me hope. Made me think maybe he could change his mind and come be with me. At the same time he said he was trying to move on and was seeing other people. It was torture to live constantly hoping that he would come round, fearing more than anything that he would not, but clinging to every phrase that gave me hope.

I asked him, directly, whether he would ever consider coming to where I am. I was tired of living in torture. He answered that if he said yes, that would give me the impression that it's likelier than it really is. I only heard that there was a chance. He explained he was a few dates into seeing someone and that he had work to think of, but I spoke of a hypothetical future where I was much better (of the depression) and he could manage to get away. 

I feel delusional - all my friends say I should get over him already but I'm obsessed. I think about him every single day. I don't want to write to him, I want to give him space, but not writing to him feels like getting over a drug, every day I have to give myself props for not reaching out to him. It's been a month and the cravings are strong. What can I do to get over him? To make matters worse, not being with him feeds my depression - I feel like if I'm not with him I will never be happy with anybody else, what we had was so special and so strong. I feel that if I was with him, I'd be much happier and be able to overcome this crippling depression. What do I do?"
2168,"Hi everyone,

I'm gonna try keep this as short but as clear as I can. 

I recently had been does by my 26 year old gf, I'm 31, I was living with her and her family for the last few months until we saved enough to buy a house. 

I realise now I was depressed because when I had down times I'd self medicate with alcohol and sometimes cocaine, I wasn't a person who would appear to be dependent all the time, just times I felt the most low I'd replace that with numbing myself. 

I loved and still do love her with all my heart. But she also has depression, one moment I'm the best thing in the world, she can't stop touching, kissing me, always wanted to be around me and just seemed crazy about me, I loved it, then all of a sudden she shuts off, cba to move, she still goes to work, but comes back giving me issues taking her anger out on me. 

I'd then drink to block it out, then we argue more, if we argued whilst I'm drinking id say really awful things to her I didn't mean and felt really bad for. Then she returns to the high version of herself, loving caring, very obsessed, which I loved. Then revert back which of course made me feel like I wasn't good enough and during arguments I'd say really bad bad things because I wanted her to feel like she made me by what I thought was picking and choosing as and when she wanted to be close. 

Only now it's over do I realise I had an issue and now because I'm not numbing myself, I realise the pattern she had. 

I feel like both of our issues pushed each other away. We lost s baby together and never really talked about it, I tried to talk to her parents but was always one sided so gave up with that in the end. 

She told me to get better whilst she does, but doesn't know if she loves me because right now all she sees us making herself better. 

I blame myself for how's she feels now but it wasn't just me, I just dealt with hoe she made me feel in a wrong way. 

I'm sorting myself out and bettering myself, but all I see is her, I love her so much and wish we met when we both had dealt with our own issues because when we are ok we're a relationship goal, so close do loving so caring. 

I need advice, how can I be there for her to help her get better whilst not making her feel pressured, I love this girl so much, but I made her feel worthless, she has me, but I feel much better now and want to help her get better. 

The day she broken up with me she told me she slept with a so called friend, he wasn't a friend if he took advantage of her whilst in that place, if he was he would have waited. 

She's not even on the pill and was unprotected as next month we was going to start trying for a family if we sorted ourselves out. 

I feel broken over it but I understand that if I made her feel worthless she's going to be like that, she never cheated on me it was only that the day we ended. 

Either way I still love this women and only see her. What do I do because I don't fully understand what's going on with her otherwise I'd know what to do."

2170,"I am currently in a pretty bad situation. My depression and anxiety is high and i can't function or hold down a job or anything like that so all i do is sit at home all day eating junk food. Each day is extremely boring and hard to get through yet i can't go out into society and function because of my anxiety and depression. I am currently on fluoxetine and i am still waiting for it to work after like 5 months. I took fluoxetine before and it worked but it took a long time for it to work last time so i expect the same this time. My question is, do you think it would be a good idea for me to go into a mental health hospital for a month or two while i wait for the meds to work so i can function again?"
2171,"I have been on antidepressants (Citalopram 10mg) for over 2 years now and they have greatly helped with my depression. However I am at the point now where I feel I am terrified of having sex with my boyfriend. We’ve been together for 3 years and when we first got together I wanted sex all the time, but now it honestly terrifies me and I become so scared when I know it might be about to happen. I am honestly so worried and a complete mess because it’s getting worse and I don’t want my boyfriend to think I don’t love him or I’m not attracted to him, because I am, more than anything in the world. I’m scared for my relationship and that my sex drive will never be there ever again. I’m absolutely terrified :("
2172,"Hello, long time depression sufferer here. I'm just having a hard day today. Trying to figure out why I am even fighting this battle. No one cares about me etc. Why keep fighting this fight? I'm really thinking I should just give up and let the depression win so I can pass on and be at peace in heaven."
2173,"My situation keeps getting worse and I don't have strength to fight this emptiness and pain. Last week I harmed myself but stopped before I went too far... I really don't know why. I don't deserve to live. One of my classmates had an accident three weeks ago and she died. An innocent, religious teen who always had a big smile on her face and helped everyone in need. When I heard about her death, I couldn't understand why good people die while Im still here. Im such a piece of shit. I even wrote a note but then realized nobody cares about me. I called a suicidal hotline but it didn't help me as someone told me killing myself is a sin and I would end up in hell. But do I really care about that? I don't think the guy I am involved with right now would care at all. I've been using and hating him for so long now and I don't really deserve to be here.

I don't know why I am writing this.. maybe I just need to say goodbye to someone. I just can't deal with this heavy burden on my chest."

2177,"i quit my last job over a year ago and have been trying to find a new job since. I have found several that have been willing to interview me but...I'm afraid to go through with it. I think there are a few reasons for this:

1. I think I'm afraid to go back to work. My last job made me so unhappy that I am amazed I lasted as long as I did and didn't have a complete nervous breakdown, and I don't want that to happen again.

and on that note

2. every job I could get where I live seems...kinda terrible.

3. I don't know how I can move to somewhere where I could find a better job. you might say to save money to afford to move, but i've been down that road before, and it just lead to me being trapped in a job i hate, isolated from all of my friends, and eventually the last glimmer of hope that i could ever have something better was slowly extinguished.

I got referred to a job program by my therapist, and everything they've gotten me to apply for either sounds terrible or, on the rare occasion i we find something good, never contacts me. I ended up not going to an interview for a job that sounded absolutely terrible, and now I have no idea what to say to the job coach when he calls and asks how the interview went. I feel like we may have jumped the gun on starting this program honestly.

I went to college and my mental health went completely into the toilet during my last year and I only barely graduated. This completely derailed me and I have no idea how to get back on track. I'm not even sure I know what the track is!

There has to be something more than this. Life can't just be ""going from bad job to bad job while being isolated from everyone."" Because if it is, what even is the point?"
2178,"So a load of work friends are having drinks round someone's house tonight and I found out about it through their posts on social media, all we're going to have a fab time tonight kind of thing, and I'm feeling really left out. I go to some nights they have but some I politely decline to because I suffer with social anxiety, but they just haven't mentioned this one at all and I'm feeling rejected and hurt. Am I right to feel like this?"
2179,"Hi All!

Well, events happened 2 weeks ago which resulted in me walking out of my job (the first full time regular job I've had in years) because I felt I wasn't good at it. Low self-esteem at it's worst. It was also very stressful.

So now I've been feeling really lost and sorry for myself. I don't have any friends (apart from FB friends and 1 friend in a different area I can phone or text) and no woman (been single years) and only really speak to my dad in my family for no other reason than he understands me and I don't feel I'm on the same wavelength as anyone else in my family.

Now I feel like moving (or kind of running away) to a new town 17 miles up the road. Start a new. Try to remain positive if I do. It's just a rash decision really but feel my home city / town hasn't really worked out for me. Is it a wise move? I mean, I'm only an hour's bus journey away from my home town.

At the moment though it's really tough going, tryna work out what to do for the best. My minds been all over the place. Questioning my behaviour for leaving my job, wondering what to do next, mixed in with feelings of low self worth, low moods, feeling agitated, eating too much junk (for probably obvious reasons) and just generally feeling all mixed up. I've rang Samaritans a few times which helped at the time but still don't know what to do for the best.

I've realised I have low self-esteem, a bit of paranoia, mood swings, anxiety and very little confidence as I've sat in my flat thinking about things the past 2 weeks. Also women seem cautious of me (or is that my paranoia again?)

Thanks!"
2180,How can your day all of a sudden change just by someone making you feel not very important and not very appreciated (work related). I guess --like most things-- i can trace it to my childhood where i didn't feel important so it probably brings up those feelings.  When you have no confidence instilled in you as a child how do you face digs made to your ego now?
2181,"Hi everyone I wonder if I have depression but I struggle with reading my own feelings. I often feel down, I think it’s sadness and I’m always scared. I’m also really tired but it can be because of my thyorid problems, don’t really know. 

I have always loved reading books, playing games and watching anime. But those interest are slowly dying and I just want to sleep. My interest for animals it’s still going strong at least but some day I struggle of taking care of my bunnies. 

Often when I feel really down one of them will always snuggle up in my arms and keep company with me. 

I struggle with having to push myself up to do things. I need to motivate myself why I need to do it and go up. Often it’s my bunnies that motivates me to go up and take care of them. 

Maybe I’ve been not feeling that good for a long time. Who knows, I never talk about feelings and open up. I’m just starting to learn how to handle my fears and open up a bit. 

I’m not at my lowest point and I wish to never experience that again. I manage to get out from it with just closing up my emotions and think about my little brother. 

How I was raised and what I have experience have made me quite the shy person. I had problem calling people on the phone, talking with strangers and friends, I had problem with people touching me and getting close to me. I’m changing that in small babysteps and done a lot of improvements alone. 

I’m a master at lying and putting up a front, I can laugh naturally but I don’t really feel any joy or excitement. I laugh just becuase it will fit into that situation. Hell, I even learned how to control crying. 

My self esteem it’s really low, I never want to be in a picture because I hate how I look. I know that I can fix myself up, I might think something looks really cute but when I look in the mirror the thoughts and voices kicks in. 

My childhood was pretty normal I think, I only got hit once by my dad and my mother would often hit me. I would only get a few bruises, sometimes a small bump or a small wound. I can understand kids are annoying and don’t listen often. I would often get hit when I didn’t understand my homework from school, got bad grade that’s nearly every time, being too loud,crying, scraped my knee and so on. I’m quite unlucky with having trouble with the academy part. I have always had it easier learning something that make me work with my hands. 

So I learned to lie and I learned to not bother my family. I’m glad I was the black sheep, so my little brother didn’t have to get hit as often and I often took the blame and made sure he didn’t get in trouble. He have been diagnosed with depression and goes to a therapist. The physical and mental aspect from how my parents raised have left quite a lot of fears and trust issues. But wasn’t something that pushed me to feel the worse.  

My mother calmed down the older I got and also when I got trouble with my thyroid, she stopped bothering me. 

Between the age of 13-16 I was bullied at school. Even though I hated school and felt deep fear I still walked to school. Because I just find handling my mother anger hurt me more than having people talk around me, laughing behind my back and telling up front I’m disgusting and ugly. 

I still get comments about my weight and that I’m fat and need to loose weight. I know all that are just slander, I’m 1,73 and weight 60 kg but I unconsciously belive them. 

So I just isolate myself and often don’t go out from the house if I don’t have to. I will often just spend my free days laying in bed and sleep. I’m careful with my university studies, so I don’t crash again and I walk on a thin line with feeling extemly exhausted with no energy at or just being tired but I can still push through the day. 

I had one crash 2 years ago, took 6 months to come out from it and another one a year ago and it took the whole summer break to get out from it. It happens when the scale tips and I get extremely tired, how much I sleep I will have no energy and I need to force myself to take just a shower and I often loose appetite. The 6 month period I struggled with stomach pain and headache the whole period and lost a little weight. 

I have no suicide thoughts because when I was younger and had it, I thought about my little brother and how sad he would feel. He means a lot to me and I never want to hurt him and make him sad. I want to be there for him and help him through his struggles and be a strong sister that he can come to.

I often just compare my feelings with how bad I have felt once and how I’m feeling now aren’t the same. So I convince myself I’m okay but I can already starting to feel the creeping feeling before I go into a “crash”."
2182,Hi I just want to shut the outside world out a mixture of things really.nunber one I got told off yesterday at work by horrible boss can't be bothered to work there anymore actually glad not there on Monday.i have always been a good worker and got told off for speaking to.new staff member and  for children being bored and for not knowing how to.work the wili and fed up of her snapping.dont even care what site I'm at other day and then feel a bit fed up as don't really see bf that much
2183,"I find myself at 48 stuck in a tiny town, married to a successful doctor that seems more a roommate at this point, than a partner. While work consumes her days, my anxiety and depression are doing the same to me. A daily roller coaster of deep dread and terrible sadness.
I self harm to relieve the anxiety only to later feeling pathetic for doing so. The advice I’m given by both my therapist and doctor seem futile; exercise (I spend 2 1/2 hours in the gym a day just to burn hours and energy), work prospects are insanely limited, and talking to either brings nothing but drive me further to the realization I’m pretty much worthless. 
The song “Mad World”’s lyrics: “The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had” 
are more truth than music. 
I feel completely lost and - just lost."
2184,"Does anyone else feel like, they couldn’t ask for anymore in life and that they are truly lucky to have lots of amazing things in their life but they still feel empty and like something is missing? It makes me feel guilty knowing that I’ve got what some people could only dream of having yet I’m still not happy! It can be such a vicious circle sometimes. I feel like my head is a mess! Like I don’t really know who I am or what my purpose is supposed to be. I don’t feel good enough and feel pretty useless and a burden most of the time. 
I always put on a brave face and act like I’m happy to others. I always try to make others feel happy and respected but don’t always feel like it’s returned very often.
I feel like I can’t open up and let on to people how much I truly am struggling in my head with myself. I even hold back from talking about some things with the therapist I see. Im just fed up of feeling confused all the time and like this. I just want to enjoy life and be able to be positive and confident. It is just such a struggle to do so.

I guess I’m just looking for others who have felt or feel the same so at least I won’t feel so alone in my thoughts.

Thanks ♥️"

I was in and out of consciousness since about ten this morning.. Finally got up about twelve. I felt terrible.. Started popping pills like there was no tomorrow.. Even took some pain killers.. Thought maybe that would help...

Didn't do any shopping.. Far to late.. Didn't make it to Greggs either... but I did go out for my walk.. Very windy.. Hated it.

Now its about half three and I'm starting to feel almost 'o.k'..... but now I've got nothing to do for the rest of the day... oh... I did the washing up to... I've become soo desperate in the last few months I've been reduced to forcing myself to do normal things in the vain hope that they will help in some way... its not really working guys.

so today is over.. So how'd I do ? Not too bad I guess... got up at seven.. Did my shopping at eight.. At nine I went to Greggs for a cheese salad baguette (saves cooking).. On the way back I hit the charity shops and brought some books.. About twelve I when out for my daily walk... and that's it... game over.. wash, rinse and repeat...

Tomorrow is going to be exactly the same.. The 'quality' of my life... the extent of my life... every days the same.. I can basically do it on automatic by now.. Its no wonder I get depressed.. Anybody would in my position.. Its soul sapping stuff...

oh..oh... I almost forgot.. Today is Tuesday.. So I've got to put the bins out... talk about life in the fast lane.. I don't want to do this anymore !.. I don't want... anything !.. I don't want this to get any better.. I just want it to end.. Just to be over !

My life isn't going to get any better.. How can I talk the doctors into euthanizing me ?.. It would be a mercy killing... I guess theres always that clinic in switzerland...

wait a minute... isn't there a society for topping yourself ?.. Isn't it called 'Exit' or something like that ? Maybe they can help ? God knows i need something."
2188,"My first post on here. I struggled with depersonalisation aged around 13 and then suffered my first depressive episode aged 15. As my Dad was a heavy alcoholic at the time I got pushed to the back of the queue and didn't receive proper support. As a result I developed severe OCD. This lead to a period of heavy recreational drug use. In spite of a severe breakdown after finishing university and another a few years later I could never get my parents to give the support I needed. In 2008, aged 28, I thought I was starting a new chapter, beginning to improve my relationship with my parents and learn to relax. Then - my dad died in a tragic accident and for many years I was consumed with guilt at not having been able to save him. 

I'm now 40 and ten years later finally feel that I've finally been able to see that I'm not at fault for what happened. I've been stuck in the same job and living with my Mum since 2003. I've tried super hard to move ahead, cutting down drinking, exercising, eating properly. For some reason I've just come down with another really tough episode of depression. I want to keep fighting but find it so hard to keep my enthusiasm as I get older and see things passing me by. Does anyone have any thoughts?"

And I still haven’t got a job, and I hate myself for not having one. I’ve never got therapy, I have no friends. I have one whose my best friend but we rarely talk. I used to be really close with my cousin, but I realized how manipulative he really is. He told me he’d help me with my depression but he’d often speak of it like a burden. He lives downstairs and I hate seeing him..... 

I never been in a relationship, and I doubt any girl will ever like me. I’m super lazy also. Like I have never been organized or worked for anything in my life. I’m trash. And I’m such an angry victim. I’m not a nice person. I’m full of victim mentality and I’m so stupid.

I don’t know what else to say but I cannot do this anymore. I’m planning on dying soon. I often wonder if there’s any reason to be here, and I don’t think there is. Why am I here? To just suffer and beg to die? It’s a evil dark world and I can’t take it."

My taxes were just offset for a loan I paid back almost a year ago and I have to go through a whole legal matter to get my money which will take 6-9 months to dispute !

Someone I never had sex with cause I am pregnant with another man baby which he knew ! Saying that I was buying him clothes and shoes and that he pimped me ! Like really ? All of it was false but he was a complete asshole and narcissistic to the highest power. I’m just in a really dark place and I have contemplated suicide, like I don’t see any point of my life at all. Yes I have children but I don’t want to fail them to smh . Nobody but my parents care about me anyway.

I no longer experience any joy in life, I have little academic achievements and no work experience, I am a manipulative narcissistic sociopath, and I have no real friends or family, except for my father. I have asked so many different people to justify why I shouldn't commit suicide and they all say the same thing: ""It gets better"". I am sick of hearing this phrase being uttered because it is neither true nor helps in any way, and I can say with utmost certainty that my life will never significantly change for the better. It is a baseless copy-pasted answer people tell you because they don't want to bear the responsibility of convincing someone not to commit suicide, which is perfectly understandable. It frustrates me to no end that I haven't been able to talk like this to anyone, to express my true feelings. It also frustrates me that I can't simply ask to be humanely euthanised and that I will inevitably have to take matters into my own hands. Please, someone convince me why I shouldn't commit suicide."
2198,"I am my own worst enemy I will tell people I'm fine when they ask even thought it's not true. I dont feel as if I want to burden people or make them worry about me as then I will feel guilty and then feel worse. 

However today is my first valentines day single in 8 years. I ended things with my boyfriend before christmas yet none of my best friends have even messaged me to see how I am.

I feel as if I should just open up to someone yet feel like if they clearly dont care why bother. I know they are busy with their own lives and relationships but I know I would have sent a message if they were in my shoes so just sucks."

2200,"I'm struggling with a debilitating illness and it's bringing up a lot of difficult emotions from when I was growing up.

When I was in junior high and until my senior year in high school, my mom was terminally ill. When she passed away, everyone at school was shocked - they all thought my mom was doing better. And that was because I learned really early on that that's all anyone wanted to hear - something positive. Put on a happy face, tell everyone what they want to hear because no one actually wants to hear how bad things were. 

There was one time I was nearly in tears in geometry class because my mom had decided to stop treatment because of the amount of pain she was in. The substitute geometry teacher told me ""Oh, it will get better, cheer up"" and I started sobbing and he treated me like I was upset about a boyfriend or something. I couldn't explain to him what was going on because every time I tried to do that with someone who didn't already know the background, I got these blank stares and people never knew what to say and it was insanely uncomfortable. 

And if I did explain, after a while a lot of teachers told me to stop making excuses. If my mom had been sick for a few weeks, that would have been different. But it was year after year and friends and teachers were tired of hearing about it and wouldn't cut me any slack. So, it didn't matter if my mom was in the hospital, I still had to take tests and turn in homework like nothing was the matter. 

Now, I'm probably going to get fired from my job because of my illness. I can't keep up with my work. I had a meeting with the owner of the company and it's the same thing as when I was in high school - they don't care how bad I feel, just get the job done. And as soon as I try to explain what's going on, I get a bunch of suggestions which aren't relevant. No, they can't help. I have many many doctors who also can't help. I don't need to hear about something they read online. 

Ever since high school, any time someone asks me ""how are you?"", I don't answer because they don't actually want to know. Telling them any thing other than ""good"" or ""fine"" results in that person looking at you like there's something wrong with you. 

I just don't know how to cope with this situation again and pretending to be okay when I'm not and dealing with people in general. Therapy has never helped. I'm not sure medication would make me less jaded. Any suggestions of books that might help?"

2202,"So I just found out that my friend who I used to be really close to has been messaging my mum about me and that I've withdrawn from her. They are having chats about me losing interest in everything and there is a part of me that knows they did it with a good intention but theres a bigger part of me that feels betrayed. This friend knows so much about me, my past and my demons that literally no one else does and I can't help wonder what else has she told my mum. I feel so alone, I have no one I can talk to or someone just to sit with when I can't be alone but don't want to talk. Feeling this alone is horrible"

2204,"Hey newbie to this!
So for the last few years I've been living with depression except I never wanted to acknowledge it was there so I suppressed it until recently when I completely have a break down. I've been struggling really bad with it lately I'm always in floods of tears and feeling down, over thinking everything.i have anxiety to so my emotions and brain is totally all over the place! I either feel everything or nothing. And it's getting so difficult to cope with the constant switch of emotions at the click of the fingers. I have been with my partner for just under a year and he is in the military so I don't get to see him very much. I absolutely am in love with the guy but I feel like I'm putting to much on him, he is amazing with handling me but I feel like he's eventually going to give up as he has a lot on already as his dad is dying so I really don't want to put this on him, we talk alot and he understands to an extent. My behaviour is getting out of control towards him tho and it breaks my heart as ll the time. I'm constantly thinking that he's cheating on me even tho he is not and I get so upset when he can't talk for a hour or so because he is busy, I am always moody with him or get really upset when he leaves or I cannot see him for a few weeks because our work schedules don't work out. I know that I'm selfish and should be more understanding but I just get so out of control some times that I cannot reset or breath I just flip out and get so paranoid and over think what if he's going off me or I'm not good enough for him. He always tries to reassure me but it never works so my question is how do I cope? I am on the waiting list for Cbt but its a 3 month wait. What do I do? How can I relieve the pressure I'm creating and help to control my self? Any advise or help would be amazing as this isn't the person I am and I never want to be like this I just really don't know how to stop"
2205,"So, I write hoping someone reads, and has some input may be. I am very depressed. I had been on cymbalta for like a year and then I stopped cause I felt ""better"". It was the longest and most difficult taper and now I feel so stupid cause I want to go back (has anyone gone back to antidepressants after leaving them? I feel like a junkie). I just don't find sense in living, I am perpetually tired and have no interest in anything. This is new to me cause I used to be so passionate about some things. I can't stop crying and feel that I am not enough for anything. 

I have an objectively good life. Im studying a Phd and have a job. No money problems,  a boyfriend (or something like that) that is very beautiful and loving, a cat that I love so much that I tattooed her in my arm. I feel so ungrateful. My brain is wrong, something's wrong with it, it just doesn't work. I overthink and overthink and I can't stop. I go to therapy... I am hopeless. I am wasting my life. I know it's annoying to be complaining like this and I hate myself for it. I am annoying to myself. 

So, I don't know... I don't know what I am expecting, may be success stories? has anyone controlled their depression? Is there hope?"
2206,"""I am worthless. No one loves me. I don't deserve to be happy.""

Depression is an unexpected visitor that intervenes in  life completely uninvited. At first, just in the corner, unnoticeable. Then there is a loss of interest in anything around me, I don't want to be with any friends or family. Feeling completely alone, even in a room full of people who love you. Push the people away and leave everything behind. Allow the darkness to grow inside and allow it to consume your head.

before you have realized how far it has actually gotten, you've already pushed everyone away and you regret your actions, leading to a worse feeling, fueling the darkness in the corner. Now that it has segregated you from everyone else, it's gotta make everything your fault. Everything that goes wrong around you is your fault and you can't fix it. Everyone hates you. No one loves you. If they say they love you, they're lying. Everyone is a liar. They really don't wanna be around you, they're just using you. Don't listen to anyone else, you aren't pretty, smart and they definitely aren't your friends. Lower yourself more, deepen the hole inside your heart.

The emotional pain then just fades into complete emptiness, there is no extreme sadness, rage or happiness. Everything dulls out, like a photo in monochrome. Sure, you enjoy some things, and you have some good days, but he's still in the back of your mind, smiling, waiting for the perfect opportunity.

And then, something happens. Completely mediocre. It's really not that bad, and it's completely ridiculous to overreact. The pain doesn't only hurt you inside, your body hurts too. Your sleep is deprived and your whole body aches.

You lose time in this nonstop spinning. After some time, the pain becomes too unbearable. ""Think about your family, think about how much they'd be hurt if you were to disappear."" Everyone around me says to think of my family but no one ever asks how I would be. When you're in so much pain, you don't think of anything around you. You don't think of how your actions will end up hurting the people around you and you it becomes easier and easier to accept defeat against an invisible force you can do nothing about.

Oh, now you want me to get a counselor, or a therapist. Oh boy, speaking to some stranger I don't even know for an hour just because they've got some special papers saying they know meow about my brain than I do. Talk about it? If you wanted me to talk, why was I constantly shut up before it was bad. Before I ever thought about hurting myself?

All the sudden you try to act like you care, but when I was reaching out for help, you stared, completely dumbfounded at my voice. Like I was speaking in tongues. But now that something has actually happened, you want to do something.

""Why didn't I see it before? Why didn't she say anything?""

Asking the questions like I wasn't reaching out for help. Screaming for help. But when no one grabs my hand, I dink into the pit and forget how to ask for help.

Which way will I do it today. It hurts."
2207,"I am new to this,for as far back as I recall I have struggled with life with my depression and anxiety and social anxiety."
2208,"I'll try to be brief, but there's a lot to explain.

At 40 I had a good job, a loving wife and was enjoying life.

My wife had some health problems which required me to quit my job and care for her.
That took 3 years to sort out.
In the mean-time I developed bowel cancer which also prevented me getting back to work.

Having got through that, I couldn't return to my previous career and my only choice was to start doing casual work to earn money.
My father ran his own business and I also helped him with that although (stupidly, with hindsight) I ended-up investing money in that business rather than earning money from the work.

Over the years my relationship with my wife has deteriorated to the point where we are now, basically, just strangers who share a house.
She is, in fact, openly seeing other men and encourages me to get a divorce if this bothers me.
Honestly, I suspect the only reason we're still married is because I bought the house alone and she's hoping for a financial windfall if I seek a divorce.

When we married I moved to her town and all her friends became ""our"" friends but, as a result of our current situation, I'm left with no friends at all.

My father died last year and, as it turns out, he stole roughly £40,000 of my property, disposed of it and then cut me out of his will (going to the trouble of writing a clause in his will solely to point out how much he disliked me) and, instead, left all his estate, including his business, to one of his friends.

I received a letter from the bank, last Friday, telling me that none of the bills/taxes/mortgage have been paid for the last 12 months because all the funds have been redirected into an account belonging to my wife and the bank are going to repossess my house if I don't pay off my debts within 14 days.

Oh, and my bowel cancer seems to be making a comeback.
I haven't seen a doctor yet (because, honesty, I might just let it run it's course) but I'm getting the same symptoms I had a few years ago.

So, no money, no prospects, no future, no happiness.

Literally, the only reason I haven't already ended my life is because I think my dog would miss me but it's got to the point where I can't even take the dog for a walk because I just spend the time thinking about how lousy my life is and how I can't see any way out.

Anybody want to tell me to cheer up and pull myself together?"
2209,"Hi

Been dealing with depression for 20 years am in my early 30's now.

Been really struggling this last week, spent days in bed, crying, wishing I could escape myself, hating myself, planning how to end it. 

So when I see the news about a UK celebrity ending their lives it makes me think they had friends, a future, a social circle, good looking, everything I don't have and they still where so unhappy and ended everything so what hope is there for me.

I know how incredibly selfish this sounds and everyone has their own personal struggles but it really makes me think.

There doesn't seem to be any escape from these feeling, I keep thinking if I make new friends and if I get surgery to look better or if I'm skinner il be happy.

Really make me think to the outside world she has so much to live for and it wasn't enough I have nothing to live for so what is the point not giving in."
2210,"Hi *sigh*

I'm going to keep the story very short, but feel unsure of where to turn or where to go to start sorting my mess of a life out.

-32 years old. Single, was engaged but she ended it two years ago due to some of my issues (Not my depression).
-No job, no career despite being very intelligent (I was studying a Masters degree way back in the day).
-I am a Carer for my mum, who suffers from Bipolar amongst other things, have been officially since my dear Dad died.
-Ended up in hospital recently for half a night following a mini breakdown, but am now scared to go to the doctor, as i recently finally passed my driving test (at 32, i know, lame right?) and don't want my license taken away because the doctor assumes the wrong thing. 
-Have had 2 or 3 jobs in the last couple of years but had to quit all of them due to my depresion in one form or another, or not being able to cope with the job.
- Managed, by some miracle to land a placement last year with an IT company - managed to screw that up too.
- Feel a loser, a failure and a waste. Not sure where to turn at this point, feeling I've used up all my chances.

Right now I seem to be in an endless loop of ""Feeling crappy - Chance of something comes up - Something else, out of my control often, stops it from happening - Any optimism i had is gone - Repeat.""

- Example from last week - Was invited for an interview at a job working in a bank, all going well until they discover I have a default on my credit file (Which was not my fault and I've tried previously to fix). Said default stiopped me from being put forward for the job.

Maybe posting here may if nothing else allow me to breathe a little, see what others think, and start trying to make a mess of the life I've largely screwed up til now. Any adivce on what might help with the depression and maybe trying to move forward. I'm aware i need to go to the docs, but that doesn't help with everything else.

If i'm glad of anything, it's my few amazing friends, and my gorgeous kitty. They keep me going day to day.

Rant over, have a great day everyone."
2211,"I’m just so sick and tired of life ... It’s not getting any better and I’m afraid it will never get better... maybe it’s best to just quit trying ... I don’t want to live but I don’t want to die either ... I’m living in this terrible in-between state, neither alive nor dead... I guess this is what some would call ‘hell on earth’."
2212,"I'm losing my mind.. The isolation has finally got to me.. After 5-6 years.. I haven't seen anybody all day. My life is like a sci-fi movie.. Like I'm the last person alive after some disaster has wiped out everybody else.. 
'Lonely' isn't the right word.. 'lonely' suggests to me the want of some positive relationship with somebody else... I'm 'isolated'.. I just want 'any' contact with the outside world. I'm sliding down a greasy pole.. And at the bottom there's self-annihilation.. Its only a matter of time...
I don't want another day like today.. Like this week.. Month.. Year. I'm stuck alive.. And I really don't want to be.. I've herd all of the arguments for staying alive.. But they never seem to pan out..
I've been trying.. I really have.. Small positive changes.. But then I have a day like today.. I only got through it by popping pills.. But I'm all out of spares now, so tomorrow is going to be a nightmare.. 
I don't have any kind of a future.. Its just me stuck in this pokey little flat alone... I'm never going to recover from this.. There is no escape... I'm turning in to a crazy old man.. I don't want to be weak and feeble.. To scared to go out... The only thing I want is to go to bed tonight and die in my sleep. Its coming one way or another."
2213,"I have been depressed for about 16 years. Though the last year it got better. I found a new purpose in life, a new direction, I worked hard and it payed off. Though recently my depression and anxiety has come back. It's due to some recent discoveries and I'm posting this here to perhaps get some advice on what to do.

So, after working really hard at a new craft which I thought I was getting good at. (I received a -lot- of praise from my peers on how fast I was learning and how quickly I made progress) Then recently one of the senior people in the buisness started nit picking -everything- I do. I'm gonna call him ""Bob"" If I was doing something, Bob would give me a new task telling me to do it immediatly. And then start critiquing that I didn't finish my last task. (Even though, I work faster and more efficiently than said person.)
Bob also started telling me that what I was doing was wrong and decides to always take over my work a few minutes before I was finished and then finishing it himself.
I've approached this with the mindset that the person was right, that I wasn't smart enough or that I was too slow that I didn't fully know what I was doing etc etc. But then over the past few weeks I started reading up on a lot of techniques that I have been using and it seems many people out there do the tasks the same way I do. So I came up with a plan, I started asking Bob to explain how to do a certain task and he would go on ""you need to do this like this and that like that"". Then I'd wait a couple of days and recite what he had been ""teaching"" me asking if this was the correct way to do it. Bob would immediately shut me down and tell me I was wrong. I now have the feeling Bob is trying to sabotage me. But with my usual mindset I'm still not sure. I just feel so lost. I don't know what to do, it's like this every day. And I'm now feeling like I should just quit. I don't know if I'm wrong, if Bob is wrong. If the others at work were just being supportive or if they were mocking me. I feel like a joke. When anxiety gets real bad I have Valium (5mg) and I have started to use this more and more often because after work my head is spinning with all these negative thoughts and I can't relax. Constantly stressed about going back to work. Every time I tried confronting Bob with my ideas and plans he would shut me down before I could finish a full sentence (Much like my parents) and then go ranting about some word he picked from that sentence. Without hearing me out. (Also much like my parents.) 
I'm going to the doctor tomorrow to get a new referral to a psychiatrist because I feel like I've poured all my energy to finally become good at something and get a sense of self worth, but now I feel like it's crumbling around me. I'm in a really dark place."
2214,"Everything I do just doesnt make me happy. I know that sometimes we need to do things that dont feel good. But for me thats all there is. Nothing I do is worth doing its just connected with costs and unpleasant feelings. Friends, love, hobbies, family, conversations and all that comes with life never really made me happy. 
I workout, I keep doing stuff, metting with friends or family but for what? It only makes me anxious, bored , aggresiv or depressed.It never outweighs the negativ parts. I dont expect anything from life anymore. Why should I?Its been like this for all my life. Now the only thing left to do is waiting around to die. Doing nothing would be the same as being dead so I will just keep on doing things that are never worth it until I dont need to anymore."
2215,"For the past 5-6 years I've not been myself and unable to shake off whatever this is.  At first I thought I was depressed, so I did things that are seen as fun, I went the gym I went on holidays, theme park days out with the family I take the chance to go car meets with my friend when he ask and yet I still feel the same.  The issue is that I feel no enjoyment, happiness, furfillment or any kind of emotion throughout anything I do in life.  I'm just going through the motions either because I'm trying to will it to happen  hoping It will make me happy or because I've been asked to do it.  I remember going the gym for weeks looking around at everyone in there asking myself why I was there, and I said to myself to get big and then I questioned why I needed to be big and then it leads to a dead end...it's for nothing... Pretty much everything from speaking to people to daily things end the same way.  I don't work because I don't care about money, and I don't care about money because there's nothing I want or care about to spend the money on.  My emotional state never changes in a positive way.  My family can be speaking to me about something and I'm just humming away with a blank expression on my face like an empty vessel going through the motions of life."
2216,"Note: I typed this up with the intent of showing it to my current therapist, who practices acceptance and commitment therapy and has given me a dysthymia diagnosis (no meds). I get weird, fleeting “bouts” of depression that come and go very quickly and my life feels like a constant struggle to avoid or appease it. If there’s anything else that’s unclear, please feel free to ask me in a reply and I’ll try to clarify it.

I don’t know how to word this exactly but the lull of suicide seems more tempting now than ever. Since I wring any enjoyment out of anything I do, like a wet towel, I’m just increasingly aware of the fact that I’m gonna run out of ways to keep myself happy, the world will run out of interesting things, time will keep progressing linearly (I know that’s not scientifically accurate but whatever), and that I will eventually die and that my life is just a series of stratagems to try to not feel my inevitable CAUSED BY NOTHING, OMNIPRESENT depressive waves that reoccur in cycles. It just makes me feel so empty that I’ll have to put up with this forever and that people aren’t normally like this. I can’t cope with life if it’s gonna turn out this way for me. I’d honestly rather be dead if it means I get 100% knowledge over how I’ll feel and that I won’t be subjected to the mental wear of having every little tiny thing I do constantly having the threat of a depressive relapse hanging over it. Whenever I do anything fun, or, not even that, when I feel any kind of positive emotion, the realization kicks in after a few minutes that I WILL be depressed again and some days I alternate so rapidly between the states that I don’t know how to confront it, prepare for it, or do anything about it anymore. It’s like I have someone spying on me 24/7 and will call the SWAT team on me if I do something wrong, except I have no idea what that is or why I should or shouldn’t do it. All this stuff about living outside my own brain or trying to get it down to more external factors may help a very tiny bit in terms of not outwardly acting on these feelings or getting super upset, but they aren’t hitting the core problem of I NEED THESE WAVES OUT OF MY LIFE ENTIRELY. There’s a distinct moment in my life where I stopped feeling happy and started feeling like everything was a struggle and I legitimately didn’t want to be alive (and still don’t). It was when I was about 13. My point is that there’s something going on underneath the surface here that’s still not getting poked at, and I refuse to accept that that’s just “how it is” for me. I’ve tried accepting it and now my moments of happiness are corrupted by pervasive suicidal thoughts and the feelings of hopelessness to escape the way my brain functions because a couple chromosomes had a little too many/few cells or something. I’m so incredibly tired, and I can’t even feel sorry or care about other people because they don’t understand shit about it. They can try to console me or tell me that they care, but this isn’t related to this at all. I know it’s not my fault! That doesn’t make it any better. Any lifestyle changes I try don’t make it better either when that persistent suicidal voice is right there in my brain, like a cockroach surviving a nuclear explosion. I’m just so tired of being so in the dark about how to treat this problem, and I’m tired of bouncing around different psychiatric services trying to guess around and bullshit an answer that alleviates the symptoms, cuts off some leaves without uprooting the entire tree. Give me some medication or shock therapy or neurosurgery or something. The main problem is something is fucked up in my brain that’s really not my fault, and it’s frankly unfair that I have to put up with it. I don’t want to live if the rest of my life is going to be like this. Call me entitled or whatever, I don’t care."
2217,How do you cope when all you want is to have a companion and no one is there
2218,"I am loney, bored and would like a friend.
I am 54, 55 in May. I am a UK citizen. My wife and 12yr old Son are US citizens but obviously he has duel citizenship.
They are both in the US. They left 14 months ago. We agreed to do this because his social worker was going to take us to court to have him put in foster care because we moved around a lot in 6 years and so they said we were not fit parents allowing him to settle in one area, one special needs school...etc.
So they are over there in the US. I couldn't go with them because the last time i entered the US i stayed 7 yrs illegally. So i am now banned. My own fault.  Pah!
I am here all alone, no friends, no family and in this area nobody wants to talk to me. So yeah, i am on medication for depression and social anxiety.
All i would like is a friend. Someone to chat to,  just to make me feel i am not alone.
Anyway, if i don't hear from you then that is ok.
Send me an IM.
Hope you have a good day."
2219,I really want to be more positive. I’ve been told that I’m very negative. I have very negative views about just about everything because of my depression. I’ve been considering being more positive for years now but I still have a lot of baggage and pain that controls my life. I’m very passive and I feel like I’m a victim.
2220,I'm so stressed my anxiety is through the roof. I am drinking even day to stop myself from slipping into a deep black abyss of depression. I'm being evicted from my apartment. And I only have 5 days to come up with a plan.
2221,"I am a college student who is flooded with homework and I don't have time to just sit back and enjoy my time anymore. Every day is a miserable cycle of completing and receiving work. Nothing is enjoyable. I want to get good grades and try my hardest but I also want room to breathe. I know this isn't really depression, but I feel like its headed there. I'm only in my first year. The first semester wasn't nearly as bad just because of the types of classes I had. I don't know if I can go through another week of this, let alone another 3 years. 
In the rare instances where I do have time to enjoy myself, I don't do what I really want to because I lack the motivation or I feel like there isn't enough time to even bother. 
I am also getting so tired of this that it is very hard to focus on studying for my upcoming exam. I tried taking a break, but I need a longer one that I can't afford. This is making me very anxious because I know I won't do well if I don't study. 
I also spent a great deal of the time I had to study this weekend sleeping. Why do I need 13 hours of sleep in one day just to feel somewhat not tired. I usually get 8-9 hrs of sleep in every night. 
Basically, what do you do when your life is just objectively depressing."
2222,"My problems first started off when I was about 17 when I developed IBS which pretty much stopped any plans I had in its tracks. I become scared to leave the house, go out with friends or do anything in fear of being caught short. As time passed everyone moved on got on with their own thing and left me behind apart from one friend I see every few months or so.  I was completely aware how precious my youth was and that it was being wasted away unable to do anything about it which made the feeling of impending doom harder to fight the older I got. Fast forward this went on for years until I got into my mid 20s until i started to learn how to manage my IBS about two years ago.  I got myself out with the family on days out, holidays, theme parks and finally manage to get my driver's license and a car, things I once wanted from life...

Now this is where my current problem beggins,  the impending doom feeling I was talking about? Well that I slowly fizzled away into nothing and that's exactly what I felt...Absolutely nothing.  When it went away it took my ability to enjoy anything with it, everything I do even things that a normal person enjoys feels empty to me. All the thing I said I've don't since I managed to control my IBS have been done with a blank emotionless face, not sad but not happy I'm just there going through the motions.  The only time I ever feel anything is when I'm reminded  of what I have lost, when I was in the theme park I seen a bunch of college teens infront of me in the que around the age I would've been when I stopped living and reality hit him that I was no longer that young teenager, with friends and a future I was a 26 year old hanging around with my mum n dad in a theme park  clinging onto a period of my life that no longer exist.  To this day I can no longer feel enjoyment, happiness, furfillment, love I can't even engage in conversations properly as I don't care enough about what's being said to be able to think of a reply that's suitable."
2223,I am 33. Never had a partner my whole life and my parents are desperately trying to convince on how to know someone and create a family. They are like there is no life without creating your own family. They just made my depression worse. I feel like I am mentally retarded when people talk to me that way while I am struggling to finish my college. I hate to be seen as someone who needs advice on life at this age
2224,"I have the flu right now. Can't sleep because of my fever and I keep coughing so it's keeping me up. The problem is my doctor refuses to give me more than 1 week's worth of antidepressants right now. I have an appointment in 5 hours (it's currently 4am) to get this week's prescription. The weather is awful, cold, extremely windy because of storm ciara. If I go out I'll get even more sick but if I don't go out to my appointment I won't have any meds left. Idk what to do I feel like whichever I do im not gonna win.
Edit-I don't drive and I don't know anyone with a car because I've isolated myself, public transport is practically non existent in the little village I live in. Gp surgery is about a mile and half away so it's not like I'll only be out for a few minutes. I'm just trying to decide which is going to be the best outcome."
2225,"Hours ago I started feeling suicidal and it was very painful.... and I just realized that this will not stop. Not tomorrow, not years from now, or not ever. It will always be extraordinarily painful, and meaningless. I’ve been dealing with this for 5 years and it has only gotten worse. So I want to end it soon. I just cannot take it. People are evil, life is meaningless, and suicidal pain is so unimaginably painful. And nobody cares. It would be much better to die because, this life isn’t worth living. I can’t imagine feeling this way even 1 more time.  I have been crying, in bed barely able to move. Barely able to think. Why does this much pain even exist? Life is so cruel and I just can’t do it anymore...... I need to stop being stupid and actually end it"
2226,"Just been to doctors and seen my practice mental health nurse.  My appointment was to be half an hour, but got approx 20 minutes I think at the most.  As I’m very depressed and anxious I’ve kind of come out of the appointment feeling not helped at all.  Feeling teary in the waiting room, nearly walking out as trying to smile and look like everything ok. In tears with her and very conscious of what she was going to write on the computer after me leaving. 

She was smiley and did a risk assessment on me (that is what she said she was doing). Honestly my head is all over the place and hardly slept last night because of the winds.  I don’t know whether I’m coming or going.  I’m not even sure what she said. I just know I was offered group counselling or one to one.  She said there is “help” out there, but I said there isn’t as we are all basically alone. (Years of experience). 

I now have another appointment with her in 3 weeks so that she can “keep an eye on me”.  Does this help me, not at all. I am alone as I previously stated.  

She wants me to go on the Sertraline as I’m very depressed.  It’s ok for her to say that as the drug companies do push these tablets.  I think I know better, or perhaps I’m wrong.  I’m more scared of the withdrawal symptoms down the line and this makes me anxious , so why bother?

In my private hell at the moment....nobody can help.  “They” say they can, but no, I ultimately have to do it for myself as I’ve had experience in the past where “they” promise the earth, but it’s all a load of crap, for me anyway.  

A very disheartened person. I know I sound a barrel of laughs, but my reality sadly.  Any views or similar experiences or indeed any positive experiences also welcomed?"
2227,"Hi everyone.
Today I'm going to share my story with you all.

When I was in my mom's womb, my mother never got proper meal, instead she was been tortured and beaten up , not only my father , but also my mom's and his family never respected her and my father used to beat hrr publicly so his family members.  She never got proper care, instead was blamed for eating which she never did . properly. I was born but wasn't safe been there .as my cousins molested me several times and we didn't have anyone to talk to as we were all alone and could not case on them as money was an issue.  My mom worked in a semi govt school, Private schools where also she had to listen to lot of negative words for her as she didn't have any option and many times she was rejected and times were hard...going empty stomach, coming empty stomach... taking tuition after school... prepping meal for family, Washing clothes, cleaning the drained pipes chocked due to tobacco' chewed by my father... cleaning the dirty toilets to the  water flowing out if chocked pipes and consumed tobacco spreaded all over the floor.. washing so many clothes till late night in winters... staying up late night and waking up early ... getting money for my father from her parents and getting beaten up if not given food on time and keeping lights off for my father to sleep and father giving nothing at home.  This is how I lived and never made friends at school and stayed all alone..was being bullied many times by the teacher and my classmates...tried staying in hostel when I decided to do B.Tech( which I did forcibly by making an excuse or blackmailing my mom of committing suicide and I did opt for PCM in class 12th by the same tantrum). I was being insulted by warden of the hostel for not saying ""Ma'am"" to my seniors and not wishing them.  As it was big thing if I'm not doing that it means my parents didn't teach me good sankaar.
This was the case, I stayed in hostel for an year but staying all the time in a room and with no interaction left me with no hope to stay for rest three years in.the same cage. So I made up a decision to stay in the paying guest , there again my anxiety made me to change three paying guest Houses within fee months only and I came back to home with all my belongings and decided to commute from home to hostel as the college where I did my engineering was just 1 hr away.  After I did my engineering I got offers but didn't have the courage to go out as my. Experience so far was worst. I decided to stay at home and prepare for some bank exams with low confidence and no desire of what I aspire for. I did teaching but challenging environment couldn't allow me to continue for more than a month. I changed and changed and only one place I completed an year and there too my work wasn't appreciated and I made mistakes too that's why my coordinator used to insult me every other day that sweepers knew and they used to say on my face that don't do this otherwise ma'am will shout at you..(my coordinator used to say me mentally disturbed and much more openly).
I did at one more place but due to cleanliness issue and no more will to work I left it after hardly 5 months..now from last year of September till now I'm at home with rarest interaction with people.. I'm so frustrated everyday that I don't want to work...many times in tension I don't eat food for two days or three days maximum.. I commit many mistakes...I don't apply my mind and I'm writing everything today and didn't have anything since morning and I am not feeling hungry either...I am very alone . Very scared...I don't have the courage to suicide because my mom will have to hear many things as she is suffering from.thryoid. sugar, bp, stone and knee pain.. she's still suffering from.tensions and I'm adding up more tensions by being alive.  I'm not helping myself and I have booked up a slot in Vipassana for 4th March to 15th march in Dhamma Lakkhana, Lucknow.. I hope there will be some changes..I hate myself and I am.not even trying to find the conveyance to reach the center.due to low confidence and that's why again my brother is getting angry on me and he's not allowing me to go ..because I don't see my safety.. I'm really lethargic and no concern for my family
.my mom.was hungry and I didn't prepare her food too... I'm really mean I need to die..pls help me anyone..pls help me.. I'm getting weak (mentally and physically both). What do I do?"
2228,Three different things happened today that felt like a slap in the face to my worth.  How can you reverse that feeling when you don't have the opposite feeling coming in from anyone?
2229,"Not sure where to start here. I´m turning 30 in a couple of months and I feel like I´m approaching a dead end. I have been alone for pretty much the entirety of my life, introverted personality type because I was never really taught or encouraged to interact in social situations when I was a child. The last few years have been very tough, the feeling of being an outsider and seeing people together in happy relationships with their loved ones makes me think I´ll never be able to achieve this due to my depression and negative thought patterns that I have been struggling with since my teenage years. I have been doing my absolute best to get my life together the last 2 years, got a job, a girlfriend, going to the gym 4 times a week, eating healthy, vitamin supplements etc. picking up a variety of different hobbies, taking different courses to meet people, going on dates through dating apps. I had to force myself doing these things while dealing with severe depression, reoccurring suicidal thoughts and I feel like I can´t continue doing this anymore, I´m just completely fatigued and tired of being alive. A month ago I feel like I lost a potential love of my life because of my depression and introverted personality. She broke up with me, but I´m almost certain if I wouldn't have had this heavy depression to carry I could have projected more positive energy into the relationship and it would have worked out. I don´t know where to go from here on... I guess trying anti-depressants is the only thing left, but I´m highly skeptical they would help me. There are times at night, around midnight, though very rarely when the depression lifts and I feel happy, and energized for a short while, it´s completely gone the next morning though... being with that woman made me feel hope for the future, I could see purpose with my life with her, but I know it´s the wrong way of going about it... I can´t rely on someone else to give me purpose and joy in life."
2230,"Someone I really liked from Primary school committed suicide and I’ve been upset ever since. Maybe it’s stupid of me to be upset since We haven’t seen each other in a long time but I always thought of him, hoping he’s well. I’m not sure how to deal with it. No ones really taking me seriously about it."
2231,"Hi all! 
So, I'm still trying to discover whether or not my elevated moods are from bipolar or this is just how normal people feel...although, at the moment, I feel I might be coming down from my high. But here is what my elevated moods look like. Feeling a sense of calm, and yet there is anxiety too. Like well, it's a mix between anxiety and excitement sometimes, but atm, I'm feeling calm and mellow. Does anyone get anxiety when they are not in a depressed episode? (I understand there are different types of depression, so maybe you have the anxious type...these are all theories though, it seems). What about sleep? I get a healthy 7 to 9hrs right now although it still takes me awhile to get to sleep most times. When depressed, I can sleep up to 13 hours and still feel tired. I've been feeling super after the sleep and my morning coffee lately.

What else? Thinking more clearly, or just thinking more. Do you ever get the feeling like you're thinking too much? Like a little too excited? Or is that just me and more a ""bipolar"" type of elevation?

I can't think of anything else. Does this sound familiar to anyone diagnosed with major depressive disorder? Is this a normal elevated mood or does it sound extreme? I've already asked folks in the bipolar section about this topic, but I want your opinions now.

Thanks!"
2232,"Disclaimer: This Post is very long. Thanks to all who read to the end. 

I’m 29 now and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was a child. It started when I was in elementary and one of my classmates made a rude comment to me. I’ve been living a miserable life since. I have a few good days, some bad days with a few good moments and some outright horrible days where I feel like I just don’t want to live at all. The ONLY thing that’s keeping me from taking my life is the fact that I know I’ll go to hell. I try to dwell on the fact that this life is only temporary. I try to act like I’m fine and nothing’s wrong but the truth is I’m HURTING SO BAD, mentally and emotionally!!
No one respects me.  I have a sister that is 15. My mom respects her more than she respects me. My sister doesn’t respect me. 
I work at a Pre K center. None of my coworkers, my supervisor or the kids respect me. I DREAD going to work every, single day. I HATE my life. I just want my pain to end. My supervisor and some of my coworkers treat me like I don’t exist. They talk over me, they don’t listen when I talk. They are extremely rude to me and because of my childhood and the reason for my anxiety and depression, I don’t ever speak up for myself because I feel so vulnerable.
I’m just here on Earth taking up space. I just hate being disrespected. I treat everyone with respect. It’s hard to take up for myself when I don’t have any self confidence and I feel extremely vulnerable when it’s time for me to talk so I don’t ever say anything. I go home feeling horrible and I take it out on my family or my boyfriend when I leave work. 
Also, this is my 4th or 5th job. I have my BSW but I’m not in my field. I’m a Teacher Assistant. The only reason I work with kids is because I feel sooo vulnerable when I talk to adults. The kids don’t respect me at all."
2233,"You know what its like I dare say we have all made plans, but I cant get it out of my head, I have worked it out to the minutest detail and its frightening, I  dont want to but it is drawing me in, how to stop this crazyness."
2234,Sorry everyone. I am new here but am going to post.  Today was so hard. My wife and I are fighting and I was honest with her about something related to how she reacts to things and I regret it. I just want peace. I want my family to be happy. Suicidal thoughts have been creeping in ( nothing to serious but it is increasing) so I just thought I might need some input from others. How do you all deal with stress that makes you just want to hide and cry?
2235,"I'm not sure what my limits are. if I can leave the house I should be fine to go to a meeting right? even though I have this reasoning, my support worker doesn't agree with me, says I'm putting too much on my plate and overwhelming myself. I feel like I should be capable of more than he is suggesting. how do you know when to say you can't make it?"
2236,"I've been very suicidal for a while now. I've been fantasising about it so much that it takes up my entire thoughts. I know how I'm going to do it. I have a note written out. 

I'm not afraid of dying, I'm just scared what will happen if my attempt doesn't work. I'm miserable everyday. I hate myself. I feel so worthless, isolated and I just can't cope with the mental state I'm in.

I hate the feeling like I'm being selfish to the people in my life but I'm like an animal that's in pain and needs to be put out of its misery. There's no point in me living. Really, I'm not living, I'm just existing."
2237,"I have been recently re-assessed for a diagnosis of Schizophrenia. I have been told by my psychiatrist for the past year or more that I have no evidence of Schizophrenia, and was labelled with Bipolar. But in the past two months I came clean that I have had symptoms and diagnosis of Schizophrenia in the past, and that I don't really experience mood swings or anything like Bipolar. I've actually had Schizophrenia in remission for a few years. I also have been dealing with substance use issues, and I'm clean and determined to stay sober.

I have trouble describing symptoms. I feel no energy or motivation. But I don't feel that darkness that is what depression is like. I cry more than laugh, I am not happy without coffee or something to stimulate it. While I try really hard to feel joy, it's been a struggle to feel anything. I just started Wellbutrin XL. I'm hoping this will lift the energy fog. But I am also nervous about it bringing out more symptoms again. I have not had much luck with anti-depressants that altered my mood and personality and usually made it worse, hence the prior Bipolar 1 diagnosis.

I am not even sure what the difference is between Bipolar 1 and Schizophrenia with depression.

And on the flip side, I sometimes wonder if the symptoms would go away if I got off the medication and got healthier. My symptoms have been in remission. I do not think I would get worse, but everyone has scared me into staying on medicine so that the symptoms don't return. So that's where I'm at. I am fairly happy with it though right now.
Has anyone ever considered that schizophrenia could be an extension of untreated major depression? I have heard the term psychotic depression. I know more about schizophrenia than have symptoms of it. I love to research stuff online and I educated myself enough that I should be able to know the difference between a delusion and reality. 

One slightly uncomfortable issue is age, and that I'll probably have a very difficult midlife if I don't continue treatment to prevent any issues in the future. So I'm on medicine to PREVENT symptoms not to treat them. I find it a little hard to deal with because I don't want to be on medicine. But my mom also has had a history of intense depression and now has schizophrenia, and she would also refuse medications to help her if it weren't for her being on a monthly injection as opposed to being expected to take pills every day.

2238,"Guys.
So today my teacher called me and told me I can't have home lessons anymore (I'm having home lessons for about 2 weeks now cause of depression) cause of my living situation.
So I can't pass school because of this.
Yeah kinda bad.
Even worst, my ex who broke my heart 1 month ago lives like in some village 40 km away from me, so chances of running into him in my city in valentines day are like 5%? 
Yeah about 5% too many
He didn't even said ""hello"" or anything.
Just like we don't know each other anymore.
So that kinda broke my heart even more.
Yeah not my day."
2239,Who’s awake
2240,"I think I might post more about my situation, I've posted before.

I feel some guilt for not socializing often with my family. I'm in my early 20s, I live with my family at home. I am depressed and I don't have energy to do physical things, (doing cardio exercise is hard work and not enjoyable until I'm done), or socialize. I am an introvert naturally, so I tend to like my alone time. I talk to my family here and there, I don't ignore anyone, I don't have a bad relationship I simply don't want to do anything. I feel bad that I don't want to socialize or get out to do things, I also have low self esteem and don't like how I look I do my best and take care of hygiene and eating healthy and good habits.

I have a low libido, everything's normal doctor checked with blood tests, and haven't dated before which bothered me for 1-2 years now, but it hasn't anymore.

my goals are to function, sleep, work (school), eat, drink water, eliminate bad habits, I even think very pessimistically so I have consciously decided to stop swearing, if anything related and stop pessimistic thoughts.

I just want to be average, I really fear needing to get a job next year, I will be done college by December this year if all goes as planned. I fear that my mental health will still stop me from getting a job/career needing to interact with people when I want to stay in bed/be left alone. I want to eventually get my own apartment, car, support myself. I don't see myself getting married.

I feel like a mess."
2241,"I just feel at the moment that Life just isnt worth living. Im 25 (m) and have been battling depression and anxiety for most of my life, its literally taking my life from me. I am terrified of the future and getting older. I'm not very rational and often erratic and dont trust myself these days when it comes to making decisions. I feel like im forever trapped in a vicious cycle as i hardly leave the house. Im tired 24/7 and sick of this constant suffering. I'm not very comfortable around people anymore and feel doomed."
2242,I keep having a urge to leave my family for a while . I have seen my physiatrist  with my husband  and he has given me more Meds  which makes 5 different  tablets . I feel I need some peace and no responsibility for a while . Space to sort my head  out . My husband does try to understand  but it is hard for him . Does anyone else feel like this
2243,"Hello everyone 

I’m severely depressed.  I cannot think about things as I used to.  I’m scared 😱"
2244,I've had enough I so want to die 😔
2245,"My name is Jeff. I have been dealing with clinical depression since I was about 16, I’m 34 now. I grew up with an abusive father, both physically and emotionally. I was a star athlete with straight a’s and nothing I ever did was good enough for him. I was still abused, called a failure regularly and was physically abused for no reason whatsoever. This continued regularly so it became embedes in my brain that I would never amount to anything. Regardless of what I did, it was never good enough. So, the idea of being a failure has stuck with me for life. Throughout the years I’ve tried MANY medications, endless therapists and psychologists without any success. I’ve never been able to embrace my dull potential. Nowadays, I lay in bed excessively. I barely make it to work and have lost all close friends throughout my life. I think EVERYDAY that I would be better off dead although that’s not an option I would ever follow through on. Thorought my life, I’ve developed severe anxiety and paranoia with EVERYTHING. It’s alwyas the worst case scenario. I’ve lost everything I used to love to do. I simply sleep and go to work. I’ve lost hope in getting the right help answer proper treatment . I’ve tried nearly everything including intensive outpatient treatment. I don’t want to be like this and cry everyday because of it. It’s hard to be social, is rather run away and into my bed. I feel like I’m reached a dead end. I don’t know what to do.. I’m miserable from the second I wake until the second a fall asleep. I don’t know where to turn or what to do. I feel my life has been a waste. All this self worthlessness has been embedded into my brain and I am completely out of answers. I’m hoping to find encouragement and a sense of direction of how I can gain my life back.. I want to be happy. Every single day is an extreme struggle. Again, I feel like I’d be better off dead.. my mental illness is far greater than your typical depression. Help."
2246,"A few years ago, I was a top student with several scholarships, awards, exchange experiences, work experiences, and research experiences going in one of the top universities in my country. I have a considerably high IQ, great family background, excellent social circle, and people often called me a genius.

But now, just a few years down the road, I can't even will myself to get out of my bed and leave the house. This has been happening for a few years, and I always manage to neglect to work on the only thing needed to obtain my degree, my final undergrad thesis. This year I'm turning 25, and it's supposed to be my last chance of finishing up my thesis, but I just can't seem to get out from the hole, and I don't know why.

I always had some depression symptoms going on when I was a kid, but after I got into university, it just got a lot worse. My best friend, who I regarded as the only person close to me, died when I was in my 2nd year. At first I tried neglecting my emotion, trying to make friends with everyone and doing everything just to keep my mind busy. I was trying to be accepted, to be friendly and cheerful like she was, so that I can feel this void and won't have to feel so empty if someone left. Few years down the road, I had a lot of friends, great prospects, but somehow I feel so... lost? 

I avoid intimacy and keeps people at an arm's length. I just can't truly say what's on my mind to anyone, at all. I was wrapped in this gold glittering foil everyone seems to see and like, smiling everytime, enthusiastically doing anything, but deep down I know that none of these people would be with me if they knew the real me, a sad old ball of dirt hiding inside the foil.

Simply said, in a snap, I lost a lot of 'close friends' got my works tumbled down because of my constantly recurring episodes. Now I shut myself in my home, work by myself from home, and I don't meed anyone except my family, who I constantly avoid because I know they're worried for me.

I don't know why, be it my inability to process emotions, final year pressures, lost sense of identity, my family circumstances--every little things in my life just suddenly blew up right in my face and I completely shut down. And I just want to give up.

Since I was a kid, I knew that I wouldn't live to my 25th birthday, and most likely would take my own life before then, thus why I always felt confusef when I was aked to write a life plan. I never have wanted to have a boyfriend nor have I ever imagined myself marrying someone, because deep down I know, I will take my own life in the end and I don't dare to involve anyone else in it.

I've done some extremely stupid things I'm not proud of, multiple attempts yet none was successful. I managed to hide those from my family and friends so far. They might have suspected that something was amiss, but none of them dared to confront me.

I tried help, really. I went to some therapy sessions, had discussions with experts, explored numerous religions, got some prescribed meds, but in the end that emptiness just keeps coming. People used to call me ambitious, but now I can't even feel the fraction of what I used to be. It feels like I'm grappling on empty air.

The thing is, I feel like this kind of ending is not bad. I just want to finish writing a book for my best friend, then just close the chapters altogether. I don't have the will to survive anymore. I already knew that my life would end as a tragedy since I was in grade school.

Tell me, how do you get back from this?"
2247,So Ive just had as much as I can take I have struggled for years and now I've got to the point I don't want to be here anymore. If not for my 2 kids I'd be gone. They would not have anywhere to go. I have sole custody of them due to their mother living with convicted pedo. So them going there when I'm gone is not an option. This is the only reason I have not gone yet. I'm finding it harder and harder everyday though for this being the reason not to just go to sleep
2248,"i messed it up. the only person who ever showed interest in me. i had tto actt clingy and ruin it. i messed it up at every turn. i destroyed it. She moved on because She's the righteous one in this, and im tthe one tthat deserves the pain. i just wish i got a second chance.
i can't
but i think the pain has been enough punishment

i want it to end

i dont want anything else from life so it stands to reason i should att least get tto finally rest"
2249,How do I get on with college when I vioce in my head and thought what huts myself
2250,"I feel like I’ve lived every bit of happiness I’ll ever experience, now all that remains is suffering... This much suffering shouldn’t be allowed to exist... Anyway I hope things work out for me otherwise things will start getting very intense pretty quickly"
2251,"I ask this question all the time. Nothing seems like enough. Life just doesnt seem worth it. Even the good things. Nothing makes any sense. I hate all of this. I have alot of self hate. But i also just have hate for life in general. Even when i love life, it just doesnt seem to be worth it. This all feels like a joke. I honestly, in a very philosophical sense, cannot come up with any reason as to why any of this exists at all or why it SHOULD."
2252,"Okay, seriously, what is the point to any of this fucking nonsense??? Why do we have to live and be appreciative of the life we've been given? Ive had plenty of moments of happiness in my life, sure, but really, in a deep, objective sense, is there any fucking point to any of this? To this thing we call life? I dont even see the point to things like love. It makes absolutely no sense. Life is absurd and i honestly wish i were dead or hadnt been born at ALL. I wish life never existed but it does and now im fucking stuck here confused and angry wondering how tf i even exist and realizing existence means nothing. Does anyone have an answer to this? I just dont see the point at all, even happiness just seems completely arbitrary."
2253,"Such a difficult day today and I can’t see me improving any time soon.  Added to my personal struggles is the fact that my son has some form of OCD and is continually swearing at me and is taking control of our house, things like laundry.  I did it today and he rang me up from home...I was shopping which was a great effort for me to do.  I thought I was doing well and my mobile rang as I’d gone to get washing tablets which he wanted amongst other things.  He said “I’d fucked up the laundry” as I’d put underwear with towels. I thought it was just tea towels that was the issue. That was so lovely to hear from him as he put the phone down on me. After I got home after an altercation he proceeded to do it all again including the dry clothes that were near to the wet laundry. :doh:

Not nice to hear when I’d personally made extra efforts to see my gp and get a referral for counselling today (very hard for me and crying my eyes out in the surgery). I really want him and his girlfriend to leave as he’s making my life a complete misery and is only because we care that he’s still living with us. I do feel for his girlfriend. He’s nearly 23 and not paying rent.

As I’ve said in the title...I don’t actually really want to face tomorrow as the crap just starts all over again. His OCD is something new to me and I can’t help thinking that it’s my fault that he’s the way he is.  I don’t even know him any more and he always takes his anger and frustration out on me.  I worry for him, but it seems I always get the full brunt and he manages to be mostly civil with everyone else it seems.  Being a caring mother I do worry about him and I’d much rather go through it myself than see him suffer in this way.

That being said he is a little shit quite a lot of the time with me, but it can’t be easy for him having to endure the way his mind works. 

Your thoughts please on my dilemma?"
2254,"has anyone tried or considered trying low dose mushrooms for treatment of depression.i am reading that the psilocybin in magic mushrooms can treat depression.of course ,legallity, availabilty,and not knowing the specific strength of whatever supply i get become factors in this. if youve had success can you give me a rundown of your regiment . is there an initial session of a high dosage , then a daily, weekly,monthly micro dose? are you breaking it down to powder so the dosage is consistent? was the relief immediate?   i dont want to go back on lexapro,it was effective for my depression but i found out the negative effects it had on me After i went off it.  horrible withdrawal symptoms -brain zaps,suicidal thoughts . i know youre thinking -well it worked -just stay on it , maybe I'll have to . i would be willing to try a low dosage thc tablet but live in a state where its not legal and i dont have access to it. i have tried plain old hemp pills and they dont do shit."
2255,"I have a high pressure job - as an example, one of the jobs that I did got someone killed. I can’t figure out how to pay my bills without the job, but I can’t keep going to work. I dread every day. I can’t get new work - I am 55 years old and have no other skills. I’m to the point that suicide seems like the only option. I can’t share that with anyone in my life because I don’t want to be stopped. Thank you for giving me a safe place to say how I feel."
2256,"Hi All,

I'll try to keep this short since I have a Psychiatrist appointment in an hour. I'm desperate for some med.to work.
All I'm needing is a suggestion on what medication worked for you IF you have treatment resistant Depression + G.A.D.
Let me add, I am actually a Mental Health Counselor myself so please don't post saying everyone is different or cannot give medical advice etc. Not being rude just desperate. 
Also I DO NOT have HEALTH INSURANCE so I CANNOT consider ECT, Vagus nerve, or ANY OTHER NON-MEDICATION Treatments. I am also VERY LIMITED with what the sliding scale clinic can prescribe.
I have tried almost tried almost every drug, almost all SSRIs, SNRIs, Welbutrin, Elavil, Lithium even mood stabilizers like Abilify, Topamax, another?, Lamictal.
I had been on Effexor and Welbutrin for over 10 years and it worked okay, not cured, but not suicidal. Back in October it stopped working completely so tried Cymbalta, that was awful, made depression so much worse. Currently on Welbutrin + Lamictal. That helped the Depression but not anxiety. 
Now Depression is back worse than ever. Can sleep 20 hoursa day, don't want to leave house, go to work, all of it.
I could go on but have to get ready.
Anyway, I just need any  suggestions of medication or combinations.

Thank you!"
2257,"Hey, first time post on here so bare with...

A few months ago, after a downhill spiral before hand mostly caused by increased drug abuse. I fell 35ft whilst in a club, whilst on a lot of different substances. 
My memory of the months before and a lot of my life are wiped, i move back home temporarily (at the time i believe just for my broken ribs and punched lung to heal) 
Two months later I'm still at home in the deepest depression i've ever experienced, having suicidal thoughts, not being able to leave the house, feeling completely lost. 
Then being told i have post concussion syndrome and trauma from the accident, on top of clinical depression and anxiety.
At the same time as all of this i find out i was close to loosing my job before the accident due to my behavior and my closest friend cut communication with me, at the same time as a lot of other friends move away.

So with the world passing me by, im just here now feeling so alone, lost, hopeless like my life isn't worth it anymore. I have no plan for the future and any thoughts of such panic me, I don't even know where I'm going to live now as my own place is a big trigger and causes me near panic attacks. Im still sick from work, being a barman i can't imagine returning yet, even though I've been off for 3 months.

I'm now on my second try at diff antidepressants and am sober, im managing to socialise a little but then have big down days after. Every single day i just feel useless like im not doing enough, like i just want to get back into life but it scares the shit outta me. I know recovering from depression isn't quick, but i feel useless and like im just letting it happen even know i know im not.

How do i go easier on myself?
Thank you for reading, really <3"
2258,"I've been with my partner 5 years

I've always seen traits of depression from not too far into it but hasn't been to bad. Ups and downs but nothing like my mum or even me in my worst bought.
Really, she's better than me.. Until last couple of years.

Job and caring about it but not feeling connected, caring about state of the world etc all feed it

But now a potential medical physical condition has really set it off. To a point where by I fear that if it is arthritis I'm worried she might mentally give up. I'm scared if she gets the bad news she'll never be the same


Already the anxiety of this is having a profound effect. Evenings are 'flat' conversation is strained and she just retreating inside.

I've had a very similar scare a few months back and know exactly what she's going through. I've also had depression (mild) in past and been on medication (once)

Few differences are she doesn't seem to tell anyone (family) , struggles telling doctor where I push and push and just self isolates. Shuts me out quite a bit too.
I also am very good about only worrying about what I can control (ie not world hunger). I guess ignorance to this I can't control reduces anxiety for me

Intimacy is bad, it was a big signal and clearest one she's not happy. Both sexual and hugs etc. It's never been this bad. Ever.


So I'm basically terrified of the future.
Not being able to do anything to help
Losing who I loved as a person and maybe physically
Finance things like mortgage if she can't work, I can't quite pay it off she gives up work

It also makes me anxious and I feel the negative thoughts I deal with coming back. Anxiety mainly


If the news is bad I'm worried she will lose her identity, give up on the relationship and who knows what else"
2259,Hi guys I had a Psychotic Break and been super depressed ever since... one of my biggest worries is if I will ever be able to get back to work ... its been 6 months already and I find the prospect of getting back to work terrifying... I’m afraid I’m so fragile now that I won’t be able to take the long hours of work 9-6 again... has anyone been like this ? Please help
2260,"Throughout my life I’ve constantly been unable to attain anything I wanted, and as such I’ve struggled and accepted what I already have. I don’t want anything at all really, just something that resembles a life.

For nearly three years I’ve lived in almost complete isolation. I have three contact numbers on my iPhone, all family members. I don’t have any social media because, frankly, I have no one to speak to. I work a dead-end Job, where I’m given no respect by work colleagues. Everywhere I go people constantly belittle and disrespect me, which has left me isolated.

I recently passed by driving test and got my first car. I was stunned by how unimportant it all seemed, I’m indifferent to it all now, nothing makes me happy. I had thought perhaps it would have changed things, ‘opens your doors’ people tell me. Truth is it hasn’t. I feel more emptier than ever.

I despise myself more than anything in the world, I’m utterly devastated by how my life has turned out. As the days go on I become more suicidal. I’m thinking July would be a good time.

I’ve tried to meet people and move on but it works both ways, no one wants me so why keep going? I’m only fooling myself at this point.

I wish things could have worked out differently."
2261,"I am a 57 year old,,recently retired ,life long depression sufferer with a good marriage,and a non depressed spouse who is Dead Set against medication.i tried for 2 years going off the Lexapro that gave me some relief from my symptoms. I liked the idea of not being dependent on the drug and tried with zero success ""natural"" cures. CBD oil,st John's wart,even mushrooms. I live in ny and I can't experiment with low dosage thc because if the illegality. I probably should go back on the Lexapro but am so indecisive and lethargic about even the tiniest decisions ,let alone one that big. My wife is supportive and realizes my depression has me in a bad place right now, and has even told me to call the Dr.   ..but I sense there is underlying anger and I know she thinks the Lexapro turns me into a different person. But I also Was a different person a few years ago. I am a borderline alcoholic and would binge drink close to a case of beer every weekend as well As using recreational drugs. I am sure this didn't react well with the Lexapro and may have altered my personality.i have since cut back quite a bit on my alcohol use.i guess I'm looking for advice.Its really hard being in this weak state of mind making life altering decisions knowing that they effect not only me ,but the person I love ,need ,and respect more then anyone.my adult kids all feel I should go back on the drug.i know ultimately it's my decision but here I lay in my couch,hoping someone else makes the decision for me. I think at some point here this morning I may call the Dr, ask for meds, take the meds and hope soon that ny state legalizes marijuana so I can give low dosage thc a try. If I were to use pot now ,it would be more for recreational purposes,It does not help or reduce my depression in any way and depending on the circumstance,makes it worse.i mean,I am 57 years old , at some point I cant worry about the long term negative effects of the meds, am I going to do nothing for a miserable 10 years and be in my late 60's having just had no quality of life for ten years.my wife and I do talk, but it's hard for me to talk,convey my feelings in this weak state of mind.thanks for this forum ,just typing that out helps(doesn't cure anything though btw so keep the advice coming)"

I'm always anxious and have brain fog and my mind wonders alot. Sometimes even when im standing up i feel as if i could collapse any minute. Just wanted to find out if anyone else can relate?"
2263,"Recent studies show that the increasing use of social media platforms are becoming a major cause of depression and anxiety. Today's generation is highly equipped with all the electronic gadgets and they have all time access to the internet and hence they tend to spend more time on that instead of interacting and connecting with their peers in person. This creates a gap of emotional connect between them. After some time they feel isolated because they could not find any one for them with whom they could be emotionally connected with to share their feelings and hence slowly and gradually they move towards depression.

What are your thoughts about this link between increasing use of social media and depression ?"
2264,I got three calls this morning. Usually it's none.  One was business related and they were wanted something from me.  Two were people i know who acted as if they called as a friend but really wanted something.   At first the 3 calls made me feel a little good....later I just realized all I am to them is what I can do for them and it made me lower than I was before.

I just dont know what to do now, I will be alone and free to do as I wish."
2267,"I've had severe depression and anxiety for about 8 years, treated on and off. I had a handle on it a few years ago, I thought. But it's back and it feels like there's a part of my mind that just takes to mental screaming whenever I try to get past my symptoms. It feels like medication is the only thing that can help, but the ones that were working best started causing seizures. 
I have moments where I have to turn into myself, curl up and put my head down and wait for my mind to settle. I have days where I cant smile and can barely interact with anyone. 
My concern here is employment. I've run into issues myself but also watched coworkers get screwed just because of their mental disorder. Like 'oh you're sad sucks for you we're not here to talk about our emotions we're here to work' . What if I cant find a workplace that understands? What if I cant find a job that I can do well, where depressive episodes and panic attacks dont really hinder the job."
2268,"Hi everyone,

It's sad that my first post on here will be kinda saddening for you guys to read and I am sorry, I am actually a very happy person overall and love to have a laugh, but please let me tell you my story as at the moment of writing this, I don't even know who I am anymore, I am completely lost.

Basically I split up with my girlfriend of 3 years,  3 months ago, and everything was all weird, up until 2-3 days ago I was still chasing her as I loved her to pieces and wanted her back, I am 24 years old and she was my first love, I never rushed in to these things and thought she was the one, I am not the boy to sleep around.

Anyway around a year ago, I noticed a change in her, just something didnt feel right, I was showing all my love and getting none back, arguments started, things just changed. Prior to all this she gave me an STI twice, but swore it was from her ex and that the first tablets i took didnt work and the doctors said that might of been the case but me being me I totally ignored it and believed her as, she is so innocent, very attractive (only on the outside). From then on I caught her talking to a boy once but she got her mates to prove it was nothing so I also let it go, bearing in mind I am now a bit paranoid of whats going on. I want to believe her but its incredibly hard, she was so close with my parents and she was working for my dad on a full time job that he managed to get her and she didnt have a job.

For months, I thought she liked one of my mates, infact his literally a brother to me, I have known him for 15 years and I would of done anything for this guy, and I mean anything, I even trusted him more than A when I was with her, because I know if anything happened I could rely on him of all people, more than my actual family at times, in the past he saved my life when I was having seizures and we was so so so close, I even met him 4 days ago for a meal then came back to mine to play console like good mates, I literally see him everyday but the last 4-5 months he started getting a bit distant, and also tried getting all his stuff from mine that his left here before.

Every time I questioned him if anythings going on as I just had this feeling he would always reassure me like ""wtf mate r u crazy your like a brother to me i couldn't do that to anyone let alone you"".

The last year of my lfie has been hell, thinking I was honestly going crazy, I thought my brain was putting these thoughts in my head, and every time i said anything the answer would be, ""its because you sometimes smoke weed your heads f*ucked"" and everytime I went for a drink I would see them look at each other but it got to the point of where I thought it was me being a shitty untrusting boyfriend, but the whole time my best mate basically a brother was sleeping with her. There was nights I couldnt sleep when she would go out and I would text D and they would either deliver at the same time or not deliver at all so I knew something was going on but he just kept saying its a coincidence, I don't even like the look of her all that stuff.

His like family to me and when I said it to my parents even they said ""dont be so silly curtis, liek D would do that to you"" so yeah basically the last year of my life has been a huge battle in my head and 3 days ago he admitted to me all this time he has been seeing her and broke down on the phone to me.

I was literally speechless, and now not only have I lost a girlfriend I thought i could trust, ive lost my best mate of 15 years and its like he dont even care, the worst thing is I still love him like a brother but at the same time really want to get some revenge in some way, I feel like im honestly going crazy if i dont do anything but i Know if i were to seriously hurt him I would also feel bad as I am too soft, so many holidays we been on, we literally done everything together and this is what his done to me.

I also found a sex toy in his car a week ago and he got akward, and about 4 months ago the last time I had sex with A, she asked me ""does it feel different"" and then laughed. I honestly dont know how I deserved this, I feel like my whole relationship was fake, and the girl I took to miami spent my savings on gave my heart to, was just using me, and my best mate who went out for meals played football with was just doing all this behind my back. How can someone be so heartless, all i want for my mates is for them to live a happy life, and if they were to split up with their partner god forbid, I would only try to get them back together.

I have so many sick thoughts another one is as a joke I said to him ""when you going to get yourself a girl or a boy who cares"" and he went hahah I dont need either thanks and smiled, like how can you be that sick I was crying in the guys arms saying i miss A and he was tellingme i can do better and all that. I just dont get life :(

I don't wish how I feel and what's happened to me to anyone and this is only 10% of the story, I now feel like im never going to be able to trust anyone as I have lost my closest friend who i trusted with my life. I am now a broken man and am lonely hoping for a brighter future.

Love you all,
Curtis"

2270,do you ever feel your not good enough to have such good people in life like all my friends and family are so fucking awsome just gennerally great people and i feel like i dont deserve them lol i dont know why i feel like it and i feel like it makes me isolate myself from them i never was like this when i was younger and have had the same group of mates my whole life its just so werid hahah  i want to be the person i was 3 years ago but idk how to get back to myself again
2271,"I just entered university last year and its supposed to be the best time of my life, making a whole lot of new friends and joining activities and camps that are very much exciting. 



But it's not.



Im feeling very much miserable right now. 

I dont really know what is going on in my studies. I dont know half of the time what i am studying and i have trouble just catching up. I try my really best to study and work hard as much but things arent just working out. it makes me feel like i will never amount to anything and will never accomplish anything good or worthy... then whats the point..?



Relationships. I am so very insecure and i find it hard to reach out to people and be myself. What is ""me"", anyway? Who am i? Sometimes i wonder who the real me is. Im always concerned about what people think of me and i always end up creating this nice and safe facade that wont offend anyone and that just restricts me because i end up being a really boring person. I have some really good friends around me and am really grateful but... sometimes i wonder to myself what is it they actually like about me? or do they actually even care? 



I feel like i will never find love because of my miserable self hatred... I have never dated before because... I mean there were guys that reached out to me but i always created this wall to block them out simply because i was scared that they would see the real me and not like me anymore. I was just really scared of rejection. I guess you could say recently I have been trying, going on dates and talking to more guys but i feel like im getting more and more miserable because im just really shy around guys. I think i can only be me after i interact with someone for a long while but i feel that most people would not stay that LONG for me because im too ""boring"".



I have no skills or hobbies that i particularly enjoy now. I give up way too easily. I used to play music but there were just so many talented people around me and i felt like i wasnt improving or going anywhere so i just lost all motivation to playing an instrument. Things that I thought I was good at are all very small compared to other people.



People around are changing, forming new friendship, getting into new hobbies, getting new boyfriends... And theres just me who's inanimate. Im still the same old me who has not taken a step forward while everyone is already at the front running miles ahead of me. 



I know i shouldnt compare but I just cant help it. And i ended up hating myself a lot.



Im just really tired now. Tired of trying. Tired of motivating myself when in the end i still end up feeling shitty about myself. I somehow wish that some virus can fall upon me or get into some accident so I can peacefully get away from everything. But life is not that easy. Life probably wants me to continue my journey of self hatred because this is their way of tormenting me. I can only ever be free when I stop caring about everything and start loving myself... which seems very much impossible."
2272,"Hi, I had a major psychotic episode and I am now eternally depressed (despite use of anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medication) how do I get out of it?"

2274,"Hi everyone, I started on 50mg of Sertraline last month for depression but found it had lots of side effects, which made me feel a lot worse. I was on the 50mg for 6 weeks but couldn't take how awful I was feeling so have been on 25mg as of last week. The side effects have since reduced greatly and this drug is clearly not for me. I saw my doctor and she prescribed 20mg of Fluoxetine but I am unsure of the best way to switch over to it. I am considering just switching straight over because I have only been on Sertraline for 7 weeks and the last week I've been on the lowest dose. I don't know if this is the best thing to do though. I have seen differing suggestions, which has left me confused.

Can anyone advise me on the best way to switch?

Thanks!"
2275,"Started to spiral at a coworker's happy news (big promotion, without trying, networking right place right time kind of deal) and i just feel envy and resentment that hard workers get nowhere and i wasn't born with the lucky 'tag' that makes me good at networking and being social.
So i am spiralling.
I have started to beat myself up about feeling envious and resentful rather than happy and have now convinced myself i suffer from covert narcissism so now i am afraid i am 'stuck' and there is 'no hope for me' and that i am a 'bad person'. (Things i would probably not say to another person who needed hope but i treat myself with contempt with harsher rules for me than for others).

I then took a learned optimism test and got very pessimistic hopeless results. So that was fun.

I now just feel really dark and hopeless, have thoughts of ' i hate my life and wish i was dead' floating around in my head (i wont do anything though), feel a dark weight on my chest and just feel really depressed and hopeless like i just dont know what to do and if i did i still wouldnt do it. Like nothing can ever change or help.

I am thinking also of how some of my friends and my husband sometimes post yo facebook when they struggle with depression and get such thoughtful supportive replies.

I will never do it because i fully believe i will be treated badly and with contempt and rejection if i did it (one rule for me one for others) and it is very lonely.

I am part of a schema program online and i dont feel i can post there anymore because people kept telling me i just need to DO things and one woman just told me i get swallowed by my feelings in the moment and that maybe id never be as happy as i wanted but could still get somewhere but i needed to take action and do something event if i felt bad like she does and then she got pissy because i didn't reply to her sage advice in the timeframe SHE wanted because it hurt me! 
So now i feel i have nowhere i can talk and be heard or understood. I feel alone."
2276,"I think I am done with my life... I simply cannot see a way out of this... It’s not going away... I just want to die so bad, but I don’t want to kill myself for my parents’ sake... I cannot live and I cannot die... Suffering is all that remains..."

2278,"I recently appealled a decision at work on my absences. But I am totally feeling out because of something odd. 

The notes given to the appeal manager seem to have been edited. They now have my original copy but I am so paranoid as editing them feels like it was trying to make me sound less reasonable (I noticed when the person holding my appeal asked where I was referring to in these notes) I checked mine later and several paragraphs were removed from their copy.

I'm anxious and confused and paranoid about the whole thing. I don't understand"
2279,"Been really low today, husband didn’t understand.  I don’t understand, so I’m stuck with it.  I had a glass of wine last night, I usually avoid alcohol as it makes my depression worse.  I was visiting my sister, so had a glass with her.  Why does alcohol now affect me this way, it made me feel good last night. I used to drink it and it would help with my social anxiety and the day and days after it didn’t adversely affect my mood.

Is it because my depression is worse that the alcohol affects me so much? (usually a couple of days later in this bad way) or is it because I’m around 50 now, that my system can’t tolerate it the same with my ongoing anxiety and depression? Any views please?"
2280,"I'm in really bad shape. I lost all the hope for happiness. All my life, and I'm only 19 yo, is stress. Alcoholic father, my brother with neurosis yelling at me, no money in family, bulliyng in school, fake friends, health problems, and now as I had some luck with love, I lost him. So right now I'm like in hell. All alone with my depression and all that bad stuff. Heartbreak affected me most. Now I don't believe I will ever be happy. I know I'm young and that I have all my life, but after all I've been through I just can't believe anymore. My relationship lastet a year, living in trauma, cause he was always unsure if he can be in a relationship, is destroyed me and led me to suicide attempt. I don't see any benefit now from being a good person. I'm always the one getting hurt, people always leave me literally always. 
I'm nowhere."

I constantly consider killing myself, and I don’t do it. But really I should because nothing works. I really don’t want to be suicidal for 10 years, and it happens a lot to people. I’d rather just not be alive at all. It makes me so jealous seeing people happy and this life is so unfair. It’s more than unfair it’s not worth living."
2282,"So hard losing what I did, my protest spot, my house of ten years, the city I loved so much. Makes me so angry. I just feel like my mind is in a really dark place right now. Just had to vent."
2283,"I have always probably had minor forms of anxiety, which have manifested themselves in a few ways throughout my life, however I was first confronted by mental health problems in a more serious way, these past few years, such as anxiety and depression. I feel like my issues and reasoning perhaps are not as ""legitimate"" as other people's problems, which is what annoys me and also prevents me from talking to my mum about it, or seeking out professional help. I know it sounds silly and not like a normal, conventional problem, which is what frustrates me and annoys me as usually finding common ground with people is a good way to move past and heal from things. A few years ago, at the end of 2017, a bit of my hair was ripped out by a rucksack, and i then started to stress about it as I think that I thought it made a big difference, although no one probably noticed, but it was just my anxiety manifesting itself. My hair then did begin to fall out, and we visited the doctors, and it was nothing to do with iron deficiency etc, so they concluded that it must be stress, and although I had mocks at that time, I concluded it was because of the situation with the hair. It is now a few years later, 2 years, and my anxiety has just been increasing and has been at its worst these past few years, but most of all, I just really hate the way I look, and feel like I don't look like myself. There is constant reminders of self love and self worth today and how important this is, and obviously I would like to love myself and the way I look - I am so jealous of all my friends who feel pretty, not in a narcissistic way, but just normal, as people can look in the mirror and feel nice. I remember how that used to feel, but I just never feel that anymore - I feel like I look different, and I hate the way I look, I hate most photos etc, and I just don't feel like I look like myself at all. I know it sounds like such a narcissistic and egotistical problem, but I just want to feel like I actually look like myself, and I don't want to miss the way I used to feel about myself. I knew that it was bad when a few years ago, or perhaps last year, I started wishing that other things had happened instead of this such as a member of my family dying - I love my family so much, so the fact that I started wishing that in a twisted way as it seemed like something I would be able to get through, rather than this, is extremely problematic and I knew that, but it was just a symptom of the situation. When I was younger, not younger but a few years ago, I would look forward to the future, ""dream"" of it, and versions that seemed appealing, in order to deal with the present, which I feel is quite a conventional method of self- motivation for many people, however now I do not feel like I am permitted to that, I can't quite explain it, but I can't do that any more. This is incredibly inarticulate, as I never really speak about it, and this has been quite hard, however definitely writing this is the first of many steps. I just get annoyed as I have the best friends in the world, I love my school, and I love my family - so I just want it all to be right, I don't quite know how to end this and I have explained this all very badly, but I am just wondering if anyone has ever gone through anything similar or has any advice? Thanks"

2019 was a great year for me, I decided I was gonna be more confident and turns out all you have to do is fake it, I faked it and it actually worked. I am indeed more confident than I was. I made some changes and decided to be nicer to people and it's working I guess. People are treating me nicer.
I thought everything was going well until I started having some nigthmares a few weeks ago. 
These nightmares involve me killing someone else. I always do it in my old college room. 
This would normaly not scare me but I've read online that these dreams may be telling me I have to be careful with my aggression. I don't understand this, since I'm the calmest person I know, I've never been in a fight. Hell, I haven't even punched someone. I don't know what these dreams might mean.
I'm scared that I have a lot of anger inside me ready to burst but I don't know about it yet. I've suffered my entire life and my childhood was not very good. Never had friends either, so I don't know if I have bottled anger inside me.
I see everyone around me be better at everything while I sit here with absolutely zero talent, zero ambitions, zero goals.
These dreams are bittersweet, when I'm inside them I feel terrified, they are very realistic. But when I wake up I feel a tremendous sense of relief, knowing that it was just a bad dream and the cops aren't actually looking for me lol.
I need help from someone who might understand about dreams to tell me what this means. I already hated myself but after these dreams I'm getting worse I think."
2285,"Hi All, 
Just posting as Im feeling pretty Crappy today like a thick fog is hanging over me. 

I'm not sure if anyone else has been suffering from depression for a number of years, have you ever got to that point where you've had enough and the fog won't lift and it's just getting thicker and harder to see the sunshine? 

I've had depression for about 18 years and it's always been up and down but the last year I'm feeling really fed up with it and have been having stronger and stronger thoughts like what's the point, I'm here living this life but never happy even though I try to clear the fog. Its been a scary feeling this last year and I feel I'm running out of options/motivation to keep going. 

Has anyone been here and got any wise words? Alternative  Treatments they've come across in the last ditch attempts that have really and truly helped? 

At least its Friday tomorrow! :)"
2286,"In the past when I have self harmed, I always end up with marks on part of my body that are unusual. I rarely get spots other than from this. It really confuses me because it happens every time but when I google it, I can’t find anything about it."
2287,"I'm 72 years old with an 11 year old dog and wanted to be a gypsy all my life. I have been suffering from depression for 17 years and I'm managing that and anxiety for god knows how long. I have no friends and no family to speak of. I hate where I'm living. I'm buying a house and have no equity and 8 weeping willow trees in my back yard which show I don't have any common since but my IQ is a little above average. There is no place I want to move to. I just want to get into my jeep and travel around the United States. My biggest fear is having anxiety attacks traveling. I have an income of $2,500 a month and I'm in no hurry to go from one place to another. Another big problem is I don't know how to make friends. I need a plan of attack and I'm not sure where to start?"
2288,"My wife wants me to go to therapy for depression and anxiety. She sees what's going on with me.

But if I go to a therapist, I have to be 100% honest and open, with no secrets, etc. And that is where the problems start coming in.

Almost all therapists are very liberal, left-leaning. Nothing wrong with that, but I feel I will be judged harshly if I go talk to one. Why?

1. When I was living in Europe as a teenager I got involved in some pretty bad political/ideological groups. Committed some crimes, and lots of bad things happened in those days. I was ultimately deported from the country I was living in, and while I have a much better understanding of life, and a more nuanced view of people, I won't completely disavow everything I was involved in just to seek approval from a therapist, or anyone else. I am who I am.

2. I am struggling with my marriage to some degree. I feel my wife doesn't completely understand or trust me, and is dismissive of my artistic and literary endeavors. The consequence of this has been an *almost* emotional affair with a female friend, who is younger, feels deeply about things as I do, appreciates my inner qualities, etc. Yes, this sounds cliche, but there are things I can talk about with her that I cannot talk about with my wife, and while I have no intention to turn this into some full-blown affair, it is a delicate situation. Platonic love for a woman is a balancing act. 

I feel a therapist would be uncomfortable with my ideology and politics, and would be judgmental about my marital situation. So while I am depressed and anxious, I don't want to get a lecture, or be thrown out of someone's office for simply being who I am. My views are complex, and so are my problems.

Am I wrong here?"
2289,Hi boss asked me to work at other site next week and asked if I could do overtime she said are you sure I can't and I said no and she said you always do it here so they might question why you can't there it annoyed me the way they took mic and expect it all the time
2290,"someone I was talking to mentioned to me that a friend of his died because of a broken heart- her son had been killed in an accident a few months before

and it really hit home for me and really made me upset

here's my mother doing anything she can to avoid me and get me  out of her life- yet here's this woman, dying because she lost her son

I don't know... it's just going to stick with me

why are my family not caring.

guess I'll never know the answer to that one"
2291,"i really don't wanna go on anymore and i've felt like this for so long but right it is so much worse than its been in years. im so unhappy and tired but i have my family who would be so devastated if something happened to me and i've been living for them this entire time and i really don't want them to be upset. i already feel like such an inconvenience when i'm alive i would only be even more of an inconvenience while i'm not. i tried to bring up getting admitted to my mom but she said she didn't think that was a good idea and that i've never been to the adult psych ward and i don't really know what that's like because i haven't been admitted since i was 13 and i just shut down because i dont want to bother her. i dont want to bother anyone. but living is getting so much harder.... i've been trying to put in job applications because i need to come up with money so that i can pay off old college debt so i can go back to college but i can't even answer my phone or leave my house so i don't know how im gonna be able to work. i was seeing a therapist a couple of times maybe 4 times but then i missed my last appointment over a month ago. i tried to call to reschedule but i felt wrong about it... im really struggling to open up to him and so whenever i go there he just basically tells me put in job applications, get your driver's license which i know to do... and i know it's stupid but him telling me all these things that i know i need to do but i'm struggling to do because i'm fighting the urge to stay alive just make me more depressed..  i dont know anymore. i dont know if any of this makes sense. i just needed to get it out. i know im the one not doing enough to battle my depression i know im not working hard enough its just hard. waking up everyday feels like running a marathon but maybe im just being lazy. i dont know."
2292,"Even people that claim to be my friends or those that claim to love me never have any time to actually come and spend any of it with me. Maybe its just me but I cant be friends with someone that I only have contact with via text messages or that I get to see once, for maybe an hour, every 3 weeks or more. I need actual interaction. I invite people over to come do whatever but they always have some excuse. Or if they do say they will come they cancel last minute or are super late. Am I really that horrid to be around? Why does no one have any time for me? Why is it so hard for people to show up to anything anymore? Whenever anyone invites me to come hang out they are shocked when I show up 5 minutes later. Like what, did you not expect me to come? You invited me I said sure and then came over. Whats so confusing about that? Is anyone in this world not a giant flake besides me? I feel like people just make up excuses or flat out lie to avoid being around me. I cant stand being alone anymore."
2293,"This is my third thread here... I do not suffer from depression per se, but I suffer from debilitating anxiety. Waking up with a racing pulse, hyperventilating during panic attacks, it simply exhausts me physically.

I wake up tired and every single thing that I have to do absolutely drains me physically, and so I go round and round because I need to gather every bit of energy that I have in order to accomplish even basic tasks, which only makes me more anxious about being so useless.

Part of me feels that I have lived enough, I have been so fortunate in my life, I've traveled all around the world, I've been blessed to meet many wonderful people, but enough is enough. I know how to cookie crumbles and how to life cog goes, and I don't think I wanna be part of it anymore if every single day is draining me with anxiety and fear about the future."
2294,My mood is very low. I’m constantly exhausted but struggle to sleep. I have an appetite but can’t keep food down. I’m passively y suicidal in that I’m not actively trying to kill myself but if I die so what? All I do is lie in bed and watch Netflix and play on my phone and listen to audiobooks. I cannot face life.
2295,"hello to all 

i am 30 years old and have problems with patience all my life, i never could be patient, like i didnt finish college beacuse of that, i couldnt lose weight or start to eat healthy.

All my life I was more of a loner and i have problems with social interactions, if i get in a fight with someone i start to get aggresive and its hard not to lose my temper. I am thinking that I am a sociopat beacuse somehow I dont care about others a lot, like about my health, my family, now i have 3 months old daughter and I dont really care about her like my wife, I didnt plan to have a baby and its hard to deal with a fact I have a baby and for me it just isnt a big deal, i dont see nothing positive of having a baby but only negative, also sometimes I get really angry on her beacuse she dont stop crying and I just want to hurt her , my emotions are switching from positive to negative but in general i dont like having a baby and also beacuse i hate the sound of crying beacuse we sleep in the same room. So can I change I dont take any meds but i am thinking to start that. I also have two phisical fights with a prople beacuse i couldnt control my anger.

Am I just a sociopat and no drugs or therapy will help me beacuse I really dont have any heart, I dont care about my daughter , i cant love her and show simpathy but she just goes on my nerves, the same goes to my other things in life, i am really lazy to do anything, I dont care about my health, about my educatiion, plus i notice I am really selfish person, so please is there anything i can change and how."
2296,I'm losing friends because if my temper
2297,"hey guys -

lately I've been on an intense back and fourth between getting out of my house, working at a better job, being around people I love, and feeling really healthy and independent and happy, knowing I'd rather be alone than have a partner who only gives 5%. But when I get home and I'm in my bed and it's later, my mind starts wandering, and I feel ridiculously lonely and depressed - even moreso following the grief that I've had to go through.

I feel so lost in the idea of finding a partner who wouldn't run from the baggage that I have over losing someone, dealing with trauma, anxiety, depression, etc. I know how to be alone and how to take care of myself and am actively taking care of myself. I just feel like I picture some of these people I like being with girls who have no trauma/PTSD experiences, who don't have to deal with depression, and who fit this category of ""normal."" 

I just really miss feeling like somebody loves me and wants to be with me, and sometimes it's really hard and feels so far away since I've gone through what I've gone through. I love my career and my friends more than anything and am making it my biggest focus, but I won't lie that it gets really lonely and I see all my friends with partners and I wonder why it isn't happening for me too, and I miss it."
2298,star is such hard work and I don't think im coping im so useless
2299,"I've been keeping busy lately, but still it's struggle at times. It's frustrating when you start to feel more like yourself and then you feel down again. I'm usually able to sleep good which helps. Still dealing with anxiety, but it doesn't seem as bad as before. Some days I have more of a depressed feeling mood than others. I've never been in this situation before and it's just tough. Hopefully each day gets a little better."
2300,Inaccurate actually I did sleep 9n the fifth night for 2 hours but am exhausted . I have a party to be at and all I want is for this farce to end.
2301,It feels like  a darkness living inside me dormant ready to act  I dont want to hurt myself...willingly with thought put into it I dont want to be in pain... I just want the pain to end...thats why if I had the chance to end things instantly I would... but I have too many painful options right now.. i just want it to end I dont like feeling this way I have felt much better. thinking of shutting everybody out of my life because they dont get it... I make things worse when I feel this way which in turn makes me feel even worse making me lose that control giving it to the darkness that wants me dead... I have sought help in the past I hated it It didnt help it and I hated taking medication a friend of mine who has anger problems angrily told me that I need help and its not normal to feel this way (duh) basically threatened me to get help Im not going to get help IT DOESNT HELP IT MAKES IT WORSE presenting the problem when the problem is life itself  maybe I just see things as a reality and it hits me differently  I  dont want to hear advice from people who dont have depression issues  they just judge and potentially make it worse  I want to give up but there is a battle between my will and this darkness  people dont care all they care about are there selfish selves if I were to die a month from now people would go back to there normal lives I am never going to mention anything about my depression again to people who dont experience it but I already did the dammage so its already done now I am going to be looked at as this pathetic suicidal human when I dont look at my friends like this but  they want me to give the system my time and money when it doesnt help what would help is having certain things in my life like love but I dont have that in fact I believe im just a waste of space I hate myself for letting it get to  this... hopefully some of you understand dont give me a weapon this all happened because I related how i felt to my buddies class but it  turned into something about me ..i hate talking about me..never wanted to even start a woe was me
2302,"Hello guys,

Might be wrong forum section.

I dont really know if I expect help from you or if this is just a way for me to  express a part of myself just for the sake of it. Last night was pretty bad for me and once again I dont know what to do. 

I have always had this feeling that i was sexually abused when i was younger but I have no memory of anything like that happening to me. I dont remember any weird person near me, i dont have any flashbacks or nightmares or anything. 

I always get a feeling similar of feeling lost, when thinking back on my life. There is that part that i remember, the things that made me a sad teenager and the things I know why they made me sad. But then there is this invisbile part of my life that I have no idea about and i have no idea how to explain it or why I even feel that there is an invisible part of my life. Lost is the only word i can find for it. It is like the brain constantly is trying to figure something out. But what? 

I get utterly emotional when thinking about or watching a documentary about child abuse or rape. It can get me to cry for an hour and sometimes it gives me a small panic attack, and for some weird weird reason - i somehow get the feeling of relating to it. I think thats the reason why i often tend to watch movies/series/videos with this exact topic, because it feels like i can relate to it which makes me ""Enjoy"" watching it. Almost as if they express all of it for me, because I cant.  But i might aswell be wrong. I have no idea.

I remember being a happy kid who loved my life. I was good in school and I always had friends to play with. But when i was 12-13 something happend. Everything turned into something completely different. I went into a depression and I dont really know why. Why at that specific time? My life kind of crasched and this was the start of years of depression. I am 25 today and i am still depressed. The past, maybe 3 years have been better in periods tho which i am very glad for.

The years went by. I become 15 and at this point i didnt want to live anymore. The suicid thoughts came. 
I started smoking cigarrettes when i was alone. When i was 16 i started smoking pot with Friends now and then. Not on a regulary basis at all. 

To this day i am still a virgin(my own choice) and i dont really know why. I do find sex scary when thinking about it. But doesnt all virgins find sex scary?

I am a lesbian.

Just a few years back i went into an eating disorder. Or I was actually never diagnosed but my physician threatened to send me to an anorexia unit if I didnt start to gain weight.

I have a diagnosed social phobia and my self eateem is very low.

I dont know if these things say anything or not but thats kind of my story when focusing in the ""did something happen to me?"" question. I wish i could explain it better but i am so bad at this. When i am having a meeting with my psychologist I am almost quiet the whole session. I dont even know why i go there once a week. Thats alot for not talking
 
I have tried to just stop think about that but i cant. The brain always gets back to it no matter what. 
I know it would probably be better to not know the answer but I do need to know even tho there is impossible. Therefore it probably never happend. Or maybe there was something else that happened? 
I cant let go of this"
2303,"Hi everyone.

I am a 29 year old male from San Francisco, California, USA who has never been able to have a girlfriend and am still a virgin despite not wanting to be. I turn 30 in October. Since today is the first day of September, I am naturally quite concerned that I will be turning 30 next month being in this state.

I have always been a shy, introverted, anxious and awkward person. Perhaps I spent too much time studying, focussing my entire life up until my mid-20s on studying. I studied two degrees in university, mathematics and pre-med molecular biology, thus having twice the courseload of a regular student. I neglected my entire social life, and had no dating life to speak of. I spent basically the whole day trying to stay afloat with my studies. My only other serious hobbies were and are introverted activities, such as competitive chess and foreign languages.

When I was around 25 I felt very lonely and sad that I still had never had a girlfriend and was still a virgin. I felt pain knowing that to be a virgin this old as a male is very taboo and looked down upon. I joined meetup groups, met some interesting people, and went on a few dates, but it seemed that women just did not like me.

So here I am at age 29 and 11 months old, still without a girlfriend and still a virgin. I feel very depressed and enormous shame for how I am. I feel depressed as well for feeling missing out on love and sex like most males my age.

But what really pains me is seeing and hearing comments from women that someone in my situation must be very weird to have always been single and a virgin. Especially since I am not religious, so I am not practising abstinence at all. I just simply ended up this way.

I would like if any female members here have any opinion of this. I have lived most of my life in USA and went to uni in Britain. But my general impression was that both American and British women would find me totally undateable, unattractive and a weird freak due to being single and a virgin at almost 30. I hope my fears are not true though.

Any advice/thoughts would be appreciated."
2304,"I'm done. I'm fucking done. Fuck this world and fuck everything. 

Don't comment about ""help"". It doesn't exist. I hate everyone and everything and I wish I was dead. 

No one can really help me I'm useless and just as good as worm food and until I'm dead I'm gonna find out how I can get back at humanity for being shit. 

Maybe I'll become a ghost if those exists that'd be pretty cool. 

No one cares, and no one can be trusted or forgiven in this life. I truly hate this existence and want it to end. 

Ban and kill me for all I fucking care. I hope this ball of dust burns to the god damn ground."
2305,"Sooo, I am currently the only thing holding myself back from shipping out to basic training for the US NAVY. Why you ask? Short answer for now; The military does not allow you to seek, or be on psychiatric medicine while going through the enlistment process (or really at all if you would like to have an active military career and not be stuck behind a desk). This means I've currently been off of all my psychiatric meds for 5 months now, ANDD I hate myself because I keep using weed to help me cope with my problems. You obviously cannot have that in your system at all, and I feel so stuck where I am due to everything happening in my family and around me. It's my fault though. I am holding myself back and making the same mistake over and over. Also It's not that I'm doing it on purpose I'm not scared to go or anything, I'm excited; It's the first good thing to happen to me in about 3 years. I'm just not strong enough with everything going on, and weed constantly being around me whether it be family or friends that are doing it. But today I try! I need to get through these 30 days. If I can't be strong enough to fight this battle how will I be able to fight any other."
2306,"Let's get to the point.

If your born in England, and you legally don't own any land/house etc... Everystep you have ever taken has been because someone has said you can go there, weather it be family, friends, ... Public land I guess.. how public is public land? Could I grow food there? Nope, that's illegal, I know, crazy right.... 

So I'm born on this island, and I have no real human rights to anything.... 
Can't grow food for free.
Can't build a house.
Can't hunt or fish.
Can't even sleep without feeling the burden of social slavery.

This to me is a #*#+!+& discrase. I have never heard anyone talk about it, why is that? Because people's lives now are better than they were? I'm not going to deny that but, I want a choice! I want real freedom! 

I've worked hard for over 5years consistently and have nothing to show for it, if I did buy land with what I managed to save I would still be under the mercy of the government. Council tax... Planning permission, I mean wtf, just let me build a place to live, grow food, basically be happy without a monthly commitment to things I don't need (no not Netflix) and leave me alone...

Tell me I'm not the only one? Or tell me I'm crazy so I can get what I want from the system without having to fight it or do something stupid. Because noone else is, as far as I'm concerned your all a bunch of oh please sir, don't put me in prison I'll pay my council tax and agree to everything you say because I have since birth and what choice is there kind of people. 

Guess I need help? 
If you want to try tell me I'm wrong go for it, but seriously, how can you ignore the fact that it's illigal to live without paying for the right.

One love."
2307,"I would like to open up to people I am close to about what I am going through. Most people have no idea that I am unwell even though it permeates nearly every aspect of my life. I show everyone a fake version of myself but I would like them to know me for real.

For those of you who have had successful conversations with people, what have you talked about? What tips do you have? Things to avoid? 

For those of you who have not, what do you wish you could say?"
2308,"Sometimes when I think I can't make it, I just give up and stop trying. It's how I am. I cut corners, I have a poor work ethic, and I'm insufferably lazy. I think my depression arises from a disappointment in myself that extends to every aspect of my life. Lately things have been fine, as I have been getting myself to write and hang out with friends, more than I used to do about 5 years ago when I was severely depressed, but I'm still often down and in the dumps.

I think I have trauma from when I was immensely hopeless and thinking my medication took away emotional range and made it impossible to be human, not until I got my emotions back, became happy, and started believing in myself enough to be able to love myself and others. I still drop down into depression because I am frustrated with myself. I have so many hopes and dreams and I currently don't see a way I can reach them."
2309,"I fell into a massive depression a few weeks back. Things weren't going well

And then I started writing again for the first time in 20 years, and produced some of the best (or maybe the best) material I've ever produced. Showed it to select friends, and I don't care about charges of sentimentalism. I need to find beautiful things in this world. The innerscape, or subjective personal world is the focus right now: not money, job, prestige, expectations. It is like being young again"
2310,"Im not getting on with my D much we have constant arguments about stupid things, I would have left long ago if it were not for my 95 year old dad, I just long to be alone but my D does so much for me she , cooks, cleans house, makes shure I take my meds etc etc,
But I still want to be on my own may be in protective housing where a warden makes sure you are all right, what do you think?"
2311,"When I stop taking me medication I started juicing and eating healthy for 2 years and was feeling happy. I lost weight start looking really nice and I had a glow to me, then I slowly start going back to fast food and end up in the hospital again."
2312,"I can do this. I am the little engine that could. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can because I have to. I have to push beyond this feeling. I have to be the person that I always wanted to be. The kind of person that I see walking through other peoples lives, living. Happy. Taking control of their circumstances. Experiencing their lives in the moments that they have created. I have to take control of my life. I think I can. But what if tomorrow I can't. What if tomorrow I can't breathe. What if tomorrow I can't pull the pieces together. What if I fail again, and again, to make this life something that I want to hold onto. What if tomorrow when I open my eyes, I feel the weight on my chest, feel my lungs not taking in enough air, what if I can't think. What if I only want to close my eyes again. What if the pain of pushing and pulling myself through this isn't worth it. What if it means nothing and I'm not capable of being anything other than broken. What if. What fucking if. What if nothing. What if every person feels this way, and they push through it. What if all it takes is for me to keep trying. I have been trying, I'm always trying. I have to keep trying. I have to do this for myself. But what if I'm too far gone, who I wanted to be is barely a memory. What if I'm the only thing holding myself back. What if tomorrow I wake up and I can breathe and I can think. What if I get out of bed and make food, make progress. Keep moving. Make this all worth it. What if I don't, what if I can't. I think I can.

I leave the therapists office with a tissue in my hand and guilt in my throat. The tissue had dried my eyes, but the guilt, that was there to choke me. To punish me for not being strong enough to deal with this on my own. I should remind myself that I did try, I tried to do this alone. I found a way to manage the panic attacks. I found a way to keep functioning, and I did keep functioning for such a long time. I created a system to manage my feelings so that I could keep existing in the same world as everyone else. Because despite my self imposed isolation, I have never really wanted to be alone. I just desperately wanted to be normal, to be okay. It wasn't until parts of myself started to chip off, the parts that I relied on to keep functioning, that I reached out. My ability to think clearly, where I was going, how I could get there. Walking down a street and stopping because suddenly I didn't know what I was doing, or it's purpose. Standing in front of the fridge and not knowing how I got to be there, if it was my own movements that had carried me. The anxiety taking hold of me, the attacks melding into a blurry distorted image of myself and the world around me. Forgetting that there was a me once, that wanted to be happy and could shape my thoughts to reflect that. It's the moments when I remember that that hurt me, myself, the worst. Those moments make me hate what I have become, what I have allowed myself to become. It was these feeling that made me seek help. Not so much for who I am now, but for who I know I wanted to be. For the person that I was, that wanted to be everything, anything, that was real and alive. 

I take the train home. I know that my autopilot will create muscle memory for this too, if I come here again. All I have to do is keep functioning. When I get home, then I can just be. I can be alone with myself, away from the ideas of reality. I can hate myself in private, where I live in my mind. I can torture myself with the ideas of what I could be, what I could have been. I can sweep myself away in the sequence of depression. I can let the idea of myself die in those feelings, absolved by the weight of emotion.

I lay my head on my pillow, feeling accomplishment for not falling asleep on the couch. I made it to bed tonight. But I'll still put on the TV in here, the background of noise of comedy shows has become a lullaby to me. A reprieve from thought. Just to settle listening to the canned laughter, forged happiness, timed responses. The part of me that knows that this is wrong, knows that I have failed again. I thought that I could today. I really did try. I thought I could, but I couldn't. I try not to think about what the world will look like when I open my eyes. 

There was a spark and I was falling. From high up in the sky amidst a pink sunset. Towards a citycape that looked like London but could have been anywhere. I was falling, the feeling from my toes to my buttocks jerking, convulsing, told me that this was real. I would die on impact. This would be it. I woke feeling my muscles clenching, my arms dead from sleep grasping my pillow. I took in a breath and let it out. Realizing that I was alive. I lay my arms straight to get blood flow into them. I wondered when I had developed a fear of falling.

There was a shadow on my wall. I could see it moving. It came in through my open bedroom door, but I was so sure that I had closed it. It's form had weight, it was real. It must have come in through the front door, the door must have been open. The front door must have been open and I must have left myself exposed to this. I woke shaking, not sure why I was terrified. The shadow was gone, my bedroom door closed, but I still lay there in the same position as my dream, looking at the same wall as my dream, feeling the same helplessness as my dream. Was it a dream? Was I safe? It wasn't real. My door was closed. I took in gasps of air, I held them each for a moment and told myself that I was going to be okay. I could breathe. I can breathe. I know I can. And I can think, my adrenaline was pumping. My throat might constrict but I can fucking breathe. I looked at the clock on the floor, it was 5am. I could get up now. I'd tried to sleep, I'd done my best. I looked at the silent television, and decided I would go to the living room. 

This morning was so much better than most, because I was alive. Alive in myself in a way that the pure panic exposed so much better than the cloudy murk of depressive distance. It still felt similar though somehow. To wade through the layers of uncertainty, it still took me to the same place. Where I collapse into the boundaries of what is real. Where I fall into the thoughts that echo like an addiction in my mind. The thoughts that had me holding my head on the sofa in my living room, crying tears that had no reason, no pure source. No definitive placement that I could get to and root out. But I had moved. I was awake. I let myself feel accomplishment. I was awake and alive and my dreams were only dreams and I could be alive if I wanted to. I only have to think I can. I think I can. Today I will. I think I can, because I have to. I have to do this for myself. I have to make breakfast. I will eat something. I have to try to do this. I get off the sofa, because I have to but somehow I'm still crying and I hate myself for how hard this is. I should be better than this. I know I used to be better than this. I walk to the fridge and I look inside. I didn't shop. But there is jam. I look in the cupboard. There at the top, is a pack of rolls that might be in date. I get them down. I'm angry at myself for not buying any food. For putting myself in this position where I'm further exposed to myself for the failure that I am. Scrounging for food in my own kitchen. I cut a roll in half and I toast it, that's better than stale bread. I layer it with jam, because I am determined to be human and I can do this. I can fucking do this. Today I will do this. I will eat this. I will start that road again that might lead me out of here. Out of my mind. Because I am better than this. I take each bite like punishment, because I am not hungry. My mind says it is not hungry. But I know I haven't eaten in too long. I know that it is my mind, and not my body, that says I am not hungry. And I want to be whole. I want the energy to try. I have to eat. It's like dust in my mouth and I know I'm dehydrated. So I pour water into a glass from the tap, and while I do this, I hate myself. Because I should be better than this. I should know better than this and be able to take care of myself. But I should remind myself of all the days that I couldn't. All of the days that I didn't. I should be grateful for today because today I can do this, I will do this. Today, I think I can. And then I remember. I remember because of the word, today. I remember today like the thought it was half my life ago, an echo of everything that was so important to me because I knew that this feeling had always been coming. I remember the words I wrote as a 17 year old girl. A child with more wisdom than I have harnessed as a woman. Something that I wanted that I fear I have lost. I want to believe that the person that wrote these words is still me and that I can do this.

2313,"So I had this period of maybe at best two months where I felt somewhat alright, not necessarily good, but “baseline“ maybe.
I've had moments of anxiety these last days but overall more dysthymia, mainly throughout the day. Early mornings are ok but once I leave the house I feel weighed down. Evenings are good but I take something anxiolytic/euphoric then, so it's artificial.
Feels like I'll never leave this place and be really content right now. I move forward and am outwardly quite productive I guess (albeit I coulsn't concentrate these last days), but really I'm only treading on.the same bloody spot."
2314,"Hello! I’m not sure if this is allowed but I have nobody else to ask and don’t know what else to do.

I am planning to end my life, this is something I don’t feel I have a choice in as I cannot cope with my daily pain or my depression.

My question is, my best friend is due to be married in May and I’m not sure whether I should do it before or after her wedding. I had thought to wait until after but then somebody commented saying everytime she looked through her wedding photos in the future she would feel sad and it would taint her day. So now I don’t know if I should do it before but again don’t want it to taint her day so feel I should do it asap so she can get over it? Does anybody have any thoughts?

Thanks"
2315,Due to extreme shyness I'm 35 and never had any sort of relationship and now I'm really struggling to get through each day. I've had depression for a while now and it's got to the point where the feeling of suicide is overwhelming. I can't carry on this way so I want to end the pain but my suicide would destroy my parents. Is there a way to kill myself with little as possible grief for my family?
2316,"I have no friends or family and live in an isolated area, there are so few groups here or things to do. I am trying to get a job but it's been hard. I really hate being so alone. Usually I would cope by getting drunk but since being prescribed antidepressants it doesn't feel the same.

It's been so hard to make friends as an adult and I've tried desperately hard but I can't seem to click with others. It's horrible to be so lonely. I don't know what I've done for this to happen.

It's hopeless now, even if I met someone all I have in life to tell are stories of struggling. I don't know what to do. I don't even know what to want in life. I can't remember a time when I felt happy and I hate being so poor and alone. This isn't fair or worth living through."
2317,"When will this pain stop?
When will it end?
I have been broken piece by piece and put together back again.

Would it ever be the same?
Will I ever smile again?
it's been lonely and sad,  living is just means to an end

Is there someone who I could meet?
Someone who would like me?
Birth and death are solitary but will so my whole life be.

I just want this pain to end
I would like to smile again
I want to look forward to my days 
When I can see my reflection in his eyes again"
2318,"I don't belong here or anywhere.  I'm severely depressed.  I'm alone, because I deserve to be alone.  I'm a terrible, ugly, stupid and bad.  I don't deserve to have friends.
You all would be better off without me.  I'm just in the way"
2319,"Hi, I've plummeted really badly and to top it all had to have one of my cat's put to sleep. Not sleeping for several days and desperately sad over my cat dieing. She had lost weight, not eating and sleeping a lot, she was 13. I'd taken her to the vet on Tuesday and had bloods, etc, taken. She had kidney and heart problems. One of the worst day's and death is so cruel."
2320,Just feeling really down :(
2321,"Feeling super depressed and low, 
Have had enough of life :("
2322,"I also posted this on the depression subreddit today but maybe I can get more replies here. 

Hi, I’m a 19F ... soon to be 20 in a few months time, who is feeling very lost and hurt in life because of what I assume is depression. I really feel I was born depressed, which sounds silly because everyone knew me as such a kind and funny girl, (a humour developed by coping mechanisms I assume) but all those years I often felt like I don’t fit in in this world and just put on an act to not cause any attention. I remember being 5(?)years old at my first year in school, and being too shy to dance with all the other kids because I didn’t feel worthy, and never felt like my parents really loved me, and they both argued a lot even though I know they do love me. 
Most of my childhood I lived inside my head because it was the only way to cope with living in general. Fast forward to now, i finished school a year and a half ago and i should be applying to uni but i’m struggling. I hate leaving the house, I hate doing any sort of chore. I feel exhausted at the idea of a shower for example, and when I do it I feel so tired and need to sit down for 30 mins just to get energy back. I’m just tired all the time, my mum says it’s because I never go out but I can’t find the strength in me to do so. Even during school, I basically did rubbish in my A-levels because when I would come home, I was so exhausted the last thing on earth I wanted to do was study. My teachers were confused because I was so well behaved and 'smart', and always told me I was just being lazy. I sometimes feel my life has been ruined for something thats out of my control. I hate myself everyday and I also have had cripplingly low self esteem since forever which really doesn’t help things! I wanna lose weight but comfort eating is my best friend........

Today was a tipping point for me because my dad was screaming (badly) at my mum calling me a “piece of shit” for being so ‘lazy’. Something I've been called too often in my life, but it’s odd because I have so many ambitions .... if I actually liked life and had energy to do stuff I probably would be so successful right now. I’m so upset with myself, I wanna leave, I wanna start a new life fresh but I’m just a girl who struggles to even leave her bedroom, I play video games all day and try any sort of escapism I can. Suicide isnt an option, as much as I would just love to disappear or wish I was never born, the idea of death terrifies me. Hell, I don’t even know if it’s possible to be happy at this point. I read posts on 40 year olds who are depressed and I can't help but think that will just be me. Where do i start?? Do I even bother?"
2323,"Hi guys, my name is Nathan!



I'm completely new to this forum and am not super well-informed about mental health, but I know enough to tell y'all a story about my friend. This post will be VERY lengthy, but I would love to get this all off my chest as it has been weighing me down for a bit now, especially recently. Thank you in advance for those who take the time to read this all the way through.



I'm a freshman at SCAD in Savannah Georgia, and ever since I got here in September of last year, I have never been happier and more content with my life. My classes have been fantastic and the people I've met so far have been extremely welcoming. I'm so grateful that I get to be here and I don't take a single day for granted. However, the story isn't exactly the same for my friend Aidan. Aidan and I have been attached at the hip ever since 4th grade. I spent most of my high school career over at his house playing video games and...well I guess just playing more video games! He was the closest friend I had; he was the brother I never had. And his parents were so accepting of who he wanted to be, and they were accepting of me as well. We understood each other and we both knew that high school was rough and being a teenager is rough. We vented to each other about almost everything you could imagine; we were basically each other's therapist. It worked for so long, and for the most part, we kept ourselves from slipping into depression or anything of the like.



Then college came around...



Aidan graduated from high school a year earlier than me, so during my senior year, he went off to NYU in New York City and started studying to be a Psychiatrist. He made some good friends there and we face-timed almost every day. Things were going well for a while. Every now and then we would call each other crying about something stupid that had happened, but it was nothing super serious. We're both very emotional people so crying wasn't the biggest deal, you know? It wasn't until this past summer (2019) that I noticed something had changed in him. We would be watching Netflix or playing a game and he would get sad all the sudden. I would always ask him about it but he would just shrug it off like it was nothing. I didn't want to pry so I would let it go in hopes that maybe later, when he felt like it, he would open up. Well one night he did. I remember it was out of absolutely nowhere. We were watching a show and he paused it and said there was something bothering him. I knew this time it was different and that it was serious.

The conversation lasted hours. There was a lot of crying and a lot of self-deprecating talk, but all I can remember from that conversation was that I kept thinking to myself, ""I have never in my life heard him sound so hopeless.”  I remember feeling like I had absolutely no answers for him. Every time I would try and help him, he would sound even more helpless. My heart broke because I didn't realize it was this bad and I had never heard him like this before. Usually when we would vent to each other, we resolved it by the end of the night. This night didn’t end like that. He told me that he wanted to be alone for the rest of the night which wasn’t like him at all. I drove home at 3am that night, feeling terrible. Like I didn’t help him this time. Like nothing I said to him meant anything at all. It wasn’t a good night to say the least. This same night repeated itself a couple times. It got to the point where I didn’t want to hang out with him at night anymore, because I knew it was going to take a turn and I was going to have to listen to the same hopeless spiel again. That sounds insensitive and I did want to be there for him, but it felt like we were getting nowhere and like nothing I was going to tell him was going to help. I never wanted to see him like that again.

September rolled around and we both went off to college. Things seemed like they were getting better and we talk pretty much every day on the phone. My first couple weeks at college were rough. It was a new environment and I knew absolutely no one, but he was there for me throughout those rough times. I knew he was going through a lot but college was taking over my attention and between being in the library 247, hanging with friends or trying not to disturb my roommates, finding time to talk was very difficult. I didn’t think it was a huge deal though, but it’s now that I realize that this unintentional neglect may have been part of the reason for what is happening now. When I came back for break, we met up again and everything seemed normal. We hung out all the time and had a great break. We had one night where he slipped back into one of those terribly hopeless conversations but this time, we were able to somewhat resolve it. I don’t know how I did it, but I was able to make him feel ok for that night.

Then I left for my second semester.

This is where everything seemed to fall apart. The first week back was absolutely hectic. I was in full panic mode trying to get things done, that I’m pretty sure we didn’t talk for a whole week. That weekend, I realized I hadn’t talked to him in a while, so I gave him a call.  The last time I saw or heard from him, he seemed perfectly normal. But when he answered the phone, he wasn’t crying, he wasn’t angry, he didn’t even sound sad. I wish I could have recorded the way his voice sounded, because I can’t describe it. It sounded like he had been lying in bed for that entire week I didn’t talk to him. There was absolutely no emotion in his voice. It was monotone and lifeless. He could barely get full sentences out, because I could tell he didn’t have the energy or will to even tell me what was going on. He didn’t care anymore, about anything. That was when I realized just how bad this was. I asked if he was on medication and he told me that he never wants to be on medication. I asked him if he had talked to his parents about it multiple times, and every time he would say yes. I know his parents. They would absolutely never let him get to this stage. I remember distinctly that he said, “I’m just afraid that this is really bad. Like it’s chronic.” I asked him if he was seeing a therapist and he said that every time he talks to a therapist, he feels even worse than before he walked in. I told him that I was worried about him and he just kept reassuring me. And then he said something that has been haunting me for the past couple days. He said he wanted to tell me something and that I couldn’t tell anyone if he did. I promised and that’s when he told me that he was having frequent suicidal thoughts. I told him again that he was scaring me and that I was worried and he kept saying, “Just promise me that you won’t tell my parents or anyone else.” The way he said it, it made me think that he would never forgive me if I did. Like that he would do something to himself if I were to reach out to someone. That call ended on a terrible note. I was in tears telling him that I loved him and that I cared so much about him, but it didn’t seem to faze him at all. Like I was just another person who didn’t actually care. Instantly after that call, I set a reminder on my phone to call him every day. It’s been a week since then, and he barely even answers my calls, and when he does, he’s always in tears. He doesn’t get out of bed all that much anymore and when he does, he says it makes him feel even worse.

I am in constant worry 247. Every time he doesn’t answer a call, I get extremely worried. Recently, I’ve been wondering what I would do if something were to happen to him, and honestly, I have no idea. He’s my best friend, I love him like my own brother. If something were to happen to him, I feel like my entire life would go on hold. This worrying is affecting my work and my mental health and I need some help. I don’t know what to do anymore. I miss hearing him laugh. It feels like he has already died, as dramatic as it sounds. But I’m scared I’m going to lose him for real. If you read this this entire post, I would greatly appreciate it if you would give me some advice. Anything helps honestly. 50% of the reason why I’m posting here is just to get it off my chest, so if anyone can relate, let me know. I would rather not bother my friends here with this stuff, as they have their own problems they need to deal with. It would feel good to know I’m not the only one. Thanks for reading, for those who did."
2324,"I am 55, an amputee, on disabiity. I have a 14 year old son who is the love of my life. But all I think about is when he will leave me. He is the only reason I am alive. I literally have nothing else to live for. I deal with depression every day and feeling worthless and hopeless. I used to write poetry, even got a couple published, but even though I tried I got no other poetry accepted. I;ve lost my creative voice too. All I want is for my son to be happy, and he seems to be. He doesn't know how I struggle. I just feel my life is so meaningless. Soon he won't need me either. Then I fear the worst. I have friends but I rarely reach out to them. I don't go out or do anything. I have a part time job that is solitary. I live in the past when I had a life, before my accident which was 20 years ago. I have ptsd as well, from childhood, from my accident, and finding my son's father dead of a drug overdose 5 years ago. I have dealt with alot of tragedy. Before my accident my life was on a good trajectory but the accident destroyed my life and body, Only my son saved me. Soon there will be nothing to save me."
2325,"Hi all. After 8 years of struggling with depression, trying endless meds with no relief, I wanted to join a forum to give and get support and to understand if any other person is experiencing what I am as it seems they aren’t.

I first noticed something was wrongduring college. I was suddenly tired all the time, had trouble staying asleep, stopped enjoying anything and the real kicker that madeit very clear something was wrong, I lost my libido and had trouble maintaining an erection.
For 8 years I have had no relief from this. I am not completely bed ridden but experience all the symptoms above daily. There was one day while on cymbalta and a week while on cymbalta Wellbutrin and getting tms (went away) that I felt somewhat okay. I recently became very suicidal and have had the thought that I must have CTE (played sports throughout high school) as this is abnormal and no ones story seems like mine. Is this path familiar to anyone else? Is there any hope?

thanks for your help and look forward to helping others."
2326,It's really hard moving from the big city to the suburbs. Theirs not really anything to here in the suburbs so I use gaming and reading to fill my void. I love traveling to different places with reading and video games. I have become really addicted to the geek culture. Doing these things helps me with my depression. That and chatting with people online.
2327,"I haven't got a decent job, got no money, no partner and no motivation.

I finished my audio degree to become an audio professional two years ago and upon finishing I was more competent than anyone in my class.

Since then...

-I've haven't gotten a job in audio
-Tried studying a secondary profession to get me by financially 
-Got bullied out of studying it by a lecturer
-Despite being the smartest/most passionate in the class
-Lost the love of my life
-Got a job at FF restaurant
-Was the fastest to learn everything out of everyone that was trained there.
-Some rude woman got the promotion that I literally proved to be better at.
-They cut my shifts
-Got no more money
-Kicked out of my rent home
-Living with ASPD relative
-He's actually not that bad in terms of violence but hypocritical to the most insane degree.

Now I can't get a new job because I can't afford a phone courtesy of the FF restaurant giving me 1 shift a week. So employers just get disconnected phone message.

Two years of this while dealing with delusional disorder and depression (both diagnosed).

It's been two years and I still haven't even found free work in audio which I can do in my after work hours hence why I tried to get a secondary profession to get me by while trying to build my audio portfolio up.

I told myself ""if you try and fail, get a new career but try your hardest first""

I haven't even had the chance to try yet.

So I'm in a position where I'm considering:
-Continue living like a loser
-Army (which I hate)
-Suicide

The options I don't want to consider:
-Turning into an asshole that connives to get what they want (these types of people are particularly the ones that end up screwing me over).

I often ponder though what is the point of actually staying a good person  knowing that my chances of reaching my dream will be significantly higher if I become a bad person.

Any suggestions for me??"
2328,"I had gender reassignment surgery, which I don't regret cus I wouldn't have lasted as long as I have in this world but there's been so many loses. My x asked me to leave, I left her the four bedroom house. My two kids who were grown up never invited me to their weddings. I came away with just my car packed at the time. My x reported that I'd abused my mum which I would never do. Investigated about that but there was nothing to investigate and she's remarried, seems immune to the lies she said whilst I plimit into depression and anxiety and thoughts of self harm. I've lost my dad nearly five years ago and my brother at 14 when I was 11, I'm 61 now. My relationship of five years asked me to leave too just recently, I alway's love unconditionally, worts and all but others seem to drop people when they no longer fit there molds. I think it's pointless going on, I can't think about finding love again for the same thing to happen to me but I'm so alone and lost. I expect people will say it's my fault, I think I should have taken my life years ago before all the above, especially if that's what I end up doing anyway. Some would see me as someone who should end it anyway so why not do it?"
2329,"i want my organs to go to people that deserve a full happy life. i want to kill myself and leave them something. Anonymously of course, i dont want them to know the organs came from someone who . killed themselves. i want to do some tiny good deed. i want some goodness in this life. i want some kid to have a new life . because of me. 

I'm better than i was before. The break up doesn't hurt as much now thatI've realised it was my fault. I am in love with her still and still think she was amazing. I apologize for this being a selfish post but this is the only platform where  i can talk about myself.  I've now . realized how immature I was, how i shouldn't have thought those things about her, and shouldn't have acted cold. And shouldn't have wanted to meet every day. I know it is over for good and I've accepted that, and that she was right in moving on to someone else. 

No one will ever understand how much it meant to me because no one was there. I was. I'd never felt special or loved before and i understand now that when i felt threatened that it was going to be taken from me and thats why i acted cold and felt so hurt. I've also made my peace with not meeting someone. And even if i was to no one would be as amazing as she was.

I understand how much suicide is hated. and that no one likes to talk about it. But ive been going through the motions for a really long time."
2330,"Hello all am new on here & figured I have to start reaching out if I want to help myself .

So a few years ago I was repeatably raped not just by my ex but his so called friends  and drugged.Some of it I remember some of which I new something had happened the next day had my nose and ankle broken and was made to feel worthless.
To cut along story short I finally kicked him out and moved I never told anyone for 2 years till I met my partner and it broke me.I suppressed my feelings for that long that when I get drunk I end up agressive and end up taking it out on my partner. I am mortified and now have decided to quit drinking and am going to get help , I tried last time but wasnt ready.
I don't want to hurt my partner but feel anxious and have at times dark suicidal thoughts .I just want to move on .."
2331,"I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for 4-5 years now, but have only been recently diagnosed. I work for the NHS and have just returned to work on a phase return after been off sick for 5 months.
To my horror, upon returning to work on my 1st day I was presented with a letter giving me an “informal meeting” for been off sick for 3 episodes in the last 12 months (having my gallbladder out was 1 episode) and the letter went on to threaten me with a further “formal meeting” should I be off sick again.
I can’t begin to explain the upset and anger I felt. I would have thought that these people would understand the seriousness of mental health issues and that it makes a mockery out of the nation’s determination to help individuals deal with the subject.
I would appreciate any advice on how to take this further. Going to my union representative is not an option as this person was the one who conducted my back-to-work interview and seemed to have great pleasure in handing me the letter."
2332,"Hi all, I find myself laying in bed all day everyday does anyone else do the same?"
2333,"Like the title says, I can literally feel myself dying. Some days I can feel it directly in my heart, actual pain. I am 36 years old and I have never had any relationship of any kind with anyone and at this point I dont think I ever will. I have become more depressed now than ever before and it seems to only be getting worse. I can not generate enthusiasm for anything anymore. I enjoy virtually nothing anymore. I wake up to an empty bed in an empty house and I am immediately sad. I just dont want to wake up. Im just sad all the time. It takes every bit of my will power to not break down into tears at work. I can cry almost at will, all I have to do is think about it for a couple seconds and the tears come and I have to fight to not let it overwhelm me. 

Its not like Ive never met anyone I wasnt interested in, quite the opposite. The problem is that no one is ever interested in me and now I feel like its too late to find someone to love. No one has ever given me a chance. I have zero experience and I feel like Im too old to learn. Like I missed the boat so to speak. I need someone to share my life with. And right now, I simply cant see any way to meet someone. I want to go to therapy but I dont have insurance or the money for it. Which is why I'm posting here. Its better than nothing right? I have family that ""cares"" but what can they really do? Nothing. What I need can not be provided by them. I need a companion. And if I dont find one soon I really dont know that I will be able to hang on anymore."
2334,"Hi, 
Having suffered with depression/anxiety for 18 years now from a young age I'm wondering what normal reactions/feelings should be and whether what I'm feeling is my depression or something else. One thing in particular is how do you enjoy things? 

For example if I have something planned and it gets to the event I almost subconsciously become in a bad mood because I'm worried I won't enjoy the event, the when it's over I'm annoyed with myself for not enjoying something I should have. 

I feel like others get so much more enjoyment out of things and I expect myself to feel the same and I'm then disappointed when i don't. The only time I realise I was enjoying myself or it was a great day can be years down the line when I remember it. 

It's so frustrating! Is this normal for depression?"
2335,"Hi lovely people..

Apologies if this is in the wrong forum.
Ive been struggling with poor health for the last 2 and a half years, I was due to have surgery in 2017 and it didn’t happen for various reasons and so my health issues got worse. I went from being a competitive surfer and mountain biker to literally not having the energy to even walk my dog and obviously this took its toll on my mental health.
I finally had the surgery i was waiting for just over 2 weeks ago and I’m feeling worse than ever. Well my GP said she’s going to pass on how I’m feeling to psychiatry because she’s worried about my mental health.. 
My question is do I have to speak to someone from mental health if I don’t want to or can I be forced to?
I’m not a talker I’m not interested in talking to a stranger at all. Once my physical health gets better I’m sure my mental health will too.

2336,"Hello forum, wishing for you all to be having a nice weekend, whatever nice means to you. I have had a bath which is quite hard thing to get myself to do this time of year. 

Life has been so hard in the past but a few years down the road and i am managing better. I don't know if i am better, or managing better, or if it is medication or something else, but i am alive and i never thought i would be, never thought i even wanted to be. 

I am waiting for the brown envelope. ESA this time. I have been in support group for a long time and whilst i am ready to do a bit more, work feels like far too much. I always said work would kill me and now maybe it wouldn't, or it would be a slower descent. The last time i worked it was baad. The nightmare of that last job is fuzzier as are most of those memories, so i am confused about everything. Whenever i have tried to reduce medication, i am catapulted back to those behaviours and feelings but could i ever get off medication? I feel i cannot go and get a job until i am not taking medicaion and well. Is it normal to think that?

I haven't done any preparation for my brown envelope's arrival. I always take a copy of any change in prescription or letter i receive so i don't have much but i have something to prove i see the doctor. I don't like many of the b*stards and they don't seem to like me. I try to be an ideal person and patient but the whole thing is uncomfortable. 

I am keeping busy and still wasting money like nothing is going to happen. I am hoping they forget to call me back in and i keep getting my money until i die."
2337,"This is going to be a bit scattered but I must get this out of my head. 
I have diagnosed depression and I do not medicate for personal reasons, most of the time I am able to cope and manage it and keep it at a mild to moderate level. 
Recently, the last couple weeks, I have been feeling a more severe depressive episode coming and and it finally hit me last night while I was talking with my husband (A) (I think my depression has been magnified by the weather and it being so dreary and cold). I felt like crying but also didn't feel much of anything. While I was discussing my feelings with A, I got the impression that he cares but doesn't care at the same time. Like, He is sad to see that I am feeling this way but less because of how it impacts me and more because then he has to deal with it. I think I am projecting, because I feel bad and guilty about him having to deal with me, but it still hurts to think about. 
When I talk to A or my friends about my mental situation, I get the same impression. They don't respond how I would like them too so I just don't talk about it and it leaves me feeling so incredibly alone. I got the advice to outright ask for what I need but the idea scares me. What if they reject me? What if that inconveniences them? What if it shows me that they truly don't have sincere concern for me? 
I know my husband and friends love me but I often feel unsupported and like a burden because I get this lingering sensation whenever I talk about it that they just wish I wouldn't have these feelings and would cheer up. They throw the usual ""You're okay. The thoughts you are having aren't accurate to who you are. This'll pass. etc"" Or if I tell them that I feel like a failure or hideous then its always ""Of course you aren't! You are so good at XYZ! You're beautiful!"" 
I also feel guilty because my depression manifests heavily as lethargy and tiredness so I can't do the things I want to do around the house. I'm a homemaker so I do the brunt of the cleaning, cooking, house maintenance, etc. but there are times when just getting out of bed and brushing my teeth feels impossible because I am so tired. To be clear, I can ask my husband to do anything domestic related and he will do it in a heartbeat and he regularly expresses his gratitude for my work. 
I have wonderful friends and a fantastic life partner and yet I had the audacity to feel this way. 
I'm so tired and guilty and I want to just dunk my head in the river and hope it washes my brain out."
2338,"Hi!
So recently my ex broke up with me because of his depression plus my depression.
This relationship wasn't standard. 
I really want to find someone, who can relate to him and answer me some questions.
So my ex was in long-term relationship before me.
He was with this girl since they were teenagers for 4 years. He told me, that he didn't love her anymore after a few months of relationship, but they were together anyway. They had normal sex few times only, cause of his sexual problems, she never gave him any gift, also she was cheating on him several times with boys and girls. He told me at the end she was in the relationship only for sex, he gave her much, but at the end of the relationship they didn't saw each other for about a month. He wrote letters to her, spent much time with her, you know normal relationship stuff. 
Our relationship was different. His depression became deeper and so after first few weeks of deep love, he told me his problems. He's a loner, he can't spend much time with other people, he can't communicate with them much, many of his friends left him cause of that. He has friends on internet far away so that's comfortable for him, but he hangs out with friends in real like once a month/two months. So we saw each other once a week/two weeks even three weeks. We had great contact, but sometimes when his depression got deeper, we didn't even text that much. Once a month he had bad days and he then started to be like ""i can't be in a relationship"", but it always ended same way, he couldn't leave me. He never wrote me a letter, it's okey, not a big deal, but he wrote to his ex girlfriend when they were together, also he saw her much more than me, we never had like normal sex, cause of his problems with being scared of pregnancy, and I wonder now is it cause he has some trauma after his ex, even though he told me his over her and he didn't loved her as much as me and that situation was diffrent, or cause of this is his progressing depression? I don't know, he ended this, cause he wasn't ""mature"" for relationship, also his depression is too hard on him, he gave me several reasons. He can't be with another person now, he broke contact with me a few days ago, cause he ""don't want to have a contact with another human"". I know he is in really bad shape and it had to end, what I don't know is what's going on inside his head, why couldn't he commit as much as to his previous girlfriend, why can't he have contact with another person right now, I know he really loved me and I think he still does, but why is this so hard for him? Can anyone relate to that, even a little? I really love him, even with all the pain I've been through with him, I really do. I know I have to give him time and space, I know I have to take care of myself, I just wish he could come back.."
2339,"Hey,

sorry if i dont do a great job explaining this, but does anyone else ever feel a kind of feeling similar to homesickness, where you just feel weirdly empty and devoid? its not a permanent feeling, but i'll occasionally get it and its mildly uncomfortable. it feels as though ive just been pulled out of myself for a moment, not in like a dissociation way, just in an awareness of sadness if that makes sense? it happened half an hour ago i was sitting with my laptop and it struck me, and i just felt oddly disconnected and slightly disturbed at everything. like i found everything off putting and fake, and i'll become annoyed by it and feel unattached. it'll last about 30ish seconds and then go away. i should mention i experienced this as a child and i think it's coming back. i keep thinking it has something to do with deja vu but the opposite definition, i dont know the word but its kinda like everything you are aware of becomes strangely unfamiliar for a few moments.

im just wondering if this is a symptom of my depression and if anyone shares this? i'll understand if no one knows what im talking about lol but if you have any insight please drop a reply."
2340,Why is it so hard to smile on some days ? It's as if my quota for facades  is up.
2341,"Hi,

I am very stressed about that: I have (almost) zero libido since june-july 2019. I will explain the situation:

It's been 2 years I take adderral 40mg everyday (before I was taking Vyvanse 60mg, since 2013). I also take seroquel to sleep since a long time. My psychiatrist prescribed me risperdal 1mg, which I took between june 14-august 06. On july 26, I took a drug named ""Molly"" (which is MDMA I think), and I had a bad trip for 1 month (paranoia and anxiety). I almost lost my libido (I can still have ejaculate but I have no erection) since I take risperdal or mdma, I don't really remember. I know my libido was very low when I took risperdal (which is a normal side effect).  Then, my psychiatrist prescribed me abilify 2mg, which I took between september 14 and october 27.

I am very very worried about that because it's been almost 6-7 months. I had a blood sample on december, and my prolactin level is normal. Everyone on says that it’s psychologic but I don’t believe it a second…

Do you think the combinasion of mdma + risperdal + adderal could have make me lost my libido for life? My prolactin level is normal, but is it possible that my libido as been affected by another way ?

Thanks for your answers."
2342,"But she spends the entire mornings in bad moods, hiding under covers, not doing anything except ensuring our child does not play with electricity or knives, but she spoils him everytime I’m with them.  
I work 45-70 hours a week, when I get home she either is gone all night/morning until I gotta go to work, or is angry, or is sad(or anything else) and hides under the covers. 
my kid is growing spoiled, and when I’m home and refuse to give him his phone (he’s 3 year old) he cries until we abide by his wishes (which makes me think she’s not caring for him, not teaching him when I’m working)

I’ve offered to pay for medical treatments inside my health plan, she refuses.
My mother offered to pay the therapist (of her choice) she refuses. 
I have offered to pay the therapist of her choice, she refuses.
She complains about medical problems such as she wants to remove the IUD (that she chose to put in) but refuses to accept my or my mothers help in paying the procedure.
I’ve already lost a job because I refused to leave her side because I feared she would do something dumb. 

I’ve been convincing myself that she only does this for <whatever reason> but would never hurt herself. But I’m feeling insecure once again, which is why I post here, seeking advices."
2343,Hi everyone. My name’s Rusty. This is day three of me being out of work due to my depression issues. I’ve got a good situation for the most part in that it’s pretty hard to get fired but still being out because of all my mental health issues I do have high anxiety about the possibility of losing my job. Can someone relate?
2344,"I confided in my mother that one day I would like to separate legally of course from my husband who is delusional and can't comprehend the basics in a relationship . She knows about most of my issues with my husband yet everytime a divorce comes up all she ever says is that since she and him are great , (it's only due to the limited interaction they have with each other) it would make rhings awkward between them.  I am living a lie and this is what my mother's opinion about my situation is. I really am all alone. I wish my life would end soon of natural causes or maybe an accident , suicide is such a taboo and damages people so much that it would be better if I didn't have to go down that path I have waited all these years would suck if I went down that lane so late ."

2346,"Hi, 

I'm struggling... Really struggling. 

I'm 7 weeks pregnant and feel total apathy towards it and everything else. I'm exhausted, I feel empty, I feel nothingness... Nothing can lift my mood, I don't want to talk, I just want to lie in bed. 

I was on max dose of citalopram, came off for 6 months and now finished 2nd week of prozac (changed due to pregnancy). I'll likely end up on max dose. 

My symptoms presented after a major trauma 8 years ago, but were there before that to a lesser degree. 

How can I feel such emptiness, sadness and overwhelming anxiety and unease and still function. 

I don't know what to do"
2347,I started crying today. I never cry. The past can't be changed so I just muddled through it. Sometimes silence can bring on these crying spells. Anybody else know what I'm talking about?
2348,"Diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I have a lot of mood swings and depression is on one side of the scale. It used to be so bad that I would think my medication kept me controlled and trapped to have to stay muted and depressed, but in reality it was other choices in my life that kept me depressed and all I needed was to believe in myself and have confidence and self worth, which arrived through the help of friends and therapy. I now love myself but I still fall into depressive states when I consider how much uncertainty there is in my life and how I once naively thought that it was all resolved and could be fully stable. I now know I have to fight for what I desire and work my hardest to achieve them."
2349,"I got carried away and posted all this in the ""introduce yourself"".  After looking through the forums I decided it should have been posted here so I will post it here.

I can't remember if I introduced myself here. Lately it seems my memory sucks. For years it seems like when I look back on my life, it sucks. Every decision I make or have made is the wrong one.  If I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.   I think part of the problem is that I just turned 69 and realized my time is running out. If I am very lucky I might have 20 years left (but knowing my luck I will kick off in the next year or two. My whole life (from very early childhood) I have felt like I have been an outsider. I stand at the window of life looking at everyone inside having fun and enjoying life. During the 12 years of of school I was the kid who was to small to play sports, and I hung out with the ""rejects"" (our school was to small to have a lot of different groups). We had the jocks and cheerleaders, the brains, and the ignored. The kids I hung with would have been the hoods in another school. Even there, I was on the outside. They would make plans and do stuff and never tell me, so I was left out. In my 4 years of High School I had no one I could call a friend. Girls ignored me. When I graduated I joined the Air Force and once again was alone. I did finally get to get a few girls to go out with me, but at most I had 2 dates max with the same girl. They either decided to just be friends or dropped me and got another boyfriend.

Finally I did find a girl who said she really liked me. She was 15 and I was 23. I really did not like her that much, she was nothing like what I wanted, she was very obese. After several more times of failed relationships over the next year, I said fuck it, since she was still ""madly"" in love with me I figured I was never going to do any better. So I asked her to marry me. I hoped that eventually I would love her. All she wanted was to get away from a bad home situation I guess she figured I would rescue her. She just turned 17 when we got married. Unfortunately she got pregnant 3 months after we were married and I got orders for Turkey for 15 months. When I got back to the states suddenly I had a wife AND a baby to get used to. Over the next 18 years I suffered through 3 more kids and her depressions. She spent most of the day in bed under the covers hiding from life. I would come home and the kids would be wearing dirty diapers the whole day, I had to do the housework and feed the kids. After 18 years I cracked. The shrink said it was dystymic (I think that is how you spell it) depression. I was bad, hallucinating and totally screwed up. I ended up in the psyche ward. The only thing good about it was when I got out the Air Force gave me a medical retirement since it was close to when I would retire normally. I divorced her and left her with the kids.

About the one good thing I did was buy a Harley. I loved riding. I rode across country on it. I put 20K miles a year on it. And then once again my bad luck hit. For years there was a guy who had a shop and worked on a bunch of bikes of people I knew. I started having problems with mine so I took it to him. And he went to prison and after a hell of a fuss finally got most of my bike back in pieces.

My love life continued to suck, I went out a bunch of times with a woman and then when things got physical I found out she was a guy. Two other women I went out with turned out to have multiple personalities. Nothing worse than making out and the woman turns into a little kid or a guy. What are the chances of someone finding two women like that.

Another woman turned out to be a drug addict, she over dosed. Nothing like waking up with a dead person laying next to you. The next woman I got with basically took me for everything I had and then had the nerve to tell me she found a new guy but wanted me to wait in case it did not work out so she could come back to me.

Eventually I left the state and went to Nevada. I met a woman and we got serious, unfortunately she was married. Her and her husband moved out of state and last I heard she left him for a new boyfriend. My life continued to suck because I started to have problems with ED. Probably due to the damn antidepressants. I found a several on a dating site but none of them worked out.  I finally did find a woman on there and we got along real well. Our sexual life sucked but I loved her. We got married and she was OK with the ED. We have basically a platonic relationship.   I found out she had had over a hundred (or more probably way more, she said she  lost count at a 100) sex partners. 40 before she turned 15. It doesn't' bother me, what does is here I am with only 10 partners. That really is depressing. So here I am... hating life. Sorry for the novel. I didn't mean to write so much."
2350,"I touched on some of my issues in my introduction, but thought I would get into more details here:

On the surface, everything in my life looks pretty good: loving wife, two sweet kids, a house, six-figure salary and over a million in assets. But I watched a video about a guy whose wife left him, even though he had ""everything"" (a couple million bucks, good career, etc.). He said ""success doesn't mean happiness ...it means higher expectations"".

My career has been an issue for some time now: I work on the bleeding-edge of technology, and it is extremely demanding and stressful. Lots of all-nighters, after-hours work, arguments in the workplace, emergencies, chaos, etc. I've looked around at other companies, and it isn't any better. But I feel I can't leave the job: my wife expects a certain standard of living, and I worry she won't respect me if I don't have this high-profile job --that she will view me as a deadbeat or a loser. 

When I was young, it was only my own opinion of myself that mattered ...that isn't the case anymore

Not only do I suffer from anxiety and bouts of depression, I suspect I am mildly autistic. This career is the LAST place a guy like me should be, and yet here I am.

To make matters worse, I have suffered some personal setbacks recently. My father died last year, I have a good friend dying of cancer (at age 49), another good friend who went off-the-rails and started cheating on her very loving and devoted husband (and now acts suspicious and defensive around everyone, including me). Another friend had a nervous breakdown, quit his job, and moved out of state--never see the guy anymore.

Yet another of my friends, and someone I considered one of my best friends aside from my wife, started treating me poorly recently. Turns out she was pretty much using me to get to a guy she had a fascination for, and when he rejected her, she started blowing me and my wife off. We had a falling out, and I kick myself for not seeing what was really going on--I thought I could read people pretty well, but maybe I can't. I feel betrayed.

I'm about to turn 50, and I seem to be losing friends and my career is unsustainable. I am too scared to make a change, because I don't know how my wife is going to react. I also worry about my health. I've been going to bed at 9pm and barely interacting with my wife and kids for the last week or so."
2351,I've mentioned about dealing with a cycle of a depressed mood and anxiety daily. Now it seems like the anxiety is easing up some. I feel less motivated and more fatigued now. I'm still keeping busy with my daily routine and activities though. I try doing positive things. Spending time in nature and riding my bicycle for exercise helps. When I get tired I rest for a little bit afterwards.
2352,"I've had this feeling all day that something bad is going to happen (depressive episode) to me and it's really bringing me down and making me feel bad. Nothing is particularly going to happen. But I just feel like someone put it on my calendar ""you're going to be really sad"" for later in the week and I'm just dreading it. 

I don't feel anxious (I don't think). There's no heart racing or hyperventilating. But it just makes me feel bad."
2353,"Hello, 
I'm just really struggling at the moment. I feel like nobody understands."
2354,"Hi,
I suffer from depression with anxiety, also OCD.
I need to share my story with someone and maybe hear some advice.
I was in a relationship for almost a year. It ended week ago, should have ended sooner, maybe it would be easier now.
My ex boyfriend and I both have depression, however his is more difficult. I needed attention from him, it's understandable during the relationship, and I needed to spend time with him.
He did not. He have some serious issues, because of which we saw each other once a week/two weeks. He's just not able to interract with people most of the time. When we first met, he was really trying to change that, he thought, that he is over this need of being alone, that he changed, because of love for me. After a month of being together he confessed about his problems. I tried to understand that, I wanted to fight with him, but he didn't. He wasn't going to a therapist or seeing any other doctor about this. He just felt like that's the way he is and that's it.
I really love him, still, so I accepted that and I just couldn't give up on us. So for another months together, it was you know, ups and downs, we supported each other during our mental issues. I started to understand his need of being alone, even though it hurt like hell. The worst part is that love doesn't have to do anything with this. He loved me, but he couldn't just give me these meetings, and that lead to fights. He tried to broke up several times, cause he couldn't be in a relationship anymore, but he never did that. He kept on fighting. During summer, he started to feel better, he even convinced me, that he have his strenght now, and he won't give up. At the end of the summer he decided to go work in another country for a few months. I couldn't deal with this at first, but I knew our love will survive it. He wanted to go there for 6 months, and came back after 3 weeks, cause he wasn't feeling good and couldn't find a job there. After he came back, we spent 3 days together, I was so happy..And then things started to get messy. He couldn't find a job, I was getting worse and so did he. I was in such a bad shape, I couldn't let him go. I was like he or nothing. So when he decided to break up in December, I told him goodbye..I had suicidle thoughts for a month from that time. I was going to harm myself and then he called me and told me he will visit me the next day and that he love me very much and I can't do that to us. So I didn't. After a month of this, a week ago, he broke up with me. I had suicidle attempt. It was the worst thing I could ever do to myself. I was in hospital for 3 days, I didn't need to go to asylum and I am so glad for that. I know this was the wrong thing to do, I have my entire live left. Anyway, he was the one to call the police, my mom and my brother. He wrote to my mom that he can't help me anymore. He gave up.
We had contact with each other during the time I was in hospital, he said he don't love me anymore and that we will never get back together, that we can be only friends, then he said he have feelings for me, that he need me, but as a friend, then he said we can't have contanct, cause it will lead to the same thing, yesterday he said we can have contact once a week, he also said like 50 times that we will never get back together, even though I asked like once or twice. He also said his feelings for me are ""I respect you as a person"", then he said he don't know what are his feelings now. I know that he cried his eyes out during my time in hospital, I know this is hard for him now too. But I am just lost. I gave him my entire heart, he was my first love, he made me such a better person but also he has worsted out my depression. I know my mistakes, I know I sometimes pushed too hard, I know that my suicidle thoughts was wrong thing to share with him, I just couldn't let him go. I couldn't imagine my life without him. I still can't.
I know we have to give each other time, and best for us is not to talk for a while.
I just can't stop crying, can't forgive myself for what I did. I know I'm a strong person, for putting out with this stuff for that long, I know he tried his best.
But I just don't understand him. He said he forgave me and he has no bad feelings for me, but then he is acting so cold, I know he needs space, what I don't know is why he is changing his mind every second. Does he need to convince himself that he has no feelings for me and don't want to get back with me and that's why he was writing so much about this, is this some kind of disavowal? Is he forcing himself to feel that way to hurt less? I know he is hurting really bad, that's why he don't know what is best for us - stay friends or not.
All I know is I lost my love, my one true love, and that I need to give him time and space. Maybe he will regret this and miss me. Maybe he will find someone better than me. I just can't shake this feeling of how well we were with each other, despite these arguments. How we always came through. How happy we made each other. How similar we are.
I just wish it wasn't over. I just wish that it's not over. I just wish we could work this through.
Can anyone relate to this?
If so, did you get back together?
Can anyone help me understand him and relate to him?
Please, I need advice.
I need to know how to survive this.. How to lose hope for us.
I just feel so much pain, not only in my head. I can literally feel it in my heart and stomach.
I'm begging for any advice."
2355,"Just realised I’ve been drinking Alcohol every night for over  2 weeks. It’s not that I’m getting drunk every night, I’m just having a couple of drinks to try and feel better. On occasions, mainly weekends I am having more and getting drunk. This isn’t good as I’d normally only drink at weekends but it’s helping me get through the evenings and makes me stop thinking about work.
I need to get it under control!"
2356,"Hi, I'm new here. 

I came here because I don't really know what else to do anymore. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety around the time I was 6 years old, and have found different coping mechanisms for different phases of my life, and now it seems I'm at a crossroads again. I can't afford therapy, even with medical insurance, and my anxiety constantly makes me feel like I'm overloading everybody in my life with depressive thoughts and anxiety attacks.

Backstory: I'm LGBT+, married for a little over a year to a wonderful and supportive wife. We just moved states and have been through a lot together as a couple emotionally over the last year and a half to two years. We have had disastrous hurricanes, I left an abusive work environment, our dog passed away, my wife injured herself so badly she required surgery, we moved to a different state, and that is just the ""major"" stuff. It has all been pretty traumatic for us both, but no matter how many people I talk to about it, I can't seem to get past it. 

I am mostly happy. I have a great job now, we just adopted a beautiful puppy, we live in a safer environment, and we are slowly getting back on our feet. I feel like I have no ""reason"" to be depressed. Yet, almost daily I think about death and the peace it would bring me. I can't seem to get over my past. I constantly feel like I need to share my story to get somebody to understand, but nobody ever does, even if we talk extensively about it. I have friends who check in on me and ask me how I am and tell me they're thinking of me. It should be more than enough for me, but I'm rarely ever ""okay"", I feel like I'm bothering them or exhausting them, and there's not a lot they can say to make things better. I constantly crave socialization, deep and meaningful connections and conversations. No matter how much of it I get, I feel isolated, lonely, misunderstood... and it sends me into spirals. I have waves of clarity where I realize how much I have and how wonderful life is and how amazing my friends are... but I still want to ""prove"" myself to the abusive people in my past/present (dad, ex, ex-employer). I constantly feel on the verge of healing but then I'm hit by something again that sends me backwards. I'm just feeling very lost in a sea of emotions and while I can verbalize 90% of them, I can't quite understand them. Which leaves me trying to over-explain the unexplainable, which leaves me feeling misunderstood and alone. 

Anyway, if you read this far, thank you. I hope to feel a little less lost or at least a little less alone in this great big wave of sadness."
2357,"I feel like I have lost all of my life to nothing, I had an abusive childhood and made promises to myself that I would once escape it. I used to score the highest in my class when at school and I studied in 13 schools in total and still was amongst the top scorers . I used to always challenge myself before the result that if it were any lower than my expectations then I would kill myself . I lived in an apartment and always thought that one day I would throw myself off the rails and that would be the end of it. As I was abused  by my cousin and emotionally abused by my parents and their families plus the constant change in my surroundings and people left me quite friendless,  I was very reticent anyway. I know if it were anyone else they would've take  themselves out of the situation but since it was me I brought misery and some more of it on myself. My sis from the same back ground and three years my junior did very well in her life. She escaped the life I feel I chose. Its very lonely , it's even lonelier because I made bad choices , no body has ever loved me. No one. How bad can I be ? Worse than most hated criminals I suppose. My sis keeps more than just in touch but really I am so far from where they see me, no one could find me in the shell they think I live in. I left me long ago, I just keep hoping this shell would crumble too so this pretence and artifice could finally be kissed goodbye. I am just 34 too young to die, too old to accept that I did not infact fulfill the only promise I ever made that too to myself.
I just want this pain to stop it's too huge to realise so I have barricaded myself from self realisation sessions I often tormented myself with since I never really learned my lessons plus I am now a mother and in a marriage where I just pretend where is the point in acknowledging all that had consumed me (when I did find any idea consuming ) is gone to dust ? That i am a defeated individual living a lie and too tired to make a change . Still sometimes i really wonder if i will ever be free from this numbness like a knot in my chest that only tightens as i gasp."
2358,i've had enough. suffered enough. been in pain enough. been alone enough. im ready i desereve to be at peace
2359,"It's been a few months since I've been on here. I was in a bad place the last time I wrote a message and months later I'm still here but I've been deteriorating badly with every passing day. 

This is no way to live, I'm only here because of guilt. If I go then three people lose their only source of income. Life insurance would provide some relief to them but not a lot. If I can hold out 6 more months there may be a better solution but, honestly, I don't know if I can last another 6 months."
2360,"Idk if anything will help but right now i just need to type all my thoughts out to maybe get them out of my head.

Ive had depression for a very long time, for years, maybe all the way back to middle school. Recently this year, things happened that have severly altered my life. If your curious, you can check out my post in introduce yourself. Basically, nothing has any intrinsic value to me anymore. Even my loved ones have no meaning to me. My friends dont even mean much to me anymore. When i hang with them, its more like im just there to be there. Im no longer there cause i really enjoy it. More that its something to do i guess. I dont even have hobbies anymore. I used to draw but i dont now. if i do, its rare now and is usually a sketch that i discard. I dont watch shows, play games or anything because i see no reason to. i tried playing a game for a few days to occupy myself but im so bored playing it now. Everything is pointless to me. I feel nothing. I am incapable of feeling joy. I cant even laugh. I used to always be afraid of death and wanted to live. Recently though, the past week, ive gone into a suicidal state for the first time ever. I am still recovering from a horrid flu but i dont know if thats really why my mindset has changed so much. I used to fear death but now i sometimes fantasize i could just die and not think anymore or experiance anything anymore. I used to wish for an afterlife but now i just hope its nothing.

I have been grieving the person i was a year ago. Back when i had even a few things to make me get up in the morning and when i felt actual feelings like joy. When i felt like a living being. For a while, i had dissociation that constantly made me feel like i was dead. Now i really do feel dead."
2361,"So I've tried some things my therapist told me. I signed up to tinder with no success, despite feedback from friends about the pictures chosen. ive started trying to accept myself. ive started seeing what i . like about myself. and focusing on that.  
I also . made a plan: I want to graduate this year to be finally done with that miserable course and . the misery it brought me. and i will not have to see the girl who broke my heart every single day. And then right after I want to die. I have the method in mind and have made some preparations. I want to leave this place. This life isn't good for me. The only people who ever messaged me always wanted something from me-And I have finally found the courage to put a stop to those people and cut them out of my life, by simply not answering their mssgs.

The truth is there is nothing that makes me happy anymore. I was only ever happy one time in my life. 

At least now I am at peace with myself
I've finally started seeing myself as attractive, intelligent, funny, and worthy of someone to love. 

But I still don't think that is going to . happen."
2362,"Hi everyone, 
I've had depression since I was about 12 (I'm 20 now). Things have been pretty rocky over the years and I'm slowly but surely getting worse. 
My moods have been a roller-coaster this past year but I've never quite felt like this before. 

So, lately, I've had this strong feeling that I really cannot cope anymore. Apart from my really depressed days, I've been okay (I guess), I've had days where I feel good (like today) but I've had this constant feeling of not being able to cope anymore, I feel like I want to end my life, I've been constantly suicidal and I just really wanna end it all, but i haven't been having the strong urge to do it like how I usually feel when I am depressed. (sorry if I'm not explaining this right or very clear, it's hard to get my head around) 

I can have a really good day full of laughs and smiles, feeling okay in general and not feeling depressed atall, but at the same time I'll have all these thoughts about wanting to end my life and that I'm really not coping anymore, even right now, I've had a good day, i feel alright and I wouldn't say I felt depressed but my mind is currently telling me to kill myself and that life is too tough to keep going, I want to cry so much but I don't feel sad enough to cry? 
I get thoughts like this when I'm really feeling depressed, but lately I've been having them no matter what mood I'm in. 

What's wrong with me? How can I make it stop.. :("
2363,"I've posted on here before and I still haven't been feeling myself. At first I thought I had a medical issue. I had several tests done and I'm healthy. I'm wondering if it's depression. 

My symptoms started a few months ago with bad anxiety. I went to the doctor and got a prescription. It has helped some, but mornings are the worst. 

I totally don't feel like my old self anymore. I still try to keep up with my routine, but it isn't the same. I just don't get the pleasure or enjoyment that I used to. Some parts of the day I feel really down or anxious. By evening I'm more calm and can usually relax though. I can get to sleep, but I wake up a few times a night. My appetite is slightly off, but I'm eating well. My thoughts tend to dwell on the negative now rather than more positive things. It just gets exhausting trying to figure things out. Especially when I was fine 6 months ago."
2364,"Lately I feel more alone with my depression and mental health than I have ever felt in my entire life. I've fallen so deep into the hole of depression that I literally moved back to a place I was living and still haven't moved in. It took me 2 months to make my bed and sleep in it and I've only slept on it twice because I've just been sleeping on the couch. I've been searching for a job but haven't found one yet and it makes me feel so useless. Even if I get the job I am scared I'm going to stay in this rut and barely will have the energy to go to work. At this moment I barely have the energy or drive to shower, leave the house, eat, cook, clean, or get things in order. I've literally probably just been laying here on this couch for the last 3 months and I feel terrible. I just feel so worthless and have been struggling to pull myself out of it at all. I feel like I'm so close to just giving up. I try to talk to people about it but I'm always just shrugged off or completely misunderstood and judged. This just forces me to have to always deal with my mental health and depression alone. I don't know how long I really can do this alone though... just feels like everytime I reach out for anything I'm either irritating someone, not understood, or told that I just have to force myself... I've been forcing myself for over 8 years... I've lost so much of my life to depression and get more depressed because I continue to lose more and more of it every day.... so many things I could have done but I was so depressed. I isolated myself for over 3 years and became a recluse... I've already been a huge loner most of my life due to mental health and depression... took me over 3 years to start to partially get past my social anxiety brought on by so much seclusion in life... and I still get extremely anxious in social situations.

I just don't know how much longer I can ""live"" like this. I look at all the people around me and it just seems so simple for them. They can make friends, keep long lasting relationships, find love, and take care of themselves. I barely can even wake up lately somedays. I just feel so pathetic...

My depression has been so bad that I've been a part of this forum for a few months and I just now found the drive to post on it..."
2365,"Yesturday I felt exctatic what with flying and all, today im low as a snakes belly
I dont know why this is I think it may be because, I know I wont be able to fly as often as I want, I have nothing else to look forwards to."
2366,"I've been struggling for awhile now and just don't know what to do anymore. It's been a daily battle of anxiety, depressed feeling mood, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and just not feeling myself. Sometimes you feel a little better and other times you just feel the same way again. 

I usually keep myself busy and I'm sure it helps some. I make sure I get the rest that I need too. I've been given some good advice on here and from others I know. I've also been everywhere for professional help and it's just that I'm stressed to them. I wish I knew the answer to get some relief. I sure miss feeling good about myself."
