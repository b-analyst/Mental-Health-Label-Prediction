0,"i know i’m only 16 so this, in other people’s eyes, just seems like “easy to get over” sorta problems compared to everyone else. also excuse the janky layout i’m typing on my phone right now.

anyways. when i was 14 in autumn of 2019, i started talking to this girl in my year that recently pulled out of school and we ended up in a relationship blah blah blah. she broke up with me when i got to my dads (out of town) after my grandads funeral and things haven’t been good since. it feels like i changed who i am for her and i can’t go back to who i used to be. i’ve tried not dating and also dating but nothing works. every word of every song i listen to brings back memories of sneaking out to go to her place. we didn’t even do anything we just cuddled and it’s the slow, simple things that i miss. we barely even kissed  a lot. i don’t even know why i’m writing this. it seems pointless. i just hope someone out there can help out. i’m hopeless and i just don’t see a way out.


yes i have told her how i feel etc etc but to not avail. she moved on a week or two after we broke up as well which i guess what a year of a relationship with me does. sorry for rambling"
0,"Every moment that I sit with myself in pain and sadness is another moment that I let someone I love down. I don't know what I want of myself anymore.  I'm having trouble remembering what I was so hopeful about in the past. My brain feels fried. People tell me ""there is hope,""... but hope for what?"
0,"i wouldn’t ever downplay anyone’s struggles, especially when it comes to suffering mental illness. but sometimes i envy those who have situational depression.. you know like the people who suffer “depression” because of a culmination of bad luck and less than ideal lifestyles.

because i don’t have a lot to complain about, but for some reason i have an aching pit in my chest and a silent, empty brain. i don’t know where my will to live went. i used to dream about my future but i don’t even know how to feel better at this point. i just feel like having crying spells all day, while at the same time i am screaming at myself in my head “WHY CAN’T YOU JUST BE HAPPY” i feel lifeless, dull, lost.

and the worst part is i don’t even feel like i deserve to feel this bad, but i literally. can’t. help. it."
0,"I’m struggling. Bad. I can’t get out of bed nor can I sleep. I spend all my time watching tv for escapism and I can tell it’s really grating on my boyfriend. 
I’m taking medication and have been for a while but it makes me feel numb. I talk to a councillor and I’ve been signed off work for over 2 months now. 
I am about to quit my job without another to go to and I’m freaking out. There’s no jobs out there and I want to do my own thing, but how can I do that when I can’t even get out of bed?? Any tips?"
0,"

Don’t even know what I’m looking for or why I’m posting but comment whatever you like, if you feel like it. Maybe someone has some insight because none of the therapy I’ve been in has helped much. 

I’m a woman in her early 20s. A couple years ago I became extremely obsessed (not primarily sexually though eventually it did become a romantic obsession) with a teacher of mine who was in his late 50s, married with children. He didn’t do anything to encourage me but he was really nice to me and we had things in common. I think he enjoyed my company too at least at first but obviously not as much as I did. I became totally obsessed, but knew it was immoral to do anything. I cried over him and dreamt of him and thought of him 90 percent of my waking hours. And long story short eventually became so obsessed that I would search the trash for things he’d thrown out. I  memorized his schedule and would try to bump into him. I misinterpreted some things and stupidly thought he felt the same about me. I looked everywhere for proof that he cared about me, even going through his papers in his office once. I looked at photos of his family and him every day. I tried to distance myself but even in another state after a year apart i thought of him every day. 

I’ve tried therapy and it helped some but I still cry sometimes, like tonight. I feel so angry and disgusted with myself because I know this is wrong but I want to google him and see his picture. I feel like my head is on fire, 5 years later. I haven’t spoken to him in over a year and we aren’t even real friends. He’s just being nice. He’s probably creeped out by me. I hate myself I just want him. I hate my brain. I feel like a baby that just wants it’s mother.... I don’t know what’s wrong with me and why therapy isn’t helping. I’m sure it’s my own fault but I can’t do this anymore."
0,"I’m an autistic teenager (don’t remember exactly where I am on the spectrum) and I just don’t feel like I can do anything right. Because of my Autism, I have an immensely hard difficulty with improving at anything. I’ve tried for years to become a better drawer, but my skills have stayed relatively the same for years. (And they aren’t even that high) Every new hobby I try, I suck at, no matter how much time and effort I put into it, and because I suck at it, I don’t enjoy that hobby and only get a feeling of uselessness. I don’t have a job or any friends because my Autism makes me extremely introverted and anti-social, (which is another thing I’ve tried and failed to change) I’m fat because I’m too depressed to work out, and I have constant headaches because of all of the stress. I feel like everything I do, I fail at, and even if I put years of effort in, I never improve. I don’t feel suicidal, but I feel like my life is worthless and that the world would literally be better off if I didn’t exist to consume resources. What should I do?"
0,"I've suffered with depression for about 16 years now. My husband brushes it off and doesn't choose to engage when I try to talk to him. I've always been nervous to actually ""take a rest,"" in a place because of the stigma. I spend most days in bed if I don't have work and can't bring myself to enjoy much anymore. It's been a long time coming. Has anyone checked into a mental health inpatient program and had good results?"
0,Hey I am wondering if anyone has made a group or if anyone would join if I made a group. I am also battling deep depression and talking to people that are going thought the same pain as me I think would be very helpful. We can support each other and give each other morale support.
0,"I am very sure that I have depression, my symptoms match. Tomorrow I'm going to the psychiatrist, should I tell him straight away what I think I have or should I just tell my symptoms?"
0,"Not here for 'attention' Not here to hear 'everyone is beautiful you'll be loved one day"" ""just be confident"" bla bla bla. Fuck off with that shit please. Im just tired of life. I feel like it would be so damn pleasurable for me to just end my life. I'd never have to wake up to this stupid ass torture existence. No professional can fix me being ugly, depressed, other mental illnesses. All they do is empty the wallet and repeat what i say, give useless coping mechanisms, and steal my money. Fuck them. I hate life. I think life is actually hell. I was ignored my whole life growing up, i have nothing in me to be interesting so i'll be alone forever. I have anhedonia or whatever you call it. Nothing is pleasureable, nothing makes me happy, nothing excites me. So everything is simply suffering. I hate that I have to keep living, i hate it. Been depressed way too long.."
0,"It was nice while it lasted, and I felt really happy in the beginning. Butterflies in my stomach when reading her texts to me, visits every day, thoughts of going steady, the whole shebang. I couldn't stop thinking ""Where have you been all my life?"" and other stupid clichés I had written off as emotionally unavailable to me as a depressed person. It gave me a sense of being whole again. Love was made in the space between us.

And now it's gone. Last time I saw her it felt like none of the magic was there, and I was in the company of someone who didn't care. She had a bad day, my presence didn't matter and no connection was left. I could do nothing to cheer her up and I got none of the chemistry I adored in the beginning. We haven't spoken for a week. Tomorrow I'll have ""The Talk"" and clear out this gnawing feeling of uncertainty and dread. Then I'll be alone again. But I'll rather be on my own than with someone that makes me feel alone."
0,"I finally made an appointment to see what damage I've done due to my depression habit of not regularly brushing or flossing. That's very vague of me. Here's the truth: I brushed once a week and flossed once a month since the pandemic hit. I feel so ashamed of myself.

And I'm feeling like such a fool. My dental insurance only covers emergency surgery and I can't afford to have cavities taken care of, so I will be going into medical debt if I am not immensely lucky and scrape by cavity free. My anxiety is high as well as a result. But that's another matter.

I set alarms today to brush twice and floss once. I managed to do it, mostly because of how scared I am. But I certainly haven't undone whatever my oral hygiene looks like overall. Tomorrow I'll try to brush in the morning again then before my appointment I'll try to brush and floss.

No matter what I need to get a handle on my self-care habits. I only shower once a week. And it takes so much out of me. I need to figure out a way to manage to brush, floss, and shower regularly. I wonder if I'd feel less depressed if I found a way to take better care of myself.

I'm in treatment and on medication, but I still struggle with basics. I'm not even in a larger bout of depression at the moment. It's there but not as bad as it could be. I think that's why my prescriber and counselor aren't pushing for more changes.

I'm open to suggestions or encouragement, for sure. Thank you for taking the time to read.

TL;DR: I go to the dentist tomorrow to see what damage I've done by not taking care of my oral hygiene due to depression. Feeling ashamed, foolish, and scared."
0,"For the first time in my life, I find myself having ""passive"" suicidal thoughts.  A slow-burning apathy has taken over, a shift in mindset toward the all-too-logical realization that it literally would not make a difference to me if I did not wake up tomorrow. You cannot miss what you do not have. 

I do not want to hurt myself, nor do I feel as though I would be better off dead.  I simply now perceive a quietness in death. The only reason I cringe at the thought is because I know my family would be devastated. I truly feel if no one in my immediate family were alive, I would not care if I woke up or not. 

The spooky (or not spooky?) thing about it is that while I recognize this is a change in thinking, I do I not care. It makes me wonder if ""this is how it starts..."" for people who become seriously ill. I know no one goes from 100% to shit overnight, for most it is a slow burn and that makes me worried about what's next. 

Who can relate?"
0,"I'm slowly disappearing and I'm too weak to stop it

My head hurts and I feel so empty and shallow as I'm typing this but today I fainted in front of my mom and everyone in the store i feel so disgusting 
god the look of disappointment on my mom's face and ppl giving me the pathetic and low key scared look I hate it I hate this body I'm not even that skinny so I'd look at my body and be like ok it's worth it this the only time my mom sees me like that so she thinks it's the first time 
The store manager saw me and told me that he know that I'm not eating and hurting myself cuz it's obvious and that he went through it too then he showed me his arms and they were full of scars bc of self harm and cutting he said a lot of nice stuff to me too

I'm pretty sure by now that my ed and depression r going to kill and I can't do anything about it"
0,"I recently released from the army to focus on college mostly because of mental health issues and inconvenient timings that don't blend well with my college schedule. The army felt like it made up so much of my identity that I don't know who I am without it. I think about the good times that I had but also the much shittier times. Both are hard to think about and it makes me really sad every day. Combined with the daily grind of college, it is really just taking a toll on my mental health.

""Time heals all sorrows"" they say, but this shit hurts so bad... I just want a break from life."
0,"Senior high school student here who's been having trouble with classes. I used to be a genius at school, I won so many awards back then in elementary school and I went to a high school for the ""super talented students"". I was pretty average compared to my peers but it wasn't a big deal to me since we were all intelligent in one way or another. But in the previous school year things went downhill fast. My depression which has shown signs back in elementary school has gotten very bad to the point that I'm barely able to keep up with studies. This school year I just cheat on pretty much everything by copying my classmate's works, from essays to math outputs. It has become pretty hard for me to retain information and focus on things. Recently a teacher made an announcement regarding how there's some cheating going on and that all people involved will be marked as zero. I'm guessing this is because I cheated on this activity where we're supposed to write a reflection talking about how this week in school went and what we learned in her subject. I can barely write anything cause I don't even study anymore and I just do less than the bare minimum.  


I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean but I can't even be bothered to save myself or struggle against the waves. I miss my old self who would at least try to succeed in school. I miss when I used to have ambitions in life and I wasn't just making decisions based on what would make me the least miserable in that moment. I miss when I wasn't a failure."

0,"I had depression for about 3 years between 2015-2018 and never once did I actually resent myself. More so I pitied myself, ran scenarios in my head constantly and distanced myself away from people into isolation and broke off key relationships and ran away to a different country... I was very much suicidal at that point.

The dark thoughts are coming back again, thoughts of suicide, but this time, I actually hate myself. I am very emotionally intelligent so for the last few years while I’ve felt down, I’ve managed quite well to overcome my struggles. This time, I actually have no fight in me because, as I’ve said, I hate myself therefore I feel like I deserve the misery I’m feeling.

Does this mean it’s time to stop fighting?..."
0,"I'm staring into nothing again. I've went through another horrible day with my girlfriend. I love her more than anything but lately I keep forgetting why...
She's depressed and suicidal...she has lots of mental issues and I've always been there for her...yet one part of her mental issue is her split personality. At one second...she's so sweet and loving...and the next one she shouts at me how she wants me to die and then she cries and apologises. I can't handle this for too long anymore...going to her is starting to be so painful...I'm not even looking forward to it, as I'm more terrified of it. She keeps lying...shouting at me...and in the end, I always tell her ""It's okay. I know you don't mean this. We'll get through this together.""
But I'm depressed since...forever I guess.
I'm there for her, but she can't ever be there for me.
When I mention that I don't feel good it's just ""why would you?""
If I tell her that I feel like wanting to die...she just told me...""so?""
I'm starting to feel like she just uses me to be there for her...but we've been through so much for so long...planned to marry...I just don't know what to do. I know it would help me if I could just talk to someone about it, but she doesn't let me and threatens that she will cut if I talk to anyone but her.

0,"My mom and I were extremely close. She was my best friend. She passed away in 2009 at the age of 49 rather suddenly. Tonight I was going through my old email account to save what I wanted to save so I could delete the account since I no longer use it. I saw an email from my mom from the week before she passed. This led me to read ALL of our emails. Some good. Some not so good (while we got along great, we were both fighting our own personal battles at the time too, and that was hard to read). 

Anyways, two hours and dozens of emails later, I'm in really depressive funk.

0,"I've tried to commit suicide twice in the last 6 months. Both times were unsuccessful. The first time I overdosed on prescription meds. The second I tried hanging myself but was too scared to complete it (which has made me feel like more of a coward for failing both times).

Anyway, I don't enjoy anything that I used to enjoy. I'm not an attractive man. I don't trust people friends or family. On the outside things may look good in my life (got a job, no debt, drive a average-nice car etc). But on the inside I'm hurting. People walk all over me at work. I could just quit my job sell all of my things and live on the street. I'd be no better or worse.

Ive felt stuck for a long time. I have no idea what to do."

No talents, no social skills, no stories, no personality, nothing. I haven't felt a real connection with a human in years if I really ever have, it hurts to think I will die completely isolated."
0,"The only thing that is keeping me from killing myself is the guilt that I will leave behind for the only person I have left in this world, my mother.  She was very happy living in our naïve country and she came to chase the very lies of the American dream just so that I could live a better life.  I never wanted to be born, I never wanted this life for me or for her. The constant pressure to make sure I can provide her with a better life is indescribable.  I wish she had a better son. I wish I could just crawl into non-existence and not have to have constant fear of the future or what is going to happen. I see everyone going to places and coming back, talking and toiling for reasons that I dont understand. I feel like I am chasing a goal that is never ending just to make sure I can provide her something of this life. I have chosen to exceed in academics and will be graduating with 200k loans from a doctorate school. I have always had an empathic style towards people and like helping others because I know what it is like to be at the very bottom. I know what is like to hear a doctor tell you over the phone that your mom has a cancer. I know what it is like to take your mom to dialysis machines 6 am in the morning just so that she can have her blood filtered out so that her body doesnt give out. I know what it is like to live in an apartment with rats crawling inside the walls. I know what it is like to look at your parent and lie to them and tell them everything is going to be okay but you know it wont. I know what it is like to keep begging insurance companies to cover medications because if they dont she will die. I know what it is like to take care of someone every single day while maintaining two jobs and going to full time school. I know what it is like to fake smile just to impress people so that you dont get fired from your job and pretend like everything is normal.  That empathic style with wanting to help others turned into embers and I dont know how much I can do this anymore.  Thank you for reading this far out. I know there are other people like here who suffer too and I hope for the best for u."
0,"19F here. This is sort of a throw away account I guess.

I finally booked an appointment for the gp (doctors) today. I told the receptionist that it's to check up on my mental health. I'm going to get a call on Friday. I'm kind of scared. I've always known there was something wrong with me. I think I'm depressed. I also think I have adhd but when I tried to get diagnosed a couple of years ago, they dismissed me because *I* was the one who thought I had adhd (as opposed to someone else like a parent or teacher which is so stupid because only I know what's going on in my head but apparently my own concern is not enough to be taken seriously 🙄) That's made me distrust doctors so I'm kind of worried they won't take me seriously again. 

I really hope I get diagnosed so that I can get treated. I hate where I am in life right now and I really wanna get better. It really sucks when you know something is wrong with you but other people don't believe you."

0,"I’ve recently (within the past few months) started 1mg of rexulti and am having more urges to eat, drink, and kind of waste my money on stuff (food, collections, clothes) is this normal for being on antipsychotics or have I just gotten into some bad habits?"
0,"I just need to vent. I’m so unhappy in my everyday life it’s becoming unbearable. I’ve been in therapy for 2+ years learning about myself, unpacking trauma, and of course learning how to cope with my depression and anxiety. I feel like I’ve tried to be happy and present in my life — but nothing works and when it’s all said and done I still feel worthless and alone. I don’t feel heard, seen, or valued by anyone in my life. I don’t feel like it would make a difference if I was here or not — the world is going to keep spinning regardless. It’s getting incredibly hard to see the point in any of this.

I’m in university and I thought I would be graduating in the winter semester of 2021 but today I found out I won’t be graduating until spring 2022. I feel like a failure because it’s taking me an extra semester to graduate. I’m so unhappy in college. Finding out today’s news means being broke for another year, and having to go through the mundane tasks and more irrelevant assignments that I won’t remember. My friend told me everyone starts to feel this away around their last semester/year of school, kind of like a ‘cabin fever’ to move on to the next phase of your life. I feel like there is no “next phase of my life”. I think this is such bad news because college is my biggest source of depression and stress. I’m exhausted, miserable, and  want to be done. 

I feel like I’m never going to be successful, happy, or financially secure. I spend my days trying to pull myself out of my negative thoughts and self-talk, it’s becoming increasingly hard for me to be present in the day or to get out of bed. I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m exhausted from pretending to be okay and be happy, I just don’t want to be here anymore."

I used to be fit af, but gained 30 pounds during covid. 

I don’t want to be here. I’ve been thinking about it for two months, but it just gets stronger every day. I am lonely even with people. I don’t think I can be fixed. If I feel this way at 30, how will I feel at 50? 60? I didn’t think I’d be here this long, but here I am... still miserable."

0,"I have had high-functioning depression (hate that term but whatever) for a long time now, I don't feel intense sadness or suicidal thoughts, I just feel empty and purposeless all the time, like a living corpse. After working on it with a psychiatrist and making some lifestyle changes, I'm feeling much better, but I still felt like there is a missing link that I'm not grasping.

And then something happened today, and it made me angry - so angry that it surprised myself, because I have not felt such an intense emotion for so long, and I didn't even know how to handle it. I realized that because that constant emptiness has dominated my life for so long, I kinda forgot how to deal with emotions.

It's kind of scary though. Now that I'm aware of my emotions I will need to learn how to express and release them. But I feel like I would look foolish or childish. It doesn't help that I always try not be a burden for other people. I already feel guilty when I talk about my mental health to my friends…

Since I smoked weed I had a grand time but it always followed with me digging up my earliest memories and  finding out why I suffer from anxiety and depression. Normally this would be a good thing now I know what the problem is but the fact I feel like there isn’t anything I can do about it makes it 10x worse. 

My parents never allowed me to visit a counselor until I gave them plenty trouble and had the police called on me. My parents are shitty but I feel like shit cause I know they love me but they just don’t know how to care for me.

These mood swings are triggered by very or extremely negative things. The worst ones begin with a blind rage for a few minutes where I feel like I can't control myself and then sadness for a few months until it goes away. The most extreme ones have only happened 3 times.

After these triggers I feel less human and moral, like I'm eroding and becoming a human shell.
I cheated on my ex who left me for another person without guilt and lying has become something I do automatically.

I don't know what to do."
0,"I can't. 
I've tried to calm myself down by playing guitar, and my Mum yelled at me because it's half 11, and too late. Fair enough. But now I feel worse.

I don't wanna eat, I don't want to do anything. 
I just wish I was dead. And this is every day, I feel like this. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate how I am. Why do I have to be trans and bi? 
Why couldn't Mum have just had a normal kid? 
I should be a girl, I should like pretty-pink, and dresses, and flowers and shit- but I don't. And I hate it. I shouldn't feel how I do towards girls- I shouldn't like them! It's wrong, and I'm so fucked up. 

I want to cut, but I am clean for 40days. I feel like shit. All I want is for some one to understand.
I can't speak to my Mum about *any* of this. 

Not my eating disorder, not self-harm, not about being queer, not about how I feel. She'll try get me help- I'm NOT dealing with CHAMS, or social workers, or anything like that, not again. 

I hate my self so much. Why couldn't I have just been normal? Why did Mum have to have a daughter like me? I SHOULD be her daughter, but I'm not, and I hate this! 

I hate when we argue, it's over stupid things, and I feel so bad after. I'm so horrible. It's not her fault, she has her brothers funeral to deal with, her having an autistic kid, with ADHD, who can't get ready in the mornings, and gets too confused, and everything feels too much- she shouldn't have to deal with that. 

I can't fucking wear anything other than hoodies, I have stupid fucking cuts all over my left arm, and all up my thighs. 

I stress over every little thing I eat, scared I'll get fat. Then I eat a shit ton of crap, and chuck it back up. What the fucking hell is wrong with me? 

Everything feels too much. I have school next week, that means sleeping at 3am, waking up at 5am, making myself exersise, go boil the kettle at 6, drink 3 coffees, and 2 green tea, and get dressed. ANNNNDD stress over every tiny little thing, and get distracted, as I do. Then get in the taxi at 7:20. Then school at 9, and school is not fun at all. I go to a SpEciAliSt school. (meaning all the other kids also have autism). There are only 7 kids in my class, I'm only friends with 1 of them. 40kids in the whole school, only 3 girls. I don't need extra education, or to be spoken to like a two year old, I don't need that, I need a mainstream school! 

Welllll. I got asked to veiw a mainstream, but, only 40% of the school spoke english, not being funny, but I am not willing to learn another language, and I wouldn't be able to make friends. And there is also a uniform...

I can't explain to my Mum that wearing a shirt (with a blazer-thingy), it makes me dysphoric because I can see my chest. (also- the sleeve might pull up, and I have cuts all up one of my arms, but it's nearly gone, I suppose :)
And all mainstream schools have uniform, so, I have to stay at this shitty school, where I'm not learning anything, have 1 friend, and it's a 1 hour and a half ride to school, 3 hours of my day is spent in a taxi! Fuck that. I'm not going back to school next week.

Also- with my eating disorder-thingy... Going back to school makes me eat A LOT less, and I'm more stressed. 

I don't even know how many calories is alot anymore. fuuuckkkkkkkk."

0,"Hi  
~~I hope it's ok for me to post using a throwaway account, I do so for reasons I hope I don't need to explain. In case something happens - there's a possibility I might end up responding or generally continuing the thread using a new account, the depression in my case dealt a lot of damage to my ability to remember things and I am very much expecting to forget the login info for this one.~~  


I come to you in a time where once again I seem to have hit emotional rock bottom, I don't think I'm expecting anything out of this, other than maybe venting in a text form and jutting everything - or what I can recall - down eases my mind a little, even if for like 5 minutes.  


I guess this is where I start, I have no idea how long this will get and I doubt I will have the patience to read through this to make sure it makes sense, or for any other reason, and my mind is something you could easily describe as broken, so if something ends up weird, inconsistent, or anything of the sort, I apologize greatly. I should also let you know, that while I think my English is not that awful, it is not my first language and on top of that, the ""plague that's ravaging my mind"" has actually made me a fair bit worse at it than I used to be. I hope the combination of mad ramblings and shitty English doesn't make it so that this is painful to read, or hard to understand. If it ends up that way, I apologize again and you have my blessing not to feel obligated to waste your energy trying to decipher it if it gives you a headache.  
There is a few things I can tell you for sure: all throughout my life I have tried and will continue trying to be the best person i can, to live by truth - conditions apply, for example while i do struggle with it, i sometimes allow myself a white lie if it helps with the other things in this sentence - to not make things harder for other people - on the contrary, try my best to make it easier for others, to not be a burden etc - to not be a hypocrite and to be humble. There's probably a few other things i should let you know about but i don't remember what else i wanted to mention so this will have to do. There is a reason why I said what i did, despite how full of shit it makes me sound, especially when I said i try to be humble, but trust me it wasn't easy to write down, mainly because of that. The reason I needed to mention some of those is that I want you to understand how i think - my moral compass, words i live by - and to add a layer of legitimacy to some of the claims that might follow. I want it to be clear that this isn't a joke, a troll post, a smearing campaign driven by an agenda, or an everyday hobby troll note from a compulsive liar. I hate lies - all my life i have been hurt, manipulated by them, I know firsthand the damage they can inflict and I understand them well. Since we are getting to know each other I might as well tell you the few things one could call me if they want it to hurt - something i understand you should never do on the internet. The words ""hypocrite"" and ""liar"" are the two words I am scared to be called in life. I probably forgot some, but these are the most important for what I'm trying to convey, which is: **please believe me**. If there are inconsistencies or signs of me lying in this post, if things don't add up - trust me it is not because I'm trying something funny, more likely just evidence of my head being doodoo.  


Well, I was supposed to start and look where we are, nice going me.  


I'm an 18 year old guy from the Czech Republic, born and raised a Catholic. From a personality test i had done at my school back in the day - a melancholic first, phlegmatic second (i believe the choleric was third and sanguine was last). I have been in an official battle against depression (and in my opinion PTSD, for reasons you might understand by the end of this) for two or three years now, and in a not-so-official battle with depression for like ten years, maybe twelve. As you can probably tell there is a bit of a dissonance between the official and non official versions - that means people only started believing me and stopped saying I'm a pussy bitch, i should get over it, or act like a man, when I ran out of fuel and physically stopped moving for days at a time two or three years ago, but the problem was going on for a long while before then. I myself didn't really let the thought it was depression get to me after hearing the aforementioned enough, because, from what I understand now, I was conditioned by my family and society into believing that I'm perfectly healthy - just a bitch. Granted, at this point I'm pretty sure i am a bitch as well, but that's besides the point.  


So, for the diagnosis period. When I slept through a few days and just didn't leave my bed at all, my parents, or to be more precise my mom, decided that hey, maybe that's not a very good sign and did some research, or ended up talking to a work colleague and I ended up being dragged to a psychologist next town over. We didn't really click and after losing a good fucking bunch of perfectly fine money I'm still salty about we moved on to a different psychologist who ended up being my current doctor and psychiatrist who I will call Sarah. Sarah diagnosed me with the expresso depresso - big surprise for everyone but me - motherly tears were shed and I was finally noticed, it felt like my parents really cared. I quickly found out Pepsi and Doritos made me feel a little better and my parents showed how much they cared by even going out of their way to provide them. Hell, even my cat seemed to understand what was going on because she slept with me a lot which helped too.  
It only gets worse after this, at least when it comes to parently (and feline) care - when it comes to my condition(s), this marks the beginning of a cog-shaped cycle of ups and downs - shortly after getting new meds I feel ok-ish, then I go on a decline, get new meds, start feeling better - steady decline. Rinse and repeat. Weirdly enough I miss this period of time. Nowadays my parents seem to, i don't know, they seem like they've forgotten about it all. I understand this is probably tiring for them, I am grateful for what they do and all - don't get me wrong, but I can repeat all that in my head, but it won't help with how things are, it wont help me cope with how they treat me now and it won't make it so I don't miss those days they really cared (or at least they showed it). Now it just feels like im a burden, like im just in the way. Sometimes they even complain to me, about me, when for example I come to one of them because I feel really down and i just need a hug. I have heard the equivalent of ""can you just stop being depressed"" three or four times now. Maybe I interpreted it wrong, but trust me i mauled it over a whole bunch of times and it holds up so far. By them I think i mean my mom, surprisingly - she always was the more loving/caring of the two, but I'm pretty sure I only heard it from her. Maybe its work getting to her. She has been stuck at the same job of a radiology technician at a local clinic for 30 years, I believe. Wouldn't be a problem if her dick boss didn't make all of the employees create one man companies so he can avoid taxes or something like that, and if they (all of them radiology technicians) didn't have to run the joint entirely by themselves, filling all of the positions, while obviously getting paid for one. I'm pretty sure there were 5 of them, then some left and recently the boss hired two young girls to do secretary work, but he hired them properly, with a contract. Best thing is my mom or her colleagues can't do shit about it, because by being forced to create those mini companies, they were forced to break the law and if they have, like my mother, used any company owner discounts for taxes or whatever else, which they most likely have, if they're getting paid as little as she is, then they're fraudsters by definition, whether by their own design or not. When it comes to my dad's work hes doing fine, he showed me a psych analysis paper he received once in an old job he quit a long time ago and i can see why he gets promotions very shortly after getting into a new job, hell i would give him a promotion if he showed that shit to me after coming to my job interview. The job im talking about paid very well and I sometimes wonder how many of our current troubles would've been avoided had he not quit, but it was very stressful apparently. This is all a quick summary to let you know why i feel a massive amount of pressure to do well in life. My dream is to have a stable life myself and to be able to provide my parents and loved ones with a life that is better than this, AFTER they retire. Its my dream and its my responsibility - meanwhile here I am, summarizing my life with tears in my eyes to a mob of strangers on the internet hoping i get a minute or two of peace and quiet from my own brain.  
So, Sarah - she runs a private clinic where she also referred me to a psychologist, who we will call Lisa. For about a year or maybe two, idk, I've been under Sarah and Lisa's care, with on and off results as stated before. Recently I started contemplating whether or not I should commit myself to a psych ward, but my mom quickly extinguished that idea, then Sarah did, by saying that should be the last resort. Sarah is actually the head of a daytime psych ward in a nearby town - or what i believed to be a nearby town only to find out it would take me hours and heaps of money to get there. The ""last resort"" status of a psych ward solution held up until a friend of my mom told her about her daughter's positive experience with one, so obviously a few days later I was sitting at an interview with a head of the reffered psych ward. It was supposed to be an interview to let me know if there's even any use for me at a hospital but i ended up locked up in a covid-test-result-awaitee room an hour later. That was the 5th of February and by the 29th if i remember both dates correctly, I was out and feeling surprisingly well. My objective there was to get out ASAP, not getting better, unfortunately, because I never handled being away from home well. I had no idea I could miss home and my family as much as I did. I was let out early on a condition - that I would attend the daytime psych ward, next building over. That is where I am at right now. I schedule visits with a psychologist and the head of the ward, once or twice a week and once a week respectively. I had a visit booked with both of them on Good Friday, which I called off because I was too tired to drag my ass there, and one today, which i called off because i was too tired to drag my ass there. Actually i spent the entirety of today in my bed on the verge of crying. Also, apparently even though i was told ""its ok to call off visits"", if i miss one more they'll have to let me go, because apparently ""they cant treat me if i don't show up"" - that's a great justification for literally telling someone not to come again, isn't it? I don't know if that's funny or painful. ""We can't help you if you don't come, so do us a favor and never show up again"". Anyways, I have the two visits tomorrow, and there's absolutely no pressure for me to come, clearly. The same way I felt the best I've felt for a long time shortly after leaving the psych ward, today i feel the worst i have felt since i can remember - for what that's worth. I'm pretty sure I feel as bad as I felt back in the day when i just said fuck it and stayed in bed for a week, but I wouldn't know, memory doodoo and all that.  


As for school, I go to a pretty sought after technical school (which is 4 years long - one year longer than regular high schools - or 5 years long for the kids two years younger than me, with 4 years being regular \[reformation\]) and my faculty is IT- it was hard but i had the backing of the best set of classmates I have had in my entire life, starting from kindergarten. It is honestly the only class i was assigned to, who didn't leave me with some sort of trauma - on the contrary - and again, including kindergarten. Notice how i said it *was* hard. I passed year one just fine, the running-out-of-fuel and catatonia problem took place around the second semester of year 2 but i passed alright, I had to write the classification test for one subject, other than that i managed to tie the ends together. I'm now in year 3 and it will stay that way. I have to stay the year because there is no physical way i could make up all the things i missed, so the only, singular good group of classmates and probably the best main teacher (?) i was ever assigned - I'm letting go of. How fun. Even better is the fact that - you've probably caught on by now - there is no guarantee I will be just magically healthy next year. I have arranged for individual teaching with the youth's education centre (or however you call that) my school works under, the papers are waiting for me to come back to school, but all of that was a year ago and I can only hope they didn't throw them out, because I never actually took them home.  


  
Well, it is now 1 am for me, the desperation wore off a little after a dinner and a shower and this post is already massive, while I have not even gotten into the ""good stuff"". I should probably scrap this, but I can't quite commit, as usual, so I gave it some thought and decided I'm not gonna post this on a complete throwaway, just make a new account, and split this story of mine into parts. I also realised that if I truly want to vent, I will end up giving away enough information about myself for someone from my past to recognize me, if for some reason they end up stumbling upon this newly established series. If you read this, think you recognize me and for some reason decide you want to laugh at me, expose my information, or share this post with some other mutuals to have a good laugh at my expense - act like a fucking grown-up and just ignore me.   


Take care and talk to you soon,  
\- Tom"

About a year ago I just started dating a girl that I had been seeing for about a month so what do I do the day after we started officially dating, I cheat on her. And somehow by some miracle she stayed with me and so began by far the best, strongest and most loving relationship I’ve ever had in my life. 9 months later and I had somehow managed to not do anything too assholey, but obviously that wasn’t going to last. My mixture of commitment issues and general piece of shittery gave me the idea that I needed to end the best relationship of my life before I got in too deep. But obviously I didn’t stop there before I broke up I had to download tinder because what’s the point of waiting right it’s not like the only girl I’ve ever loved deserves enough respect for me to wait until after we’ve broken up to do that. Anyway here I am 5 months later finally facing the fact not only did I treated one of the kindest most loving people I’ve ever met like some expired meat. But that I deserve this. I deserve to feel like a piece of shit because that’s what I am."

0,"So my neighbour who I thought I was cool with reported me to my mum, claiming he saw me smoke weed. We have been friends with this neighbour dude for like 2 months and we even chilled a couple of times. Though I never mentioned I smoked. He is a cigarette smoker himself and he smokes like a pack a day . I never judged him for his habit and would have never thought about mentioning it  to anybody. My mum told me he stopped her on the road and told her a bunch of crap about me and my habits. How I wear my hoodie all over my face while out(I do it because of social anxiety plus to hide some of my ugly scars on my neck which I am always judged for by complete randoms) , how i am always in the house ( minding my business ) , how my window is always open( supposedly told my mum that I open the windows to blow out smoke which is a complete lie as I smoke in the woods ) , how I always walk in a hurry ( which he claims I do because I have something to hide) ,how I always leave the house to chill at the back of my parents house , he even went ahead and told her about the casual conversation we had where I mentioned that I hardly drink (he instead told her that I am a drunk) . Good thing my mum doesnt believe him  at all. But its just nuts to think that this dude whom I thought we were becoming close would say such things to my mum to try and get me in trouble. I have never even had an argument with him or done anything to make him hate me. I smoke like a quater of a joint daily to relieve my depression , I have never caused any trouble for anyone  but someone goes out of their way to snitch. People suck man,

Wherever I go people tell me ""I don't want to play psychologist"" ""Why do you like that stuff it's kinda dumb""  and when I try not to be depressed and cheery they hate on my personality and interests. God it feels like it's me against a brick wall. I'm so tired of being born into a world of abuse, being different because of ADHD, being the weird kid in a very christian school. I'm so alone and nobody relates to me. Got very bullied in middle school too. They played games where the loser had to tell me they liked me because ""liking her is so embarrasing hahahahaha!"" 

I'm on the verge of dropping out of high school, fuck it, I'm gonna end up on the streets and I hate my life. School gives me panic attacks in class. Everyone thinks I'm messed up and weird. It's so, so embarrasing cause I feel like deep down I'm ""normal"" like everyone else, or at least like them. I've just experienced so much shit. I feel humiliated. I wanna be normal. I wanna be able to breathe without being judged or having to do amazing in school. I can't eat anymore, I can't sleep properly. I'm losing weight and my room is an incel's nest.

I'm trying something new. This is my depression journal. I had some energy today and I felt like writing my progression. I'll write both positive and negative things that happen to me on that day. Maybe I get better maybe I won't. Also some of these things might be trivial to you  if you are reading it like just getting out of bed but it's not trivial to me  
Day 1:  
Got out of bed  
Brushed my teeth 2x  
Cleaned my room  
Didn't skip online class  
Paid attention to some parts of the lecture actually  
Studied a small amount.  
Exercised a very small amount.  
Ate proper healthy meals 3x  
Tried doing something new(drawing as long as I could as I normally don't do that)  
Felt bad not doing more, I don't know why I am not satisfied...fuck

0,"Just need to get this off my chest.

I grew up in an extremely unstable household. Not very supportive, adults acted like kids, mental and physical abuse, manipulation, constant financial problems...the usual. Despite all the hardships, I would try my best to hold my head up high and have the mindset that these difficult situations would make me stronger. And as long as I worked hard and was a good person, things would eventually look up. 

I'm in my mid-twenties and recently some problems just occurred in my life. I just feel like I can't catch a break from life, that everything the could possibly go wrong ends up going wrong. I don't understand why bad things keep happening to me. I'm not asking to win the lottery, I just want to stop feeling this misery.

For the first time ever I feel like I'm suffocating. I was always able to hold my head above water but now I feel like I'm drowning. I feel like I'm finally breaking. I'm not a huge cryer but at work today I'm not sure what happened. I was just working and all of a sudden I started tearing up and had to step away. I felt so overwhelmed.

I can't sleep, eat, get out of bed, I can't think straight, I just want to crawl under a rock and stay there forever. I'm so tired."
0,"I have grown a hatred for myself in the past few months. I thought I was untouchable because my self-esteem was one of the few things that my depression had not yet taken from me in the 4 years I’ve been ill, but it took that from me, too.
I want to blame how I was born for the way I am but I do not know if I can. I do not know if it is my own failure or natural selection that will wipe me off this earth eventually but I know at the very least that something will.
Some things I can’t blame myself for, like my ADHD, my gender identity and my fucking disgusting dwarf height of 5’2. I hate how these things make me even weaker, I hate how I can’t do anything about them EVER and even if I someday will get over my depression I will always be weak because I was born weak.
I hate that my only talent is visual art which I know will never ever help me earn a living because I live in a small country where the people do not appreciate art and I would most likely never be able to even be good enough to stand out. It’s just a useless trait in me that can maybe earn me a few compliments but I would rather trade it for academic success so maybe I could one day pursue the career that I want to and live the life that I still have enough energy to dream for.
My father deserved a better son than I am. I love my father with all my heart but I am so scared that he will pass away before I can somehow show him how I admire him and can only dream to one day be the man that he is.

0,"Ive been bouncing between family members homes and Im tempted to just live out of my car. I just moved to Wisconsin into my dad's house because I thought him and my step mom would be more supportive.

I got and lost a job in just 4 days and I'm at a very low point. I've been researching psychiatrists and found an inpatient program, and I'm getting on my dad's insurance in the next 10 days. I just want to wait until I can make a psych appointment before I get another job and ruin that. Both my dad and step mom are down my throat about getting another job asap and to get out of my room. I lost my job just yesterday. A couple of minutes ago I was doing dishes and thinking about going for a walk when my step mom started yelling about how I have to get out of my room and go for a walk and if I kill myself then I'm going to hell (which I don't believe in). For some reason her telling me to do what I was already planning on doing just makes me want to stay in my room. 

I'm 19 and just lost my 10th job. No matter how hard I try I always end up having an anxiety attack and walking out. I don't know what to do anymore but I feel terrible living with family even if I'm paying rent and everyone just makes me feel more alone. My dad doesn't want me to even consider an inpatient program. I think it might be a good idea since I've been this depressed for a long time. I'm going on his insurance so I don't know if he has a say. I keep losing jobs so I definitely can't move out on my own.

I've looked up disability requirements and thinking about filing for low income housing. If I get a job I end up keeping it'll have to be minimum wage to qualify for low income housing, or I'll have to make $18 an hour (high income when I'm not qualified for anything) to be able to afford a cheap apartment and all my bills by myself. I also know it's a long process to apply for disability and even then I could be denied. I have ADHD, PTSD, severe major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks all diagnosed by my psychiatrist from my last state, but I'm not sure if I should attempt to get disability. Everything just seems like a lost cause."

I want to either sleep or eat junk food or struggle to watch a funny YouTuber, but I end up sad or crying. I think about how life is meaningless and I've been dealt a bad hand.

I have achieved none of the life goals of a ""regular"" person.  Significant other, decent job, house, car, love, any happiness. 

I got sick about 4 days ago.  Dizzy, nauseous, sinus, chest pains and I am all alone.  Being sick in bed alone has made me reflect even further on my life.  I know life isn't supposed to be fair, but a little joy would have been nice.

I've barely been out since the Covid kicked in last March.  Recently, I went to the dentist and had a look at myself in the mirror and was absolutely shocked.  I looked so haggard.  Like I had aged at least 5 yrs in 1.

For those of us who deal with Depression on a regular basis, we know it won't go away when Covid ends but I believe it has hit us harder.  Especially, those of us who are isolated.

Anyone else scared of going out in public even more now because you feel even worse about the way you look or feel?  I dread the summer.  The 14 hr days of sunlight.  I literally hate the daylight."
0,"I’ve learned today not to tell anybody how I truly feel. Even someone I thought I could trust. This person asked me what’s wrong after I had a sobbing breakdown today. At first I said I’m fine, just having a rough day. You know the usual deflection. They said that they’ve noticed I haven’t been taking care of myself lately as much as I should (for context I have stopped taking antidepressants). They said they could tell something is bothering me. So I thought they sound genuine in their concern, why not tell them that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and that even the slightest problem can push me past my breaking point (hence the breakdown earlier, triggered by something stupid). 

I don’t know what I expected, but all I got in response to opening up was a blank stare and now I’m being ignored. No support, no “hope things get better”. Fucking anything would be better than this. Right now I’m feeling so stupid for thinking anyone would understand. What’s the point anymore. I don’t trust anybody."

0,"A rant on a throwaway account - thanks for hearing me out and getting this out of my head

&#x200B;

”OK, good luck.“ 

&#x200B;

I’ve suffered with major depression and active suicidal ideation for a long time. I’ve been on and off meds, been through ECT, and talked about hospitalization more than once. Every time I tell a provider that I’m not going to pursue care all I get is “ok, good luck.”   


I get it from the perspective of the provider. If your patient isn’t interested in treatment, forcing it isnt the right move. Also, for the sake of the health of the provider you can’t chase every patient.   


Just once it would be nice to have a provider say “no! You’re in too bad of shape and you need do something. Here are your options...”

Again, I get it. I just wish it was different.   


What have been your experiences with this been?"
0,I know at this point the only way I'll get better is with extensive therapy and medication and honestly probably a long stint in a psych ward. But of course I don't have health insurance and can't afford it...which leaves me shit outta luck. It's hard to want to even try to get better when I feel like I'm staring down a tsunami with a tin buck in my hands. At this point I'd really rather just drown

b) I'm a horrible person who doesn't deserve to be vaccinated. Other people deserve it much more and I don't want to waste a much-needed vaccine"
0,"I worked very hard for a long time. In 2017, I decided to stay sober and focus on being responsible, volunteering, improving myself. Nine months later some teenager hit me with his car (no trial, no jail time), shattered 13 of my bones, and ruined the sensation in my right hand. A year and about 100 PT sessions later, my mom was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, which has now become a glioblastoma; she’s immobile and can barely speak. This diagnosis came less than six months after she retired. 

Over the past four years, my dog died; my ex — only person I’ve ever loved — married someone far more handsome and richer than me; I lost my job as Covid hit, despite making so many sacrifices; and now I’m living at home, over 30, my mother’s caretaker. I think I’m also becoming an alcoholic. 

I don’t want to travel. I don’t want to fall in love. I don’t want a pet. I don’t want a good job. I don’t want a nice apartment. I don’t want to meet new people. I just want this all to end."

0,"My mum always told me my depression is most likely reactive and to an extent I do agree with her.

I can enjoy blissful moments in life especially while I was a lot younger. However when you are younger it is so much easier to be innocently ignorant to the way society works.

I understand having or experiencing a relationship doesn't fulfil everything in life or provide happiness, just like money doesn't provide happiness, or big homes provide happiness. Being rich doesn't provide happiness but one needs money in order to survive. I also understand that some people would rather be better off without one. But that's easy to say if you hop from relationship to relationship like hopping on a plane or take your experiences for granted because of your looks or social skills that a lot of men and women would kill for.

This is sort of how I feel about my relationships. They are almost always platonic or acquaintances partially because I choose them to be that way. I have been so isolated for so many years that I think it is destroying me layer by layer until it finally reaches areas of my soul that won't be able to take the further destruction. This is down to my childhood and being blamed for the way I was born and thus inevitably being bullied, rejected and outcasted most of my life. Including now however it is just a lot more discreet and how it is shown.

I'm not saying for a second this is all down to not having a girlfriend. It definitely isn't. But it is definitely a large chunk of it and I'll explain why.

One of the main reasons I was bullied in school for many many years was because I had never had sex. I think at least half of my friends lied, but it was much easier for them to lie than it was for me; because genetically there was so much wrong with me it was impossible to lie and keep up the pretend. Not only did the bullying of the situation become the icing on the cake; but the romantic fantasies I would concoct made it a desire impossible to bare at times being from ages 8-16 having never experienced a single thing. Most of my classmates have now either had children or had ten plus relationships at my age now being 22. This is why I always feel like there's something wrong with me.

I do believe some of these experiences are distractions from inner problems; and I'm not denying this is true. However what I am denying is that 'relationships don't matter' because they do. Being able to obtain a relationship, matters, having connections, matters, even if you prefer to live the more lonesome life like I clearly do.

I just wish there were girls I could meet where I would not instantly feel a pent up rage inside of me assuming they are going to instantaneously judge me on how I look despite how hard I worked for 5 years to make changes to my face, body. It never changed my genetical features which ultimately has made all of it feel like a waste of time because women have rarely felt any sexual attraction towards me; and if they did, it was to use me for their own gratification or an ego boost, or because they wanted something from me.

Most consider me average looking but I know the aura around me I sense people truly believe I am below average to quite ugly. The blanket stares I get from people can be quite hard to deal with and sometimes this can happen even in my own closest family and friends and can be really tough to bear.

I just wish society focused less on looks and more about the kind of person someone is. I understand it's becoming more this way now especially since so many people become abused in relationships due to focusing on the wrong factors; however do not less this stray from the clear fact that most people get dismissed if they do not find them even slightly sexually attractive.

And this is ultimately why I am so depressed everyday. The more days I wake up the more I feel so lonely and my heart sink lower and lower feeling like I am falling into a pit which I can never crawl back up from. It gets harder and harder to pick myself back up and feel like I can grasp the steering wheel and get my confidence and self worth back up.

I honestly wish myself and everyone good luck for the future in their endeavours and I am very aware there is more to life than this but my one true desire in life is just to be able to experience the ability to obtain a relationship."

Waking up and getting out of bed is difficult enough, but waking up from these dreams makes life so much harder.

I don’t even want to live in real life, now my dreams are just another place I suffer."
0,"I have no hope left. I am 40 yrs old 500 lbs and on disability unable to work. I got a hell of a list of mental issues and I get 800 a month off disability. 400 of it going to bills. no extra income. no family, all are dead or I have nothing to do with the ones that are alive. I have not one friend, and not just saying oh I have no friends, but yet talk to about 3 people per week etc.

I literally have no one. it has been 4 years since I have voice chatted with anyone outside the room mates I live with. it has been over 12 years since I have actually watched movies etc with anyone. I am very high risk for covid, if I catch it, I will not survive it. I will literally die from it. my town doesn't have the vaccination and the nearest town is 30 miles away no way to get there.

all my town has is 20 plus fast food chains. a walmart and a brookshires. tons of dr's and a few churches. I am far from religious and been banned from all the churches for questioning the pastors/preachers and for calling them out on their bs for not doing what they preach but demanded others do what they preach. all my hobbies require money. and I need a vehicle to even do all of my hobbies. only hobbies that don't is gaming and watching movies and tv shows. since I torrent everything. but still, it absolutely sucks.

I owe the housing authority for low income housing 9 thousand dollars, and its not my fault but yet I owe them 9k. I have no car, bought one a few years ago and got scammed out of 3k. I have a crown that is broken and need to get fixed but can't afford the 1200 to fix it nor can I afford the 400 to have it pulled. it is also my only molar that I have left on my left side, if it gets pulled I won't be able to chew any hard foods. the nearest dental college is 30 miles away and again no way to get there and with this covid, I wouldn't trust going until I got my shots.

I been single my entire life, never had a real girlfriend. only about 6 women who pretended to want me and love me then faked their death on me or stalked me for over 5 years. never lasted more than a month with either of them. I have no children. always wanted kids in my early 20's never happened. now I am 40 and just don't want kids of my own anymore.

Spent the past 10 years trying to date and find someone to settle down with and the past 10 years, I have been laughed at, mocked at, made fun of, told to kill myself, told I don't deserve love. had a woman I met on reddit tell me I was a complete piece of shit because she read my post of how I survived 10 yrs being homeless and said anyone who steals is a piece of shit and needs to go to prison. didn't matter why they stole. yet she had 4 kids by 4 diff men no income and living with her parents and judged me for stealing food/socks to survive.

I have lived a hard life and because of it, I have cptsd and severe chronic depression along with paranoia and other issues. making it very hard at times to get over my past and I have cptsd nightmares sometimes of things I been through. meds help sometimes but not all the time. therapy does nothing. tried grounding and other things.

I just got out of 2k debt with 4 credit cards thanks to the stimulus check. I put that 1400 plus the other 600 I had saved towards all 4 credit cards. that 600, took me 4 months to save. I just have no hope left anymore. last time I been hugged, was back in 2012, before that, it was 2007, before that it was 1996. last time anyone told me they loved me and actually meant it, was back in 1996. last woman I been with or tried to be with was back in 2016. before that it was 2012, before that it was 2007. and a couple others between 2007 and 2016 but it was nothing but bs and me basically being catfished.

I just don't have it in me anymore to keep living life. I have no more reason to keep going.

I have done many many things in my life all cash under the table, some were actual paid jobs but didn't last but a few months or a couple weeks before I had to quit.

I have worked on Farms/Ranches and have done many things. I have done things from cleaning horse stalls, pig pens, shoveling manure and laying down fresh hay to washing and brushing horses. I have also done lots of land construction. Building pathways, concrete or cement slabs to build sheds on, all types of fencing even having to move fencing. digging trenches to lay down piping or wires. My day to day jobs varied on what the bosses wanted done on the Ranch/Farm.

I did boxing for six months but was forced to quit due to health issues.

I have taken jobs putting up walls, sheet rock, putting in floors of tile, carpet, laminate, even putting in outlets. I have done home repairs from plumbing, holes in the walls to rotten floors or counters. I have even built tons of different driveways built out of all types of things. Dirt, Rocks, Pavement, Cement, Concrete, Asphalt. I have even built several porches or decks for peoples houses and wheelchair ramps for their homes. I even got into painting ceilings and walls for peoples homes indoors and even installing light fixtures and ceiling fans.

I have owned a landscape company called Big. E. Landscape, which consisted of mowing, edging, trimming, planting trees, plants, bushes, trimming bushes and shrubs.

I went to California and got my Class A - CDL to drive eighteen wheelers and had a job for a bit doing that for almost 5 months but was forced to quit because of my anxiety attacks from driving them. My job was to operate the truck, hook and unhook the trailer, make sure the trailer was safe for transport and was loaded properly and strapped down properly and to plan out the route via a map and make sure I had the route down and all of the fuel stops and rest stops down along the route.

I worked in the rodeo scene preparing horses and bulls for the show and then putting them back in the pins after the show and giving the horses a bath and brushing them after the show.

I worked with this local heavy metal band. Which consisted of setting up their guitar, bass, drums and mic's during shows and tuning them. Then I had to break everything down after the show and put it up.

I got into Archery and even got into fletching arrows and selling the arrows I made. which turned into a small local business of my own.

I owned a small auto business doing tune ups mostly consisting of changing their oil, radiator fluid, spark plugs, belts, alternators, radiators, fans, batteries, tires. bulbs. fuses.

I used to fix computers and do computer repair from home and fixing cars doing tune ups like oil changes flat tire fixes belt changes light bulb changes spark plug changes brake changes alternator changes radiator exchange changing batteries simple minor things like that and ran the business myself and getting customers via online websites or word of mouth.

and here I am, 40 yrs old, no friends, no family. mental issues out the ass, in a small dead end town. no way to get anywhere. no where to go. trapped. every time I tried to leave this town things came up, either needed eye surgery, or had to use what money I saved. I can't do it anymore. regardless how much I try it always blows up in my face or I end up failing and making things worse for myself. I am at this point, just waiting to die."

0,"49 year old guy. Never been in a relationship with a man nor women. Hooked up with anonymous guys when I was in my 30's but that wore off within a few years. Other than that the only person I had ever messed around with in that way was a friend from childhood, John, who I met at age 10. This went on from about 16 until my late 20's.  Unfortunately he apparently saw it as more than simply friends with benefits which is why I had to stop engaging in that with him as it ****ruined our friendship. There is an entire story there but I will leave that for another time. Anyway I am still 'friends' with him although its sort of more out of routine than wanting to actually associate with him. He just stresses me out all the time including lying alot.  However I do think in some twisted way even 20 years later he see's our friendship as more than what it is and was even though I put out the total opposite vibe.

I have never told anyone in my family or social circles about any sexual or romantic or there-lack of aspects of my life as it applies to John or in general. All they know is that John is a friend since childhood.

I have almost no social circle aside from a couple of other normal friends. One of them I talk to about once every couple of months and the other maybe once a week and occasionally go out to eat. Used to hang out with them alot during the late 90's and early 2000's.

My family circle consists of my mother, my brother who I am not close with but talk to and see occasionally and his wife who I will call Laura and who I only tolerate as she is a busybody knowitall who is also into all sorts of conspiracy shit and loves ramming her opinions and views down other peoples throats.

Anyway, apparently my friend John has been messaging Laura on Facebook in recent months even though they were never actually friends in real life. Not sure who started messaging who or why although in a recent text conversation I had with John he said she has been bothering him about cannabis. She is also into pot and CBD and thinks its a cure all for everything and likes to talk about it.I told John to just tell her he is not interested in discussing it and stop bothering him with it. So at that point I assumed that was that.

Well today suddenly Laura messaged my mother on Facebook and asked what is going on between me and John. Of course my mother had no idea what she meant. Laura went on to say that John seemed to be saying stuff that led her to think he was was obsessed with me and said that can be interpreted as, to use the word she used, ""mushy"".

Now John is a weird guy in general and is not the brightest bulb in the lamp but I can't imagine what he said that she thought was ""mushy"" but I am royally pissed off at him and for that matter her about the whole thing. I don't need more crap in my life. I have enough stress. Anyway John apparently talked to her about more than just pot. Honestly Laura probably dug at him to find out more about me and he was not smart enough to watch what he said. Again as I said she is a busybody. Now I do not think he actually went into detail but I suspect it was more about his tone when referring to me, enough so that it raised a flag for her.

I plan to get in touch with John tonight to find out what the hell is going on and I also am going to end the friendship. He already stresses me out and now THIS. He really screwed me over. I want nothing to do with him anymore. But he has forever left this new dark cloud over my head by not being able to keep personal shit about me and him to himself, especially when talking to people who are also part of my social or family circle."

0,"6 years ago I had an illness I wasn't aware I had. I don't want to get into the illness right now, but I had really bad vertigo-like symptoms and I had been throwing up every day for about two weeks.

Even though I live in a courty with free healthcare, I've always had a mentality that the hospital should be the last resort. I can tough it out until I get better. I was convinced it was just a flu. Finally enough people close to me convinced me to go.

As soon as I get to the ER, I told the lady at reception my symptoms and before I know it I'm being rushed to a bed and I have IV's sticking out of me, a heart monitor attached and nurses taking blood samples at a very alarming rate. In all my years I've never been whisked away in the ER like that. I always have to wait like 4 hours to see anybody.

I finally talk to a doctor after a few hours of laying there, and he tells me if I had waited even one more day to go to the hospital, I would have died. Those words have haunted me every day since.

I forget how long I was in the hospital in total, about a week I think. It was really tough mentally. I cried every single night, and had more thoughts of suicide than I ever had in my life combined.

My then girlfriend would come see me every day after work, and she wouldn't leave until they kicked all the visitors out for the night. We were so in love then.. She would hold me in my bed and tell me everything was going to be okay. When I started to regain my strength we would hold hands and go for walks around the hospital together. I sincerely believe the reason I survived was because I had her.

Fast forward to today, and I'm medically okay. I've recovered fully, and am syptom free, but my life has done nothing but go downhill since then.

My girlfriend and I were together over a decade before she left me for another man. I have no friends anymore, just a couple of pen pals, I have no family. I owned the business of my dreams, and now I'm unemployed going on a year.

If I had died then, I would have died happy, in love, surrounded by people who cared a out me, and with so much potential

I survived, but for what?"

0,"Christmas in 2020 was shit. me and my brother went to my dads after he phone us telling us that he had something to tell us. We went up thinking that his cancer might be back again which he got in 2018. But after we got in the house and sat down it was really clear that wasn’t it. He told us that he was arrested for indecent photos of children.... at first I wanted to beat the shit out of him. I was built up with soo much rage and anger but I am not normally a angry person. He then told us that tried to kill him self three times in the space of two weeks and telling us that he was sorry and shit. Me and my dad haven’t ever really had the best relationship and he didn’t have any clue about me ever. That night I went home told my mum what happened then went to bed and all these scenarios went through my head. What happens when his name gets put out on newspaper or something and I have to change my first name and second name. Which leads to me then having to tell my friends and other people who might know ask me why i change it and stuff. And then they might think that I might be like him or something. Once I did discussion thing in school and it was about Paedophiles and crime n shit why I think they should get the death penalty for doing the crime. Then I thought would I want my own dad to get it and now I am in this situation...... few other things played through my head that night. Didn’t get any sleep as well. Ever since then I felt like shit and everybody that I know or has ever seen me has been talking about me behind my back and saying shit about me or my family. My friends in last couple of months have been distance away from me and every now and then I see photos of them out and shit and never get invited or anything and now I am thinking some of that stuff I was thinking on that very same night just might be true. And now stuck in this situation we’re my friends might not like me evermore and everyone in town knows what my dad is and what they think about me.... it’s crazy to think that something that was completely out my hands or any sort of control has ruined my life and now stuck in this depression day in and day out and been hiding it. Been trying to find myself a apprenticeship for like nearly month now and starting to think I might turn into him. And now I don’t know what to do and starting to go deeper and deeper into a hole everyday. Anyways I hope  everyone has better life than me. love you all👍

0,"I used to be in a sport in which getting bruises, and sometimes injuries, were common. When I was first starting out, I’d get a lot of bruises. My wrist would be covered with bruises. I’d come home from 5 hour afterschool practices exhausted, worn out, and starving. I’d get bruises on my wrists, my legs, knees, sometimes even my nose. Once, I got a small bruise on my lip and eye. I’m no longer in that sport, and I miss it. I miss feeling like crap after practices; I miss unknowingly going hours without eating and coming home with a new bruise that would last a week. Those bruises at least kept me interested. It would look different with every passing day; maybe I’d wake up and it’d be darker or lighter, or maybe the color would become more purple. I don’t get bruises as easily anymore and I miss it. I don’t even know why I was so infatuated with having and getting bruises, but I miss them. It’s so stupid."

0,"So I’m not really sure what to say but I have a question and I’ll give some background that might help. 

How do you deal with depression and getting school work done? 

I’m in college living away from home, and I’ve had an unconventional route through college due to health complications. I am currently seeing a therapist and taking medication but I wanted advice from other people who deal with depression. 

Depression is something I’ve struggled with for a while and usually I go through periods where it’s difficult for me to get work done, but it usually passes and I’m able to catch back up. 

But this past semester my depression has been pretty bad. As I’ve said I’m working through issues that contribute to this and am actively trying to get better. But my school work has been severely impacted and I am behind. I am still getting some of my work done but often I find it really difficult to do anything productive and instead do things that distract my mind - tv and video games. 

I was just wondering if anyone had advice on how to get myself to do work or motivate myself during this period?"
0,"I have developed major insecurities and depressive, suicidal thoughts over the course of the COVID-19 lockdown. I had a lot of time in my hands, and most of it were spent thinking about my situation where I had slapped myself with harsh realizations. I have regarded myself as poor and somewhat handicapped due to my situation. To get in straight to the point, I feel insecure and jealous of the people around me living in subdivisions. Literally every single one of the  people I know lives in one, while I live in the middle of the city. They live their lives with fresh air in the mornings and cold breeze at the night, while 24/7 I go out and all my nose gets is polluted air and dust. They live with peaceful bird chirping sounds while there's not 10 seconds of silence in here due to the endless traffic noises and annoying honkings. 

I love playing sports (basketball and badminton) and I have become a varsity player at school beginning at my sophomore year. I realized that I only get to practice when I get my ass off to an arena which will take a couple of minutes (and travel, entrance fees, gets expensive overtime) to get into, while my friends just casually go out their houses and play in basketball and badminton courts in their village. The insecurity in me is that I could've become this, could've become that.. if only I had the means to do it. Yes, no excuses quotes exists, but damn it's painful to see everyone excel at a very rapid rate than me. I also like to record songs but traffic noises piss me everytime and throws my mood away.. while my friends just flex on me their peaceful sounding subdivisions and record their music with minimal takes.

What made everything worse is that, the lockdown literally gated me from doing EVERYTHING... while them... they CAN STILL do the usuals. Damn, it pains me when I see their stories about playing basketball, taking walks in their village, practicing driving, morning jogs, leisure activities, cycling, while all I feel is that I'm rotting inside my house. All I have is my computer, and all I do all day is play a bunch of games. I resorted into gaming getting my dopamine to somewhat ease the pain, but everytime before I sleep everything just hits me again. It sucks that I try to be happy everytime my friends and my girlfriend say something about their activities in their subdivision, deep inside I feel so jealous and insecure... 

I do not envy anyone though. In fact, it is good that they have such privileges. It is one's fault that this is my situation. It is just undeniable that I feel like trash and depressed every single day. I wish I could take fresh air in.. wish I can walk at mornings, afternoons, evenings.. wish I can go out of my house without wearing masks. I feel like I am wasting my teenage years where I have the most potential.. inside my house in total isolation with nothing to do but online classes and gaming. It just sucks that my relationships are being affected too (I have been a lot irritable and my family thinks I hate them. I have also lost so much emotional and mental strength, affecting my relationship with my girlfriend), since I am losing motivation to be better at anything... I stopped my workout, my regular practice of coding... chores and hygiene.. I feel like everything is so unfair for me and there's no more reason to continue.

I wish I lived in a subdivision. If only my family was rich enough (my sibling also feels the same way as me, although we haven't talked about it, but I hear her having emotional breakdowns about this certain matter), but that's another conversation, and a whole another insecurity as well."
0,"Im turning 19 and i hopefully will be graduating in a few months from high school. I say hopefully because ive really been low functioning since covid happened and my parents are only getting angrier and more disappointed with me now that Im becoming the opposite of what I used to be. 

I just wanted to ask how you know if it's the right time to tell them? Im really itching to tell them right now cause we just had a big fight but they probably wont listen to me because of this. 

Should I tell them about my cutting and suicidal plans/ideation? 

How do I approach them?

Im usually bad with words but my mom probably wont let me give her a page with my writing on it since i already tried doing that when i wanted to quit the IB program (it's like AP in the US and A-levels in the UK).

We're low income and have language barriers as Asian immigrants living in Europe so we probably cant afford professional help. I regret not asking my school counselor before spring break on how i should tell my parents so im asking you guys : ) thank you if your read through this.

Been fighting with depression,  Anxiety,  Suicidal Thoughts and Self harm urges for a few good years but in all honesty I am tired.  I feel like everyday comes and goes but there is no real reason, goal or ambitions behind it. 
I feel like I am a shall of what I once was and I can't even find something to be happy about, the girl I love seems to not really care about me, or us as in a relationship. It feels like no matter how much effort and time I try to put into something it will inevitably fail,  like it did so many times before. I can hardly see a point to it anymore but I keep pushing,  I am telling myself that everything is okay when I can't help but feel the opposite thing every single night. I am  a hypocrite,  I am telling others how to try and achieve hapiness while I know fully that is never that simple.. at times I wished I was dead, other times I am happy to be alive.

0,"Does anyone ever get that feeling of isolation? When you try to be open about your struggle with Mental Health -- especially with those closest to you -- but you feel a bit of backlash that all you do is identify with depression and that you are just burdening people around you with your negative energy. I mean I try the best I can to put my outlet in other things to try to let out the steam and not on my relationships, but shit, sometimes you just want to talk to another human being. But then you're only faced with shame feeling like you overshared and all you should do is bottle everything up inside again -- the very same habit that brought you here in the first place. This sucks."

1,"I met my abuser properly on Saturday, 14th April, 2018 at my friend’s birthday party in my friend’s house. I first went over to my abuser’s house for the first time on Wednesday, 18th April, 2018 where he gave me my first kiss. I lost my virginity to my abuser on Monday, 23rd April, 2018. I attended a party on Saturday, 28th April, 2018 and loads of my abusers friends approached me and asked how he was in bed. My abuser then had a go at me, accusing me of telling everyone about us and threatening to leave.

Why didn’t I read that sign and just leave then.

Last night I had a vivid dream of the memory of Saturday, 14th April, 2018 - walking through the house of the party. I didn’t know I could dream of memories. This is the first time this has happened. I’m scared to go to sleep tonight.

Just now, I got a notification from Instagram saying “follow .... and other people you may know” and it was him. My abuser. I thought I had him blocked everywhere but clearly not. It’s taken my account this long to recommend him. Why now? Why after that dream? Why in APRIL of all months? Why? Why why why.

Do you ever feel like things happen for a reason and that coincidences are often too fucking coincidental to JUST BE coincidences?! Do you believe in fate? Do you believe in those horribly painful gut feelings that something isn’t right? I do. I really really do. Because usually my gut feeling is right and usually it isn’t just a coincidence.

I’m terrified to sleep incase I dream of a worse or more painful memory. I’m now scared that fate’s gonna make me run into him again soon. He only lives ten minutes up the hill from me. It makes me scared to leave the house. And when things like this happens, it makes it worse.

I’d like to disclose that I AM on the waiting list for a domestic abuse counselling thing. It’s not okay that this still kills me so much when he left over two years ago."
1,"I feel like the men who did this to me stole a part of me. They took a piece of me I could never get back

Loved ones hurt me not strangers. I shouldn’t be afraid of strangers hurting me because it was the ones who “loved me” that hurt me, not a stranger. There is no way someone who loved another could do anything like that to them. It should be a stranger who hurts someone like that. Friends don’t assault friends. Boyfriends shouldn’t choke their girlfriends unconscious. 

I am scared. I am tired. I miss therapy. (Mine is on maternity leave currently.) I am down."
1,"Last year was a rough one for me at work. Not to get overly specific, but I ended up in a few situations that have ended with me having severely impaired ability to do my job. Some days are good, some most days are really bad. It’s to the point where it’s effecting my life, my wife, and my work. My substance use has exploded, and is officially a crutch. Without sugarcoating it, I’m pretty fucked up. So I make the decision to go see my family doctor and have a conversation with him. He’s been great in helping me deal with my ADHD, and is usually right on the ball. My fear was that it would be downplayed, and I’d get the “you just aren’t cut out for it” speech or the “if you don’t like it find another job.” Needless to say, all my worst worries came through, and my doctor told me about all the mental health issues in his field. I believe this was a way to try and build rapport, but in the end it was extremely belittling. We talked about the need to build resiliency, which I’m totally on board with, but he refused to accept that I feel no improvement from online counselling, and NEED to talk to people in person. Now I’m just laying in bed, trying to figure what my next step is. I feel broken beyond words, and hopeless that there will be any improvement."
1,"I have these mini attacks a few times a week. I'll just be laying around and then suddenly my brain drifts and im back there or ill be watching something and get triggered but it isn’t enough to send me on a spiral. Still i can feel my heart rate spike and my body go ""oh shit it's go time."" I am fortunate enough to have one of those phones where i can check my heart rate and stress so i get to understand what's happening and it isn’t pretty. During attacks it can be 100 to 110 bpm resting heart rate and at one point i had a particularly bad attack that left me ~140 for roughly 7 hours despite doing literally nothing.

The worst is that the desire for meth hasn’t disappeared but I’m sober since then. Any advice, I’ve suffered from trauma in the past but this trauma in specific has been the most intense of this kind, has took all of my desire to live and exist. I live in constant fear."

1,"I'm male and 23. And now i realize more clearly that me and my 3 sisters where sexually abused by our father in our early childhood. I know because my sisters and my mother are now speaking more openly to me about those things. 

As my mother told me lately, she had been raped by him also often times.
I myself can't remember anything that happend to me or my sisters. It all comes clearer now but i had heard of those things a few times when i was younger. Though i didn't really realised it. Don't know how else to formulate it.

I did know and realised quite early however, that my family was a bit messed up and that my mother couldn't take care of her children properly. She was very angry with them often times. Also hit them and blamed them for the difficult situations we often found ourselfs in. She sometimes even punished us for our need of care when we where ill.

Still, this whole story about how this all came to happen and why there was so little help for us for so long and why many family members didn't ever talked about this or even disclaimed many of the terrible conditions we were in. 

Some parts of me say: ""is this all true? What when it is not. How am i to behave. How am i to go about every day live. What must i do to get my live together. Can i even do it? 
How hard must i try. I failed so often. ...""

I left ""home"" when i was 17, i lived in different places but barely felt at home anywhere. I quit different schoolings, now i work as a cleaner for about 5 hours per week.since nearly 2 years I'm in a sincere intimate relationship for the first time in my life and we are about to move together.I also go to therapie since about 3 months one time per week, which i think helps me.

I feel so traumatised by the YouTubers i grew up with; by the general community- the police etc. I feel so helpless; small; weak; insignificant. I feel like I am not doing anything even if I advocate, educate, donate... I feel so... dumb yknow... Like, if I couldn't help myself, at least, I wanna help others and I cant even do that? I am so scared of humans that I been so avoidant of everyone and I feel extremely alone. I just feel and see hatred and pain everywhere I go. Going by my day, knowing that someone got SA'd, someone got m\*rdered. That my best friend will never have justice. I will never have justice. Even if I am studying my dream major thinking ""oh i can at least help ONE person, at least ill make the tiniest change"", IT'S STILL Not enough.

I don't wanna feel like the every single person could end up being evil. I wish i can trust people again, and be dumb and fall in love easily. It was so much easier to just- love and trust. My naive view of the world was so much better than noticing and feeling every little detail. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I just want to be free. I want to feel safe. I want to trust and love again. I want to be happy. I wish I can let go of everything and erase all my trauma. I don't wanna live like this...."

1,"So some background my mom was mentally abusive, her ex-husband(stepdad) was 1 of 2 sexual abusers of mine, the neighbors daughter my ""friend"" who was another. Lately I've been relapsing so badly that im shaking, can't breathe but then i breathe in so much that it hurts to breathe in but i wont release the air, its gotten so bad that i can't talk coherently just choppy but understandable sentences, instead of usual 1 memory I've been getting every single memory and more that i forgot about. Lately I've been daydreaming so much, not only that but I'll be having moments where I'll forget who I am for like 5 maybe 10 seconds forget who i am what I'm doing but then I come back. Then there's times I'm so paranoid around people that I don't want to stay around them in school but I want to cry but can't so I panic. There's times that I have out of body experiences but my body continues to  do whatever I was doing like I'd be taking notes in class but then I'm out of my body moving in my memories and my body will continue taking notes fully and when I come back they're done. It scares me when that happens because I didn't learn anything but I copied and finished everything done, I've done it while walking as well while carrying a food tray and sat down at a table then snapped back and I looked at my boyfriend confused and asked how did I get hear this was in 8th grade I'm now in tenth and it's only gotten worse even though I've been better I was released from therapy. When my dad is left with my dad I get paranoid and sit there for ages to make sure she's safe and I know that's not healthy my still boyfriend from 8th grade I told him he ever hurts our kids I will leave him in a heartbeat and make sure he gets heck in jail because my mother stopped my abuse from her ex-husband but kept him in the house. I don't know what to do I've been so bad lately that its taking a toll on my relationship and though my boyfriend is so strong and has been helping me so much when i relapse(not usually this bad) I push him away almost ending the relationship for him to have a ""happier life and normal life"" though he said he's happiest with me and he said his life isn't normal that he's lives a great life and loves helping me he loves caring for me and helping knowing my family is not the best... but lately because my moms ex-husband isn't behind bars he still sees my siblings (which are his blood related kids, and the reason my abuse happened so long was because i believe if it happened to me it wouldn't happen to them that I was protecting them) Hes not behind bars he still sees them and lately my issues have been happening so bad that I'm somehow messing with my memories thinking I made them up, my mom used to yell at me that i was on her Sh\*t list and my aunt was on there knowing she hated my aunt and my mom said I was on there but it didn't hit me that she hated be till I saw the list a  physical list right under my aunts name so i knew my mom hated me, and well that aunt said in the beginning when i told my dad what happened she said what if he was brainwashing me which i know isn't true but her saying that made me start thinking i was making this all up that maybe i had a bad dream like the many I've had, I'm starting to doubt myself and I told my boyfriend and he said ""no, i know this happened to you with the great detail and breakdowns you've had the fear you show whenever your siblings are alone with your parents, as awful as it is I know it happened and honey I'm hear for you to vent, cry, and be listened and believed in I'm here for you.""  Many people at school and home life see me as happy but never see this side of me besides my partner, they don't see my paranoia, doubt, the struggle of remembering to eat because I developed eating disorders that I'm healing from, shaking, breathing, the forgetting who I am, and out of body, they never see all the memories that I live, yet they say I'm living the highlight of life which they aren't wrong I'm the happiest my entire life I've finally been happy living life not wanting to disappear or die, but everyone tries to make it seem like I've lived nothing. I overreact so much to little things but I can't control it. I don't know what to do I'm scared for people to see me at school when I can't control it. My family called me a chemical F\*ck up because I'm pansexual and nonbinary, they see that because I chemically have a difference that make me attracted to shes/hes/theys and thems to them all that I'm a screw up because I'm attracted to those and that they compare me to those who want equality out on protest for that when yes I want equality but I'm doing everything for them to not get angry for those out there when I have done anything. Just what can I do to calm down better to heal better to feel better and not doubt my memories, who I am, and everything in life. I'd like advice."

1,"I am 17, and I think I have been through a lot of trauma for my age (my mother tried to kill me so I was adopted by my grandparents, they died, I was manipulated and abandoned by my aunt, who threw me into an even more abusive home until I moved out at 16)

I have depression and anxiety, which I was diagnosed with when I was around 12, but this was before I went through most of my trauma and I have never been reassessed for any other mental health issues. What I find odd is that I don’t have any strong symptoms of PTSD, the only thing I can think of that could lead into it is I have really bad abandonment issues (I have nightmares of people I care about dying and I am paranoid that everyone I love will either die or leave me) But that doesn’t line up with symptoms of PTSD. I’ve only ever had a strong “trigger” once when I was around 13, I saw a scene of a hospital or something and I started crying because it reminded me of losing my grandmother, but this was before I was fully orphaned or went through any emotional or physical abuse so I don’t think it counts."

1,"First of all, I would like to say a HUGE thank you to everybody on this sub. You all have been so supportive. We’re some strong people. 

I wanted to write this to share my story and hopefully give some people recovery hope. 

How did I do it? I wish I had a better answer, but time and realization. My PTSD lasted about a year and a half, which is lucky compared to some of the people I’ve seen battling it for 5+. By realization, most of what was holding me back from recovery was guilt and regret. I put myself in my abuser’s shoes and asked myself various questions in that position. I actually became angry at my abuser for taking my childhood away, which was a big step. 

I still get the occasional flashback, but they’re not the panic-inducing ones I used to know. More like bad thoughts. 

My advice to everyone here (based off my experience!) is to...
-be patient, give it time! 
-put yourself in your abuser(s) shoes if you feel guilty
-realize you are worthy of love, abusers have tactics to make you feel otherwise! 

And something that personally helped me...
-The second most recent episode of Grey’s Anatomy. There is some deep PTSD and life advice in it. 

Lastly, stay strong! The storm will eventually end."

I display very strong symptoms of ADHD and was wondering what made everyone else confirm it in their heads whether they had ADHD or not(again aside from the diagnosis) 

I also am not asking this as medical advice or a diagnosis, just as wanting to know others experience with this.

Also another thing to note is that while the trauma was trauma it wasnt anything that was extremely intense. Like at all."

1,"General TW- talk of trauma, gender, sexual characteristics, depression/suicidal, intrusive thoughts, and the general content could just be overwhelming for some 

Also sorry it’s so jumpy I’ve been writing this during a panic attack for 30 minutes and I still feel awful. 

I (m17) have a lot of trauma I’ve been through that was consistent for my entire life and I’m still honestly not out of the woods even now. Its probably resulted in cPTSD but I’m undiagnosed so it’s only possible, thought I think likely. The only thing is it’s not typical trauma, nothing bad happened to me physically, there were no isolated events, it was just consistent and there all of the time from day 1 of my life. I am intersex (XY with internal testes and ambiguous genitalia) and when I was born I appeared more female than male so they had sent me out that way and I was raised female. I was called a girl, people called me she, I wasn’t allowed to cut my hair until middle school, people thought I was biologically female, and I had to use the girls bathrooms and changing rooms. Of course I had the perfect storm of things going on that made me seem like a typical female (gynecomastia and pseudo-menses), yet I was not because I am male. From as young as age 5 I remember always telling people I was a boy and I kept begging to be referred to as such. I told teachers and other kids I had a penis but my parents thought I was girl. I was ignored, dismissed, and laughed off. My dad was nice enough to hear me out to a degree and let me do cub-scouts with my brother, participate on boys sports teams, and took me out to do typical father-son activities but he still called me his daughter. It wasn’t enough. I broke down in health class multiple times because I had to attend the girls portion of the class. I skipped gym all of the time because they wanted me to change in the girls lockers, I just walked the halls and hid around. I used the boys bathroom whenever I could in public or at school and while that was relieving it didn’t do much to curb the damage done. Eventually I just stopped going to school most of the time because I knew I would be perceived as female and I couldn’t deal with that, so I stayed home. I was miserable all throughout middle school and most of high school, which I dropped out of because I was tired and ready to move on to better things (yay for early college I guess). In 7th grade my parents actually started to listen to me (mainly my mom) and took me to a doctor who suggested I might be transgender. It made sense at the time so I just went with it, even though it felt off and not right. I was put on hormone blockers and stayed on them until the end of my freshman year of high school. I gained a lot of weight and because I was barely starting puberty my voice was still high. I looked androgynous and sounded like a girl. People who didn’t know me gendered me correctly which was good, but most already knew who I was so I was incorrectly perceived. My freshman year I remember a junior guy gendering me correctly and consistently in my civics class and it was probably the thing I looked forward to most cause he would talk to me about typical boy shit like boners and sports, and it was finally someone seeing me for my real gender. Then of course a classmate who knew me told him I “used to be a girl” and he kind of stopped talking to me after that. Never gonna forgive that classmate that’s for sure, since she was wrong and he was actually right. At 14 and 15 I still sounded like a 12 year old boy (which of course 12 year old boys sound like girls) so that sometimes set people off who didn’t know me, but most of the time I was just assumed younger (which I guess in terms of pubescent stages I was, so I’m not offended by someone thinking I was 12 at 15, especially cause they gendered me right). Thankfully that’s not the case now as I’m finally going through puberty (started at 15 when I started testosterone replacement therapy). I look and sound like a normal guy my age now. I only got my intersex condition confirmed a few months ago which is good to finally have knowledge of but also now I’m stuck with everyone I knew before thinking I’m a trans guy so that kinda sucks since I can’t explain the reality of the situation. That’s how it still kind of lingers but at least I’m not viewed as a girl anymore, at least not to my face...

TL;DR - I was raised female as a biological male with an intersex condition and it was traumatic

Now onto how it’s affecting me currently. Of course I’ve been horribly depressed for a majority of my life because of the trauma I went through but after dropping out of high school and getting away from the people who gendered me incorrectly I started feeling a lot better. I finished my GED, started community college, started working out, got a job, things were good. Even during the beginning of covid it wasn’t unbearable, things were fine until around December I would say. I also have OCD so that also plays a part in this, it may even be trauma induced I’m not sure, but it went from manageable to hard to manage in that month. However since the beginning of the year it’s gone from hard to manage to crippling, on top of trauma attacks and loneliness with no outlets to vent outside the internet. I’ve developed something akin to body dysmorphia is the only way I can really describe it. I can’t look at my face or body without thinking I look like a girl or a young man who looks like he used to be one. I can’t hear my voice without thinking it sounds like a girls voice and in my head my inner voice still sounds like my pre pubescent self. Objectively speaking I look and sound nothing like a girl, there’s no “tells” that I was once perceived as one and theres no indication that I’m biologically female in any way. But my mind says otherwise. It says that my ambiguous genitalia are normal for a female and that my penis is just an enlarged clitoris. It says my testes aren’t actually there and I’m just wishfully thinking because I don’t want to be a girl. It says my gynecomastia is normal female development and not abnormal male breast enlargement. It says I’m biologically female even though I am objectively not. It tells me I look female even though I objectively don’t. I can’t be around women or trans guys for long without getting uncomfortable because of those sort of thoughts, it’s triggering. Looking at photos of myself or hearing voice recordings from before I started puberty is triggering. Those triggers and thoughts send me into a panic and I break down and cry just hoping it’ll end and that someone might be able to help me but nobody ever does. I just suffer alone with nobody to talk to. I’m constantly paranoid that people view me as female or that they secretly call me “she” behind my back. I’m always afraid people don’t actually view me as male and that they would lie if they were asked. I was constantly dismissed and ignored as a child when I told people I was a boy and I just get so overwhelmed by how I was never believed and nobody addressed my concerns until it was far too late to undo any damage. It wasn’t fair and I get so angry sometimes and shut down over it. I always have the urge to cut off everybody I know currently and rebuild my life as I want it so I don’t have to doubt how others perceive me. I’m constantly obsessing over and checking my body to make sure I’m still male and look male and because of my distorted perception and intrusive thoughts most times acting on those compulsions don’t even help. My perception is so warped that it’s basically in another reality and the paranoia is getting to me. Most days I don’t even want to speak or be looked at by anyone, not even myself because I’m so scared of how I’ll be perceived. Whenever I get triggered and panic I feel physically sick. I can’t whisper or speak quietly because it sounds like a female voice, why I really don’t know but it’s probably because most guys revert to their falsetto when they speak quieter or whisper since it uses less of your vocal chords. I have random crying spells brought on by seemingly nothing but just remembering the past and those intrusive thoughts. I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual just to try and escape them. This trauma has ruined me and I can’t take it anymore. I’ve been rapidly declining for weeks now and I’m approaching being borderline suicidal because it’s gotten so bad. Things have gotten bad again and I can’t even tell anybody because they just wouldn’t get it. I feel so broken and I need help but I don’t know where to start. 

TL;DR- I’m suffering too much and just about ready to let it all go"
1,"I know it’s not healthy and that it only makes me feel worse but usually at night, I’ll actively seek movies/episodes of shows/poems even that i know will trigger me and make me feel like shit.. 
I’m not sure if it’s just a way of self harm, me trying to actually feel something after feeling numb all day or me trying to prove myself that I’m okay enough and i can stomach it without getting triggered. 

Most times i just end up getting triggered, feeling sad and crying myself to sleep. It’s all my fault tho.. i wish i could forget about and stop harming myself but I can’t.."
1,"Okay, I'll start off by saying that I'll spoiler this post to make sure nobody gets triggered or anything, so there's a warning for mentions of manipulation and some generally toxic things. I'm also new to this subreddit and currently suffer from PTSD and such.  
Anyways, it was about 2-3 months ago (or more) when this happened. I was talking with a few friends over like, text and stuff (these friends are online, not IRL) and all the sudden they started talking about a guy who I'll call S. S used to be nice, but after a while he began to turn into, well, an asshole. Being passive-aggressive all the time, generally saying some shitty things to people who didn't do anything, and overall being very toxic and manipulative, etc. Of course, I was best friends with S and I didn't let go because I was fairly young at the time. S, therefore, was shitty to me and others and being generally toxic and what-not. Yadda-yadda, the friends that were having a conversation about him went through a similar situation with him. During this time as well I felt guilty about what S did, regretting some of my actions and how I treated S despite S being the cause.  
So yeah, friends were talking about how much of an ass S was and, all of a sudden, I got shaky. From what I remember I was shaking, could hardly breathe, and I couldn't calm myself down. I also got a feeling of guilt hit me like a truck because, you know, S. It took me about 30-45 minutes to finally calm down.  


Does anyone know what this was? I think it might've been a normal panic attack but I have no idea what actually happened. Was it a PTSD attack, a panic attack, or something else? To those who give advice thank you so much in advance."
1,"Repost from r/CPTSD

So I just for the sake of needing to get it all out because I tend to not be able to, I just wanna list all i've been through from childhood to adulthood. I'm a gay male with DID btw.

\*Ages 3-5: I can't remember a lot, from ages 3 and I assume even before I would neglected, not physically, but emotionally by my mother and my father had abandoned me as a child and would be completely neglected via not being hugged or comforted ever and being forced to ""Cry it out."" I would be sexually abused at either age 4 or 5 by two men whom I still can't remember who had forced themselves on me and hurt me and as a result I would be very frightened and unable to attend pre-school initially because I would cry and scream and hurt myself so much and be so clingy that I couldn't attend my first one.

\*Ages 6-8: At these ages my mother being sexually assaulting me, forcing me to shower with her in which she would expose herself to me and make me touch her body. At this age as well if not sexual abuse by her I would be forced into emotional incest, being forced to comfort her at the same time as she was assaulting me because she would cry about being a bad mother and I would be forced to play the role of her husband and tell her I loved her, gave her back rubs and hugs. My grandma who has bipolar 1 like me began to stop taking her meds every now and then and became extremely abusive as well verbally and she and my mom would neglect me or constantly insult me every single day. I would begin to start showing more signs of sexual abuse such as bedwetting and other behaviors. As well I would be constantly bullied by students. At this time I had also protected my friends from a robber and hid them as a man stole my brothers items. As well at this time I told my mother I wished to die to go to heaven where it's safe in which she laughed it off and walked away.

\*Ages 9-10: At this time I would be harassed and bullied by students and then my own teachers as well as my mother and grandma and grandpa who was a drunkard. My mom became boyfriends with a man who would also terrorize me, I was witness to him smashing a chair into his brothers head repeatedly and had to be the adult in the situation and protect him by stepping in front of him and saying ""You wouldn't hurt a child would you?"", then afterwards bandaging his brother myself. I would be witness to his cocaine addiction and him coming home cracked out and scaring me while he was having bad trips. Him threatening to kill me or beat me, and other stuff of that nature. Being around my mother, him and his friend mocking and yelling at me while they were drunk and I was crying, and telling me intimate details of sex life and how they were selling drugs together to addicts. I was repeatedly told that I was a bitch, always complaining and the abuser.

\*Ages 11-14: I would be forced to move into my grandma's house because of my mom's frivolous spending, in which every single day I would be screamed or tortured by my grandma, grandpa, cousin, aunt, sister, and mom and be forced to pick fights with every one of them and be harassed by them. My memory in general is extremely poor but I remember extremely little of the sexual abuse when I was younger and this period as well. My mom broke up with her boyfriend after moving in as well. During this period I would be routinely mocked in a group by most of my family members as I cried. I was forced to go to therapy because I was a ""problem child"" and in those therapy sessions my mom would talk to the therapist and the therapist and my mom would never allow me to talk during sessions with two therapists, with both therapists the only listened to my mom's needs and wants and never gave any advice other than ""Go do breathing exercises I guess.""

\*Ages: 15-17: I was living in an apartment with my mom after she moved out, in which she would refuse to sleep and go into psychosis and terrify me and abuse me verbally every day and act even more childlike than she already has throughout life. At 16-17 when I entered high school my mom's ex-boyfriend dumped his ex-girlfriend on us and she lived with us for two years in which she stole from us and I barely had any food to eat, she shouted at me and was also an addict. Was forced to endure my mother's psychosis even more and was not allowed to sleep for two days straight because she would wake me every 30 minutes on the dot. At age 15 I had begun to engage with older men online for sexual gratification and was at 17 groomed and sexually abuse by an older man. Due to my feminine appearance and desire to shave being called the T-slur by my mother and was insulted for my sexuality and tried to be convinced that I was straight.

\*Ages 18-19 (Now): I still live with my mother, she still shouts at me and nowadays I am more or less her caregiver, she has refused to allow to get my drivers license, refused to allow me to be independent, and generally keeps me in the house the most of the time and still hurts my feelings. I am currently in therapy for my trauma."
1,"I've always thought that my boyfriend mother has been very similar to the behavior of my abusive father. But, I always brushed it off because I figured she would never behave to the full extent in front of me. I've heard stories from my boy friend about how she has controlled him through the years and suffocated him with her control to the point of severe depression. She took him to therapy and spoke for him the whole time. She had the therapist make him a schedule that she approved and forced him to follow. He was only allowed to do school and therapist/mother approved activities. 

She in more recent years yells at him to do chores the minute she says it even if he's in the bathroom it doesn't matter. 

I've never liked her but always respected her to keep peace. I always assumed if I kept up that behavior it would be fine, but today I realized I was wrong.

My Bf and I came home from rock climbing and where starving so we where excited and thankful that his mother had made rice. The only problem is it had cilantro in it and I don't like cilantro. However I didn't want to say anything because I wanted to be a good guest. My bf knowing I don't like cilantro started suggesting alternative meals. Once his mother heard this she started yelling about how ""We should be grateful for her for providing for us"" and just eat the rice.  Once the shouting started I was immediately teleported back to being a child where my abusive father was yelling at me the exact same phrase as he tried to force feed me food, after I told him I was full, he'dthen raise his hand and hit me.  I felt like I would collapse, so I ran to my bfs room and laid in bed frozen. Once I was sure I could suppress my panic attack I went back to the kitchen and told my bf I was leaving. My bf walked me to my car and the minute I left his house I broke down. I almost collapsed to the floor and was in tears. He comforted me until I felt safe to drive and I explained every thing to him.

I just feel so ashamed for letting this happen to me. I felt helpless and scared after teaching myself how to be brave for so long. I'm terrified this will happen again but rn his parents house is the only place we can really spend time together. My house is overcrowded and I share  a room. His house is much bigger and easier to be alone in. I just feel lost and scared that this will be a regular occurrence."
1,"Vet with a bit of success.

Hello everyone. This is my first post here. I’ve taken time to respond to other post, offer my support and suggestions.  

I feel like this is the moment to share my story.

I’m a 36 year old veteran of operation Iraqi freedom. Ever sense I left theater I was never the same. After a tour in Korea I took alcohol to a whole new level, and after I departed serving. I just got worse. 
Now there were some ups. I created a business, I had two beautiful daughters, and met my soul mate. 
All of that being said I still couldn’t be happy. 

In the past year and half to two years, I have completely hit the bottom. Had to pivot business just so it could survive. Had a long up hill battle and was drinking myself to sleep. Oh and that soul mate? I became emotionally abusive, she took care of me, loved me unconditionally. Picked me up off the floor every time I was that drunk, and stood by my through every single suicide attempt, and I destroyed her, and I destroyed her life. 

In this warpath I discovered a brewery of other veterans. This guys had found treatment. Unfortunately it’s treatment that the VA doesn’t cover. So after another complete slip I dove into my pocket and paid for treatment.

I was not happy about doing some “hippy shit” these guys and this Dr put me on clinical ketamine treatment, meditation, and journaling what I’m grateful for. The first treatment was a horrible experience with amazing results, and it didn’t take. Sober for a few days and back to being a miserable asshole. 
Reason why? If I told you something would you listen? And that’s exactly why. I had more important things then to follow up with the personal after care. 

So it goes 4 treatments later. I finally get it. I’ve been sober, I’m journaling, and I found the cause of my diagnosis. Fear, when we crossed that berm we were all scared to death. It’s only natural. But there were more deep seeded issues outside of Iraq that I discovered in treatment. 

It goes without saying, you’re a special kind of fucked up to sign up in a time of war, or a special kind of stupid? Either way, Iraq and alcohol were just the icing and sprinkles on that cake that was my life. My childhood of abuse and abandonment was the cake itself. 

So what do you do? How do you “fix” it? 

You forgive and you forget and you love. In my case I had to start with my mother on Easter Sunday, I wrote her a polite beautiful letter, no passive aggression, no questions as to why. I thanked her, I wouldn’t be where I am today had this not happened to me. I told her I loved her, wished her no I’ll will, and hoped she had peace. 

We can’t change the past, we can not change others, sometimes we can’t changes the situation that may or may not be from the cause of our own actions. How ever we can change ourselves, and I’ll say that’s been my uphill battle all along. 

I never forgave myself, I never loved myself. 

So what do you do next. Well I wrote 18 year old me a letter and said the same. 

Keep in mind when you dig down deep in that heart of yours and truly forgive someone, this means you forgive them. You’re done bringing up the story and situation. You find love in your heart and you drive forward. 

I feel as if a 10 ton ruck sack has been lifted from my back. After doing this. I’ve let go of all control, people around you might hurt you, that was never their intentions. So let people in your life, and love them.

Most of all love yourself

This isn’t the last chapter of my journey. Here shortly I’ll be given clinical psilocybin, MDMA, and DMT in one weekend. 

If you’ve read this far please feel free to ask me anything. I hope if you’re hurting you know you’re not alone, and I’m sure my actions might even work without drugs."
1,I think I am arriving to the point of finding acceptance in suicide. Like this is all just to much and I'm not sure if it'll get better. If I will get better. My emotions and depression are just way to much. But I think I am ready to let go. Which scares me although I think it will be okay.
1,It always seems to bring up a lot of my charged feelings. Even more so now that I no longer consider myself ~Christian~. Anyone else?
1,"Like, I've been biding my time all these years, believing deep down that a magical ""someday"" would come...... fantasizing about ""someday"" when I had freedom, when I was safe, when I was stable and surrounded by loved ones and had prospects and goals and a Life. And that when that someday came I would finally be free of my PTSD, too, it would simply end. Because what was there to be afraid of any longer?

That someday is here. And my trauma hangs over me like a spectre, just as much as ever. Hahaha...... it feels like, now what? I fought and worked and clawed my way to this place, and now I can finally Live, the future is finally in front of me....... and I'm absolutely haunted. So now what?

In the past, the thought of carrying this horror and pain Forever, the knowledge thatPTSD was something that stayed with you forever, gave me so much despair that I wanted to die. But somewhere along the way, I found a little hope, in that fantasy that someday once I was free to move towards the future and build a life, that I would also be healed of that pain and trauma. What now? I'm really going to be like this for the rest of my life.....? ....."
1,Hey everyone. I just joined because my husband of 10 years has PTSD. Things have been a roller coaster for the last 3 years since he got near deathly ill. I'm trying to piece together our lives and need some support and possibly another viewpoint.
1,"Had a seizure while driving and totaled my car, don’t remember much but the last couple nights of rest I’ve had intense memories of me during the accident. Am I having ptsd?"
1,"Long story short, my husband’s psychiatrist wouldn’t prescribe him a medication he’s been on in the past (in another state) and told him to “talk to his therapist, do some breathing exercises, and go for a walk”. There was an event this weekend that triggered an episode for him and he’s been a wreck since. That’s was their response to it. If that shit worked, psychiatrists wouldn’t have a job anymore. What the hell do we even do at this point. 

Anyone else being failed by the system?"
1,"I’ve only really done a little bit of research but I need some advice on where to go or what to do. Or even just to know if someone else has gone through something similar and has some pointers. 

My attack last week
I was stilling with my wife scrolling through Netflix and she wanted to watch an animated short story. We read the synopsis and can tell it will be a sad film. I was slightly joking and said I’ll go grab the tissues cause my wife easy cry’s over things. I on the other hand haven’t really cried in just about 10 years at the most I’ve gotten a little watery in the eye but have not shed a tear in 10 years. It’s kinda strange but I just felt like what I’ve gone through in the past wasn’t nearly as bad as what I’m experiencing now and so I never really got sad enough to cry. So sometimes my wife would try and watch sad movies to see if I would shed a tear. Well about half way through I let myself get wrapped up in the feelings too much and couldn’t stop thinking about what happed 10years ago it just flooded my mind and I couldn’t stop crying my body broke out sweating like crazy. All of the pain I thought I wouldn’t have ever have to feel again just came back like I was there again 10 years ago. 

What happed 10 years ago and what happened 20ish years ago. 
So 10 years ago coming up on the exact date my stepdad killed himself in our back yard with a shotgun. The rest of the family wasn’t home at the time and when we got back we were wondering where he was. I thought he had gone for a walk to clear his mind cause he was dealing with a lot of issues that were happening all at once. I walked out back and saw a blanket behind our woodshed. I just saw the edge of it but I assumed maybe he was working on something back there and I just let him be cause if he was back there he probably wanted to be alone. I went back in the house told my mom that he was out back and probably just wanting to be alone. An hour went by and I just had the worst feeling of dread that something was wrong but I kept brushing it off. My dread was confirmed when my mom ended up walking out back and finding him there. I remember her screaming and everyone rushing outside. She covered him up with the blanked he had laid out she didn’t want us to see and I’m glad I didn’t. 

20 years ago
This pails in comparison to the pain I felt when my stepdad died. But when I was about 6 or 7 my parents got divorced. It was for the better because most of my  memories from when they were together were just of them fighting and yelling. My dad abused my mom from time to time and to this day I have never seen him sober. He kind of a functioning alcoholic so you really can’t tell when he’s drunk. The only way of knowing is counting the number of beer bottles he’s had that day. I used to think that my parents divorce never really effected me but looking back I know it did. I grew up without a role model I was alway angry and people often didn’t listen or pay attention to me. So when my stepdad came along it really changed things. He was a better father to me than my real father and I really looked up to him. That’s why it hurt so badly to lose him and i lost the one person I looked up to. Years later I found myself secretly striving for the approval of others and I think it became I didn’t have anyone to look up to and I wanted someone to be proud of me. 

My life today 
I didn’t think anything in my past had too much of a negative affect on who I am today. But I’ve recently been having some small amounts of anxiety and have also developed a hiatal hernia. Doctor told me it was rare for someone my age to get one. Most people get them from obesity or having extreme anxiety. I don’t feel like I have extreme anxiety but I did have one panic attack last year. And now I had this PTSD attack I really don’t know if all of this is related or not thought. 

TLDR 
This started out as me just wanting to get some advice on what to do but I ended up telling my story and kind of venting. I’m truly sorry if this trigger anyone I kinda was getting a little watery eyed writing this."
1,"Hi friends,

I have PTSD from when I was a kid, from long-term stuff that happened with people my own age. I'm in my 30s now and I've realised how hard it is for me to form and maintain friendships due to lack of trust. Whenever someone reaches out to me, I feel like they're bothering me and I get angry and judgemental. I don't have this problem with romantic relationships, strangely (maybe because I never had those when I was having problems).

I've been going to therapy for the better half of a decade and it's helped a lot. I'm just wondering if there are any books or resources anyone knows about this topic that might help me. I lost a few close friendships over the past few years and I'm sure my behaviour towards them was a major contributing factor.

Thanks so much for your advice."
1,"They tried to prevent me from making it out by locking me in a room to keep me out of school, torturing me and leaving me to die, destroying my homework and burning my books. They believed that without an education, I would have nowhere to go and be their human punching bag forever. My only memories of school are my books burning. 

Now I'm in a fantastic relationship with a wonderful, loving man of 5 years who recently proposed, attending a first rate university. I'm at the top of my class and year away from graduate school. I'm experiencing everything I've ever wanted after living in fear for so long that everything was all out of reach. Despite a hundred thousand obstacles at every single step of the way, I've made a fuck ton of money. More money than they've made over the course of their lifetimes combined. I just booked a nice vacation at a gorgeous seaside villa to celebrate getting vaccinated. Which, of course, they don't believe in. I have the freedom to do whatever I want and go to wherever I want. I have a new family now and they aren't part of it. I adore my friends and would do anything for them, and they would do the same for me.

They're stuck in miserable dead-end minimum wage jobs at 60 yrs old with no savings, no education, no retirement fund, no employable skills, no job history, no friends or family. Both their healths are in the gutter and their bodies are rapidly deteriorating because they don't believe in science or nutrition or medicine. Meanwhile, I'm in the best shape of my life. I play beach volleyball, run half-marathons, do competitive fencing, and lift weights. Their lungs look like swiss cheese, but their denial was so strong they continued going out in public, knowingly endangering other peoples lives even after their COVID diagnosis. Their cars are falling apart and mechanics are bleeding them dry because they don't have the know-how to do routine maintenance themselves. They enjoy their own ignorance so they can use it to blame everyone but themselves.

Fuck yeah, I *am* vindictive. Sometimes I feel like my sole purpose in life is to become so successful that they hate how miserable their own lives are. I hate them and want them to suffer the same fear and humiliation that I did. They're going to die as alone and unloved as they made me feel for two decades. Nothing would make me happier than if they died surrounded by nothing and no one.

Anti-science anti-education people make me fucking sick. End rant."
1,"Hi guys I just joined this subreddit because I’m not sure if I have ptsd or some form of c-ptsd but I just know I’m scared and anxious all the time. Honestly after doing research I finally feel like this is my illness. I’ve been previously diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, but I think my trauma lead to my depression. Although I haven’t been through much I was bullied severely as a kid and my parents were constantly fighting and violent, now I have frequent nightmares and I’m extremely scared of any form of sexual intimacy. How do I stop living I fear? I have a therapist but I don’t know if I should change one that is a trauma specialist? I’m new to all of this so any advice would help . I just want to know that I can get over this because I’ve been through so much and I’m just tired"
1,"I’m starting emdr today, I'm very nervous but hoping for the best. Thank you guys for being such a supportive group❤️"
1,"Hello all, After being in crisis and the intervention of my local CMHT, I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. I have since been engaging with my local CMHT and psychiatrist through a trial and error in regards to medication that aided in managing various symptoms I was having. 
One symptoms I was really struggling with was a lack of decent sleep. Sometimes it was a combination of being unable to settle to sleep, other times staying asleep due to nightmares and at times a combination of both. Due to restrictions and concerns in regards to sleeping medication in the UK, I was on a short term course, which I used as and when I felt I needed them, these ended a longtime ago. During my last appointment with a psychiatrist I spoke about anxiety like attacks/symptoms I have recently began experiencing at night when beginning a sleep regime (tight chest, difficulty breathing, sweating, uncomfortably warm) and that I was still having nightmares and often waking, choking, gasping for air and in a panic. I often managed to ground myself and 'ride it out' before trying to go back to sleep.
Recently these have began happening more frequently, however, it is no longer occurring when asleep or have been for a little while, but as I am drifting off to sleep, the in between stage if this makes sense. I have feeling that I am unable to breathe, cannot breath as if my throat is blocked and when I try to wake, I struggle. I feel as if I wake, but I am still somehow dreaming, but now I'm  in my bedroom, in my bed still unable to breathe. I then panic, fantastically trying to sit up, which is when all of a sudden I experience a pulling back to reality and actually wake in a panic, gasping, heart  pounding etc.
I was wondering if anyone else has or does experience this? If so how do you cope, strategies you have in place? Due to UK lockdown I have to see what appointment I can get to speak with someone as it seems to be happening more frequently, since initially calming down so any tips would be appreciated.
Sorry for the long winded post and hope it makes some sense."
1,I'm fine until I get a partner then I regress and I start to act unhealthy and show more signs that I wasn't ready. I keep thinking I'm healthy then once I date I am awful about it. Help.
1,"Hey ya'll! This question is prompting my first post. I've learned a lot from reading this sub and I'm excited to be a part of this community. 

I F(24) have C-PTSD. I'm a survivor of several different types of abuse as well as several high trauma situations.  I have been in therapy almost constantly since early highschool and I've overcome a lot. I'm decent at symptom management at this point and to be honest I live a relatively joy filled normal life. The final frontier for me in overcoming my trauma is romantic relationships. 

My first relationship in high school was super toxic and ended with him stalking me. Since then I've worked to  overcome my tendency to sabotage relationships before they start and my habit of putting up walls of being very emotionally hardened and uninterested.

However, I've noticed a pattern in my relationships that I'm not quite sure what to do with. I want to know of anyone else has experienced something similar. 

Generally when I meet someone and we start going on dates it's fun and exciting and lighthearted. The first couple weeks are just enjoying learning about someone and having fun together. I'm a very enthusiastic and fun type of person and it's easy for me to drag people along in my excitement. Generally I'll really be into someone at this stage and be excited for the prospect of a relationship. 

Then around a month to two months in the other person will express their affection/ liking / desire for commitment. Then my heart goes stone cold and I lose all emotion. Generally around this stage I'll find myself wondering if I even liked the other person to begin with. I'll pull them apart in my mind and find every single thing about them that isn't perfect. I make a mental running list of reasons we wouldn't work. All the while mentally and emotionally distancing myself from them. Then by month three they've become an enemy and a threat in my mind and I break up with them. This has been the pattern in every relationship. 

The weird part is.... It seems so real? Like It doesn't feel like I'm intentionally sabotaging. I genuinely lose all feeling for people as soon as they express interest in me. I'm about a month and a half into a dating relationship and I've been so enjoying getting to know this guy. But last week he asked to make it official and I've spent the last week feeling totally dead toward him. No positivity, regard, liking left. All I can think about is the few inconsequential things I've noticed aren't awesome about him and playing out an eventual breakup. 

I don't want to ruin a potentially good thing. But I don't know how to move past how emotionally stone cold my heart always becomes at the first sign of commitment. I'd love to learn from other people's experiences! I hope this was all clear and relevant."
1,"Some years ago I suffered a near-death experience in a local hospital, namely being fed solid food after being injected with morphene. I promptly choked, blacked out, had to be revived. That was probably a trigger event in my diagnosed PTSD.

Now my wife needs to go to the same hospital for a heart procedure. Friday I took her there for a pre-op test, and as we walked down a hallway all the old memories/fears came flooding back.

Now she goes in for the procedure Wed. I feel I should really take her and be there for her support, but just don't think it's wise. Should I feel like a heel in arranging someone else to take her, or is my own protection more important?"
1,"I’m 25. I’ve been having nightmares here and there of the guy who had stalked me, harassed me at work(he was a customer), and threatened my family and I. I was on high alert for 2 years, staying hyper aware of my surroundings when I left work to go home, and when I would go to any store. He was a complete stranger who became obsessed with me and told me repeatedly I’ll leave my boyfriend for him. That event took place 2018-2020, it stopped when he was finally arrested and jailed, and I have a 2 year injunction put on him now. I quit that job because it was triggering working there where employers made me feel stupid for calling police on the stalker guy. But it’s not a worry for me anymore and I don’t think about it daily. I have no triggers that triggers these nightmares I randomly have here and there. I had a great weekend so I don’t know why I had another nightmare last night.

The nightmares usually consist of him breaking in my house & trying to grab me, or he’s outside trying to get in the house. He never looks away from me and stares intensely just enjoying my fear, even though I usually push him out or my boyfriend beats him up in my dream. In real life, he never broke in my house or tried to grab me, it’s an irrational fear that manifests in my nightmares.

Besides the nightmares, the only other ptsd symptom I can think of is startle responses. If someone is at the door or I hear the door handle jiggle, I get really scared and my heart starts beating fast. I usually don’t answer the door if I’m not expecting any company. I always make sure doors are locked.

Is it possible to get over this ptsd? My family thinks I’m overreacting so I’m thankful for finding this sub."
1,"Between CPTSD and Overtraining syndrome I’m 3 years of not healing. Considering SSRI. 

Symptoms:

1. Insomnia - fall asleep can’t stay asleep but feel sick or nauseous/dizzy not well rested 
2. Tinnitus 
3. Fatigue - incapable of working out without sympathetic system going on fire
4. Despair/Hopeless/Anxiety
5. GI - constipation or urge to go to the bathroom when driving or leaving home and causing anxiety 

Worries about SSRI:

1. Loss of erections
2. Worsened insomnia
3. Brain zaps 
4. Withdrawal 

My goal is 6-12 month of treatment since this was from acute trauma and overtraining. 

Prozac, Trintellix, Lexapro?"
1,"I have  been sober for 3 years, 3 months and 25 days. I started drinking daily in 2003 when I was 37 years old. I drank 4 - 8 beers a day (and would drink more on weekends my husband and I would go out to the bars.) When my liver started acting up and more importantly, when my behavior started to get really bad (I have pretty bad CPTSD/PTSD/anxiety, bipolar and seizures) and I was arrested (I was charged with resisting arrest - no other charge), I got help for my ""alcoholism"" and have been sober ever since.

I went to rehab and then to an IOP program for trauma at a behavioral health hospital for about 6 weeks. I have been seeing a therapist, psychiatrist and regularly go to see all the specialists I am supposed to.

Lately, I have been getting REALLY frustrated because the medications I am given for the seizures/bipolar have horrible side effects (like constant, crippling stomach pains, hair loss, weight gain, insomnia, etc) that can greatly affect my health. The new Ambilify I was given, can CAUSE diabetes.....and I already have high blood sugars WITHOUT the drug. The Depakoate can cause LIVER disease....well, I already have that in the form of a fatty liver (my ammonia levels were so high around the time I was arrested that I was acting psychotic). I have terrible GERD symptoms and have IBS (""slow transit C"") and these medications make the pain worse. With topiramate, I lost 40% of my hair! I had to stop the Ambilify because of the CRIPPLING nausea and stomach pain....and why the heck would a prescriber give me a drug that CAUSES restless legs when I already have that (and am restless in general)?

I started to think: why is everybody telling me that staying off alcohol is so much more healthy and ""better"" for me when the medications I have to take to medicate my ""conditions"" actually make me more ill than the alcohol did?  I self medicated with the alcohol and while I know my behavior was not great and I was slowly killing myself (and all of my interpersonal relationships) - I am STILL doing this, only not through alcohol anymore, but through the side effects of the medications (and my mental illness that doesn't seem to get much better with medications - only the seizures stop with medication).

Now, I do not long for the days of sloppy, not even for the ""good days"" of drinking.....but yet, alcohol seems to me still - to be the best medication I have ever used to stop the ""symptoms"". I even was more social (yeah, I know about lower inhibitions, impulse control). My alcoholic mother and I talked about it. SHe is 72 and I am 54 years old....so we are not so young and have had a few years to learn certain things.

I don't know what I am really trying to say here, but it has been bothering me; all of these side effects and how some of these strong anti-psychotic (and convulsant) medications can actually CAUSE medical problems like liver failure......just like alcohol......and yet I am told taking the medications is GOOD and drinking alcohol is BAD - yet I scream at my husband while on the oxcarbezine more than when I did when I had that once in a while black out rage......

and anyway, isn't Depakote supposed to HELP constant hiccupping and not CAUSE it? ;)

Thanks for letting me vent, I guess."
1,"Am I only one in the world who has got a PTSD from too rapid SSRI withdrawal and subsequent psychiatric treatment? I withdrew from Paxil (generic) 40 mg in two months, after 20 years of use, as instructed by my GP. I was (and still am) experiencing 
protracted withdrawal and was having panic thoughts, anxiety and  irritability. I started acting impulsively and almost lost my self-control, which ended me hospitalized. I also had some kind of serious allergic reaction from surface disinfectant but nobody believes me. Everything that happened was diagnosed as a relapse.
And of course, Paxil (generic) was rapidly reinstated in addition to antipsychotic. I've been having many functional symptoms to this day of which many have already been improved.

My blood panels, ECG and head MRI came all back normal.
My biggest issue currently are total loss of emotions, anhedonia, apathy, anxiety attacks and brain fog. Propranolol is of great help for my anxiety. I'm currently having a job but don't have any interest nor excitement towards it anymore.

I'm not sure if I have a PTSD or perhaps some kind of a brain injury.
All GPs have classified me as ""depressed"". Does anyone have any ideas how could I possibly improve my situation? Thank you for all answers."
1,"I need to explain myself somewhere , mabey here someone will understand. Hamid.
I met a doctor today to undergo a simple but painful procedure.I have done it before in the past  I know why I am afraid. The necessity of it helped my overcome the fear. Before my appointment I saw the doctor  I  was appointed to be kind  to an elderly patient. I appreciated it and when we met shared this. 
In short I explained I have post trauma, non-related to the  small procedure (as if something is really non related). I asked to be in control, he understood and respond attentively. 
He was professional but not cold hearted like I am used too from doctors and caretakers. 
He then asked my age, when I said 47, he looked up brightly and complimented, really you look alot younger. 
Thats when I broke down and burst into tears infront of this man. Apologizing multiple times of course. I was disappointed I couldn't hold myself together.

The split
....
So half an hr later this is what I analyzed.
I have developmental trauma through neglect during infancy. 
As a baby I call out for help and it didn't come. 
The Doctor's regoconition and adressing  my request for help, obviously overwhelmed me, I somehow could not believe the reality of the present because of my traumatic disbelief.
For me, When he mentioned my age, he saw the man in front of him, yet I was alsothere as a year old lnfant.
To me this makes sense. 
Does it to you?

1,"This has been happening on and off since last fall now. But most times after eating, my heart rate shoots up to 120 and I have to take deep breathes in front of a fan and drink water to slow it down. It usually 30 minutes to an hour. Is this because of my PTSD? Or am I doing something wrong? I developed stress induced palpitations for the first time last summer but they mysteriously went away after a few months but now a days, they only show up after meals."
1,"I'm just so frustrated it feels like I'm losing my mind over things that are supposed to be fun.

I suffered a bit if trauma in highschool in a very bad relationship, and it's left dating and sexual activities scarred and I just can't seem to move past it. It's been over 6 years since I got out of the abusive relationship and I just a year or so ago started dating this really really wonderful man.

Ive been in therapy almost 5 years trying to work through my trauma but it still just hits me out of nowhere. Sometimes the triggers don't even make sense . I was having a fun conversation with my love (video call cause ling distance etc) and he asked me to flash him, I was hesitant but thought why not. And immediately I felt strange, which turned into what I think was a disociative episode. It's like my brain just stops working and I'm swallowed by paralyzing fear.

It feels like I ruin everything with my panic. This sort of thing happens so often when trying anything new. Things that should be fun just aren't. I don't know what to do. I just want to live a normal life. Has anyone else felt anything similar? I feel like I'm going crazy..."

Is a past trauma like being raped has something to do with suffering from dysphoria? My female friend was raped around 3 years ago and a year after he started to feel more comfortable being addressed as ""him""


Fyi he didnt admit he was raped and i find out by myself"
1,"Last night, I experienced a traumatic experience. I have come to realize that the details aren't particularly important - I think it suffices to say that my central nervous system was kicked into a very agitated state with every possible ""fight or flight"" response activated. Actual physical harm was possible in the situation and I had real reasons to fear for my safety, though I am not 100% blameless or even close, I could have been assaulted viciously. I had intrusive thoughts about what happened last night, could not unwind easily and generally felt miserable, in a state of hypervigilance.

This morning, I woke up feeling much better but I found myself feeling extremely angry and irritable later on. I found it hard to concentrate on things I needed to do, had intrusive thoughts, was jumpy, felt anxiety etc. I've dealt with panic disorder in the past (thankfully muted to the point of being a low-lying thing now - haven't had a panic attack in a year or so!) - this is very, very different. I feel like I am exhausted while also being on extreme overdrive.

Since it has only been one day, I know that I am not experiencing PTSD - these problems would have to persist for a while for that to be the case. However, I want to do whatever I can to sort out what I am feeling now so it doesn't happen - does anyone have any tips or advice or tricks or insights? I'd appreciate anything you have to offer.

1,"Hey y’all!
I’m at the point where I have nightmares at least once or twice a week. It usually begins with me reliving my trauma (r**e) and then the majority of the dream is me feeling super depressed because I feel like I can’t talk to anyone. When I wake up I’m still depressed and feel gross from the dream. 
I’m kind of unsure what to do because I don’t want to go to sleep because I don’t want to experience the feeling of reliving my trauma. I basically stay up watching Netflix until I can’t hold my eyes open anymore. 
Any advice or tips would be welcome. 
Thanks!"
1,"Trigger warning ⛔


This will be long so if you can please answer to my question I'll be thankful. I really need some answers. 

I was subjected to female genital mutilation (my clitoris was partly removed) when i was 10 years old (I'm 26 now), in my country most girls go through this horrible experience.
I don't want to be diagnosed with PTSD because i don't want this to be the reason of my suffering with depression. 
i remember the day in details.
I don't usually think about it but when i do, i feel the hate burning in my chest, what in hell could possibly drive educated parents to commit such an awful thing on their child?  And why did they chose to wait until I was 10?  Why didn't they just cut off my flesh when I was an infant and got over with it? 
my body, my privacy and my dignity all have been violated.. And the worst is that i have to remember, for the rest of my life, every detail of that fucking day and the days followed. It was like ""chopping off part of my genital"" wasn't enough no, they forced me to let go of all my needs of privacy untill the wound finally healed. I was left with nothing but feelings of humiliation and embarrassment. 
Whenever i think of that exact moment.. The cutting, the bleeding, the stitching.. I feel discomfort through my private parts, my muscles contract and my whole body shrinks.

My parents are educated they have no excuse, whither they purposely intended to limit my sexual desires and thus ensuring that their dearest reputation will not get tarnished, or they just didn't question the norms.. it makes no difference.. what matters is that they wanted to be socially accepted. they chose to submit to customs. They chose themselves over my health, over ME. and i hate them for it. 

The thing is, i don't believe this interferes with my day to day life, (I've had too few sexual experiences to know if it's affected), i don't think about the event much, i don't have nightmares.. and i don't have problems with remembering important aspects of that day. 
The only reflection it has on my life is that I've some sort of hate towards my parents. 
I've been struggling with depression for i don't know how long, recently diagnosed with bipolar II. But i believe this has nothing to do with what i experienced. 
My therapist asked me whither i went through any traumatic event,  i cried while telling her the story, i haven't talked about it to anyone before. We're to have further talk about it next session. 

Is any of this sounds familiar? Could someone go through a trauma and not develop PTSD? 
I don't experience panic attacks, nor uncontrollable flashbacks. Is the absence of these two symptoms means i don't have PTSD?"
1,"Has anyone been triggered by no apparent reason?

I have been battling with PTSD ever since I was around 13 years old. I'm now 19. My worst year was probably 2019, but since then my symptoms have decreased. I know I could be even better if I went to therapy (The last time I went to see a professional I was 16) but I have been able to manage this thing fairly well. Then suddenly, a month ago, I had a paranoia episode. I was supposed to go out with my friends, but all I could think of was that I was going to die at any second. I was shaking, barely walking, looking for potential threats that didn't exist. Walking the street I saw a police officer and even though we were not doing anything wrong, I was sure the police officer was going to kill me. I can't even express how sure I was that this was going to happen. Hours later, as we were having diner, I wrote a long, goodbye text message to my mom and my dad but luckily didn't send it. I couldn't enjoy the night. I felt miserable. Once I got to my home, alive, I couldn't believe it. A voice inside my head even tried to convince I was actually dead and just wandering around. I know how ridiculous this sounds, but there's no way to express how I felt. Almost like a soldier walking through a mined field, so certain of my imminent death. 

The thing is, nothing triggered me. At least, nothing I can remember. I was totally fine until I wasn't. When episodes like this happened to me in the past, there was always a trigger, a perturbing image or another crappy experience. But that day, there was nothing. And the next morning, I was totally fine. Before, my crazy, I-am-going-to-die episodes lasted weeks.

I'm worried about what this may represent. Although my night was ruined, I'm more worried this could happen when crossing the street (In the past, my paranoia almost caused me to run into moving traffic) or when having an important meeting. Perhaps even during an exam. I don't know if I should contact a therapist again, as I'm actually better than before. I don't know if I should seek help because a single, isolated episode. Anyone has had experiences like this? What do you advise?"
1,"I get nightmares about my trauma once a month, like when I wake up I KNOW it was about what happened. I get nightmares where I feel helpless, scared, frozen more frequently but idk if it's related to my trauma. But the nightmares where I KNOW it was about my trauma or seeing my abuser I get once a month without any triggers.

If I get badly triggered, I usually have nightmares for a few days back to back and then it goes back to being once a month. It this normal??? Could it just be anxiety and not PTSD??? Cause I've read that people with PTSD have a few nightmares every week. I don't know if it counts for me because it's only once a month without any triggers."
1,"I just got out of a 6 week relationship, not long I know, but regardless I fell hard for this girl. We had been talking for a few months before getting together. She had C-PTSD, and I accidentally triggered her multiple times. It was never my intention. The last time was the last straw, and she blocked me completely. 

Whenever she would let me know of a trigger, I wrote it down and did my absolute best not to do it again. She had told me that feeling like she was in trouble was one of them.

The incident that led to her blocking me was because I asked her a question, but I phrased it wrong and she felt like I was accusing her. I can give more details if needed. 

I don't really know what exact advice I'm looking for here. I just want to know if I was in the wrong, and if I was being toxic, and I figure the best people to ask are those who have PTSD themselves. The guilt is killing me and I don't know how to move on."
1,"Hey people.
First of all, I was never diagnosed with PTSD mostly because I thought my flashbacks were due to my anxiety and they're normal. Now I understand it might have been the other way around.
Anyways, I've come a long way in the past 8 years or so and now I am at a really good place mentally. House, dream job, family, time, money. Everything is there and I worked so hard for it all.
However it seems like the flashbacks have persisted, instead they are mostly beautiful memories, like the first day in daycare (ok that one was a tiny bit bad as well), tons of memories of me playing with my friends including the songs we used to sing etc.
I am used to terrible flashbacks and I've developed a mechanism to get out of them relatively effectively but in this case I obviously don't have to.
Anyone had any similar experiences? Does it mean I'm finally losing my marbles completely? Am I getting better? None of the above?
I'm confused. Thnx."
1,About a week ago I suffered a severe mental breakdown after i had been released from the mental hospital. It was so severe I ended crying screaming and literally thought I was going to end my life right there. My parents weren’t very helpful either as my mom and stepdad were part of the cause of this mental breakdown. I’ve been having flashbacks from that day and My anxiety and paranoia have been through the roof lately. I’ve become extremely distant from my parents and have developed a sense of numbness and dissociation. That event has been haunting me ever since and anytime i remember it i go into complete panic mode
1,"Hello, I will keep my story very short. Basically in the past 3 or 4 years I have had 2 nervous breakdowns. Before I had them, I wasnt taking care of myself and was extremely lonely. I am aware that is my trigger. However, the straw on the camels back was migraines I had where I couldnt see - normal that I get those every few months but for some reason, when they happen when I'm already anxious, they absolutely send me over the edge, I start shaking, feeling cold, crying, thinking I'm about to die. I now have what I beleive are flashbacks, overthinking, hypervigilance, over focus on what has happened with me. I am recovering but have days like this where I feel so worried. Has anyone overcome their issue around PTSD, and have any recommended therapists or approaches or modalities? 

Please any advice someone, thank you."
1,"My wife was diagnosed with PTSD after she watched her mother attempt suicide as well as some other childhood issues and she's been having a really hard time with accepting the diagnosis. But now it seems like everything that ever happened to her was a trauma. Such as that she never got to go to Disneyland even after her dad promised her they would go or that her friends never asked her to go to the skating rink. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I'm trying to be supportive, but I'm not sure if I should point out that those are normal life events and yes they're sad, but not major issues. I'm not sure what to do or how I should try to help her navigate her diagnosis and make sense of her life."
1,"Please let me know if this doesn't belong in this sub! This is my brain dump and questions I ask myself, mostly a vent post, maybe someone can relate to this train of thought?

Something happened when I was 12 that was fairly traumatizing and caused me distress for years after. I didn’t start acknowledging it as traumatic until I started seeing my current therapist. I recently looked at the DSM-V symptom list for PTSD and found that based on what I remember from ages 12-14 ish, I fit all of the symptoms and then some.

I continued to have all of the symptoms for a few years (2-3 after it happened), but they’ve slowly gone away. It's been much better since the parent that acted as a trigger for me has moved out and we've stopped talking.

10 years later and I still have the symptoms that overlap with GAD and MDD (which I’ve been diagnosed with). My therapist has been urging me to see it as a result of what I went through, which has been difficult. For the first time in my life, I’m seeing the avoidance I have always struggled with as part of the coping mechanisms I developed then, when my only tool was to avoid so as to not acknowledge my own powerlessness. I’m still too afraid to move, I have an overblown avoidance response to everything new, I can’t cope with the constant feelings of failure and stress… I look at myself then I look at my friends who have been through just as much and more and wonder why I am  so paralyzed.

I used to think of myself as self aware but it feels like my brain is hiding things from me. I can't remember a lot of what my early teenage years were like. I don't even remember who I was - me at 12 feels like a stranger.

I never got formally diagnosed of course so I don't know if I really had PTSD then, but I'm just thinking about how deep the scars of trauma run. It's black and white thinking but I weirdly thought I had healed and I sometimes wonder how it’s possible that this thing that happened might be continuing to derail my life, even though I never think about it, and would've never noticed it without someone else pointing it out. Or rather, I would never have realized there was an option to not be this way."
1,"Dissociation has been killing me. I feel indifferent and forgotten. Brushing teeth or showering for me equals to climbing a mountain. How can I get better? Medications, stimulants, drugs? I never did any, but I need help badly.

1,"And now I just want to die even more. She could have just sat down with me and talked but instead she got angry and threatened to call emergency if I didn’t stop being emotional. 

It’s 1:30am and I’ve taken valium because I can’t sleep but still all I can think of is the image of this massive hulk of a policeman standing in my bedroom doorway decked out like he’s ready to beat me up.

I already had ptsd. I feel like this is going to make it worse. I feel so humiliated."
1,"Back in November, a stupid small word triggered my current downward spiral. I caught myself early, got myself to a doctor, and got myself on the waiting list for therapy.  Something I never did in the past. I would allow myself to just fall deeper and deeper. I had managed to cope for so long, but that stupid thing in November toppled me. I was at an appointment at my daughters' school with a support staff member, and he was helping me with what sort of things to include in the personal statement. 

He made a small comment saying that he knows I have past trauma and maybe I could include that. Honestly innocent enough, but it was the spark. I had never ever told anyone, so how could he know? Who told him, how did he find out? My head was racing my heart was thumping, and I couldn't stop the panic and fear rising in me.

If I exclude the beatings my sister gave me on a daily basis, it is nearly 15 years since it happened. Looking back, I cannot believe how stupid and naive I was. I was going away for a few days. I had a large bag with several changes of clothes. I was wearing a brown knee-length skirt and a pale cream/light brown blouse. I was 17. I was struggling with my bag, and took a break, and sat down outside shops in the middle of town. Two guys came by and made a comment. I didn't think they were talking to me. I got up to leave and they offered to help, they took my bag and started walking. I followed and was talking. went through an unused bus station. one of them hit me so hard I fell. I didn't even fight back. Which made them angry. So they tried to strangle me with my bag.

I left home a few months later. My mum didn't notice I was struggling. My sister was beating me, my mum didn't care. I eventually got in a relationship with someone. Moved in with him. He was so nice at first, so kind and caring. but it changed. He would start with name-calling that he'd excuse away with him just being silly, and I was overreacting. Then controlling who I could see, who I could talk to. Then he got physical. Always saying he loved me and was sorry later, and that he didn't mean to. He was drunk or stressed or angry.

During that relationship I was having nightmares nearly daily, I eventually learned to hold them in, to not react from them when waking because if I woke him he would hurt me for it, or force me to have sex with him. 3 years I was with him before I attempted suicide. I ended up moving back to my parents' home. I kept having nightmares. but they slowly reduced. I would keep seeing things in my head. Seeing them, feeling them, hearing them. 

Years later, I had my daughter through a difficult birth.  2 years after that her father and I split. I ended up suicidal again, but not in a physical way. I couldn't deal with the memories, I just wanted to erase them. I was in that way for a few years. By the time my daughter was 4, CMHT and CRHT (Crisis response home treatment team)were involved. A psychologist said during a visit that he believed I was showing symptoms of PTSD. He told me that I had to tell him what happened in order for him to diagnose me. He was rude, showed no compassion, no kindness. he was a harsh rude man, and I did not feel comfortable talking to him. He did not believe me when I said my daughter was my staying power and said I had to promise him I would call the crisis line, or he would hospitalise me and get my daughter taken from me. 

After about a month and a half of a shit cmht. I was forgotten and slipped through their cracks. I worked on myself and slowly got better. I did so well (had a dip in 2017 with depression and anxiety) but I did pull myself out... Until he said trauma. I am spiraling down all because I was scared of how he could know. I never told anyone. I had written to a friend once who said I was lying, I was too ugly how could anyone even want to go near me. But I had never said it out loud. 

15 years on and they were still controlling me with fear, still suffocating me. All because I never told anyone. I finally told someone. I finally said it out loud. There was no relief from it. It didn't ease the pain. But I am hoping that in the future it won't cause such a crash because now I've said it, it's out there, it cannot be taken back, it cannot be erased. But it can be worked through."
1,"I hope this doesn't count as soliciting medical advice. I'm aware it might straddle the edge on that.

My therapist recommended I might want to look into an IOP for a few reasons (psychiatrist availability and therapy more than once a week). I have an intake appointment on Monday, and it was mentioned by the admissions staff that the intake appointment will likely be 2 hours! 

Does anyone have experience with these intake appointments? What are they looking for, exactly? 2 hours seems like a really long time. From what I understand it's like an interview so they can decide on a plan of care for you? I've done inpatient before a decade ago but never anything outpatient."

1,"For the 6 + months since they have been trying to pick a fight with me.

I've been trying to ignore it, but a few months ago I couldn't take it anymore. I wasn't sleeping, I was triggered 100% of the time by them yelling, stomping, calling me names every other day.

It’s honestly kind of subpar, but the man knows absolutely everything about how it’s been produced to the history of the feuding breweries, and has an entire room that is essentially a shrine to our German heritage. Fun fact: when I did my 23 and me, I’m only actually like 10% German. We’re Irish. Like stone cold Irish. 

My father also has a weird fascination with children, which is something that I chose to selectively forget until a couple of months ago. I remember a lot of things that I wish I didn’t about that now, and as a result, I have done absolutely everything in my power to rid myself of anything and everything that is tied to him. Including my last name. The man has a way of slinking into my life, trying to find ways to keep me tied to him. He had access to my bank accounts, my life insurance (which was sketch because he never told anyone he took it out on me); I look a lot like him too, especially now that my hair is short. I can’t change the way I look, but I could work my fucking ass off to finally separate myself financially. And I have. I took myself out of the family AT&T plan; I closed all my old bank accounts (which is a bitch to do by the way), I moved so he doesn’t know where I live. The only thing tying us together now is our heritage, our name. I don’t necessarily want to go through all of the trouble of legally changing my name because it’s a lot of paperwork and just work in general. New credit cards, new license, new everything. And that’s absolutely terrifying. But not nearly as terrifying as what he’s done. So what am I willing to give up? Honestly everything. Coming into treatment, I felt like I was going to the extreme by doing all of this, but the longer I’m here, the angrier I get—and it’s good anger. The kind that fuels you to be proactive rather than just sit and take it. It’s just a name, I get that. But it’s also not, and I get that too. I’ve tried to associate the other amazing people that share my name, because there definitely are some dope ones out there. But there’s something so liberating about breaking the ties that bind. 

“It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.” 

My father isn’t the only toxic person who tries to cling to me, and he won’t be the last. But the difference is that I’m no longer afraid to lose things. I want to make space for new things, for better things. So what am I willing to give up? Absolutely everything."
1,"I remember I would conjure up another personality to take some of the verbal abuse I received. When it happened, my world would get blurry, I felt very spacey, and sometimes my body lightly sways. I would imagine up a tougher, more hardened version of myself to receive trauma, and I would imagine they would be there in my body while I watched from the sidelines. I (?) would think ""I have to keep (my name) safe, this is my job, I have to do this."" They would also sometimes offer comfort to me when I was upset. But only sometimes.  
Does anyone else experience this as well?"
1,"I live in a suburban town in Wisconsin and recently had to go into Wauwatosa to get a vaccine. On my way there I got cut off and was almost side swiped and almost pushed into the median. Out of habit, I waited in my horn and the aggressive car full of people all turned around to flip me off. They proceeded to move to the other lane to let me pass them but I was uncomfortable since they had intentionally slowed down 20mph and I was afraid of what they might do. I made a quick turn to get away from them and as I was turning, I saw them do a u turn back towards me. They tried to hit the back of my car so I had no other option than to run stop signs and make quick turns to outrun them. At one point, they caught up to me and as they almost hit me, I quickly turned into a small parking lot. When I pulled in, they passed me on my left and threw their drinks at my car. When I quick backed up to get out of their, they stopped their car and two or three of them got out and started yelling at me. Now this might not sound bad to most of you but this was the first time I have ever been chased in a car where I was unaware of their intentions. In my mind, I thought I was going to be shot. Now every time I see a car that looks the same as that one that chased me or see a car start to come up behind me fast, I almost have a panic attack. I haven’t been able to sleep that well since it happened. Would this actually be PTSD?"
1,"TW CSA and abusers

I recently discovered my CSA, and am home for the first time since I realized. It happened right down the street from my parents house, and from the little I remember (thank you dissociation!) it was horrific. I feel like just being in this town gives me a trauma response. 

My uncle also moved back into town. He has always hated me because I am close with my grandmother and until I was born he was “her baby”. He managed to call me a doucebag today in front of my entire family and no one said I word. I’m supposed to just put up with it because my uncle has severe bipolar, but I’m so sick of this. He has done a lot of fucked up things, and yeah calling me a doucebag isn’t really that bad (although I had barely said a word to him at that point so idk how I could have been being a doucebag). 

My mom is a whole other can of worms, she’s also bipolar (which is fine!) but insists that the diagnosis was fake and that she just has depression. Which also is fine, it’s her life, except she isn’t getting any treatment currently so she is all over the map. I forgot how stressful it is to not know what you’re walking in to- she can turn on a dime and often shifts throughout the day. To cope she and my father just drink, which only makes everything worse. 

I’m sorry for coming on here and venting, I just wanted to see if anyone else could commiserate. I do so good with treatment when I am in my apartment, but it feels like 10 steps back when I’m home."
1,"Part of my bad PTSD habits has been watching gore. I realized a few days into it that it was becoming an addiction, and I stopped. My therapist told me it was a controlled fight or flight response but in a safe environment, and that’s why it’s addicting. Amygdala etc.

Recently I’ve noticed I’m incredibly apathetic and emotionless. I hate it. I feel psychopathic and part of that validation comes from the gore I could watch. I wonder if I could hurt someone, and it scares me when I think I could. I never had those feelings before the gore.

I know this is part of the amygdala being fucked: sometimes working too much, now not working enough. I just want to feel normal again, not trying to push the vague thought experiments if I could inflict violence on others. I have OCD like tendencies that easily consume me—I don’t want this in me.

I’m willing and want to get all the help I need. I know it’s not normal. Has anyone else gone through this?"
1,"One of the major traumas in my life was from a few years ago when three cops beat me in my underwear in my own living room and then tased me when I was on the ground. My heart was beating so fast and erratically the ambulance said I was actually missing beats and were worried but the cops didn’t care. I spent over three weeks in jail for something I didn’t do, feel free to mock me or call me a liar for that too cause a lot of people have already. I’m now stupidly a criminal justice student and with a lot of the courses especially the one I’m on now it triggers memories of everything that’s happened nonstop. I wonder just what the hell is wrong with me, why do I do this to myself. It’s bad enough I can’t go any real time at all without thinking of something that sets me off without being reminded of it."
1,"After years of yourself being threatened with someone else committing suicide, and them bringing a gun in the house to make their threats more powerful, would someone attempting to kill themselves in front of you and play dead for thirty ish minutes cause a trauma reaction?  I've spent this whole week in a trauma reaction, and i just want to know if by remembering this am i overeacting to what happened?  I was young and they had previously made me swear not to call their dad or the cops in that situation and I had never been in that situation before, (I'd been threatened thoroughly but I've never seen someone die, fake or not) I jusy thought they were dead and panicked and didn't know what to do.  I was very young and very stupid I thought I couldn't break their loyalty or it would make things worse for them.  

They were obviously fine and had been faking being dead afterwards.  But they let me sit there and bawl and panic over what happened while they pretended to be dead.  Thinking back on it, and knowing what I know now, there was no way they could've been injured especially not fatally or to make them lose consciousness.  I've done the same to myself in attempts after seeing this, it won't even put you to sleep.  So i know they were playing dead.  Would this cause a trauma response in someone?  Even years later? 

I've been having to barricade my doors at night.  This is not the only thing they've done just the latest my brain has started to remember.  I just want to know if I'm overreacting.  I really felt like I watched someone die that night and I'm sorry, I was just frozen.  I was young and I didn't know what to do after making all those promises.  I vaguely remember calling their dad but idk if that actually happened it's been so buried for so long."
1,"I grew up in a dangerous home and no one ever caught on. For as long as I can remember, I've been dissociated from my feelings. It's not that I consciously shove them away - I just don't realize they exist, and as a result I don't feel the need to talk to someone. And then I'm blindsided by breakdowns.

I didn't open up about the abuse until freshman year of high school, when I was in my first relationship and they saw my body bare. Since then I've been trying to heal slowly - I've been patient, bc I know being oblivious to my emotions is what's kept me alive through the years.

I'm 21 now, and with a partner who's very emotionally conscious - they've got a lot of hurt of their own, make art about it, and spend lots of time pondering their emotions. When I have my breakdowns though, I can tell they get frustrated at how little I understand my own feelings. I pointed it out once, and they apologized for the fact that they unfairly expect me to analyze my own feelings as much as they do with their own.

I spend a lot of time thinking, I really do. And yet when I look inwards, I'm often met with a brick wall. It makes me feel all the more stupid and shallow when I inevitably hit my next breakdown. I feel like such a fucking imbecile.

I've felt all the more frustrated with myself since that incident with my partner. I know they didn't mean any offense by it, just the implication that I think less on my feelings makes me feel like I'm a dumbass who doesn't know how to self-reflect. I can't write heart wrenching poetry, I can't make surrealist art, I can't do anything productive and meaningful because I don't know how I feel. I'm fine until I'm suddenly hiding and crying in the closet without remembering how I got there.

Never mind the catharsis of being able to express myself, I just feel like a fucking piece of shit idiot who's been going to therapy for nearly a decade yet can't even catch myself before I break down : )"

1,Has anyone tried beekeeping as a form of therapy?
1,"So I only recently in the last 2 years was diagnosed with PTSD and all my triggers are caused by my mother (whose house I’m still stuck living in but I’ll get to that later) I cannot be tapped on the shoulder because my mother used to do that before yelling at me or screaming go in my face, I cannot be touched on my upper arms or neck, and if someone touches me on my back I freak out because she used to push me down the stairs in the house (that I still live in) now onto the (TW) now this next part I’m not sure if she ever intentionally or unintentionally did these things but it happened often enough that I told my psychiatrist and now I’m telling you all, I’ve never told anyone else any of this and I’m not even sure if there’s a statute of limitations on it or not because it started when I was 15. So what would happen is I would be in the kitchen or the basement making food or doing my laundry 🧺 and she would just brush up against me my buttocks the side of my breasts my psychiatrist has told me to practice NC even though I live in the same house as her still. I’m not entirely sure if her actions with the brushing past me or up against me was ever intentional or not but I do know the financial, psychological and physical abuse were intentional as well as the denial that I have any chronic illnesses. So I guess the point of this post is since my diagnosis 2 years ago I just need reassurance that I’m not the only one feeling the way I feel on a day to day basis."
1,"Recently my therapist told me I have PTSD (which wasn't a diagnosis I expected) and at first I was kind of sad, but the more I research it the better I feel. It's like I finally have an explanation for all the  behaviors I used to constantly beat myself up over. I'm genuinely looking forward to doing more work to identify my triggers and learn to manage them. I even feel kinda compelled to tell the friends and family I'm close to so that they can better understand me. The only thing I'm sad about now is that I went so long without knowing what was going on with my head."
1,"I have Chronic PTSD from life long trauma in my childhood, a severely broken family, and adulthood trauma. 

One of the biggest issues with my condition is trust with women. 

The two major women in my life, my mother and grandmother have given me good reasons not to trust them, and by them being the main women and the toxic women I've had in my life, it screwed my trust for women... My mother was narcissist, drug addict, and a whore and my grandma was a religious narcissist control freak... 

One reminder from a woman I'm with and it triggers me and my trust for them is all screwed up...

For instance, I'm 32 the woman I'm with is 23. She is still full of energy and likes to get out and socialize, while I on the other hand do not. Her mother reminds me of my mother and has shown me things to make me believe that, so I don't trust her with her mother. I don't trust her around her friends either... These people do not like me and tell her she can do better and to leave me alone. Due to a broken family past, I'm not a family oriented person, and do not see the importance of family gathering or any of that, and my trust issues go through the roof when she does this family function bs...

I'm old school and believe my relationship should be based on old school morals, rather than this confusing and destructive moral set we see today... I believe in old school teamwork and stability, the man should provide and protect while the woman cooks and cleans... I believe the only family we need to focus on is ours and building it... Instead, she is interested in drinking, slumber parties, and get togethers with these women who not only do not like me, but also women that I do not trust and as far as I'm concerned and learned, birds of a feather flock together...

Her on the other hand, does not have a clue what that means and fights, argues, plays victim, and gives me a guilt trip when I try to get her on board with this... She says I'm controlling, but when we first met, I told her bluntly about my condition, symptoms, and where it all comes from... I figured we had that understanding and she would support me... However, just like a lot of women I tell this too, at first it was all support, but in the end I'm a monster or controlling...

Recently, my relationships go for 1-2 years before im fed up with repeating myself, my concerns, my issues, and reminding my condition is chronic and the only way to better it is from real support. I feel like I'm constantly punching myself in the face and giving myself triggering flashbacks when I do that...It's like you tell someone you have PTSD, and now they think your stupid... 


Maybe I am controlling... If I am its for the right reason as far as Im concerned...I don't ask her to do anything illegal or immoral...

This relationship has been going on 1 year and 6 months just like this, and I'm ready to call it quits and just focus on bettering myself to be better for someone else in the future...

But when I try to move on, she either uses suicide or pregnancy as a way to stay in the picture...and honestly the girl needs help and guidance and I try to give her that, but after 1 year and 6 months of trying, constantly repeating myself, and fighting over it, I'm tired of trying to help someone who can't help themselves or don't want the help...especially while I'm struggling trying to help myself to better health...

I told her she is contributing to my PTSD and thats the opposite of what I'm looking for from anybody at this point in my life..."
1,"TW: childhood sexual abuse

I know it's unhealthy to keep wishing that some things didn't happen or complain about life being unfair, but goddamn is it unfair sometimes. it's pretty useless to mourn the person you could've become without the trauma because that person simply doesn't exist. I just still feel envious sometimes of everyone who hasn't experienced sexual abuse. 

Before I was abused as a child, I was a lot more talkative and extroverted. The year after the abuse happened teachers started expressing their concerns to my parents, that I am unassertive in class, too shy, etc. What would my life be like if some horrible things never happened? I know I need to stop thinking about it. Today is just one of those days I feel angry again that I am one of the many unlucky ones who were born into a dysfunctional family. I have done some EMDR therapy and made tons of progress already, have a loving boyfriend now, but I still get setbacks. I know it's all part of the recovery process, but today I just wanted to express my grief. I feel unable to talk about this to people in my life, because they wouldn't understand. 

I wish I didn't have to get triggered during sex. It's so maddening. I feel angry that I should even have to remember horrible events of the past. If I never got abused these flashbacks wouldn't have to happen... Sometimes you think you're making progress and doing well and then those traumatic memories just punch you right back in the face :D. Oh well, I shouldn't beat myself up about it. I can't do anything else but surrender and accept my past, unfortunately."
1,"We’ve been together for a year. He does almost everything right. He is incredibly generous and loving. If I have a flashback for any reason, even during intimacy, he holds me as does whatever I need at the moment. He deals with my night terrors every night with nothing but love.

But he still yells sometimes at me when he’s mad. Raised voices are by far one of my biggest triggers. I ask him to stop, and he says he comes from a loud family and can’t help it, but will try. When he raises his voice I always start to shake and tell him not to, and he feels bad. But he still does it most of the time when we argue. I have told him many times, if you have a problem or are angry at me, you can tell me with any words. Even if they hurt my feelings. Put me in my place. But just please, please don’t yell it at me. We rarely actually argue anyway. 

I can’t logically react once I’m set off.There is one thing that will trigger a flashback in me 100% of the time and he is very careful not to do it. Raised voices are my second biggest trigger, I will start to shake and be scared 100% of the time, and it triggers a full flashback episode like 50-75% of the time. 

He says he is “trying” to stop raising his voice. I don’t get why he has to “try”, is it not possible to just like... not yell at your girlfriend with trauma? He’s never experienced trauma, but how can he look at me shaking like that and then do it again the next argument? 

I’m just lost, I don’t know what to do."
1,"I have hyper vigilance and I can only sleep alone. Lately I've had to deal with guys who get hurt feelings when I don't want to sleep over, don't invite them over my apartment or want to become a part of their life early on, and it makes them think I just want something casual. When a guy doesn't go at my pace I start to resent him and disparage him in my head and sometimes out loud, by accident. I try to explain how I feel to them in a simple way but I'm always scared of over sharing and they just brush me off. They're not really interested in hearing about some random girl's issues. 

Guys ask for Instagram and social media which I don't have and they don't know how to respond when I can't give them my profile. Sometimes a guy from online dating tries to invite me to a party when we barely even met, and I'm so suspicious of people who invite me to parties or to meet their friends. Then when one tiny argument comes up, those same people are willing to throw me out like garbage and never speak to me again. How can they have the audacity to invite me into their life and pretend like they wanted me? I wanted to be open to letting people in again but every time I try it takes too long for them and they become tired of me, I start to resent them for being all the same and I can feel their annoyance with me. It's exhausting trying to be happy around somebody all the time. No one wants to be around a miserable person but I'm not happy when I feel pressured at all. How did you find someone who respects you and your boundaries who you can feel safe around?"
1,"(Hello, I’m also looking for support about ptsd but there’s only the one flair) So long story short i was manic, and the highschool thought i had to go to the hospital to get medicated so my mother tricked me into going, once at the hospital the mental health act was pulled on me and i didn’t go peacefully, so i was tackled and held dow by two RCMP officers and one of them, a fat pig had his knee on my neck and i had to negotiate with him to move his knee from my neck to my head as i was afraid i was gonna die, when i was fighting i was yelling insults at them but with the pathetic mans knee on my neck i could barely talk and breathing was hard, so i had to start saying stuff like “don’t kill me, do you want to kill a 16 year old?” Anyways at first i thought it was the meds i’m now on that was making me more anxious and insecure, but now i’m starting to think it’s the ptsd, maybe i connote being the things i did when i was manic with the trauma from the police incident, i used to think i was unbeatable and then i got beaten, and maybe that’s why my confidence is gone, i used to explain that i was trying to build community when the strangers on my block would respond, but now i don’t feel like i could do that, i miss being manic, also i was never a danger to myself or others, i was just really really happy and confident, and i bet to edgy in my artistic expression, but now i know, god i’m insecure though."
1,"It tends to happen when I'm out in public. I have really bad anxiety linked to ptsd and I'm not great in social situations, so I tend to get overwhelmed really easily... But even so, it seems to happen out of nowhere. One minute I'll be feeling mostly fine, if tired and stressed, and a little uncomfortable in public. And the next I'm completely overwhelmed and physically can't talk, and feel so disconnected from everything. I've even had to go as far as to learn basic sign language and teach my fiance basic signs so I can still communicate with him when it happens. And it lasts well after I leave the stressful situation, sometimes hours before I can talk anywhere above even a whisper, again. I'm wondering if anyone else deals with this same thing, if you know what causes it, and if you maybe know any way of limiting it or stopping it?"
1,"Hi, I'm here for advice and to hear some thoughts experiences of other's. I hope you can help me with my story.

I try to keep it short to not bother you too long but it won't be a short read. Thank you in advance. 

So I'm living on my own for about a year and a half now. My moving out experience was not the best to this day. My first landlord had driven me into psychotic breakdown. I knew this feeling I had it multiple times during high school and even in middle school. I moved out that day. I then lived on the couch of a friend of mine for 2 months until I found a hippie commune by chance. I lived with them for a month but they hated me. I finally found my first own flat after this month.

My moving in experience was quite pleasant, I thought I would finally have my own home now and can finally rest and get some peace.

Everything was OK until Covid struck and I started to pursue my hobbys because I didn't had to work. It involved manual labour. I was constructing a electrical boat in the basement and some components in my flat.

Turns out my neighbours don't like people who do things and don't live of social welfare. (it is in a low income area). And so two of the people in the house one of them directly under me decided to use their plentiful free time to turn my life into living hell.

One day I got a letter from the neighbour under me which was more of a rant with more expletives than words. Followed by a letter by the landlord saying I should stop making noise. (he accused me of absolutely ridiculous things if never done). Shortly after that I got a letter from the landlord again threatening me with eviction. I was stressed at this point but this freaked me out and put me into a never ending state of fear of being evicted within 2 weeks without warning. This would be terrible in the current housing market. So I lived in fear of this happening from then on to today. 

But wait there is more. 

One evening I was working in my basement when my neighbour under me and his friend came into my basement and threatened me there. They wanted to beat me up and they thew my tools around. They where harassing me to no end and then even a other neighbour a I was friends with and saw the thing happening. They followed me to my car outside and threatened me there also.

I was completely done after that but I but I had to return every day to this place because it was my house after all. I had terrible fear of runnig into them. I stopped looking in the mailbox because I didn't wanna run into them. I didn't left my flat when I knew one of them was in the hallway. 

I noticed the first physical signs of this by sweat and a racing heart while walking to my door. I was looking over my shoulder and only wanted to minimise the time being in the hallways. My heart beats fast only typing this. 

But the worst thing, and that's why I'm turning to this sub is my neighbour under me started punching against his ceiling thereby my floor whenever I did something he didn't like. 

In the beginning I didn't even understand that he did this on purpose. I thought nothing of it, I looked at it as random noise which happens in big complexes. But he didn't stop and soon he was pissing me of. Months of this went by and it went from disturbing me to stressing me. Stressing me hard. I'm at a point now where it ruins my mood multiple days after each incident. 

The most concerning side effects for me is that every time something rumbles, either at work or at home or anywhere and the ground shakes a bit it gives me the same dreadful feeling and it throws me of into a state where I'm just so filled with stress hormones that I need a minute or two just to be functional again. That's where I hope some of you can tell me whether or not this is PTSD typical. 

I'm also starting to measure elevated blood pressure even though I'm super sporty. I also feel tired often and most importantly I'm having trouble concentrating on things. Another thing I can't explain to any doctor is that since this I'm more and more starting to feel unwelcome in my own skin like I'm just remote controlling my own body. Besides that, only little amounts of caffeine and alcohol or any mind altering substance kicks me of my feet. I was pretty tolerant against this in the past. 

I have only a few days ago signed my new leasing contract for my new flat in a single house at small village outside of town. I'm so incredibly happy about this. 

Can some please tell me if the above mentioned symptoms will go away after the move? My doctor performed multiple checks and didn't found anything wrong with me so I think they are related to my experiences and are of psychological nature. Has anyone had similar experience with the symptoms mentioned. 

If you are still with me thank you for reading this far. Please tell me if things are gonna get better once I'm out of there and what I can do to feel better again. I just don't want to be bothered by thoughts about my neighbours anymore. These guys have ruined my mood and my health for every single fucking day since a Year now. 

Thank you"
1,I’m sorry this is a strange question but I keep noticing it and I don’t understand it or know what to ask really. Whenever I get there I just feel so sad and feel trauma resurface. I’ve been sexually harassed before but it’s the trauma from the abuse in my family that feels like it invades my mind when I’m doing that. I’ll reach that point and feel good then all of a sudden I remember getting beat or hear all the yelling in my head or I’ll just hate myself or something. Does anyone else experience this? I’m sorry I know it’s a weird question to ask but I don’t know how to talk to anyone about it really
1,One of my triggers is the song that was playing when I regained consciousness during the event that caused my ptsd. I get very anxious when listening to music in the same genre if I haven't made the playlist. I tend to avoid listening to the radio and such. Hearing it triggers major flashbacks for me. I play in a softball league that plays music on big speakers very loudly. The whole time I feel like I'm on the verge af a panic attack worried this song is going to play.  The guy that runs the league is a really nice guy and I think that if I could explain in the right way he would agreed to not play it. I just don't want to get into any details but I feel like he would need to understand that it is more than I just don't like this song. I would rather email him than talk in person.  Does anyone have a suggestion on how to go about wording this?
1,Is anyone else experiencing this? I can’t turn my mind off at all.
1,"I (28f) never realized the domestic abuse I witnessed and was apart of as a child (9-17 yrs old) would result in me having PTSD. I was always under the impression I was manic depressive and had anxiety with small bouts of depression. 

I didn’t start addressing my struggle until recently and going to therapy for the last 3 months and being on medication for the last 2 months has been extremely helpful. The initial reason I started going to therapy was I noticed the things that happened to me as a child, those feelings and emotions I experienced I was bringing into my marriage. Not cool. I needed and wanted to get it straight. How do I deal? 

What triggered this? My upstairs neighbors. It’s not a matter of being on the 1st floor, it’s just the shit neighbors who live upstairs from me. The banging around from their toddler, the hard walking mother and the occasional fight with the father are setting off major triggers. I own the condo and bought it about Sept ‘19, these guys moved in Nov ‘20 as renters. Needless to say it’s been a long 5 months. I’ve spoken to my husband about moving - he’s not budging. I can’t blame him or get mad at him. Who knows how long these guys are going to last here? Why give up on an asset for temporary happiness? Which brings me to my next point. 

Happiness is an extremely emotion we strive to live for when in actuality we should be looking for contentment. He says “they aren’t the problem, you need to stop kicking dirt over your problem and start addressing it.” Talk about tough love, but he’s right."
1,My therapist recently changed my diagnosis from PTSD to Complex PTSD and recommended that I purchase the Complex PTSD Workbook. Has anyone here used that workbook before? I’d love to hear what your experiences were.
1,"I just had an outburst because things got to overwhelming and I'm super embarrassed.  I normally can handle myself well and remove myself when I feel like things are gonna trigger me but I have rare times I just can't.  They usually happen when I am alone but sometimes they happen in front of my bf, I'm guessing because we have a very close relationship and I can let my guard down.  The thing is, idk how to communicate what just happened or explain to him why I freaked out cause the reason seems so fucken stupid and I just acted like a two year old who didn't get the chocolate bar and threw shit and themselves on the ground. I'm super embarrassed and scared to come out of our room and go talk to him."
1,"Not going to get into my past experiences, but my mother doesn't believe my doctors and mental health team when they diagnosed me with PTSD. My mother says that since I was never in war I cannot have PTSD. What should I do or tell my mother?"
1,"So I went to a psych ward back in December because my mental health got terrible. I’m currently in therapy although I do not a have a diagnosis. They are leaning towards c-ptsd but have also mentioned BPD and bipolar 2. I know nightmares are common with ptsd and I was curious if any of you could tell me about your experiences with it. My nightmares lately have been too much to put it simply. They’re all very real feeling and don’t feel like normal nightmares not to mention I don’t dream like normal in these nightmares. I almost always dream in 3rd person and didn’t start dreaming in 1st till these nightmares. They give me that nasty anxious feeling in my stomach and the Adrenaline from fight or flight reflexs. When I wake up I realize it was a dream but I’m always disoriented and have to tell myself who I am, where I’m at and what I’m doing. It’s almost like I have to remember the last 2 years of my life to figure out what just happened."
1,"When someone is falling asleep, just as they transfer into deep sleep but hear explosions, bangs, loud pops, knocks, etc. which wakes them up. This is increased when they are stressed. Also loud sounds like trash trucks in the am makes them wake up almost panicked. Always around 4 am. Truck runs at 4 am, before that their father (who fell often after 2 strokes) would wake up at 4 am, and they would also hear the neighbors phone alarm vibrate up stairs at the same time. This didn’t happen until after basic training. Loud pitched whistles followed by explosions from 9 pm to 6-7 am. Always waking up as they hit deep sleep. Never completed basic."

I could write a book about my life, however to spare the lengthy post

I don't know how to keep being alive. My life has just been one domino effect of bad ever since I was 17, and im 27 now.

I've been in the wrong spaces for such a long time, not intentionally but it's like the first bad situation somehow led to another that led to another. I've had two traumatic relationships in my life, both being with co workers. the 1st was when I was 17/18 years old, fresh in the work world working at a fast food. The guy was 21 and due to low self esteem from being ghosted and then finding out the person then chose another girl to be his gf, right after ghosting me ( we were talking and flirting heavily for about 3 months), I stupidly accepted the advances of a guy who wasn't my type in the first place. He was always very persistent in wanting my attention and when he spoke about how good I look and how special I am, how much better I was than other girls, how he doesn't know how a guy couldn't want me etc. I finally fell for it. We went out for about 4-5 months, and towards the end of it, the truth came out. The mother of his child was pregnant with another child, about 6 months along, so basically when he and I first got together, even before sex happened between us, she was already 2-3 months pregnant. Of course he didn't disclose this until later. I think he said something along the lines of not believing that she was. Although I should've ended it right then and there, it took me a few more weeks to do so because I was attached to him by then and he told me so many lies about him saying my name in his sleep and he loves me etc. etc. he told me there's no such thing as fairytales and that he's no good, and he told me the lies I wanted to hear. This was the first guy I had ever been with not just sexually but ""romantically"", I never had a bf before and I had been so hurt by being rejected from the first guy ( who honestly was like my dream guy at the time, he was in college, kind, large vocabulary, creative and the one I originally thought and hoped would have been my first bf) but the lack of closure of rejecting me made me wonder what did I do wrong, etc. and I beat myself up everyday even until now for ""falling"" for the 2nd guy because he negatively changed my life and he wasn't even my type or someone I was initially into. After we broke up, about a few weeks later, the mother of his child gave birth ( I was aware he had a daughter but being stupid and not in the right mind I believed that he wasn't with the mother in that way it was just co parenting), and she and he started harassing me, calling me, texting me, etc. it was awful. Right before that started, about a week prior and maybe like 3 weeks after we broke up, I had found out I contracted an STD from him. To my knowledge a condom was always used but I guess it didn't matter. Being blindsided by that, then being harassed and cursed out by both of them, all while still working at that toxic job and trying to finish up my 2nd semester of college, was unbelievably hard. I spent about two months dealing with that on and off until I was able to find a new job and quit immediately. I didn't think it would get worse, so when the first curse out happened, I didn't quit because I thought that was it. But it continued even though I never provoked back... never opened my mouth to argue back because I realized arguing back with someone like that is like talking to a wall. Maybe my lack of arguing back made them more upset so two weeks later, it happened again etc. After I quit, he did contact me again one more time two months later out of the blue to curse me out. I had his number blocked from months prior but for some reason you're able to still get voicemails.... Out of curiosity I listened and I'm like you're the desperate to get the heat of yourself that you're going to say you never wanted me and that I'm basically some hoe who had nothing better to do... I haven't heard from him since but there's more to write. That one year of my life working there I'm still in shock to it to this day. And that was the start of the spiral."
1,"I wish my flair could be the shrug emoji

Anyway
I know people that I want to be friends with
And like we are
But aaaaanytime anyone tries asking about my life I kind of shut it down reeeaaal quick. Not intentionally either, just like I manage to totally redirect every time without even thinking about it. Defense mechanism? Perhaps?
OR
I put a lot of effort into getting to know someone and they just don’t pay me any mind at all so then I’m like... sad? Because they don’t want to know me?
But also I’d probably shut them down anyway so it shouldn’t matter?
But then I’m just cycling in loneliness 

So I know a lot of people but nobody knows me
And I don’t know if I’m okay with that lmao

Does anyone relate? Or like... know what to do with this kind of feeling? It catches me off guard every time"
2,"I'm talking things like psychosis. I had the whole C-PTSD package, extremely depressed since my earliest memories, constant suicidal ideation/depression with chronic health problems and isolation, but that all paled in comparison to what happened a few years ago, which I suppose was the climax after all those years of buildup. I have no specific memories of that year, only the thoughts that passed through my mind and so I call it ""Hell year"" or just ""that year,"" I was diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features which helps me remember that it actually happened.

My self-loathing and critic were so intense that I wouldn't allow myself the smallest luxuries and I was consciously dedicated to self-destruction and degradation. I'd physically harm myself as punishment for doing things like moving my eyes around. If I looked around a room, I'd get angry at myself for having the nerve to try and gather information about my environment. I would refuse to turn on lights for a similar reason and I'd often lock myself in a pitch-black room for hours on end and remain motionless. I once typed up 10 pages about the functions of hands and why I should be deprived of the privilege to move my hands, or how I didn't have the privilege to walk and decide where I was located in the world. I would try to analyze the structure of every emotion I felt and logically reason out why I should be incapable of experiencing that emotion since having emotions requires having relationships to entities or objects and since I can't have those relationships, I can't have emotions. It wasn't as easy to eliminate thoughts since thoughts appear randomly, so I tried to induce health problems to slow down the rate at which thoughts would appear in my brain.

There are a hundred more weird things I did but those are the first ones that come to my mind. I don't know what I'm looking for by sharing this humiliating information, I've just never talked about it before and I can't talk about it to anyone in person. I know it's not relatable for most. I've been crippled ever since that year, even though all those habits are gone I never managed to get a life going. Have any of you gone through something like this and scrounged together a life afterward?"
2,"
I had to have an MRI, and found between the *loud* sounds it made and being stuck on my back caused me to alternate between internal panic holding back tears (biting my tongue) and dissociating. I kept catching myself and ‘bringing myself back’ so I wouldn’t move or start sobbing during it and prolong the experience. Being “stuck” on my back is a major trigger for me; completely helpless feeling with disgust that washes over me. I wasn’t so much bothered with claustrophobia as others usually are in those as I was with my position; I had to stay in there like that for 40 minutes. 




I guess I’m just venting sadness and a stressful day. I hope I don’t ever have to have one of those again; along with an angiogram some years ago when I had to stay still on my back for *3 hours* (I did cry on and off then). *Miserable!*"
2,"I was trying to explain my thoughts to my therapist a few weeks ago about how I needed to figure out how to put myself first in my life but without going to the point of being completely selfish. Then the other day while reflecting on one of my dad's stupid rants I realized that I need to remember that sacrificing my comfort for the wellbeing of others is OK but sacrificing my wellbeing for the comfort of others is not.
Do things that are a little bit annoying but keep someone else safer, healthier, etc.
DON'T do things that are a detriment to your own mental or physical health to prevent someone else's annoyance.
Really just a long-winded version of don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm but I wanted to share."
2,"Tomorrow is my birthday, and it is just bringing up a whole bunch of things that I'd rather not think about or feel. My parents want to video call with me for dinner, but I don't want to spend that time with them. I also know that if I don't video call with them tomorrow, their feelings will be hurt. It just feels like they are performing the ""good parent"" role, aka ""good parents spend time with their kids on their birthdays."" And to be honest, it is so much emotional work to talk with my mom for extended periods of time that it seems like a terrible way to spend my birthday. 

I just keep going back to being a little kid and having to make decisions for my birthday that I didn't want to make (Where do you want to go to dinner? What specific present do you want? Where can I buy the specific present? Send me the Amazon link. What kind of cake do you want?). I always felt SO MUCH anxiety about picking a place for dinner that everyone would like or choosing a present that my parents would actually buy for me instead of telling me ""oh, you don't really want THAT."" 

My dream birthday would be for someone to plan a fun day/ dinner for me and not make me make any decisions, but my birthdays have always had to revolve around me making ALL the decisions for the day because that is easiest for them. They never cared about what I actually wanted (to have someone thoughtfully plan something they think I might like and take the burden of planning off of me), and have always just done the minimum to show everyone else that they're doing what parents are supposed to do. If they really knew me, they'd know that the way they ""celebrate"" my birthday doesn't actually make me feel thought of or cared about, and feeling thought of and cared about are the only things I really want for my birthday. 

I feel sad and lonely, and I'm grieving for the little kid who just wanted to feel seen and loved."
2,"A little background: I was diagnosed with CPTSD in the last year, but (like everyone else) it's been constantly present since I was a kid. I tried to go to therapy at my undergrad but there was a shortage of therapists in my city so it was impossible to get an appointment. In the last year I've seen three therapists, one of which was the perfect match for me but since it was through my grad school CAPS program it was only short-term. I was recently moved to a long-term therapist, but I'm starting to resent therapy generally.

For some reason, I don't respond well to CBT. It's not that I don't do the work associated with it or I'm actively resisting my therapist and the treatment. It's more like I've done the work on my own for a long time, but the symptoms of CPTSD are still there. With my previous therapist we focused on what we both thought would be helpful and integrated different forms of therapy together. It was especially great because I would be able to research things on my own in between sessions and bring what I thought was interesting to my therapist. I told my current therapist about it and she said that would be a good idea, but I brought her ""The CPTSD Workbook"" because it's helpful to me and she basically said ""that isn't empirically tested so it's invalid"" and I spoke about ""The Body Keeps the Score"" and she said ""the author didn't actually do any research of his own so I don't recommend that book at all."" 

Since I'm a grad student in a pretty analytic-heavy program, I understand what she was saying. It's easy to be a guardian of your subject and gate-keep in that fashion without realizing it. I don't think she meant any harm by it and she didn't say it in such blunt terms, but you get the idea. 

In my last session she gave me a book to read called ""When Panic Attacks"" and I'm more than halfway through it. I use the daily mood logs to challenge negative thoughts whenever they come up, but these are (thankfully) few and far between because I've made a lot of progress in terms of anxiety. Still, I don't really like the book at all and find myself having to force myself to read it through before my next session. It feels a lot like blaming people with anxiety for their thought patterns without considering the causes of the problem in the first place, especially when it comes to trauma. Obviously the book is effective and has helped a lot of people so I don't want to discount that because parts of it have been helpful to me too! 

I also resent the fact that my therapist keeps saying ""when you get off substances you'll be better"" or ""everyone I've treated that has gotten off of substance has been better off."" I smoke weed at night using a pen because it's helpful to me. I have terrible insomnia, chronic pain, and it is nearly impossible for me to release the tension in my body. I only take one or two puffs before bed - not enough to get high - and it addresses all of the above. I stopped for two weeks and I couldn't sleep because the pain was too much, even with gabapentin and advil. I only started up recently because my lack of sleep is affecting my everyday life and emotional wellbeing. And even though my therapist says there's no judgement and that weed is preferable to medication, I just feel like I'm inadequate for having to rely on something to just be ""off"" enough to sleep. I also feel like I won't get better if I don't stop, even though it's not a ""problem"" per se. Even here I'm explaining myself away and that in itself is frustrating for me. 

I also get frustrated because why can everyone else walk around with their toxic af behaviors and not have to put in such hard work every single day? It's exhausting to heal and become better and sometimes I just want to give up. I feel like I constantly have to be on my best behavior and monitor myself every second, because if I'm not doing that I'm not getting better. So yeah, I'm starting to resent therapy."
2,"Ugh This is a bit long....sorry!  I could use some hot takes and support/advice on this.  *deep breath because this is hard to admit*

Last week I had a triggering gyno exam to investigate a problem I am having and found out I need some follow up procedures that are particularly problematic for me due to some past traumas.  I was upset but doing ok I thought.... I worked, did normal stuff for a week.  Then yesterday afternoon I had a period of about 6 hours at home where my husband says I was making sense when I talked, but was lost/confused, kept asking the same questions over and over, and appeared to have no short term memory.  I apparently acted like a person with a bad concussion or dementia.  I cannot remember any of it today - the whole thing just completely blank even when he describes our conversations and stuff we did it rings no bells at all.  Also things that happened the day before that I do remember fine feel like they happened a week ago, like time dilated or something.  

Pretty sure this episode was psychological in origin based on prior experiences.  The other time I had this sort of severe reaction (plus severe depressive symptoms not currently on my menu) I was hospitalized in a mental ward and the docs agreed it was definitely psychological that time.  That was 5 or 6 years ago.  This episode was a little different but similar enough to convince me it is my mind not my body doing this.  If it happens again I have agreed to see a medical doctor to make sure, since as a middle aged lady I know some things can get wacky with thyroid, hormones, etc.  Doctors are one of my triggers so I really hate to go down that road unless it is super urgent.

I do have a history of dissociation, time loss, and cognitive impairment when super triggered, but consider myself recovered for a few years now (25 years of therapy/meds before that recovery and I thought it was solid) and this episode took me completely by surprise.  I am physically a little shaky/panicky today but my mind is working though I am still kinda weirdly distracted.   I am having some crying jags today that start and stop abruptly, but have been able to talk with my spouse about the underlying traumas so I think I am getting through it without too much walling off....dunno.  

I called in sick to work out of caution (I have a somewhat tricky/hazardous job and cannot forget/lose focus at it) but feel like I can probably go back in a day or two assuming I stay on track.  I am going to try to journal/cry it out for awhile each day to try to discharge the emotion.  I graduated from therapy and meds last year and was hoping to still do some EMDR for some landmines like this that I know still hide in my mind, but unfortunately every therapist I checked is booked solid because everyone is struggling these days due to *gestures at everything going on in the world this year*.

Anyway, looking for some advice, reassurance, or commiseration from any others who may have this sort of experience in their journey.  I feel like I am losing my mind....again.

Unfortunately I still need to have this super triggering gyn test and biopsy procedure and am unsure how to handle it.  I told them I have a couple of flavors of PTSD and needed a little time to prepare myself before scheduling it but I really can’t put it off much longer.  Advice on navigating this in particular is welcome."
2,"I would say I'm an introvert. I have friends but I spend a majority of my time alone. Part of this is a coping mechanism. ""If no one is close to me I can't be hurt."" Type of thing and also the fact I'm an introvert and I gain energy from being alone. I'm also no contact with my whole biological family so  I don't have really many social connections. I do have a therapist and other professionals who help me.

I'm trying to work on it though, reach out to my friends more and spend more time with them. But I notice that after I spend just a few hours with them I need a week to recharge, even when they're my only actual social interaction I've had in a while. So how much social interaction do humans actually need?"
2,"relationships exhaust me. seriously. i can't take any fighting. my romantic partners have never really been exhausted or destroyed by  fighting, unlike me. i don't really understand. are we just cursed?"

2,What's something we should tell ourselves on the days where we accomplish mostly nothing? Today I was filled with anxiety. Spent most of the day in bed on my phone/watching TV. My brain just goes over all the negatives. Everything feels so heavy and I get so tired of fighting this battle....usually all I can do is remind myself every day won't feel like this. What about you guys?
2,"I wrote a post a few days ago, and it briefly mentioned me going for a walk in the park. I’ve been trying to go on some exercises to get myself moving.

I went for a walk today and I came back home feeling horrible. I was exhausted. My mind has been foggy since. I feel so awful. As I was walking I felt like I was going to die. I still feel like this.

I’ve always been anxious going out in public. But it’s gotten much more difficult to manage the past few months.

I know I’m not the only person who struggles with this. I’ve read about other people feeling similar things, just different scenarios.

But… fuck man. I never realized my anxiety has been this bad. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this either. I don’t see my therapist until next Monday. We’re doing EMDR, but my visits with him are so spaced out that waiting becomes agonizing. I’m thinking of finding another therapist on an online service like BetterHelp. Someone to supplement my other therapist. I get so tired of waiting. And I need a professional I can keep in touch with.

If anyone has any advice, I’m willing to listen. For now I’m just spending the rest of my day in bed or taking it easy. I’m so tired."
2,"The techniques I have learned from this book have been extremely helpful with emotional flashbacks/panic attacks that put me in a fight or flight panic state (or freak state.) It will bring me down to a grounded, calm state after several rounds when nothing else is working. I highly suggest it!"
2,"maybe we aren’t made for love, i whisper down the phone, because i love you the way i love weed
not a want, or a saving grace, but an emotional need. 
i tried really hard, but pleasing you makes me miserable, for i want to love you, and my heart is bleeding but a relationship for me, just feels like a ceiling. it traps me, squashes me down, an anxious feeling. breathing? meaning? find one, find both. i cant fit your relationship box, maybe i’m poly, or maybe i’m just broken. take her out the box, brush off the dust, hidden at the back of the shelf. open the engraved golden clasp, let the ballerina dance, smiling in bliss, none of this confusing romance. but this dolly is broken, someone damaged her in the night. stole her batteries, crossed her wires, convinced her he was right. before i met you, my only experiences were hollowing. love wasnt something worth swallowing, for sadly in this lady’s life, teachers touched school kids, abuse takes a life. tell someone you said? cut me open with a knife. see how my heart is mouldy and brown, lie me on the police station table, examine me for evidence, who cares if i’m mentally unstable? at worst he’ll get a few years and a mark by his name, sadly the victims too caught up in her own self indulgent blame. he still teaches, i checked, facebooks got that sorted! after that, your profile, i finally reported. because i don’t want my fucking abuser, to like my shiny new profile picture, notifications are off now, blocked in a flicker. and no matter how many instagram posts on self growth, feminist tweet or sexual assault statistic, no one will understand the way i miss you, it’s sadistic, ballistic, i’m screaming, but only silence echoes out. drowning, still just praying my parents don’t find out. they’d kill you, then me, at age seven? or age nine? see i can drag a straight line, from your hands up my school skirt, to the dirty living room floor, where i got fucked like a whore. it’s like sexual trauma makes you hot, the male gaze isn’t clandestine, it’s not wrapped in fine wine and sunshine, it’ll rip out your insides. devour your soul, keep your relationship, i’m doing just fine."
2,"TW: CSA, FT, EA
Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long read

So a bit of backstory about what brought me here. A little while back I had a pretty bad nervous breakdown in response to CT scan that told me I had mild brain atrophy for age. I had a follow up MRI that disproved it but the damage was done and I had convinced myself in that time period I had dementia. Now I still struggle with that thought, and every day I’m scared because I’ve been struggling with memory issues and some word retrieval stuff that was sudden onset after this traumatic event. Everyone keeps telling me I’m healthy physically but mentally I’m pretty unwell. In the past I was diagnosed with ADHD, MDD, and GAD but here recently my therapist and I have been talking about my extremely traumatic past. Here begins the TW: Essentially I was molested for a good portion of my childhood from about 3-11, parents divorced at 9, I was then forced to act normal around my abuser after the abuse was discovered and my family effectively covered it up for several years, my parents remarried, then divorced again two years later following my mother’s infidelity to my father, she then forced me to lie to the rest of my family about that which put further strain on everything, i then moved in with my mother and stepfather making things really bad, mom got pregnant and lost my only brother and then six months later I lost my grandmother, a year later I had to report my sexual abuse because I went to counseling at 17 which caused a huge case and family problems galore, all of my friends turned against me over the course of a summer then proceeded to drive me out of the college I was in during this time I lost my great grandmother, fast forward a couple years later my stepfather who ironically cheats on my mother decided to leave and make me have to care for my mother and little sister for a time before he came back. My life gets constantly uprooted and turned upside down. He told me to look into CPTSD and turns out I have a lot more in common here than I thought I did. I honestly wish I didn’t feel like I had dementia as being 22 it’s extremely unlikely but fear has really taken ahold of me."
2,"That’s all. Life was easier when I put everything in a box and hid it. Now I see that box before me every day. Sometimes I look into it, but not much. I wish I could hide that box again but it keeps coming back. It was so easy to forget about it before, why can’t I do that any more. It’s annoying."
2,"It’s just after midnight where I am, and I turn 23 today. The last year has honestly been the hardest year of my life, and I can’t believe I made it. Just wanted to share"
2,"I’m 21, and have had three jobs before — I walked out of all of them.

For example, when I was 16 at my second job, I walked out mid-shift after only four days, because the coworker training me told me in front of a customer, “You should know how to do this by now!”

I was flooded with so much panic. That black dread that always comes with rejection/criticism. They were both staring at me and it felt like I was collapsing in on myself. I literally ran out and never went back.

Looking back I know my response was totally disproportionate to the situation but it really felt like I was going to die. It’s been like this every other job since, too. I know it comes with the territory, but I’m really terrified of criticism.

Does anyone relate? Have advice?"
2,"I seriously cannot understand how anyone can be happy single.  When I'm in a relationship, I take so much better care of myself and I just feel more alive in general. When I'm not, it's like my brain is like ""aight I'm out"" and then unplugs itself and I'm left floating through life. When I'm lucky enough to feel anything, it's usually intense anger, self hatred, or anxiety."
2,"I was wondering if anyone else here whose family has been affecting by things has been able to restore a good bond with them?

My family went through some long term trauma, and now, through no fault of their own, I find it very hard to trust/be close to my mum and step-dad. Even looking them in the eyes is very difficult for me. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe I'm subconsciously being avoidant or defensive.

Would family therapy be worth looking at?

Also, can anyone relate?"
2,"Some explanation: I am diagnosed with CPSTD, depression, and anxiety. I wrote this to help me articulate my feelings. To help people understand that they are not the only ones who are feeling this way. To release these feelings, to help me process and understand them more. I’m trying to convince myself that I’m not doing this for attention, or validation, but I am still and feeling guilty over this. Maybe one day I won’t be.

I thought life was supposed to be enjoyable. It’s not. The only thing keeping me going is the hope that one day it might be. That I won’t feel hatred for myself. That I wont feel guilt for eating food people give me. That my car will have working ac and windshield wipers, and up to date registration. That my shoes won't have holes in them. That I’ll be able to stop sewing patches in my pants. That I’ll be able to sleep at night without waking up not knowing where I am. That I won't have to rely on anyone ever again. I’ll be able to afford my medications. I haven’t bought myself shoes in two years. That I’ll have more than -40 dollars in my bank account. I won’t feel guilt for telling people I’m not okay. I hope that one day I’ll be able to tell people that I’m not okay. The hope that one day I won’t flinch when people try to hug me. That I can look up and know where I am and what year it is at all times. That I won’t feel abandoned. That I won’t feel crushing guilt for every kind word someone tells me. That I won’t feel like an imposter in my own life. That I won’t feel like I have to be happy around everyone. That people realize that my normal personality isn’t joyful. That my joy is a mask to make everyone else feel comfortable around me. 

I used to believe that if you worked hard, that if you made all the sacrifices, you would be happy. But I’m afraid that I can never be happy. 

Yet through all of this, I don’t really feel hateful. I feel tired. I feel suicidal. I feel guilt towards myself and disappointment at others. I’m angry at God. Because of the sense of justice he gave me. I’m angry that he lets people do terrible things in his name. I’m angry at Christians for not being loving. I don’t understand. How can people hate? I’ve had trials and tribulations that have broken me. I hate my life, but I will never hate people. It would be easier if I could. It would be easier if I didn’t care. I could walk away from it all. But I love. I feel too deeply. I’m angry at God because of that. Why did he have to do this to me. Why did he have to make me feel this much. I don’t want to. I want it to end. 

I want to make others feel love. I never want others to feel the way I do. I guess that’s how come I don’t share. Because its easier to keep it inside. I guess its kind of selfish. I don’t want to deal with the pity. I don’t want to deal with the sympathetic pats on the shoulder. I don’t want to explain myself to people. I don’t want to defend my feelings. I’m comfortable here in misery. It’s all I know now. Life isn’t enjoyable, but I hope that one day it may be."
2,"They’re putting A LOT of perspective on how badly I was mistreated. I set boundaries with the people around me and they’re usually like “okay thanks for letting me know. I respect it.” But when I did that with people who used to be in my life, ex friends, ex therapists, my biological family. They’d get passive aggressive and do war campaigns on me. Like wow... 🤯"
2,"First I've realized that I can say no.

I've realized that I don't know who I am.

I've realized that I don't know what I want.

I've realized that I've never lived, that I was abused to be a mere Pavlovian doormat obeying puppy.

I've realized that my time is limited.

I've realized that I'll never get it back, and now I need to face the paradoxical consequences of it.

I've realized that I have feelings - ""I am sad"", ""I am happy"", not sure how it works yet.

I've realized that what people say I am, isn't necessarily true.

I've realized that I can enforce boundaries, that if I say no, it is A no.

I feel like it's too late to live my life, soon, in a blink of an eye, I'll be 30, the same way, without noticing, I turned 20.

It's depressing, I'm a mess, I'm trying to make it, but it's hard and I don't want to give up on my dreams, if, they're even MY damn dreams.

J'accuse! I blame! I blame my parents, my family, the bullies, the useless therapists, I BLAME.

They were all either straight abusive, lazy, blinded by their own disbelief, I blame them for messing it up.

Now, I've got to repair this broken man.

There's a saying - ""It's easier to build strong children than repair broken man"" and oh how true it is.

Because this broken man, and yes, I am broken, needs to repair himself, take of his inner child and prepare for his future self, and it's daunting, tiring and I'm on pits of despair.

The thoughts of what if, should've, could've terrorize my serenity.

This is my life unfortunately, this is it.

And fuck it, I am a victim. I'm not victimizing myself. That's what fate has given me - To be a victim of never being truly loved by your parents. To never know what true love is (except from Grandma). To never have a happy fulfilling childhood and teenage years.

This is my hand, but I'll play it well, hopefully.

I'm sad, as being realistic, I'll want to have children, but how can I have children, or even think about children, when there's this child here, this poor child who wanted love, warmth, recognition, inclusivity, a comforting shoulder and a listening ear which he never truly got?"
2,"I've always compulsively picked. My skin, hair, nails, anything. I've recently been compulsively combing my dog to get his dandruff out. I'll literally ignore the rest of my life to give into this compulsion. Anyone else?"
2,"First time poster here, long time lurker.

Both parents are awful and I am completely NC with my mom. Several years ago she found out my phone number and I can't remember how. Ultimately I blocked her from calling. The fun part is about my cell phone provider is that when you block a number, it doesn't ring but my phone notifies me that the blocked number had called. She is also allowed to leave voicemails that I can listen to. That is pretty much not helpful at all and triggers me every time she calls. At least it doesn't ring so I don't feel compelled to answer and get into a fight. 

Well she has now decided to enlist her friends to call and harass me now! Got a lovely text that said ""What a horrible young woman you are to do such things to your mother. You will regret it. Your Mother is one of the nicest and generous people I know. You should get to know her. You must not take after her. Good luck. I wont contact you again."" 

The last time this individual texted me I said no more texts would be tolerated and they would be considered harassment and therefore I would be filing charges. I called the police department of where my mother lives (i moved out of state) amd they told me that I needed to contact my local jurisdiction. Well I don't wanna do that because then when they call my mom to tell her to stop they will have to announce which department they are calling from. Then she will know what city I live in and that can't happen. 

She abused me, and abandoned (and probably abused) my two older half brothers. She ended up stalking one of them so I am afraid she will find where I live and show up unannounced. 

Dunno what the point is here but I'm just upset that I am 31 and she refuses to leave me alone."
2,"I have ADHD and an onslaught of physical health issues. I also grew up in a very abusive home. 

I get into these anxious feedback loops when something triggers me but I always thought it was my ADHD brain causing this to happen. I dissociate but I thought that was ADHD too because of how inattentive I can be.

Yesterday my landlord spoke to me extremely aggressively. It reminded me of how my father used to scream at me. I cried for hours and I dissociated for the entire day. I barely felt connected to reality at all. It has never been that bad but what I realize is the few episodes that came close to being that bad have always been instances where someones behavior reminded me of my father. Every time.

I brought up CPTSD to my therapist this morning and she said that it seems very probable to her and she’s thought so for some time now. 

Tbh it makes a lot of sense as about 4 years ago I started zoning out and losing chunks of time. My perception of time was way off. My previously sharp memory got so foggy I could barely remember the names of people I’d met multiple times or knew back in high school. I thought it was my ADHD so I went back on meds, but I didn’t see much of an improvement. Now I think I might know why. 

This is ruining my life. I think I’m going to have a productive day, I get triggered, and it’s all over. I spend the day in bed. I can’t go on like this anymore. Has anyone here found treatment that helps? Was it hard getting diagnosed?"
2,"Not even just the mental and emotional aspect anymore. My body is usually tense. Past three days though it's been extra tense and rigid combined with almost anxiety shaking. I'm already sore from an injury, but I thought I was getting better. The past three days though it's just been constant rigid shaking and I feel choppy. It feels like the aftereffect of a crash, but without the crash. 

It doesn't go away and stuck in the environment that damaged me and their snide comments are just icing on the cake. I can't even cry it just turns to uncontrollable laughter. So sick of bullshit and misery and shit stacking. I hate feeling it all just shut down. I try to heal and do what I'm supposed to do and something else waves over to drown me or stacks. 

Over and over and over and over and over until I just don't know. So many cravings and needs not being met and getting burned and now I'm physically getting screwed.

And nsfwish, but it's been rough and been lonely, but terrified of people so I tried just soloing myself a bit to try to relax and I couldn't even do that. I tensed up so much I couldn't even move. Just ended up crying and frustrated. 

Now I need to eat and I want actually food and there is just unhealthy crap they got and I can't afford to get anything better and just so stressed and irriated about so much pent up shit. There's no one to go to. No comfort physically or mentally here. I'm beyond my limits just irratable and hurt so much I'm angry and I don't want to be."
2,"I've never told anyone the whole story before. I had a friend call 911 on me because I was suicidal and alone. He told me he had done it, so I was waiting for emergency services come. I was expecting paramedics. But when I opened the door it was the police. They told me to step outside, and I did, but when I closed the door behind me and turned back to face them, I realized the officer closest to me had his gun drawn and pointed right at me. I was 21, 5'8, 115lbs of weeping mess. I didn't have a weapon or anything in my hands. Just a young woman in pajamas and sandals who wasn't sure how to keep being alive when she was in so much pain.

All that was going through my head was, they're going to shoot me and the newspaper won't say my name. It will say, mentally ill woman, but it won't say my name. And no one will care because I have a history of psychosis and therefore I'm not a real person. He shouted hands up, and I put my hands up. He told me to turn around. I did, and then he told me hands behind my back and then they cuffed me and told me to sit on the steps. And after a short while of sitting there, they picked me up and threw me in the back of their car and when I couldn't cry quietly enough they yelled at me to shut up and then I'm pretty sure I just froze, all the way to the ER.

I never told anyone because I thought I deserved it because I was suicidal. I never told anyone because I thought they would judge me for being afraid. But ever since I've always been so frighrened of the police. Every time I see another mentally ill person has been killed during a wellness check, I'm thinking, it could have been me. It could have been me so easily."
2,"i have been on 20mg of prozac since the end of 2016, so about 5 years now. im getting anxious about how long i’ve been on it and it’s possible effects on my brain. im also worried if i’ll ever be able to get off them :(( does anyone have any experience with this or insight?"
2,"Hi there. I was in an abusive (physical, mental, sexual) relationship for 7 years. From age 15-22 years old. My abuser (ex bf) physically isolated me from the world. I was imprisoned in my bedroom for many years and was told he would kill me if I left the house. When I finally decided to leave him, he stalked me every day and threatened my life 100x per day for almost a year after.  I am now 30 years old. I have worked hard to get my driver's license, put myself through college, and now I am in grad school after a lot of trial-and-error, dropping, enrolling, depression, etc.

People are often so proud of me when they hear my story and what I am doing now. However, I still live in fear every day of my life. Although I have moved to a new city to create distance between myself and my abuser, I still stay up at night wondering if he has found me or if I will wake up to him in my home, or in a parking lot, etc. Because of this, I have always stayed anonymous online. I don't even write my name on packages I order. I just use my initials or a fake name. I have one social media account and I don't even use my real name on it (it's private, as well). I also ask family to not post photos of me.

My current problem is that I am getting close to graduating with my Master's degree and entering the professional world. With that comes LinkedIn pages and other online portfolios. Also, the profession I am going into requires that I have my name, photo, degrees, etc. on a webpage. I am afraid of making waves and refusing to do it if I land a job.  This would mean that my abuse could easily google my name and find the location I work at.

I've considered changing my name but I am so attached to my name and it would break my family's heart. Plus, in my education, degrees, and internships- I am known by my real name. If I get hired at my internship, I feel like they would be confused by a name change.

Friends and family get annoyed with me when I bring this up and tell me to stop being so egocentric and that my abuser had moved on and so should I. They don't understand that I am always in survival mode and it won't go away.

Any advice on this topic would be so helpful. Or anyone that has been in a similar situation?"
2,"I hate this. today i had an awful experience at hospital. i had to have a biopsy done with about 5 minutes notice (didn't go to hospital for a biopsy)

so that was pretty traumatic - 2 stitches.
but what i wanted to talk about; The nurse touched me on my back.. bare skin and i flinched like she was a hot flame.
Then... she stuck a large needle into my back that i was forewarned would really hurt! and i was totally accepting and willing to endure it. if theres anything im good at its tolerating pain... i think i thought maybe at some point

no emotional response merely physical 'nerve ending' response.
But her touch terrified me. it was like being electrocuted. she said sorry my hands are cold.... but that was just a convenient excuse for me. she was really nice so i think she may have been helping me out there.
i had an emotional freak out from her merely touching me but a metalic needle causing me pain feels safe somehow.
Im feeling pretty damn alone right now after that feels like i have a literal bubble around me- im not personable!!!!"
2,"I feel a bit dumb writing this, but I have this intense need to make things my own way. I feel like I've lacked an identity for so long and I fawned a lot during my teens especially that it became weird to even hear somebody say my name out loud. I couldn't connect that to me. 

Honestly I still quite struggle with who I am, I can't for the life of me say who I am if somebody asks me what I like or who are you. I get so confused and I try to really intensely research everything and rationalise (which I think is more of a flight response) to try and decide on very simple things. 

So here's where I'm at. I will literally spend hours just deciding on a product, whatever it is, is this the right match for me, is it truly me, was I influenced by somebody to get this. I need to truly feel that a clothing is mine, the food I eat is my choosing, the book I read is my choosing, the activities I do are my choosing. It's truly tiresome way of living. And maybe linked to my OCD, but I just don't feel good about things if I feel at all that they're not my choosing. Is it part of hypervigilamce or what, but I feel almost infantile trying to protect whatever small pieces of identity I've gathered together."

Trigger warning for sexual things.  

The title pretty much says it all.  
I do not really feel by body, i do not really feel emotions. I do not ""feel"" most of my body parts.  
I do not notice when i need to pee or need to poo in a reasonable time.  

When i feel like i need to pee, my bladder is about to burst.  
When i gotta poo, it is either, be on the toilet in 30 minutes or you shit your pants.  

I have a active sexual desire but i can not stand being touched. I do not enjoy being touched.  
But i still have this intense longing for some human connection.  
Most of my time among humans is spend calculating ""what would someone normal do"" and come up with a appropriate response.  
There are parts of my body that are not ""there"" for 95% of the days i spend awake.

The only time i feel connected to other humans is when i am high on weed.   

I spend 3 months as out patient and after that, a full 12 months living full time in a psychiatric facility.   
That means i slept maybe 5 days out of 365 of a year *not* in the loony bin.  
For 360 days i slept, ate, worked and lived in that place.  
Because i wanted to get myself together.  

But it did not help. They did not listen. After i talked about this, once, they just labeled me as a ""self medicating addict"" and just stopped caring beyond that.  
And this is not something my head made up, i got it in print, 30 pages worth of discharge papers saying just that. Despite me only talking about drugs like 2 or 3 times.  

I know why i distrust people, plenty of them have abused of tortured me.  
But this is beyond that, they ruined the connection between me and my body.  
When i am alone, in the dark, at home, in my bedroom, under the covers... i still do not feel good, safe and fulfilled.  

For the past year i could not even spend 60 bucks (i do not have) for a hooker just to get a hug and some comfort.  
Because corona has shut down every last brothel in my entire country.  

I am 40 and the only thing i want from live is to just once, just once, wake up next to someone who does not want to get away as soon as they open their eyes...  

I CANT EVEN GET A HUG I PAYED FOR! FOR FUCKS SAKE!  

FUCK YOU ALL WHO THINK CORONA IS NOT ALL THAT BAD!  

And fuck you with a rusty rake to everyone who is married or in a relationship who told me ""we all got it bad"".  
NO ASSHOLE! You do not. I talked 20 words to another human being in the last week.  
All talking to the person at the register when buying groceries."
2,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m not trying to discredit myself at all. I have suffered a lot of abuse in my life at the hands of both parents and ex partners and am surprised I can even get up and face the day sometimes.

I was very high functioning when I was younger, very academic, sociable, outgoing. 

A girl I work with is the same age and I just marvel at her, she works 7 days a week right now (4 in a lab and 3 with me in our retail job) runs a finance insta and is so educated about money, has solid friends, and is in her third year studying medicine.

I try not to compare myself but I look at her and think that if I had a better upbringing, that could have been me. 

Instead I am working just to keep my head above water, I don’t have any passions or career path and I feel like I’m not getting ahead. I almost feel frozen and not able to live my life as effectively as I should be"
2,"TW: Abuse and child trafficking mention, car accident 

So I already was traumatized over my parents and the multiple abusive relationships I was in and being child trafficked for a bit, and then about a week or  so ago I watched my dog get hit by a car. It’s been kinda affecting me a lot, when I hear car horns or tires screeching or beeping I get freaked out and I’m so worried about it happening again. But it also feels ridiculous, my parents have said it so many times. He’s not injured at all and we’re so blessed and all, which we are. I just kinda can’t get over it. He luckily just bounced off then ran away loudly whining instead of going under.. So I feel kinda over dramatic to be affected this way
(Lyric)"
2,"I don't know much about this topic at all, so I'm on a lil bit of a limb here. 

I've had CPTSD since I was a toddler (31 now) and have tried many forms of therapy, including neurofeedback and EMDR, to help my situation. Haven't made much progress with any of them. About a year and a half ago I tried a session of Accelerated Resolution Therapy that basically short-circuited me and escalated my situation into a full-blown panic disorder in which I felt panicked at everything my body did and was constantly convinced that I was actively dying. So I guess that session stirred something up. 

Since then I've gotten my B12 and D deficiencies tended to -- which helped significantly! Take your supplements, people! -- and started exercising and sleeping with a weighted blanket. I keep wanting to try meditating but having to stay still for anything is a major trigger for me. 

I keep hearing about how specifically learning music helps with neuroplasticity and adaptability, and in theory it makes sense. I was just wondering if anyone here had experience with that. If I take up an instrument it'll be a bit of a financial investment and I want it to be worthwhile."
2,"I've been in trauma-specific therapy for almost two months now, and I know it's vital that I get treatment. I avoided my trauma for years using alcohol, and I've been more or less sober for about four months. I knew that trauma therapy would be hard, but I had no idea how hard. Some days I just want to give up because the world seems so much darker, so colorless. My therapist and my boyfriend both tell me how much work I'm doing, and that I'm doing great, and that I'll get through this, it just takes time. I get that. But I'm so tired all the time now. I quit my part time job because I was having constant panic attacks and suicidal thoughts, and some days I just can't find the motivation to do much more than get out of bed. I feel worse than I can remember feeling. It just sucks that even though I'm doing everything I can, or maybe because I am, I still feel like shit all the time, and I still want to die every day. I know I'm moving forward, but it feels like I'm going backwards. I feel like I'm swimming with all my might against a much stronger current, and I'm doing good if I can stay in place."
2,"For a long time I've had an ever present fear that I'm going crazy. That I'm losing it and I'm going through psychotic episodes. But at the same time I don't think I am. I just think I'm really afraid. 
Is this common?"
2,"After going out and reading about anxiety and panic attacks, I’m more confused about what I am experiencing.  

To paint the picture what happened - an appointment got changed from a 1300 to 1130. I didn’t mentally register the change, and neither did my calendars. When I missed the appointment I was having full blown fight or flight adrenaline surges. I think it’s a combination trigger flashback, as much of my trauma from childhood was from not picking up on instructions due to an LD. 

Any help/suggestions on identifying this? 

Closest thing I found was I over in  r/cptsdfight - but that isn’t exactly this."
2,"They don't know about my diagnosis, and I have no interest in telling them about it. I don't want to see them, let alone give them hugs pretend everything is ok. But if I don't, they'll get pissed and demand to know why I'm acting distant. They'll also be mad when I tell them I don't want to get dinner after the funeral.

When they see me acting normal around my brother and distant around them, they'll wonder if I've been talking to my siblings in secret. (I have. They're are all leaving the Mormon church, and my parents think I'm ""leading them astray"", which is ridiculous. My siblings reached out to me after their faith crises for support.)

Losing my grandma is hard enough without having to deal with my parents' shit. What do I do?"
2,"I was thinking about this lately after talking with a friend about his childhood. He had a horrible childhood too, his father was an alcoholic and his mom was mean and dismissive. He confessed it all to me while he was drunk one night. But he’s doing well for himself. He struggles with certain things like addiction and whatnot, but he’s overall doing really well for himself. 

I had a horrible childhood and developed C-PTSD. He had a horrible childhood, and managed to stereotypically flourish outside of a few things. Why does this happen? What’s the difference?

Edit: to clarify, HE was the one that told me he’s doing well for himself. He told me he has addiction but doesn’t make a big deal of it because he’s had so many successes in his life"
2,"Thank you for sharing your stories over here. The last few months have been terrible for me. Knowing that other people are struggling through something similar gives me a strange sense of community, a result of our tribalistic mindset perhaps."
2,"Okay my question might be a little hard to explain, but basically I’m extremely self aware of my ptsd and anytime I have an intrusive thought I immediately recognize it and I sort of split that thought off from myself. In a way I feel like this creates two very different ways of thinking in my mind because there’s my PTSD brain that gives me reminders of my trauma & then there’s what I call my normal brain, which I feel is my regular self. Does this happen to anyone else? PTSD for me really just feels like it’s an intruder trying to get me to feel bad about things I had no control over."
2,I've never had many friends. Just one or two friends who I am losing because of my fight with my trauma and insecurity. I used to trust them enough to confide my problems (not all). They've become judgemental and easily irritable. I do not talk to them everyday but whenever I do they make me feel like a burden. It's come to a point where we have stopped talking. I feel absolutely alone with no one to turn to.

2,"When I was a kid I had no memory of my childhood before the age of 5 but I was riddled with anxiety and nightmares of events I had no idea about. I had no recollection of what happened in those early years and nobody in my life would tell me until earlier this year when I finally reconnected with my half sister who proceeded to recount all of those events, and having the blanks filled in finally was both enlightening and terrifying. It’s scary that such a important moment of my life just got erased like that. Did anyone else have this happen to them?"

2,"Called it quits today with someone who works with me to try and find, well, work. I live alone and am only able to afford this because of receiving some type of disability. Started drinking again so that the bad thoughts stop since meds never help and just make me gain weight when I'm already huge and disgusting and I can hardly afford them. Not looking forward to therapy tomorrow.

I'm avoiding certain people so that I don't have to answer any more of their questions, as I never know how to respond, their questions frustrate me, and because I just give up for now. Maybe forever. I'm not open to talking to anyone about this in depth because no one understands, or it's not their problem. I feel guilty trying to talk to them when they're busy/already stressed with their own problems. Most of all, ultimately, I feel like no one actually cares about me that much. That could very well be false, but it's just how I feel, especially when I get like this, and no one's here.

Then again, I pretend to be okay, and like I said, I avoid talking about it. However, it's hard to open up when you feel this way. And any comfort received will feel superficial. I'll also feel pathetic since I feel like they're pitying me and that makes me even less open to talking about this to anyone."
2,"I am overwhelmed in the amount of triggering information I got a few days ago. I am not okay. I think I have been stuck in an emotional flashback to a time when I was 7 and I was abused horrifically the entire night. I just found out my sisters are all going through the same thing and my heart just keeps pounding and pounding.

I went to the doctor and he didn't seem to take me seriously. Gave me all of 60 seconds to explain my symptoms. Gave me hydroxyzine, 25mg tablets. They aren't helping.

for some reason, this short interaction has made me incredibly drained and sad. for someone to overcome such tragedy and abuse and still ""get through it"" whereas i can hardly order at starbucks without freaking out is...humiliating. something along those lines. my dads values are along those lines of discipline, that if someone has a mental illness theyre just not trying hard enough to not have it. the type of person who didnt want my sister on medication for depression. somehow so smart, yet so in denial of science, and yet i still care that he would be disappointed if he knew how broken i am from him. i would be seen as lazy and manipulative, just as he saw my sister. i hate this ""suck it up, push through it with discipline"" mindset. its led me to extreme isolation and my mental health issues worsening. im disappointed that there are self help books like this, but then again, i guess anyone can write a book about anything. it doesnt mean its correct just because its in a book.

it also saddens me because its pretty hypocritical for him to advocate for ""mental toughness"" and ""discipline"" when he so often goes against his own values, yet getting angry at others when they dont follow them. im realizing the greatest thing i struggle with is validating my own pain. im so tired."
2,"I recently got out of a very difficult relationship after 10 years being together. My ex boyfriend had been cheating, emotionally and physically, for more than half of the relationship. And as you can imagine, the relationship itself was full of Gaslighting, manipulation, lying, etc. In addition to the cheating. 

Since I got to know about the years of cheating. I've not reacted in the way I expected to. There's been very little crying, feelings of hurt etc. It almost feels like I'm watching from afar as this trauma unfolds in someone else's life. 

That being said, I'm also unable to come to terms with the end of the relationship. It almost feels wrong and that I'm clinging onto some lost sense of hope of us being together. I'm not sure what this feeling is. 

Can you pls help me unpack these feelings? I've been doing some research and I'm not sure if this qualifies as a trauma bond/PTSD/anything else."

I was thinking about this incident, and I remembered that for quite awhile afterwards, the whole world would shake and I’d loose my balance.  I know realize this was the result of a concussion. 

The long-lasting effects of a concussion?  Irritability, concentration and memory problems, and depression. 

So combine those with the anxiety that comes from my job, and it sets me up for all kinds of fun. After periods of prolonged stress, the part of my brain that can regulate my irritability starts to get overwhelmed and it fails.

2,"I'm new to accepting I have C-PTSD and identifying/making connections around flashbacks.

Does anyone else ever have emotional flashbacks triggered by boredom?

I have ADHD but I also realize some of my ADHD symptoms are actually trauma symptoms.

However...

 I've noticed sometimes I feel antsy in an annoying sort of way that tends to stem from ADHD. It's irritating to be bored but I can laugh about it.

And other times, like if I don't take a walk on my lunch break (I'm an admin assistant and spend a lot of time at my desk) or do tasks that require getting up throughout the day (like making copies or filing)... by the afternoon I start to get those ""I wish I could die"" type thoughts and dissociated feeling like I do in a flashback. 

I'm wondering if it could be because I associate boredom and having to sit still even though it's not what I need with being trapped?

A decent part of my cptsd comes from religious trauma (and I'm a part of that subreddit too). I spent a lot of time since childhood stuck sitting in services or youth/college groups, forced to be there by either my parents or my own gaslighting of myself, having horrible, scary, and/or toxic  teachings forced down my throat, often by people I have what seems like an unreasonable hatred for today. Teachings that have really messed up my self esteem and relationship with my body, esp being a woman.

I'm not sure if I provided enough (or too many) details. Does anyone else get triggered this way?"
2,"I'm perfectly aware of what happened to me and I remember every detail. I've never repressed it, I've never been hypersexual, I've never had any symptoms that other people had after similar experiences. It's almost as if I didn't find my past traumatizing. I don't feel anything when I think about it, I don't hate the person who did it to me. I don't feel scared or angry or hopeless or disgusted with myself. I'm wondering whether it makes me sick or it's just a part of the process."
2,"I still get dysregulated.  But for three or four weeks I have felt good. I have encountered a few major triggers and haven’t frozen or dissociated. Been in some minor and major arguments and haven’t frozen and have been able to think and find my words.

Of course I do get triggered and can have a morning into the evening disrupted. But I’m able to function and think and feel. There is not much escalation beyond my body clenching up. I don’t rabbit hole into shame or fear. I’m not devolving into a depression nest or feeling like I’m going to die.

The loud neighbors don’t bother me as much. And I don’t think I’m dissociated. 

I’ll have to see if this continues into the holidays as that’s when I seem to get the most wired.
Heck my mom doesn’t invite me to holidays anymore  and I’m not triggered by it. (She likes to try to punish me for not wanting to be around my abuser). Maybe a little sad but it’s so much better that having to fight about my feelings.

I learned about cptsd around this time last year. And have had two therapists since. I’ve almost come to terms with my ex best friend. The social trauma of that has calmed and it still bugs me but it’s better. I’m planning to get rid of the last thing of hers some time this summer. Through fire! Ritualistic burning of my journal depicting her stuff and my own trauma reactions. 

I’ve come to terms with my first ex and his stuff. And I have a better understanding of my abuse and the home life before that. I maintain my boundaries for the sake of my inner child. She will never be put in harms way again.

I can call for my job. Sometimes I may have to breath and recover after but I can do it. I can just hang up on people. Telemarketers and rude insurance reps. Boom no longer letting them rule my life because I have to be polite and not hurt their feelings.

Still have dark intrusive thoughts but that’s usually a flash back and my grounding methods are helping.

I’m not healed and it’s still early, but these all mark recovery to me! Only time will tell. I think I’m just writing this to say Thankyou to the community! Reading your stories and just the general support helped me get here. I’ll probably move my activity more to CPTSDnextsteps as I don’t think I’m helping much here anymore.

I hope everyone can continue their healing journey, and I’m just putting good energy out there for y’all. You deserve to be human! You deserve to live a life in the way you need, and to love freely!"
2,"I had a moment of clarity earlier, while experiencing an emotional flashback. I was feeling that helplessness from when my dad was angry at my mom for a decision she made in parenting. She was letting me off easy on some homework that didn’t matter (an art project), and my dad was pissed and making it into a big deal. Because the whole situation was about *my* art project, I felt like it was my fault that my dad was angry, and I felt so helpless to stop it. That outburst is the only time I ever remember my dad getting physically abusive. Toward the end of the fight, he shoved my mom and then he walked out the door to go for a walk. 

So here I am, almost 20 years later, and sometimes I still get triggered back to those feelings. Even though I can objectively see the scenario and how the only person at fault was my dad (being a total asshole), I still *feel* down deep that it was my fault. 😕"
2,"This was mostly when I was younger. I remember imagining the lives of my peers. A healthy family, good friends, etc. I would pretend I was living through them and I basically assumed their lives were perfect. Was I just that weird of a kid or was this a coping mechanism for anyone else?"
2,"I haven't seen my out-of-state family for about a year and a half now because of COVID. We are all finally vaccinated (them before me, I still have a little bit of time) and making plans to see each other. I'm generally looking forward to seeing them because it's been so long but there is deep grief and fear surfacing that I'm about to put my healing to the test and might not be ready. 

My sister, who is the source of much of my childhood pain, has been really pressuring me about when I will visit because she had a baby during the pandemic that I have not met yet. Keep in mind I'm still squaring the fact that someone who made my life hell as a child is now a parent... 

I haven't been giving specific dates yet because I want to make it clear I'm not rushing to see them just because she demands it but now the rest of the family is questioning when I will visit and I just don't feel ready.

I'm doing a good job not committing to anything I'm not ready for right now but the questioning about it wears me down and makes me feel like I'm the problem.

Is anyone else experiencing this? How are you coping? I really wish I could feel secure enough in myself to handle a visit but I feel especially tender now that it is in the close future. I want to protect my healing more than anything."
2,"I live in Philadelphia and it's killing me.  I'm going to do what's right for me and find a new, better paying job in a healthier environment where hopefully more folks share my hobbies and values.  This is a big step in my recovery I believe.

So that got me thinking, what are good environments with folks with CPTSD?  I am a nature boy, so my mind automatically wants to move to a cabin a hundred miles away from the nearest town, but the more practical, mature part of me knows that I need access to resources and good people.  The suburbs kinda freak me out because I grew up there and the competitive lifestyle really isolated me.  I found the urban thing to be so rewarding for so long, but people are just dying every single day.  This place is a post industrial hell hole and I gotta get out.  I love to bike, so maybe living in a less toxic City with a good bike culture might be perfect?  I dunno.

What do you think?  Where do you live?  Is it good?  Is it toxic?  What do you like or dislike about it?  What should those of us with really active and aggressive triggers aim for in finding and building a home and community?"
2,"My Therapist and friends are recommending all the time that i should form positive habits, especially taking care of my flat and taking more care of my personal well-being, but all this does, is making me feel left drained and not very positive at all. It's exhausting just to think about it."
2,"I applied for a job and it went well so the recruiter had me take this test called the [Predictive Index](https://www.predictiveindex.com/blog/how-does-the-predictive-index-test-work/) and it consisted of two sections. The first asked me to choose words from a list on how others would describe me and then the next was to choose the words (same list) to describe myself. My results came back the following:

>[Operator](https://www.predictiveindex.com/reference-profile/operator/):  Operators are people you can count on. Patient and conscientious, they're usually among the most cooperative people on any team. Operators will remain stable, thorough, and relaxed in most circumstances.

It had me wondering if this is related to the trauma I have and all the peace keeping I have done to survive... Curious to know what others have gotten if they've taken it."
2,"Every time I have a flashback, I get suddenly and intensely suicidal. I can’t see the point in living at all if all I’m staying alive to do is constantly be reminded of all the horrific things I’ve experienced. And being black in America, I can’t escape racism triggers at all unless I sit in my house and do absolutely nothing. 

Since racism and racist bias and microaggressions are literally everywhere, all the time. I can’t go for a drive without seeing Trump and blue lives matter signs on cars, billboards, people’s houses. Shit I even passed a farm today that had a huge sign of Trump’s name in their crops. 

I can’t go into a diner without having the white waitress give me a weird look, I can’t turn on the TV without being reminded that people like me are automatically so hated we’re excluded from even having a normal amount of black people in a TV show, or they have subtle racist jokes, I can’t even chat with my white friends without them showing some level of white fragility. Or I get gaslighted. I can’t just come home from work without being reminded that I’m different because my white neighbors lock their car doors the minute they hear me get home. I can’t get a tattoo without the tattoo artist going off into some rant victim blaming black people for getting killed by the cops as if I’m gonna agree with him. I can’t go into the comment section of the Chauvin trial without seeing people call him a HERO for killing a black man that did nothing wrong. Or even the folks that probably deep down don’t have bad intentions but are performative and tokenizing. 

I guarantee even sitting here begging for some help on this subreddit, I won’t be able to escape it. 

I literally can’t do anything without it being right in my face, even from people that I love and care about and thought cared about me too. 

This is ON TOP of the horrific things that happened to me when I was little, that I’m also triggered on almost daily. There’s no where I can go where I’m not being reminded that I’m not wanted because of what I was born as, ON TOP of being triggered into remembering all my other biggest traumas from childhood

I just want to feel okay, but it’s like I can’t get away from triggers no matter how hard I try. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m always just “hanging on” but barely even doing that."
2,"I spent a whole day with a psychologist and all that we were able to conclude was I have dependent personality disorder and adhd.

I did a long questionnaire (maybe 250 questions?) and the results inconclusive...apparently my entire world and inner view can literally change by the time I’m asked the same question (worded differently) a little later on.

So on the plus side I don’t have an issue changing my thoughts or beliefs based on new information. Downside I have 0 attachment to my own views...

I am so tired of surviving and having to literally teach myself in order to actually make progress...
Thankfully my psychiatrist diagnosed me with CPTSD so I read some clinical books.

I see a therapist once a week (3 months now). This therapist has over a decade of experience, is trauma specialized. And told me “I don’t know how to treat you.” (Not the first time I heard this.)
I am glad she was honest and is working hard to help me make progress.

I do not have an inner critic. Like at all. I literally push myself to be better and pull myself up instead of down.

I am fully aware of all my major traumas. I can talk in great detail about them. 


I think the problem is I still live with the people who abused me (parents) and when I leave (realistically 3-5 years) I will be in a much better place mentally. 

Also I have saved their actual lives multiple times. And took care of my dad for over a decade by myself. I raised myself, took care of them since I was a child, and they kept me financially dependent on them to keep me from leaving. 


Just want to say shit fucking sucks...But it is what it is. I’m doing my best and that’s all I can ask for. Little by little I am on the road to becoming a better version of myself"
2,Yes I am seeing a therapist and no I’m not going to act on these thoughts. But sometimes I daydream and fantasise on getting revenge or killing people that are abusing others for their own personal gain. I’m finding it really hard to get these thoughts out of my head but I know I’m too empathetic to actually hurt someone.
2,"Each inner layer contributed to the creation of the next outer layer.

* My first inner child was me at toddler age. I felt a prevailing sense of humiliation even then. My parents grabbed me gruffly and screamed while forcing my face to look straight at their terrifyingly angry eyes. I have memories of physically shrinking my body and slinking away quiet, scared and sad. The kind of fear where a cold wave washes over you (the trauma). I'd go to a corner of the house and pee my pants because I was afraid to ask them for help going to the bathroom. They'd do this to me for being too loud, speaking like an ""idiot"", being a crybaby. My trauma response was fawn to my parents and all adults.

* My second inner child is my primary school self. I had no shred of self-esteem and lived in a haze of humiliation. My parents were malicious with their comments and followed up with hour-long beating episodes (the trauma). They were paranoid every little thing I did meant I'd become a delinquent etc. etc. and violently stopped literally anything I tried or did until I did nothing. The cold-wave fear of being beat loomed over my head all the time. Looking back, most of my behaviors were normal for kids. It would be concerning if I *didn't* do those things. Bonus: My parents would say I need to be ""tough"", ""smart"", ""popular"" to be a worthy person, then they'd strip me of any dignity, so I felt like they didn't think I was none of those things (and therefore that I wasn't). I felt ashamed trying to curry approval from them, so I'd go to school trying to convince kids I was tough, smart, popular and get them to tell me I really was all that. 

* My ""last"" inner child was my middle school and high school self that lived in a state of perceived social rejection (the trauma). I couldn't connect with my peers because I was horribly insecure and used all social interaction as a way to flex on others to feel good about myself (characteristic of people who feel a strong sense of humiliation). My trauma response was fight at this time. I had to control people into giving me validation and if they didn't, I exploded. I had a strangely strong need to try forcing the reality I wanted to believe myself onto others for validation. People brushed me off and it was painful. My peers were my last resort at getting love and I thought I had to ""prove"" how awesome I was to get it. When I failed, I hit rock bottom and forced myself to fold into a pretzel as my second effort to get love. To my present day self, I ""am"" this kid back then who couldn't level with others. Who was weird. Who no one wanted to be around. Who has control issues.  

* My present day self has issues with freeze and fawn response (people pleasing and approval-seeking).

How far back am I supposed to go? If I ""am"" my last inner child, how do I keep unraveling that? God, at least if you're going to give me a puzzle of trauma, give me the brainpower to solve it."
2,"I'm dating someone I love and we're starting to build a life together. 
At the moment we aren't living in the same place so we rely heavily on texting to stay in touch. 

They love words of affirmation. They like compliments and hearing what and when I'm thinking about them. I'm mistrustful of words and I look primarily to action to see the truth of a situation. 

I have noticed that every time that our texts turn in any way physically intimate / sexual in nature, I feel ill. 

I find it so cringey and upsetting. I freeze up. I can't reciprocate. I get immediately suspicious and just want it to be over. I get this urge to crawl out of my skin and leave my body entirely. 

I've told them about it and they've stopped bringing it up, and/if they bring up something mild then they don't expect me to reciprocate at all. 

I really appreciate all this, but I don't know what to do and how to/ if to get past this. I don't know if I should just accept this about myself or if I should actively be working to retrain my brain. 

Does anyone else relate?"
2,"This is more of a lighthearted subject for this subreddit. With the pollen count so high, my allergies have my eyes burning and I can’t stop sneezing. I started taking some Benadryl to get rid of the symptoms. Well, uh-oh! Turns out drowsiness is a side effect in both medications, and I can’t seem to stay awake after taking them both in the morning. Oopsie! Gotta get some non-drowsy Claritin instead, since I don’t normally take Benadryl for my allergies. Haha! Time to chug some green tea."
2,"Due to childhood trauma I literally can’t upset people. I was taught that everything was my fault and that I was responsible for my parents moods etc. 

So If I get the tiniest whisp of a hint that someone is upset with me I feel sick to my stomach with guilt. I just can’t cope with it. 

Because of all of this I’m constantly told that I’m ‘such a nice guy’, but to be honest it never gets me anywhere except a bunch of responsibilities and co-dependant relationships. 

I wish I could learn to put some of my own needs first. I don’t mean going too far the opposite and becoming “a nice guy” selfish type. But I wish I could stand up for myself. Just a little."
2,"My current boss is nightmare incarnate, down to shoving blame onto others and stealing credit. I need a new job, because day by day this is wearing me down to a shell.

However, looking for one has resulted in frequent panic attacks, breaking down into tears, and put me in a constant state of hyper vigilant fear. I’m trying to find a situation to improve my mental health, but all it seems to be doing is making it actively worse. Interviews where I feel I’m judged for everything, unfair deadlines they refuse to negotiate, a crippling fear of both change and failure... I don’t know how to do this.

Is this just me? How does anyone deal with this?"
2,"(Prompted by [u/Flaky\_Web\_2439](https://www.reddit.com/user/Flaky_Web_2439/) 's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/mk0cjy/ask_a_stupid_question_get_a_stupid_answer/)  “Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer”)

You know, that 'default' insult that was likely passed down from earlier generations. Said in a dismissively snarky or sarcastic tone that was completely inappropriate in a parent-child relationship.

For me, it was ""Don't be ridiculous."" Not helpful for a kid who took everything literally, seriously, and personally."
2,"Hello everyone. I recently came across the concept of using certain objects as an ""anchor"" to the present, a reminder to stay in the here and now. I don't have many interesting or meaningful objects where I currently live, so I was thinking of printing an old picture of me and a close friend of mine and keep that as an anchor. It has a soothing effect on me as it reminds me of a person who means a lot to me. But I was wondering, since the picture is 10+ years old, does this defy the concept of staying in the present? Should I opt for more ""neutral"" objects, but from the present time, or it really doesn't matter as long as I have a physical object to focus on?
Thank you for reading, I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions on this."
2,How do I “come out” about CPTSD? I’ve had a really difficult time opening up about it as an early 20 something and wanted to ask what you guys’ experience is
2,"As some background, my dad has been sick my entire life, he has a disease that just grows cancer pretty non-stop. I have a weird relationship (if you can call it that) with my dad because of this. When he was home he would often backup my moms abuse, doing things like coming into my room after she beat me and telling me to go apologize to her because I made her feel bad. He was also physically abusive in his own right like throwing me into the pool in December (in southern CA but still) when I was only wearing a sleep shirt and then just locking me out of the house for the night. 

A few therapists have commented that, even with the abuse, I put him on a pedestal because of his illness and the fact that I was trained to always expect him to die within soon, and this went on my entire life. Don't get me wrong, he taught me how to ride a bike and one year he left the hospital on October 31st and went straight to the Halloween Carnival at my school. He wasn't always bad but then again, neither was my mom. 

Anyway, I cut contact with my mom on Valentine's Day in 2020 after she lied to me that my dads procedure had gone well and that he would be heading home that day. When I finally found out he had been bleeding internally and went through 2 exploratory surgeries, I lost my shit on her and she tried to blame me for not being a good enough daughter to be informed of my dads medical emergency. I told her I was done and haven't talked to her since outside of a single letter.

In 2018 my dad had his worst bought of hospitalizations and ended up in the ICU for 6 months after a ground-breaking new surgery at a special symposium left part of his intestines' necrotic. He spent close to a year in the hospital and he came out in bad shape, constantly in pain and actually taking the prescribed pain meds that for the past 30+ years he never touched. He's on a feeding tube and gets multiple IVs a day to get his medication and fluids; it isn't a great existence. 

He ended up going out and getting Covid, I'm almost certain purposefully as some sort of assisted suicide but he had no symptoms and they didn't tell me my mom was sick until her oxygen was at 80% (thus the one letter I wrote). Anyway, I've been more distant with my dad than usual over this because it was so negligent. 

Last night out of nowhere I get a text giving me a schedule of upcoming doctor visits and procedures. None of them were routine but I played dumb and asked if they were simply to manage pain. He responded by telling me he's been having a lot of trouble breathing, he's been in more pain than usual, he's been getting transfusions because of bleeding they can't find, and they're pretty sure the cancer is back. He ended it with ""Nothing is ever just easy. Sorry .""

That sent me spiraling, both the information and the blasé way he shared the information. Whenever I react to shit like this my family calls me a crybaby and over emotional because it 'isn't that big of a deal'. Ignoring the fact that he has next to no GI tract left, he is a medical fucking marvel and has been written about in a few medical papers over it so cancer is a bigger fucking deal than last time. 

I didn't feed into it and just said: I'm so sorry, thank you for letting me know. Please keep me up to date. I figured a diplomatic response would be the answer but instead he told me more serious and life threatening medical issues he's facing and followed it up with: Love you kiddo and sleep well. ♥️ Hi to \[my husband\]!

They make me feel crazy. It's a big deal but it's juxtaposed against smiley faces and heart emoji's. I have to keep reminding myself that they aren't normal so I don't spiral further than I already have. I don't want my dad to die but sometimes..."
2,"Hello,

I don't think I'm really asking anything in particular. Just wondering what other people's experiences are. 

I started EMDR at the end of February and I worry I've been underperforming at work. Does anyone else worry they're not doing a good job? I feel like I'm always making small mistakes or misunderstanding things, not being fast enough. I work 2 PT jobs but I often feel too guilty to count all my hours in one because I think I could have done the work faster. So if I do a 7 hour day, I count just five hours for example. 

In one job, my work is all online and remote, in fact my conversations with my new boss are all email. They're very understanding and never put me down for any mistakes but I can't help but feel I'm more of a burden than asset because of my questions and mistakes. 

I'm also just really very tired and have trouble focusing sometimes. I haven't told my email-only new boss because I don't want it to sound like I'm making an excuse. And it's also the only relationship I have right now where my recent healing journey is a total secret. I'm  torn between  wanting to share and wanting to pretend I'm 100% okay. Meanwhile with my other job, my boss/mentor knows what's going on but they want me to be 'okay'... It come from good intensions but there's definitely a pressure to be okay and happy. It's come to this point where I'm muting the call because a word I've read in the report we're reviewing me has triggered me and I'm crying."
2,"I've struggled to talk to anyone about this topic because I feel like a big part of me thinks I sound rude and think I deserve special treatment or something. But I feel like this community will be able to understand what I mean.

I've stopped talking to friends about my problems because I feel like my problems are so much worse than theirs and they never have an easy answer so all I get is pity. I struggle listening to other people's problems because they seem so incredibly simple to me. I am never rude or will belittle their issues, but I struggle to relate when someone says ''I'm so angry at my dad, he keeps making broccoli for dinner even though he knows I hate it'' because I've had to make my own meals for myself and my siblings for years because my narc mom didn't care. 

I feel like everyone else's issues have a clear solution whilst mine are just the effect of 20 years of abuse and cannot be ''fixed'' only slightly dealtt with through years of therapy. I cannot share how I haven't been happy in more than 10 years and I cry almost every day with someone who's biggest problem is ''getting nervous about exams''. 

I want to be supportive and I want to be able to share my problems with friends but I just know they won't be able to help so what's the point? I don't want pity.

I feel like an awful person but I can't help feeling this way constantly, like I know there are people in the world who have it worse than me but I feel like everyone around me has easier problems than me and I cannot share anything.

Am I a horrible person? Am I exaggerating and making things about me? (This is something I was told a lot by my abusive parents growing up)

Am I alone in this? I just don't know anymore."
2,"I really was doubting whether or not i was really being abused even though I knew i was until last night when it got confirmed once again

I just don't know what to do, they act like nothing happened and I'm feeling even more suicidal

I can't find anything to distract myself

I'm seeing my therapist in a bit and i really want to tell her about my suicide attempts but i can't mention this and i don't want to keep living with them like this either"
2,"As I was waking up today I felt a pain in my chest, and it occurred to me, I’ve always felt this pain. My entire life. As a child, as a teenager, as an adult. On top of the deprivation and neglect, I had this realization that I’ve been grieving the metaphorical death of my parents for the past 5 years and it isn’t fair.

5 years ago they bought tombstones for themselves and in the past 5 years they’ve only called me and never visited me. Every time we talk, the topic of their death comes up. It’s always talking about their deaths and regrets and they refuse to just live. They refuse to believe things can change. It forced me to want to rush milestones in my life so that they could experience it. I tried to rush getting married and having a kid but then realized deep down, I’m doing it because I feel responsible for their choices and I’m still trying to create this happy life and family that we’ve never had.

It all feels like a messed up joke. They ruined my childhood which was filled with neglect and abuse. And I still want to please them and now it’s just death plaguing every single interaction. And it makes me so angry. Even as an adult, they can’t even spare my emotions and want to make me feel bad. Bad that it was my fault that as a child, I didn’t talk to them often enough. Always reminding me about death around the corner. 

They never gave me any meaning or plan for life. My purpose, as they’ve beat into me, was to take care of them when they’re older. So they deprived me of all experiences they believe would not make me successful. I was locked in the house for a decade and every summer, I’d sit at home alone while I knew my friends were outside having fun. I’d be screamed at for doing poorly in school and when I would ask them if they could get me to a doctor because I think something is wrong with my head because I’m struggling academically, they’d scream at me that if there’s something wrong with my head that I should just drop out of school. An impossible double bind because they expected me to finish school and take care of them. 

Now I’m an adult and they realize that their neglect and abuse has caused me to not care about them. I don’t even care about myself either. And I don’t have the luxury of death being right around the corner. If I live til 100, I get to live with this for the next 75 years. It feels like one big and cruel joke."
2,"So I was seeing a therapist every 3 weeks for over a year. I needed a piece of paperwork to try  for disability from her. At the bottom of this paper it said ""ADHD anxiety depression and c-ptsd?"" What does the question mark mean at the end? The adhd and other stuff I knew I had. I wasn't able to stay in therapy long enough after to ask. I can tell I do have some form of ptsd"
2,"I know probably no one will really read this, and that's okay, I'm just I'm sorry. I just maybe need some support rn because I'm so tired of being broken down all over again and it's all because of me. I just ended another therapy relationship, the one before that really didn't end well and I'm still struggling to heal from it and the one now, after everything that happened with the last one, and money issues I just couldn't go on with it, I told her beforehand that I'm not coming and we knew it meant goodbye and I've been crying about it for the last few days on and off between work, school and general house chores. I just got a text from her, today was our last appointment and she left me the option to come or not, I'm not gonna pay to say what I already said and hear what I already heard so I didn't go, she sent me a text thanking me for putting my trust in her and still trying, and that this is goodbye. It's all my fault, I know it is, I know I chose to end it and all the reasons behind it still stand but it really is all my fault, and everything that happened with the last t, and he was nice too but still I am so so hurt, I'm tired of myself, I'm tired of not healing, I'm tired of being blamed for my suffering and just go to therapy and just why are you so suicidal, so unstable, as if this pain I'm carrying is nothing but air, so why aren't you normal yet?? And I'm tired of having no memories at all and the depersonalisation that makes me want to slit my wrists almost on the daily just because it's too much, and I'm tired of being hurt by people who claim they just want to help and I'm tired of supporting myself and having no one in my life who can understand and code switch just so I can function, and failing to kill myself because I actually maybe care about myself and think I deserve so much more and can offer so much but also know I have no why of achieving it and why do I still get hurt by those people and systems, the only conclusion I can draw is that it's me and it's my fault but I can't fix it, and please please please I tried killing myself so many times these past two years but I keep actively or passively (by dissociation) stop it, so now according to my psychiatrist and the way doctors and therapists look at me I'm just unstable, insane, maybe I'm (god forbid /s) borderline. I'm just so tired of fighting this world.


I'm so sorry I'm sorry"
2,"I can be having a day not feeling ill - which I often do with panic and anxiety but even on my relatively chill days stepping in the shower or getting into bed or being woken up by my very kind, quiet cat, makes me jump so much I feel like being sick and it’s such a sudden shock. 

Does anyone else have experience with this and can anyone think of why this might be? I know it must have something to do with fight/flight and “vulnerability” but I can’t think of anything more specific."

2,"I'm turning 23 this week, and have decided to buy myself flowers, took a step further and customized it!

This whole self appreciation thing seems too foreign for someone from my household - I can count by one hand the number of times we'd get 'gifts' from either one of our parents or the times we'd see them gift each other. Only time we'd get them were when we excelled academically, which didn't happen often btw (My siblings and I were well above average, just not by the standards of our Asian parents). Interestingly, in some occasions we would be asked about what we'd want, but get something completely different?? 

One time, my dad gifted me a set of books he chose and decided to add a personalized note, writing about how proud he was of me and how much he 'loved' me. Later that day, I walked into his room and found the exaact same set of books with the same note. Turns out he borrowed a friend's gift to his daughter, and copied out everything word for word bc he couldn't really bother coming up with anything himself. I didn't feel anything at the time, probably because it was the first time I felt 'appreciated'. Now I'm just mad, and it adds to the resentment I already have for him. 

Idk if this is an unpopular opinion, but I've started expressing to people beforehand about what I'd like to be gifted with, and if I got something I couldn't use/wear, I'd donate it. My family does give me shiiiiit for it lol"
2,"I’m looking for advice dealing with sleep avoidance due to severe night terrors, panic attacks during sleep, and nightly sleep paralysis. I practice good sleep hygiene...and am able to maintain a good sleep schedule for a week or two at a time, but when I sleep at night the night terrors get worse and escalate until my anxiety about sleeping doesn’t let me sleep while it’s still dark out.

Any advice on:

Dealing with night terrors (I’ve been on prazosin and it did nothing, I’m on meds that help mitigate physical symptoms of anxiety and panic, but they have failed to reduce symptoms in my sleep) I have them whenever I sleep and I keep all my senses in them. Any tips that help reduce how often they occur would be amazing. Any tips on decreasing the number of dreams I have about rape or assaults...I’ve had the night terrors for basically my entire life...and have gotten used to a lot of the content...but reliving...what my parents did...it’s a lot...just figuring out how to shift them...from the most traumatic of content would be hugely beneficial. (please no recommendations on lucid dreaming...I tried for several years...and it’s not something I can do.) 

Dealing with the aftermath of night terrors (the wake up part and calming down...I’m really stuck on how to do this at night especially...I wake up screaming or crying and shaking...and I...really just don’t want to go back to sleep because they start up again...whenever I sleep. Tips for calming down and feeling safe would be amazing.

Dealing with sleep anxiety (calming down before bed, putting paranoia to rest, dealing with anxiety brought on by it being night, things beyond the general advice (journal, to-do-list, mindfulness) especially.

Any tips, or descriptions of what’s worked for you would be really useful. I’ve done a lot of research and tried a lot of things but nothing I’ve done has really improved things.

Thanks in advance!"
2,"I'm experiencing this sooo hard right now. I really, really have to study but no matter how hard I try I can't force myself, it's almost like there's something invisible stopping me. 


Studying generally triggers me into flight or freeze and it doesn't help that my teacher is an unpedagogical, unreasonable ass hat that expect us to understand things on our own and sets too high expectations of us. Another reason is probably that my life depends on me studying right now because if I didn't I would be homeless without any money...
There's just so much toxic shame and panic buried within this."
2,"Hello everyone I opened Reddit lately and after a long time and I saw this subreddit that I used to scroll through regularly half a year ago. Lately my life has changed a lot I went through some pretty harsh bullying in school years back with a lot of physical abuse, everyday I would go to school get beat up and back home to play video games and the same loop everyday my parents didn't give a flying fuck, so I was 17 with a lot of problems, anxiety and depression and I read somewhere that difficulties help the mind like excercise the body, I was near suicide at that period so I just told my father I will be back in 5 days as usual he didn't care so I took my motorcycle and went to the nearby town without knowing anyone there I slept in park benches and in apartment building basements I saw many different people and even started talking to girls in the street something I never imagined you could even do and after the 5 days I came back home took a shower and left again doing the same thing just better this time I made friends and a friend group let me stay In an old house we used as a place to hang out and with literally nothing I was happy, really happy and I realised something my personality changed a lot in these days I became psychologically stable and I had either happiness or felt content because I didn't really had or still have any needs expect cigarettes and tobacco, now I'm back home I made my basement my living space and I live here now with 2 chairs 1 table  and 1 bed and I'm content with that I work small jobs father some money that it takes me months to spent because of how cheap I live and I go riding with my motorcycle around Greece the  towns and villages near me now but Im expecting the lockdown to end so I can travel to many places, that is my life story and my advice would be to see the world,get through hardships in life because if you don't face your fears they will find you at home"
2,"Four years ago I was diagnosed with complex PTSD and major depression, panic disorder and some general unhealthy social behaviors. I put in the work and my life changed so much for the better. 

Much to my surprise, my traumas were recently triggered and now I'm a full blown mess. I don't know how I didn't realize it could all be triggered alas here I am. 

I've luckily gotten en queue to meet with a new psychologist, alas it is starting over from the beginning (I am living in a different city than my old counselor). 

With my past, including interactions with medical professionals, I am very generally skeptical. I'm also not sure what to expect from counseling with a psychologist (before it was just a mental health counselor). 

Any advice on what to expect from my first few sessions? Any red flags or green lights to look for or seek out? 

The traumas are extremely complex and I just don't believe I have much of anything left inside of me at this point... Meaning pretty much a full mental and nervous breakdown, constant panic attacks, it's a miracle I am going to work and keeping that steady though I'm extremely hypervigilant so it's not easy. Anyways it's all to say I don't know what my options are to work thru this with the new psychologist but I don't wanna do a story time where I run thru everything that's horrible and happened to me because I don't have anything left in me to traumatize myself further. Does that make sense? Any advice here on helpful approaches to talk with him about or things to look for?"
2,"For awhile now I have been trying to find answers. Why was it that I use to be great at school, and now I instantly cry at the thought of homework? My memory use to be great, and now I barely remember what I did earlier today. I feel so spacey so often, so many hours of my day is wasted on who knows what. I get anxious over watching a movie that I don’t know the ending too. Every day is a constant feeling of dread under my skin, but for no reason whatsoever. 

I am happy that I have supportive people in my life. I have spent so many years in therapy trying to find answers to my life. But what I discovered was that trauma didn’t just affect one part of me, it affected all of me. My anxiety has gotten to the point that it triggers asthma attacks, my allergies / breathing issues have gotten worse too. My body aches everyday, it’s like I’ve been carrying too much weight for too long. Im tired everyday, no matter how much I sleep. I thought my trauma was something that could be buried away, that it wouldn’t affect me after all these years. I had even forgotten a lot of what happened, but my body never forgot. It never did. 

Finally I am starting to listen to my body, to understand. So many times I am mad at myself, why cant I just function like everyone else? But there is a reason. Its crazy how it took me this long to realize how deep it affected me, to think that it exaggerated so many other health issues in my life but I was too blind to see the elephant in the room."
2,"BIG BIG BIG TRIGGER WARNING: SU!CIDE. 



An old acquaintance of mine took their own life. They seemed so happy and had such a big friend group. I never ever could have guessed. 
I am so so shocked & scared.

If it could be him, it could be anybody ever. 
I’m scared if it could happen to someone like him it could happen to me. 
I would never ever want it to get that way, what do I do?"
2,"I have found this extremely useful with getting my life back from an extremely dark place. I hope this can help someone. 

* Stop seeing people who caused you trauma and or trigger more flashbacks while you work to heal. For me, this meant stopping seeing my family and it was really hard to do. 

* Come to a realisation about who you are. You need to accept the bad and how it has shaped you. There is good in who are are. Consider taking the Myers briggs personality test and printing out the good things about your personality. Also research how trauma can effect your personality type. The information is out there.

* Knowing what happened to you and how it shaped you is very important. It can help you stop focusing on the bad and your trauma. Find out what happened and how you were effected. Knowing and accepting what happened and how it effected you can help you move forward. 


* Setup a vision board. Buy a cork board. Setup your goals for the next 5 years and your short term focus. Setup your budget. Research and write a list of activities that you would like to do - Eg, specific places you would like to visit in your area. Find some truths that really hit home with you. One for me was: “Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die” Print it all out and put it on your vision board.

* Read Pete walker from surviving to thriving and the body keeps the score. Check out neuroscientist scientists Andrew huberman podcasts or YouTube. I learnt from Andrew useful insights regarding habit forming and insights into the mindset of highly successful people.

* Fight against the victim mindset. It’s an easy trap you can fall into. I struggle with it myself because hell, most of us are victims of horrible trauma. But the victim mindset places the responsibility for your happiness and progress elsewhere. It’s a dangerous trap that can hurt your progress. The mindset I want to strive for is a nobody can hurt me mindset. 

* Microdosing shrooms. This helped me due to anti depressants robbing me of almost all feelings. Shrooms helped me feel again amongst other things such as feeling of well-being and increased energy. I’m not recommending this for everyone but it did help me.

* Reconnect to body, listen to it. Exercise more and make diet changes. Consider cutting caffeine and reducing sugar.

* Reconnect with feelings and trauma that is being suppressed. Accept your feelings and process the trauma. Easier said then done I know. It’s likely the toughest thing on this list by far. Microdosing helped me with this a lot. EMDR and other methods may help others. 

* Reduce weed, alcohol and anti depressants. I personally find it all helps suppress feelings and sometimes can reduce motivation. Weed is a bit different sometimes but ultimately I don’t think it’s very healthy for the mind unless it’s CBD based. Please don’t reduce anti depressants until you are ready, and see a doc first."
2,"It was a hectic week last week, with both good and bad moments. 

Today I'm taking a me-day. I dont have anything planned or anything to do. So I can relax... Or can I?

I've been struggling a lot with body image/self image lately. I have this image in my head that i have to look a certain way to be attractive (thanks media) and so I try to work out, eat healthy and lose some weight. But this is hard since my body is still so exhausted and working out makes me feel even more fatigued. I also crave more unhealthy foods whenever I feel so down. 

I've had a long history with eating and exercising struggles and I tend to become overly obsessive with them because they give me a sense of control and make me feel more worthy as a person. But the last year or 2 ive been pushing my body beyond its limits and now often have little aches and pains. A lot of my muscles have been cramped up for that same time so that makes exercising even more difficult because I cant do the motions properly and my breathing is very shallow because of it.

Long story short: I can't work out and eat as healthy as I  think I have to. So here I am. On my bed, exhausted. Beating myself up because today it just aint it. I know resting and gentleness is all I need today and maybe also tomorrow and the day after, but the critical voices in my head keep telling me that I should work out and that I am worthless now. Which makes me even more exhausted. I tried a little exercise but I almost broke down crying so I stopped. 

But I just feel like Im never good enough just the way I am. I am overly critical on the way I look and I cant imagine that anyone would want to date me. Even though other people always tell me the exact opposite and I rationally know I am decent and there is nothing wrong with me. Uhg.

I needed to get this out. Dont know if others can relate. Thanks for reading."

I've recently found myself in a situation that I'll try to describe as an example of what I perceive as different parts but I'm not sure of I fully understand the concept of parts and how to interpret and apply them.   


So, about a couple of months ago I was dumped by my then partner of almost 2 years. We had a really good relationship and I definitely saw a future with her but things didn't work out. I've had a bunch of more or less serious relationships in the past and I think my attachment is somewhere in between anxious preoccupied and fearful avoidant.  
   
At first I was devastated, of course, but found myself to get back on my feet pretty quickly. A couple of weeks ago I met this girl who's a friend of friend and I felt like we where checking each other out, since then we've met each other maybe 3 times and talked for a bit, every time with a small group of other friends around (Covid-safe of course!)

This is where I'm starting to have pretty mixed, confusing and ambivalent feelings at the same time and I'm wondering if it's different, fragmentet parts of me that makes me feel so emotionally confused or if this is what a ""normal"" non-traumatized and dissociated person would feel as well. 

  
\- One part of me seems to get into this obsessive kind of mode, where I think about her a lot and finding myself augmenting the situation and my feelings for her even though I barely know her. I would suspect that this could be a child part that's **desperate to attach** to someone in order to not feel lonely and abandoned and to feel cared for and appreciated. This part is a strong one.   


\- One part of me feels kind of depressed and hopeless, like what's the point? I'm just tired of relationships failing and people leaving like nothing ever mattered, and why should I even care about this girl, she's probably not worth it and will end up disappearing any way.   


\- One part of me just feels avoidant, anxious and a bit angry, like I want to avoid her or ever hanging out with her again.   


\- One part of me, which I guess is a grown up part, tells me to let it go and take it easy with myself and my own feelings (and hers). This parts also tells me to not engage in any romantic relationships since I really need to work on myself and stay single and heal. I think this parts also tells me that I'm not ready to be dating and should be responsible and force myself to be by myself.  


\- Another part of me, who I also suspect is a grown up one, is generally positive and sees no wrong in getting to know someone and take things easy and see what happens. This parts also thinks that some company would be nice and that if anything would happen between me and this girl, we'll be able to communicate and take things slow and easy. This part is also curious about the person and wants to get to know her and care about her. I believe this part to also hold some kind of self-compassion and is telling me that there's no wrong in wanting to connect to another human being.   


I haven't got it professionally or medically confirmed that I suffer from C-PTSD or structural dissociation even though it seems kind of likely. This is just my random thoughts about myself.   
Does anyone have any insight or wise words to share in this whole mess?"
2,"I just want to learn how to mask my self and stop being a prey for abusers, it is like they can see through me. I don't know if it is my low self esteem, or my quietness that they assume is low self esteem but abusers are usually dumb people that are used to agression, conflicts and loud places and if you don't scream or act like them they for whatever reason start getting agressive and taking out their shit on you, making you physically sick from their mental,psychological,emotional abuse and gaslighting. They are not fucking safe and you live in constant anxiety, never feeling safe for you life because any new potential friend could be your new abuser so you are left like a living corpse, barely living day to day just waiting for the days to pass, living in misery and just wanting to die because no matter how much you hide it is like you have been cursed, it is like you have been marked by other abusers and you don't know why they choose always you and not someone else, the more abuse you experience, the more self hatred, people hatred, self isolation you do. Even though self isolation is not healthy, getting out there, meeting new people hurts extremely more"
2,"For whatever reason it is easy for people to corner me, gang up on me, hate me for no reason and trigger me. This is why I hated group projects ever since I was the age of 12. It seems that everyone else is usually an asshole who can't work in a team and puts all of the responsibility on me. While I have had positive groups where different members take their part, it was usually more rare. I don't know how do I give my self away, is it that clear that I am emotional, am weak due to certain symptoms of ADHD that make me vulnerable, hyper emotional, sensitive to rejection and I am also an ex people pleaser and am codependent. I really really really struggle standing up for my self and putting boundaries. If I don't put a overly serious and cold demeanor people just start taking advantage of me. I don't know how dumb people find each other and start to bully me, but it always happens. I am afraid of going out because of it, because the outside world isn't safe, there is always going to be either a group of 12 year olds who imitate and smirk at me, or a group of drunk men who harass me. I don't know why the abuse doesnt' stop and how this dynamic forms. I don't understand social dynamics well and I don't understand how my friendly kind persona somehow screams - I AM WEAK, COME BULLY ME, I WON'T DEFEND MY SELF ANYWAY, FEEL FREE TO RAPE ME PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

&#x200B;

 I want to understand what gives me away and how to stop this cycle before it even begins. How does befriedning a group of new people somehow transforms into 6 or more people starting to bully me for no reason when they barely know me and I didn't hurt or provoked them, I  have always wondered what makes an easy victim and even read many articles and unfortunetly easy victims are intelligent people like me who are not dumb and agressive and don't scream or fight with other people which people see as - standing up for them selves. Jesus Christ, how can I stop this madness where people out of nowhere who barely know me create group and start bullying. I am tired of this mob mentality because I haven't done anything to deserve behavior where people gaslight me, can't apologize and don't care what they do and want to project their insecurities onto me"
2,"Hey guys 18F here, I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 12 which got corrected to CPTSD at 17. My life has been really rocky. I was born to my crack addict mother, she locked me in a room for days and wouldnt feed me until I stopped crying, she had a gang ready to molly toff the house me and my nana were as a kid (decided against it last minute), at the age of around 4 got taken off me because of crack, abuse and apparantly she tried to drown me. My dad never wanted me,  I loved him and I always tried to live with him but he just simply didnt want me. He wasnt really there but enough to tease me about being in his care. I mostly grew up with my grandma which was good, she spoiled me. Just she was very depressed and her husband (my granddad) and son (my uncle who was really like my brother) both committed suicide and I'd come home from school and she would tell me she tried to drown herself in the lake today. It was all too much. I was quite bullied in school.  By the way I tried to do EDMR therapy and it was working but sadly I couldnt see my psychologist anymore. I'm in a good point in my life now though. I am really happy and finally in a healthy relationship.

But anyways, my point in this other than the vent is that I hate that I cant relate to anyone that I know. I wish I atleast new someone who didnt grow up with their parents, not that I want anyone to go through what I went through but just so I can feel less like a sad story and more like a conversation with someone who has gone through similar things."
3,"i work a restaurant minimum wage job, and it’s been having a strain on my mental health. i feel that i am being taken advantage of and i’m starting to have a hard time controlling my emotions at work. every time i try to talk to my manager about how i feel i’m always shut down with how much more she has to do for the store and how much longer she works. i understand she deals with a lot but i am not a manager and i didn’t sign up to fill in the gaps for everyone else. the worst part is that i’ve began thinking that i can only function at work if i’m on drugs which has led me back to abusing my adhd medication. 
i’m so upset all of the time at my job. i don’t enjoy it at all and i don’t know what to do. i know it’s minimum wage but it’s what’s paying the bills right now and i don’t have a place to go yet. but i don’t even know if it’s my job that’s the issue or if i’m just making it seem worse than it actually is. i’m worried that one day i’m not going to be able to control myself and i’m just going to walk out and regret everything.
it’s so exhausting trying to put on a good face for people that i don’t give a single shit about."
3,"Seriously though? Can someone ever love me in the same way I love them? Or am I just doomed to always be the one in love? Like it's hurtful to realize they just don't feel the same and you have to accept that reality. I don't want to accept that reality because it means that I'm unwanted, unlovable. I don't want to live in that reality because it just fucking sucks. I will always just be some things people lives that they tolerate and get replaced later.

3,"Whenever I split I feel so trapped in each viewpoint that I can be completely aware I will be trapped in the opposing viewpoint in no time but still cannot *feel* any differently in the moment; it’s torture. 

So which do I actually believe? Do I actually love them or hate them? Do I just feel both? Why can’t I see both sides at once? What is the difference between thought and feeling here? What is my true feeling if I can split and feel either/or so intensely?

I hope this post made some sense, I’m so frustrated with this disorder and having trouble understanding myself. I would pay big money for my thoughts and actions to be driven by fact and logic instead of emotion at this point."
3,"Bit of a rant here

Let me start out by saying I'm NOT like this with every guy. This in regards to someone you have an emotional attachment to and feel an attachment hunger for.

Its coming up on a year since my ex broke up with me. He's a PA. He went through my since deleted account after i specifically told him I wasn't comfortable with him looking at all of it. Its my fault for thinking I could trust him in the first place. We had sex and while I was asleep he went through my account. Reading things in regards to BPD I don't even remember writing. 

I had deleted the account after the initial encounter, my reason being if i was so concerned about him finding it I shouldn't have it. Unaware he'd already gone through it.

I've been in non consensual sexual situations. Ive had people I trusted betray me. I've been violated in many ways. This was something I've never experinced before. On a psychological, interpersonal, intellectual...and Idk what all other levels.

I'm so truamatized. Yet part of me still feels desperate for his attention. I wanted a different ending to the story, any ending where I'm not left feeling unwanted and abandoned.

Even worse. I haven't the motivation to go out and meet new people. If anything I'm simply terrified of getting hurt again. I feel abandoned and feeling abandoned makes me feel worthless and feeling worthless makes me feel like I want to act out in self destructive ways. Everytime he ignored me it validated that sense of worthlessness.

I know he never got off his multiple dating apps and had me replaced in a matter of days. I'm still sitting here a year later broken. Trapped in a past that doesn't care about me anymore. Feeling worthless over somebody I dont even want to be with forever, but him discarding me still hurts all the same. 

I want to cry. I feel pathetic. I haven't engaged in self harm since July. Even if I were to give into that urge it wouldn't change anything. Id feel worse, he wouldn't care. I don't think it will come to that. I just hate feeling this way. 

I feel so abandoned and it makes me feel so worthless and theres nothing i can do about it in regards to him. Why does my entire self worth have to revolve around somebody I don't even really like??? Part of me just wanted him to prove me wrong and be nice like he was in the very beginning but that never happened.

Thanks to anyone still reading. I think I just want to feel seen and heard instead of holding all of this in like I have been."
3,"it makes me feel so inadequate, and it makes me have a BPD spiral every-time.... i’ve been cheated on and my ex did things like this and it turns out he cheated on me during the entire relationship.  (Even though my current bf is nothing like my ex, and I know he loves me)

I don’t want to bring it up to him because I don’t want him to know i’m crazy and was stalking but it really bothers me ):"
3,"Dunno if this is how anyone else feels, but I would much rather have depression than euphoria. At least with depression I feel ""attached"" to my thoughts and actions, with euphoria I feel like moving through quicksand trying to connect and feel grounded. Depression is thinking dark thoughts, but euphoria is thinking those same thoughts while staring off into space for hours with a smile on your face. Depression and anxiety is being afraid of intrusive thoughts, euphoria is laughing at them but still believing them to be true. 

It took me years to learn that my body's natural reaction to severe sleep deprivation is a euphoric state, rather than irritable. All it takes for me is less sleep, more sunlight, and too much caffeine and I might as well be high on something. And it's scary as hell to think about the the patterns and decisions we make in our lives without even being aware that there's something not quite right in our brains."
3,I told a friend that I had bpd and explained how I usually automatically put up a personality for everyone for them to like me or like a reflection of that other person’s personality and they called me fake and they haven’t talked to me and wont anymore.
3,"Does anyone else feel like no one will ever love you the way you love them? That you will never find that partner and your life will just be sad? I feel this way and sometimes I feel like there’s no point to anything if that’s the case. Just unmotivated because I don’t have someone to depend and love. Someone that can make me feel loved the way I want to make them feel loved.

It’s sucks that I can’t live properly without that special someone."
3,"Sometimes I read through symptom lists and feel horribly, horribly guilty, to my core, for having BPD (I'm not diagnosed but I have been suspecting it with increasing strength and frequency since 2019.) But then I remember that it's really not my fault in any true way, and was probably due to a duo of abusive, neglectful parents who could NEVER come out of themselves and truly love me. It always feels like something died inside of me because of this semihuman early life. I was on acid a few months ago and realised that this, combined with the fact they don't speak the same native language as me (this is immensely frustrating and actually legitimately damaging to development imo) and vice versa, meant that *there were and are no feedback loops between me and them*. 

I mean, imagine any sensible thing you say being met with a confused face and a ""huh? I don't understand"", or stonewalling as per my dad. I've read studies on how FUCKED UP the latter is, too. 

My point is, it's weird having your emotional life sort of fucking ruined by something adults could have prevented but you personally had 0 control over. I'm rotting in jail, life sentence, for a crime others committed. At least I have the freedom to make my jail comfy. 

Anyway, I feel most at peace when I'm doing random shit around the house and cooking or cleaning. I don't live on a diet of love... just comfort and stability. I feel most at peace when things are nice and calm. 

I think I've realised in the past few weeks that everyone just gotta make do with their psychic construction and it's futile and agonizing trying to aim for perfect psychological health. Why? 

From 14 I knew I had problems with being able to love, and this tortured me for years. But why do I torture myself for something I can barely control, and why do I even want to be able to love in the first place, exactly...? Why? Why do anything? 

I don't want kids. I don't think I'm, at least as of now, capable of romantic love at all. I don't have enough within me for anything more in the long term future probably than friends, a casual bf and a pet. Anything more than that and I'll get real fucking destructive- but this amount of and distance of relationships seems like it will be a possible equilibrium for me.

There is no point trying for further. It's not my fault I have this condition. I value my own peace of mind first and foremost and I disagree with the mainstream pressures to always aim for the theoretical best (because it makes you feel guilt af you're not there or aiming for it) when I have been left emotionally foundationless. 

I feel like I don't owe it to anyone to live my life in such a way that could be looked up to by others, whereas I have felt this pressure in the past. I think there is a quiet virtue in living the best life you can for your circumstances that are out of your control. 

But at the same time I also feel like I'm giving up on life and love and being loved. Like I'll decay if I ignore emotions and relationships and retreat into my own little world. Like it'll feel like escaping reality and living a lie and pretending death isn't real. 

But maybe it's not as hard as I think. Argh... I'll hand it over to my therapist. I have no idea."
3,"I (23F) have a bad habit of blowing up at my BF (25M) we’re long distance and I always will text super fast without thinking during episodes when I’m triggered by something he does. 

Is it as simple as bringing my phone upstairs to my room and leaving it there? Or is there something else I can do also to relax my mind and let the feelings pass so I don’t do any further damage to my relationship? 

It’s to the point where he can’t take my episodes any longer and I feel like I have no self control. 

Therapy hasn’t been helping, and my DBT doesn’t start until next month."
3,"My BPD has been flaring for about a month, and I truly don't understand how my husband could still love me/hasn't left me. I'm not mean to him at all, but I need constant reassurance, and we always are talking about our relationship and my goddamn stupid ~fEeLinGS~. It must be so tiring for my husband and get so old, but he just keeps telling me all day every day that he loves me. I don't understand it, but I am so thankful.

I'll be so happy when I can pull myself out of this spell. It seems to happen spontaneously and resolve in much the same way, so I'm trying to ride it out as best I can. I don't have access to DBT because all the therapists are too expensive. I see one at Catholic Charities who isn't trained in DBT."
3,"So i started a new job this week and so far it's been pretty hard but i'm managing as best i can and my hours are good so i'm keeping positive. But there's this manager at work and she is ALWAYS there during my shifts, I hate her so much. I have no idea why because she is relatively friendly to me, she even trained me. But I hate her and her presence triggers such bad anger and anxiety for me. Why do I feel like this? And also if you ever felt like that, how do you cope with it or what do you tell yourself to make yourself like the person more?"
3,"I know it’s not a healthy mindset but I feel like if I’m not harsh on myself I won’t do what I need to do to help myself make my situation any better. 

I just want to be loved, and validated. 

Everyone who knows this tells me to love myself. 

I don’t know how to do that. I try to do what’s good for me, cut out what’s bad for me, look after myself, don’t let people mistreat me. I feel better about myself. But inside me there’s this sobbing, crying child that just wants a hug. And feels so alone. And I just want somebody to see that child and to love them. Because I can’t.

Every day I go through the storm alone and come out of the other end. I try to be strong. I rarely give up. And even when I do I know giving up isn’t the way. So I get back up. But I just hope there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Because I’m so tired of walking alone."
3,"I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. Then I got another diagnosis whereafter the BPD diagnosis got invalid according to the doctors. Now they won’t examine/screen me for BPD again, but I’m pretty certain that I have it as almost all the symptoms match. I’m really suffering from major mood swings, anger outbursts and weird behaviors such as screaming at my husband over the phone and throwing soda in his garage because he was out with his friends and I was scared that he was with other girls. I know I’m crossing a line, but I can’t control it which is why I consider myself to have divergent behavior patterns. This is just one example out of many. What should I do in this situation?"
3," 

so my partner has been off with me for weeks but she says she is just stressed and worried about everything but hardly talks to me about stuff and just says shes fine when you can clearly see shes not.

I keep trying to make plans and the best i get is a maybe, like it would be nice to know what i am doing etc.

the main thing is today, she blanks me for hours then tells me to shush every time i message her while shes out with her friends, yet she is constantly on her phone when she is around me, like rather than tell me she is busy she just tells me to shush and then ignores me when i ask why.

idek i just needed to rant. I want things to work out but im getting the feeling that she is pulling away."
3,"I don’t know how to even explain this because I’m such a confusing person. If I confuse myself, how can I expect anyone else to understand me? I can’t believe I even act like this and I genuinely can’t help it. 

I’ll really like someone be all over them etc and vice versa then the next Im like ‘omg what in the hell, I defo don’t like you etc’ it’s like a cycle. I’m like this with family too... mind F*CK I tell you.  I don’t even think I’m capable of love because everytime it’s like ‘NEXT’.... sigh"
3,"A couple days ago I (19F) was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and they prescribed me Abilify. I read that Abilify also helps for symptoms of BPD (which I’m not diagnosed with, but I have a lot of). I’ve been taking 5mg for that past 2 days, but I’m looking forward to things not hurting me anymore. If the things in my life can’t change for the better, I figure I can at least change the way I feel about them/how they affect me emotionally. Have any of y’all taken Abilify and saw any change in that department?"
3,"Last week was pretty bad for me. I got in a fight with my family which ended up in me going on a pretty bad drug binge. Worse than normal. Ive been off my meds for years. I'm just trying to hold it together until I see my new doctor on the 26th. 

In order to keep my job and extension my home, I've been staying home and watching TV. I also keep up with my chores. Most of my friends understand this. But my newer friends can't seem to grasp it no matter how I explain it. Recovering this time around has been way more difficult than any episode I've had previously. Does anyone have advice on explaining this? I try my best but I guess I appear high enough functioning to where me explaining just doesn't land for them. It's a sad ugly existence. I can't help that solitude is the only thing that keeps it together for me. My biggest fear is ending up jobless and homeless."
3,"Hey frands,

Im trying to figure out what’s going on when I get the empties—you know the feeling.

I think it might have something to do with a lack of connection and validation. Possibly a lack of continuity and security—a lack of the sense that I am understood, loved, valued, safe—that I am standing on solid ground. 

I wonder if it’s not the ground that needs to be solid, but me that has to be ready for it to drop out, and know I’m gonna be ok, that I can handle it without help from anyone. 

I came up with this thing re: a sense of self, informed by some reading, my own experiences and the input of my fabulous therapist: 

Agency: Capable, confident and competent: a sense that I am going to be able survive, thrive, meet my goals, that i am valid, worthy, competent and capable

Validation: a sense that I am valid, loved and understood; sense that there are people who love me, that not just my emotions are valid, but my experiences, my whole self; a sense that I am loved, not « loved despite », but just loved; a sense that people understand me when I speak, that there are people who see the good in me and the value of my contribution 


Continuous & connected: a sense of who I am persisting despite big changes in the landscape of my life, despite grief, crisis and loss of loved ones. A sense that I am connected to this sense of persisting self and to others around me.


I’d say I’m working towards all of those pretty consistently, but that none of them are where they need to be. 

Without any specific external stimulus, sometimes I get this rattling emptiness. It feels like a disconnect, it feels like hopelessness and loneliness. It feels like emptiness, but it’s certainly not the absence of emotion, is it? 

I was wondering what you guys feel about the big empties—is it something missing, or something present? And what helps you when you feel that way?

Thanks!"
3,what's a good way to handle your bpd partner splitting on you? I love my gf dearly but when she's angry she can be so hurtful and it's hard to not react to her and then have her blame me for getting mad in return. she can love me one day and the next act like im the worst person ever and idk how to handle the value/devalue swings
3,"I’ve heard that if you get pregnant while single and have BPD, a social worker has a strong chance of taking your baby away. And you can’t adopt for sure. I totally get it because having a personality disorder and raising a child would be HELL and so unfair to the child, but I would want to raise it to be happy and not at all like my parents raised me. I always planned on adopting. 

Ive been in therapy for it and have made tremendous progress, but I’m far from perfect and won’t be for a longgg time. Even if I’m totally recovered in like eight years, would they even let me adopt because I have a past of BPD and possible self destructive behavior?"
3,"People in BPD are way more likely to attempt suicide, and way more likely to suceed, yet taken far less seriously than other mental health disorders because our ideation is more frequent and impulsive. And honestly I'm sick of it. 

I get it, attempts to hurt myself are a regular thing for me, feeling suicidal is a regular thing for me. But especially when it goes up in intensity I feel there is 0 support. I've flat out told services what I plan to do, with no prevention or intervention before I do it. I've been given mental health numbers more than I can count, been given the speech, been told ""we understand you're asking for help"" on my attempts, to the point where they don't even bother sectioning me or taking me to hospital any more they just tell emergency services to leave me at home. 

I feel let down, I feel I'm left alone to struggle. I'm tired of being asked what I want them to do to help, and then being told they can't do that because we must think longer term. It only takes one attempt for me to succeed in seriously hurting myself. In the moments I really need help, and don't get it, it makes me want to hurt myself out of pure spite to these services. 

Just today I was told that because I dont wake up early enough, I am not engaging and will be discharged if I don't fix my sleep. Despite attending 12 weeks of therapy and not missing one session, despite not missing one appointment with my care navigator, despite calling all of the helplines they give me before I take action, I'm not engaging. To them, non engagement must be the only reason I am not feeling better.

I'm sorry I'm just so sick of it honestly. I just want help and I want to stop being given the same bullshit when it comes to me being in a desperate situation."
3,"I am
Trying to get good at making songs because I want to do it for a living and every time I try and I can’t get it right or I fail it makes me want to go jump off a bridge. I start to feel like a complete failure and that I’ll never accomplish anything and it just floods my mind with all these negative thoughts. I even get like this with a video game that I play too so it’s like anything I try to be good at if I feel I’m not good enough or if I can’t get something right it makes me really suicidal. Does anyone else experience this?"
3,"So, where do I start?

• My homophobic brother not only doesn't accept my gender identity & sexual orientation, but he also takes the mick out of my beliefs, then says ""it's just friendly sibling banter""
• I feel like I'm treading on eggshells whenever friends and family find out what I do for volunteering (well, I label it as volunteering to make my life easier)
• I've been having a really crap 24 hours with voices in my head, being close to losing my temper, etc...
• And then a couple of hours ago, our family dog started having a seizure, and I somehow was able to be there, despite literally just starting to have a panic attack in the kitchen

So yeah.... Gotta love life, ey? 😅😫"
3,"The title is the TL;DR of my situation, and I'm trying to figure out how to cope as I feel I've been spiraling worse lately and I'm afraid I'll say or do things I can't come back from. It's pretty long as I'm giving quite a bit of background so I appreciate if you make it all the way through.

I was with a partner for 5 years, and have known them for 9. They were my best friend. We've lived together for nearly 3.5 years. We planned on getting married; we were engaged and had an idea of the future together. Our relationship had it's issues and we both could have been better to eachother, me more so given my disorder, but also because we started dating as kids and are in our early 20s now; people change and grow.

My ex was poly and had feelings for other people during the span of our relationship, but never acted on them. That was a lot to deal with, and compartmentalize. About 8 months ago, I learned they had feelings for a coworker of theirs we had been hanging out with. And I thought maybe I could too, so I agreed to open our relationship and to mutually date this coworker. 

I spiraled a lot in that relationship, and got really bad for both myself and my partner(s). The coworker agreed to the relationship but very obviously only had feelings and inclinations towards my ex long term partner, and I was being gaslit (since apologized to) as to the imbalances I was noticing, and that I was asking for too much. My ex-long term partner tried to hold it together but we were already rocky as it was. When I mentioned going back to monogamy, that I couldn't handle polyamary, that I wanted things to be like how they were, ex-partner said that it wouldn't be fair to coworker, and they wouldn't just cut him off like that. That ""things change"" and when pressed, I learned they didn't want to get married to me anymore either because it wouldn't be fair; basically pulled the rug out from under me on the future we had had planned together in the 3 years prior.

I mourned that relationship, and what it used to be. I was chatting, venting and generally hanging out with a coworker (current partner) of my own for a few months leading up that I thought was becoming me new FP...turns out I was starting to crush on him especially in the latter half of the thruple relationship, at my lowest. So I asked both partners if I could pursue it, so that we could all have a slice of happiness and I wasn't such a mess at home. Two weeks into relationship with current partner, I broke up with thruple coworker but stayed with ex-long term partner.

Ex-long term forbade current partner from coming over, and partaking in hobbies that ex-long term and I would do together like cosplay or certain games. I tried to respect it because I know what I felt to feel jealous and protective of things like that. But I felt this was unfair as I was living with ex-long term and their boyfriend, who I felt did me dirty, and yet I was still being cordial. They told me it wasn't unfair because they couldn't help that he lived here; but the idea that I have to be around their boyfriend, and an ex of mine, while being unable to invite my own boyfriend over felt really unfair.

It was rocky obviously. And then I learned I wasn't actually poly and couldn't handle two relationships, especially with one that wasn't a thruple. I wanted to be fair to current partner as I felt I was being unfaithful somehow still dating ex-long term, despite current partner's complete acceptance, reassurance and understanding of the poly situation and things I've vented about previously. I wanted to have a future with current partner and I didn't want the mess that I was still clinging to from my previous relationship to scare him off, or make him feel like he didn't have my focus or love. I was confused and upset and anxious as fuck at my options, but I just felt so much better with current partner.

So I broke it off with ex-long term after they had been expressing grievances about my lack of reciprocation / not being able to be the partner I once was, but I couldn't parse my own feelings. I still love them, but I didn't know if I was in love, and I didn't want to ruin a good thing with current partner. Ex-long term partner told me that no one would be able to handle my disorder like they could, but have since apologized for such a toxic comment. Ex-long term begged me, told me they wouldn't want to be friends with me if we broke up when that's all I really wanted, and I sat on it for awhile, and after consulting current partner if I could try again, and getting the reassurance and okay for it, we tried again.
But I was still bitter about the relationship I had mourned, and how I was treated (and treated them) in the thruple relationship, and I still couldn't be the partner they wanted. I loved them but wasn't in love. Every time we were together, it was a new argument. We always argued, but it was more now. And finally, they broke it off with me, after writing a long list of things about me that irritated them, that they've since apologized for. And said that we should not be bitter like we were last time, when I wasn't bitter in the first place, just confused with so many life changes in so little time, and tried to have it be amicable. That we could still be friends and they just needed time to parse how they felt and grieve what they were afraid of.

It felt unfair somehow...even though it wasn't, rationally. There is no fair or unfair in things like this. That now that it was on ex-long term partner's terms, I wasn't allowed to be bitter or upset.
They promised they wouldn't ghost me as they have issues with doing that to others, and we own pets together, so they would send me some pictures of the pets a couple days after this. It seemed like it was sort of a segway to normalcy.

I'm good friends with all of my exes, and I thought that's where this was going. It's easy for me to bounce back to 'normal'...if anything, still being friends and not pretending like there wasn't history makes it so much better than just not, for me at least. It keeps negativity and bitter feelings from arising. I know everyone isn't like that. 
 
Communication eventually died down to nothing. They start ignoring messages, even messages about pets. I noticed I was softblocked on a website we used together when I wasn't a few days before. I got obviously upset, and I sent some long messages when I spiraled one night, nothing bitter or sinister but long, frustrated and confused, about the distance and the living situation and how I was being treated like a ghost now in the household, how I felt it was being put on me to find out when it's appropriate to be friends again.
Not only mourning 5 years of a relationship but 9 years of a friendship on my side. 

Was responded to being told this was one of the reasons they broke up with me; my long winded messages at early hours of the morning (despite a majority of our arguments being initiated from them; have no had any arguments with current partner like I did with ex-long term.) And how they need no contact to cope, but they didn't initially express that to me. And us living together makes that especially difficult, having to see eachother.

I come out of my room to hear them venting to their boyfriend in the living room, a space we can all come into, and I catch them say, ""I don't owe them anything, I'm tired of it!"" in regards to my message
I am not proud of my reaction that day. They told me not to interject in their conversation, but it was a conversation in a living space and felt I had every right to speak my mind. I'm a firm believer that there's a minimum you owe someone, especially with history.

I blew up, and they blew up back to me and we yelled at eachother back and forth. I made threats telling them I would make their life a living hell if this was going to be how they were going to treat me in the apartment after all of our history; like someone they didn't know, cold and uncaring. I'm not proud of it and apologized after 11 days of getting my mind together, and was ignored.

They say to respect what they need to cope, but tell me they don't owe me anything. And I can't handle no contact...a lack of normalcy makes me vindictive and bitter.
I have to respect what they need while ignoring my own needs, and my mention of that had them telling me to stop making myself the victim.

They need no contact to cope but that's impossible living together. We have two other roommates as well who I am moving in with when our lease is up, but I feel bad they've had to witness the mess that's been happening in the past half year. They've been there for both of us seperately, but one roommate has known me for 12 years so he's more inclined to sticking around with me. 

I told ex-partner calmly for the second time to start getting their clothes and such out of my room today. If we were on better terms, I wouldn't mind them leaving their things here because they really don't have a lot of space in their room with their boyfriend. But I can't cope having all of their stuff cluttering my living space, especially when I'm trying to be around more often.
They agreed to it but said I was being vindictive, but I reminded them that they said they didn't owe me anything, and I didn't owe them my living space.
It turned into another conversation about letting things settle, and no contact, and it got heated. They have a way of pushing blame onto me, and saying I need to take accountability but I feel they never take accountability, or realize when they're making themselves the victim as well. 
They told me they don't understand how I don't understand that they don't want to talk to me, and that this is why they dread talking to me. A total turn around to the bullshit they told me when they broke up with me, like cusion.
I just feel like they're taking a coward's way out for it all but I'm trying to be respectful...it's just really hard.

How do I deal with this ? I've been staying at my current partner's place a lot, and honestly I'm much happier in this relationship than I've been in awhile...I could gush and gush about all of the good things. He gets me, our love languages match, we can have conversations instead of arguments, we just...match. Ex-coworker partner told me I was too fat for him, despite having worked on my weight and having an eating disorder (which was jump started again after that comment). When I confided in my now current partner about that months before we were dating, his response was to tell me I was perfect the way I was, how shitty a comment like that was from someone who's supposdd to support and love you, but most of all, that if I wanted to get in shape, he'd work out with me. That was the positivity and support I needed in my life and he's been just as supportive now as he was then. He's like a sunflower and I just want to be around his warmth all the time.
But I don't want to rely on him as much as I did with ex-long term partner; I don't want him to feel smothered with my problems. And I especially don't want to get hurt...or to split and hurt him. I've been trying to look into therapy. It's been 3 months and my love keeps growing stronger, but I can't just live at his place and I'm afraid he'll see how bad of a person I am over time. I don't want to ever feel like I wasn't enough like I did in past relationship, enough for ex-long term partner to obviously want to date other people. I have to be back at my apartment sometimes. But every time I'm here and I see ex-long term and their boyfriend, I just get so angry. Especially with the no contact."
3,"The funny thing is I'm hypersexual. I frequently think about sex, just to not be fully present when it's actually happening. Every time things start heading there, or even when it becomes a possibility, my mind goes away and I shut down—even if I’m the one who initiated it. Thankfully this has never affected my performance though, because hey... my BPD brain needs that validation, right? LMAO.

I don't have any recollection of being sexually abused or assaulted, so... I seriously don't know what may be causing this, to be honest."
3,"I feel like I’m constantly cycling between optimism and wanting to fix things, and wanting to just end the relationship. In my heart I want us to fix things and just be happy together, but there are very real issues between us that can never seem to leave my mind. At some point, it came to be that every big argument we have leads to me asking if they just want to leave me, and going through all the reasons why we shouldn’t be together. I really think that I’m not good for them, I’m the first girlfriend they’ve ever had (we’re in our early-mid 20s), and I feel like that hinders their ability to see how things are. Sex, money and mental illness are our main problems, and those are pretty big things, but despite that I just want us to be able to come back to the love and happiness we used to share. One minute all I can think about is how sweet and wonderful and patient they are, and the next moment I’m reminded of our issues and feel like the whole thing is doomed. I hate that this is going to be what they base their future relationships on if we break up, I hate that I’m responsible for shaping their idea of love. I feel so incredibly guilty, and they still want to work on things, and a big part of me wants to as well, but then the other side of me wants to prevent any further suffering on their part. I would love and greatly appreciate any advice!"
3,"Whenever anyone starts answering things half-assed I feel like it's my job to pick it up. Normally I do this by turning the convo to them and only them with a basic ""what are you doing rn"" question or in this situation just ""what's up with you"".

Then keeping the attention on them until either they change it or the conversation ends. 99.9999999% of the time it never goes back to me and it ends after a bit. (Sorry a bit off track their but I still feel it important)

My dad is just answering me ok. He wished me a good day, I answered with a sentence about my day then I get ok back. Talk about how I got a good hand mixer for a good price, ok. Then I brag about it a little breaking down just why it's so good, sounds good. 

Now I'm thinking of swinging to convo over to him. I don't want to because I'm always talking about him or others. It's never about me and when it is, it's forced and I get nothing. 

My sister can buy a 25 cent pencil and my dad would be praising her for just how perfect and amazing it is. Nobody cares about what I do no matter how big and impressive."
3,"Triggers for blood, suicide, stalking. Please no telling me ""change your number,"" ""go to the cops,"" ""just move,"" it is so much easier said than done.

Long story short, me and this girl were friends until I realized how toxic of a person she was and I cut her off. She used 3 different phone numbers to call me, she said she would show up at my house if I didn't talk to her, she would try to use my friend to contact me, she would do what I did when I was 18, but worse. She would constantly invite herself over, forcing herself into plans that I would have to face the consequences of when she told my parents she didn't have a way home.  She would just take my stuff and say ""oh well, you don't use it, do you? It looks the exact same as last time."" She would guilt trip me into giving her things, she would make me feel like shit in order to make it so I wouldn't stray from her. She would tell me that no one liked me except her, guys only talked to me for sex, money or for a joke. She didn't even like my ex because she didn't introduce him to me and was constantly telling me that her friend would be a better match, knowing that I wouldn't end the relationship if I got into it because I was too scared to lose her friendship. She would talk so much shit about him, but then act like his friend to his face. She would constantly tell me that he was cheating on me. One night, after me and him broke up after the second time we dated, I said he was a bit of an asshole sometimes. My best friend since the fourth grade and mother both said if he made me happy, then they're happy. But what does this bitch say? ""I told you so."" This stupid piece of fucking shit texted me one day saying ""hey, come over, I'm having a panic attack."" I had my dad drive me over, go into her room. She had cut herself and had me clean up the blood. She had notes for everyone and insisted I read her note as I was cleaning her blood. She told everyone that her ex boyfriend broke up with her because he had another girl. Nope. She broke up with him to fuck his best friend who had feelings for her. We met in the 6th grade and she got mad because I found a pen that she decided she liked. I went to the bathroom and she flirted with a guy in the class to take it. I asked for it back and she gaslighted me, ""it was my pen, I lost it last week or maybe you stole it."" We had an assignment in social studies the next day and we fucking bombed it because she was a petty piece of shit who refused to say any of the lines for a skit we had to do on the Black Plague. In the 7th grade, she went to a different school. 8th grade, she came back and sat with me and another friend, throwing small bits of food at me to try and piss me off. 9th grade, she acted as if none of that happened and we were the best of friends. It took me until the second year of college to realize how toxic of a person she was.

I have so many fucking stories about this piece of shit she was such a manipulative cunt and I ended up being her lapdog.

My dad saw her a few months ago at her job because he needed something. He told me what happened, he said ""hi Stalker"" and she goes ""how do you know my name?!"" He thought wtf you were my daughter's friend, but said ""you have a name tag."" She responds with ""oh yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting"" and I guess told him a story about how she had a ""mini stroke"" and doesn't remember anyone or anything.... except she has these prom photos with this one girl who she feels such a strong and special connection with.

But if you don't remember anything.... how do you know those were prom photos? I know I burned all the ones I had because you forced your way into the fucking photos because ""WE WERE LIKE SISTERS!"" and I couldn't even have one photo by myself, I couldn't even get one with the guy I liked who I ended up dating for a few months, without her guilt tripping me. My mom didn't pay for any of the fancy borders, nothing that said PROM 2015 or CLASS OF 2015, not even a prop sign in the back that said 2015, I wore a short mint dress, and it was at the aquarium.

So, how do you remember it was prom?

If you had a stroke that made you not able to remember anything from your past? How do you remember it was Prom.......?

She continued to tell my dad that her mom wanted her to take the photos down, but she wants to know who this girl was. My dad came home and told me what happened and that I probably shouldn't go in that store again.

Now, I know it's stupid to pick up phone numbers you don't know, but my work has like 4 different phone numbers and I don't save my coworkers' phone numbers so I don't accidentally call them, so I have a habit of picking up just subconsciously when I hear my ringtone. When I pick up the phone, sometimes it's a spam call, other times it's a legit call and other times, it's just silence. So what I've been doing sometimes is to say her name and tell her to leave me alone. Most of the time, my phone hasn't been by my face as I would hang up, but today I said it into the phone.

I said ""Stalker, leave me al-"" and then it hung up.

It was her. I'm telling y'all, it was fucking her. It's always been her. Every call that has been silent after me saying hello twice, it was her.

I still have the phone that has texts and screenshots of everything that happened. I should've gotten a restraining order when it was at its peak, but I stupidly didn't.

I just want her to leave me alone. I don't want to be her friend. I don't want her in my life. I don't want her to have control over me again."
3,"I literally hate some of the things I read about BPD. I was looking for articles/info online to give my friends about BPD so they know how it affects me and my relationships and so many of them say things that I just don’t feel is correct. For example describing relationships with us as “tumultuous” and “emotionally draining”. I mean I realise that difficulty in relationships is such a huge part of BPD, but so many of us work so, so hard to be the best people we can, and we also have even more love and empathy to give than other people! I just feel like it’s so unfair that it’s so easy to access articles online that say things like “manipulative” and “destructive” when most of us are just doing our best to navigate normal life with these intense emotions and feelings about people. Yes, BPD can be awful and cause us to act in ways we aren’t proud of, but we do our best to not let it control us and we have so much love to give. 

TL;DR- I’m a fucking good person and a great friend and I’m sick of reading about how difficult it is to know us."
3,"I recently made a new group of friends and they are genuinely HEAVEN SENT. such blessings in my life. they are beautiful people. we decided to get each other easter baskets with tons of gifts, so, i went out to buy things for them. for one friend, i got them a little crystal for $18. i asked my mom if she thought it was cute, and she said that me spending money on these “people” was extremely weird and that i was only buying them “expensive” things so that i could BUY their friendship. her comment made me extremely upset and embarrassed. she thinks that i’m not worthy enough of people liking me. apparently the only way people will like me is if i buy them stuff. i’m so humiliated. i’ve never had friends like this before and my mom knows it. i don’t know why she makes me feel stupid for having friends, and i don’t know why she acts like my friends don’t actually like me."
3,"I realized I’m an absolutely horrible person and hurt everyone I loved during a depressive/psychotic episode. The guilt is so bad and I need to know if others with bpd have done terrible things during a bad episode. 

Basically now everyone thinks I faked my suicide attempt as well."
3,"hi i basically just wanted to say that i really hate myself sometimes and i do the stupidest most psychotic things and i just am in constant argument with myself and it’s so tiring im so tired 
idek what the point of this post was i literally just needed to get this out somewhere 
i constantly feel like i’m trapped inside my body while someone else controls it and they keep doing shit i dont want them to do and no matter how much i scream they never listen to me
this is my body and i should be in control why am i not in control"
3,"Guess what! 

Ex messaged me again asking to hookup after I ignored him the first time. Instead of ignoring him again I decided to give a mature (I think) message. 

“You used, manipulated, and lied to me. I spent so long healing and finally have moved on from you and you need to do the same thing, clearly sexually. You have no idea how badly you hurt me Jozef. Your actions traumatized me. 

You need to reevaluate yourself if you think this is okay to do. Frankly it’s disrespectful thinking I’m a disposable sex object here at your beck and call.”

“You waited three months to ask to hookup” 

Did I do okay? 

And I know for a fact that he read that shit because as I went to paste it and once again he said “never mind” after asking. Not even a minute later did I send my message. That’s how I know there is no way he didn’t see it. It shut him up and I don’t think he’ll ever message me again. 

For three months he has thought about me solely sexually, enough for him to ask twice. And I know he’s been pleasuring himself to the thought of me. The sad thing is that he probably didn’t delete my nudes when I asked. Makes me sick."
3,Lately I have not been able to handle it. It's debilitating and all I can think about. It's affecting my day to day life. It's obsessive thoughts and I feel like I am losing my mind. I don't know what to do any more. Please help. Any tips?
3,"As the title says, how do you broach the topic with someone who you believe may have BPD? What do you do if they are reluctant to seek medical help to deal with this? 

It’s my first time posting in this community, and I am looking for support from people who have been in a similar situation with their significant other."
3,"My therapist wants to diagnose me and she's VERY certain I have bpd. Although I do not have the anger outbursts or the rage. I cry a lot. Pretty much always sad. Co dependant. Unhealthy coping mechanisms. I do have ""outbursts"" I guess? But they are crying and sadness from a fight with a partner or rejection or feeling abandoned or lonely."
3,"Hi 
I’m new here 
Idk why but I just wanted to tell someone that I hurt myself again today. It’s just another scar to add to my collection. I don’t feel well. I’ve never been well. I’ve struggled my entire life and even now when I try so hard and want so much to be normal or simply be ok 
I can’t be. My brain is all fucked up and I take so many medicines just so I can somewhat function. I am tired and being kept alive because I have to be. I am tired."
3,"My mother raised me for the most part, but she doesn't really feel like my ""mom"" if you know what I mean. I turned 18 a few months ago and have sort of been living alone the past few years. It's complicated, but the simplest way I can put it is that I live at home while my mother stays in her boyfriend's apartment.

She pays the bills. Every two weeks I get a $100 for food (includes my cat). The rest of the time I don't see her or ask help with anything, and that's how it has been for three years. I know that I should be, and I *am,* very grateful that I have a roof over my head and food in the fridge.

I feel stupid for wanting more. I wish I could switch places with my cousin and soccer mom auntie. She cooks her daughter dinner and knows her friends, they even talk about the boys my cousin likes. They have a relationship. My mother hates hugs and has never said I love you."
3,I was watching a Documentary one time of a football player who had BPD and I was like I totally relate to everything they were saying on the doc. I suggested to my mom that I may have BPD and she told me in a very harsh tone that nothing was wrong with me. I was 14 fast forward 7 years and I get diagnosed with it. ( My mom to this day denies I have no mental health issues even after I been diagnosed)
3,"
I am 17 years old and got my diagnosis. i’ve struggled so much since I was 7. A lot of things happened that made me realize so much at such a young age. Growing up I was always confused, still am. Confused on why I did what I did, why I felt the way I felt. Once I turned 15, things got so bad. Meaning I ruined so much for me. (was already ruining things for myself since I was 10). I won’t say exactly what happened but a lot did. After that, that’s when I got help and eh it helped a bit but the feeling never leaves. I was doing very good last year when I was 16. Very good. I felt happy. I didn’t feel guilt, anger, or had suicidal thoughts, at all. Something triggered it in October of last year. A lot did tbh. I got bad again I recently got out of my “manic episode” in march since then. It’s weird because I swear it feels as if I blacked out through it all, with just a very few memories ( not good ones) . I cry everyday after my manic episode ends for months. ( i’ve noticed this with my past episodes) i always end up feeling better after but then ruin it... it’s a cycle that has been consistent in my life for as long as i can remember. i just can’t believe I messed up so much for myself, why do i do that? I feel better now I guess. Just so sad that i didnt stop myself): I have friends and they are great. great. the opposite of me actually, i have some of the most stable friends ever. So as you can see I dont open up really, they wouldn’t get it.Which also leads me to feeling alone with how I feel. But what I want to know is will it ever get better? is it too late to mature? will this be me for the rest of my life? I’m almost an adult I shouldn’t be this impulsive and i hate it. I just want someone with bpd to tell me it has got better for them. i need to know i wont always self sabotage for the rest of my life.

but i’m also quite optimistic which makes no sense. I also know i could get my life together. It’s not that bad, i think the reason i feel so hopeless sometimes is because of how haunted i am by everything that happened to me and how confused i am. i just dont get why me. so much that is just wow . but I have money saved up, a car, and im graduating in june. ( impulsively quit my job in february, working on finding a new one ): ) but i just don’t want to keep having to go through the pain of it all if it will always result in me ruining stuff for myself it’s so painful among with the trauma I have. It sometimes feels that i can’t handle it for the rest of my life. i hate having memories and flashbacks of all the trauma i just want to be happy and not ruin it."
3,"This is probably the worst day I've had this year. I don't know where to start. I just got off Spring Break and it usually takes me a while to get back into the swing of things. I thought that maybe I would've felt more relaxed after the break but Monday I completely slept almost all day. Today I woke up and tried to make an effort to be productive, but I got an email about one of my student loans and saw how much I owed and panicked. I talked to my mom about my loans and how I was freaking out over nothing and I guess she's right...but why don't I feel any better?

Not to mention that my FP always makes everything about himself. I thought that maybe just this once he would try to comfort me, but instead he talks about how anxious HE is. He does this whenever I'm upset. Every single time I'm upset, he gets upset, and then I have to take care of him. If I don't, things will only get worse (ie he'll have a huge panic attack or hurt himself). I'm so fucking sick of it. 

So I had a panic attack today. I walked out of the room away from him, because he always finds a way to freak out and turn my feelings against me. It's like I'm not allowed to feel fucking anything. Having panic attacks alone is terrible, and doubly so when you're afraid for someone else. 

I'm typing this as he has came back from having a cigarette and now he's on his stupid goddamn phone. I know if I call him out on it, he's going to talk about how it helps him with his anxiety and how he wants to talk to this person he ""hasn't talked to in a long time""--so that makes it okay. If I were to do that, he'd say I'm not being there for him. Fuck him.

I'm afraid for my life. I feel like I can't do this anymore. Why go to school if I'm not sure I'll even graduate? I'm racking up all this debt and for what? I don't know what I'm going to do with my life, and I wish I had someone here to comfort me. I don't know what to do--ever. 

I had to get this off my chest. Thanks for making it this far. I'd appreciate whatever messages you have."
3,"I don't know what to do right now. I know this isn't just in my head, I know it's real. I know I'm nothing to them now and they have someone better. 

I told them how I feel and it all went so wrong from there. It was all too late. I'm always too late. Not good enough. They already have someone who is so much better than me in every way.

My mind is spiraling now, I don't know what to do.
I know I shouldn't feel like this, I know I should just forget about them and move on but I can't."
3,"18TF. If I could get a job, I wouldn’t be able to keep it, but I can’t get that far. I don’t have transportation anyway. Everyone says to freelance, but I don’t have the fucking energy. And my coping mechanism is “add to cart,” so I really don’t know what the fuck to do. Has anyone else been in this situation? What did you do to not be destitute?

EDIT: I’m not doing something that requires me to live to work. Fuck that. I couldn’t bring myself to. Like literally, my brain wouldn’t let me. Life was meant for more than eating, shitting, sleeping and working."
3,"I'm sure a lot of you feel this way too. Before my diagnosis, I was always wondering why I had always hated myself. It had always felt like I was born with self hatred, and I don't think I've ever experienced self love. As for feeling unloved, do any of you feel *entirely* unloved? It obviously has to do with the self hatred, but I've always felt that way. My parents aren't the best, especially my mom, but my childhood wasn't dark (even though I don't remember most of it), and I was told loving and uplifting things for most of it. The main and one of the only things I remember from my childhood is how dark my thoughts were, though. I barely even spoke as a child because I felt like I didn't deserve to exist. I still feel like that now, as a 22-year old. I know that BPD can come with these thoughts, but has anyone experienced them so deeply and strongly almost every day since they were born? I've been loved before, I know that, but not by many people, and either way I never felt like I deserved it. I have a partner now, and she's very loving, but I don't even feel loved by her anymore because I'm probably the lowest I've ever been. Can anyone relate to any of this?"
3,"I have AvPD too so flings weren’t really on my radar until my 20th birthday (I am impulsive and competitive). However, since the pandemic, my family and I have been separated for the longest and furthest we have ever been. I just realised a pattern to my casual sex. I now avoid casual sex because the risk of getting an FP is 42% (I calculated) and also, covid. We’ve been trying to get together for the past year but our schedules don’t seem to line up and I chose to stay quarantined. 

I just want a friend tbh. I just want to hang out and do fun stuff. I have friends. But why do I use ONS and FWB’s for fulfilment. Tbh, I’m never actually satisfied, I just feel worse but I do it again and again anyways. I’m tired of the sex. But why are my only successful meet-ups for sex?"
3,"Well I found out someone was talking smack about me. 

I want to confront them. 

But wait - I barely know them and they live 3,000 miles away from me. 

Forget it. I will trust karma. Also confronting has never helped me with anything."
3,Hi! I'm undiagnosed but show a lot of signs of having bpd and I've noticed that after break ups the only way I can get over someone (who I actually like and care about) is by making them into the enemy somehow. Does anyone else do this?
3,"I recently found a great therapist and began seeing her. I was looking for someone who is in network with my insurance, taking new clients, and certified in EMDR. It took her a few weeks to call me back, but she did, and I knew as soon as we talked that she was a good fit. I did talk to two or three others on the phone too, but she was the best fit. 

She started with maybe 10 or 12 weekly sessions to take my history of traumatic events and do a sort of family tree. Then we were ready to begin EMDR. 

In the first session, I dealt with the death of my father at an early age (one of my first memories). It was so profound, I cried and cried. At the end, I felt it was cleared. I left with a deep sense of gratitude for all the people who helped me along the way in the time shortly after my dad died. The second session was a bust. I think she recognized it too and ended about 10 minutes early which was fine with me. I've only had two sessions, but have been so impressed with the first one that I an so encouraged. 

My therapist uses the bilateral buzzers with lights. I hold one in each hand. 

I've been at this therapy thing for a while. I've had CBT mostly. I've had lots of negative experiences, significant enough that I know they hold me back from achieving my potential, from having a fulfilling life. My functionality has improved over the years, but I still carry around these scars, emotional vulnerability and low self-esteem. 

For the first time in my life, I feel I have a chance to overcome. 

I wanted to share because I would not have known about EMDR if a friend had not told me about it. I have read a tiny bit about it on the internet and asked some mental health professionals before trying it. They all told me it helps significantly with trauma. I understand that BPD may have roots in childhood trauma, so I wanted to share here where I sometimes lurk in the hopes that it may help someone here. It gives me hope anyway.

Cheers to all of you!"
3,"I have been in relationships since I'm 15. Looking back i think I was not single for more than 2 weeks.
I had a 1,5 years, 10 years, 3 years and now 2 months relationship.

Usually I only get the courage to end a relationship when I feel I can trust the ""next"" one. I know, it's terrible and i feel guilt about that.

No boyfriend ever wanted to break up with me. They always tried to win me back. I thought it was because I am perhaps a good person to be with but i realize now it's just trauma bonding 

I now started a new relationship and I think I give my soul to my partner. I pay attention to everything they say. I try their hobbies. I get close to their family (i have no family so i always want to be close to my partner family). I offer 100% of support. I get close to their friends as well and disregard my own friends.

It was the birthday of my boyfriend and i went completely overboard. Bought 7 gifts,  baked a personalized cake .. and we are only two months together.

I know it is probably bpd but i love this men so much. How do I know if my feelings are true? I didn't say i loved him yet, but i do. I think about growing old together, about traveling and i can see all of this happening.

I'm just so worries there will be a day i will start painting him all black. Then i feel like I don't love anymore. I don't want to start the cycle again. I had amazing partners before and i left them because there were some things that didn't work. Instead of fixing these issues i moved to the next one...

How do You differenciate real love from bpd love?"
3,"As a nonBP I’ve done things I’m not proud of. Responded to things too aggressively. Not held her when she was sad bc I was hurting too. Things I would never do under “normal” circumstances. Things that hurt my exwBPD. Real or imagined. Things that have “crushed” her and taken her “will to live”. I feel guilty. I feel her pain. And of course she felt pain that was 100x what a normal person would feel. I care about her and despite a heartfelt apology I still had these things thrown back in my face in the end. I never cheated on her or lied to her or degraded her as a person. In fact we had several conversations about her past sexual history and I never once made her feel bad about it. 

But, I don’t know where to begin to forgive myself. It’s really deep. I’m a good person. I don’t do things “to her” in a vacuum or maliciously and in at least one case she was a willing participant. The chaos and the emotions that came from the instability of her disease affected how I treated her in return. She was absolutely no angel and has no insight on her volatility bc she has no understanding of just how unhinged she was. No frame of reference.

That fight or flight reaction i got isn’t rational and when I was constantly under attack i was bound to make a mistake eventually. Mistakes of course were lorded over me forever and were brought back at all the worst times. I only ever remember the good times and she only remembers trauma. Seemingly, my ex never applied the same pressure to herself when evaluating how toxic she was towards me at her worst and what it did to me. Never held herself to account and applied the same unforgiving attitude. 


I smiled and sat there at our final lunch together and i listened to all of her grievances without a semblance of self reflection on her part. No acknowledgement for the hell I dealt with.  It was all about her and her feelings and what I did to her even when she was accusing me of being selfish. The ultimate irony. I served tables for a decade and kept my resolve and forced a smile on my face and told her she will always hold a special place in my heart even though I doubt she’ll ever feel the same way despite our 1.5 years together. 

It was hard but I feel like in the end I was the only one that was held to account for the chaos that WE were a victim to. Her disease stole a beautiful opportunity from us and I’m bitter and resentful about that more than anything. It’s just hard to forgive myself when i look back and it feels like I’m the only one that made mistakes."
3,Does anybody else's BPD symptoms heighten during the time of their period? I find my emotions constantly changing during these times and i'm always on edge. I was just wondering if this happens to anyone else or if its just my meds not working anymore lol
3,"Okay everyone.. I've come to the end. I read everyones... and I want to thank everyone for existing and fighting through every irrational, rational,  crazy, emotional feeling that made u feel too much or too little... you guys don't know just how much of a difference you made in a tiny inadequate little me... thank you for being strong.. I'm full blown ugly crying right now. 

I never knew anyone else with this.  

@all Thank you"
3,"Does anyone else have completely normal friendships and relationships with people but when you find someone to date , you start splitting and overreact to things? When I’m not in a relationship I’m sad but usually ok. The relationships I have with people are normal and even kill. But when I’m in a relationship I go through so much rollercoasters! Does anyone else feel this way?"
3,"Why do I feel so abandoned? She didn't even give an explanation why, though I suspect its because she doesn't think she can help me get any better. I feel so let down...I know I was just a patient, but she was the therapist I've been with the longest, out of the 12 I've seen in the past. It hurts so badly... I'm in bed crying now. And the worst part is I have to go about my day and pretend I'm fine, because none of my friends can ever handle my sadness, and they tend to just get annoyed when I feel bad."
3,"Whenever my boyfriend and I have an argument, I find that over the course of the few hours we fight, I begin to forget the beginning of the argument. The next day, it's like it never happened. Does this happen to anyone else?

For me, I know that it hurts him that I can't remember. One thing I do remember is that every time, he specifically says ""and the worst part is that you won't remember any of this tomorrow."" I don't consciously choose to forget! My brain just doesn't let me for whatever reason. Maybe I dissociate without realizing it, I don't know. I also have a hard time recalling memories from my childhood so maybe it's related? Anyone else also have problems with memories from their childhood???"
3,"Hi yall! 

I’ve been with my SO for 2.5 years, and I was diagnosed with BPD a year and a half ago. The first year of our relationship, I recognise that I treated him poorly, and I’ve dedicated a lot of my time to building a healthier bond. Now I’m in DBT, and ive spent a lot of time working on our relationship- establishing boundaries for both of us, cutting back on my codependent actions, learning how to self validate (it hurts so much to be honest, I just want to call him and be with him 24/7 but anything to have a healthy relationship with the person who loves and supports me!) 

I love him very much. I understand I may be hyper-vigilant, but I was wondering if anyone else had experience with this- I’d like to send him some resources on how to support and talk to people with BPD. However, I’m afraid it will come off as “haha I’m using bpd as an excuse, here is a guide on how to deal with me like an animal”. There’s the part of me that’s afraid that he will see it as me trying to make an excuse for my behaviour. Honestly, it’s for his own good- I want him to have the resources to correctly communicate with me for the sake of the relationship, and the more he understands bpd, the more he’ll understand me. As we all know, BPD can’t just be easily turned off, or it wouldn’t be a disorder. I want him to have the resources to keep both of us happy and healthy. 

Maybe I’m over thinking it? I assume he would be receptive, but maybe before I have this discussion I’d want to know if any of you have had this talk before, and the best way to start it! Also if there are any suggestions for materials to send to SOs or loved ones, I’d appreciate it! 

Thank you!"
3,"I can't help but wonder if my husband and kids would be better off without me. My mental illness is so draining on me I can't imagine what it's like for them. Idk where else to go.

I just randomly get urges to divorce my husband and leave so he could go be happy with someone normal. 

Anyone else?"
3,"EDIT: Thank you for the awards! I’m so glad me sharing my experiences and feelings resonated with so many of you. Thank you for all of the kind comments! You’re all lovely and valid❤️

This example is literally just from today and I think it sums up my experience with BPD pretty accurately. 

Today, my FP (also my S/O) went to work. He texted me after and told me he made a work friend that he found out he knew from a high school club (they competed against each other apparently). He shared this info with me to bring up one of those “small worlds” moments, but I couldn’t help but wonder if it was a girl, if they flirted with him, etc. I thought, what if he starts to like this person, thinks they’re better than me and leaves me?
I rationalized these thoughts quickly but I’m not proud that I even had them in the first place. 

Then he told me he was gonna start his drive home. Sometimes he’ll call me on his drive and tell me about his day. He didn’t today, so I asked if he wanted to, and if he didn’t feel like it, it’s okay. (I always make sure to do this, I do not want him to feel obligated to talk to me). He didn’t answer because he was DRIVING. Rationally I know that’s why. But my brain is mean, and a bad thought I had was that he was sick of me, probably saw my text before he started his drive, and ignored it because he thought I was being clingy and annoying. I thought, maybe he’s thinking about that person he knew from work and doesn’t want to talk to me and ruin it. He clearly hates me because he didn’t respond.

I RATIONALLY know none of this is true, but the thing with BPD is, you can objectively know one thing, but feel the emotions of another, and not be able to stop it. It’s like you see yourself about to crash but there’s nothing you can really do to stop it from happening. 

Then, he gets home, sends me a snapchat of his cat, and he hasn’t responded to my text. Rationally, I know he probably walked in, saw his cat, started to pet her, and thought, oh, my girlfriend would like to see this, sent me a video, thats it. 

But my mind was convincing myself that he is ignoring me because he thinks i’m annoying and is trying to prove to me that he doesn’t care about my texts by letting me know he’s active on other social media. I figured he was afraid to say no to calling me on his drive because he knows i’m sensitive and I’ll be very sad if he rejected me in any way, so he doesn’t want to deal with me being emotional and burdening him. I started to feel like a massive nuisance. So I texted him and told him he can say no to me when I ask to call if he wants to. 

Poor guy just calmly explained to me that he didn’t see my texts because he was driving, then came home, saw the cat, pet her. It was that simple. It was that simple for him, and for me I went on a whirlwind of intense emotions where I thought he hated me, was going to leave me for somebody else, that he was purposely ignoring me, that I was an emotional burden and he’d be better off without me. 

And it’s only noon. lol"
3,"I can’t stop thinking about her. It’s just constant intrusive thoughts about her, obsessively going over in my head what happened, what was said, how it was said, memories and things that aren’t even really significant. I can’t stop thinking. Almost all my thoughts go to her and I’ve been doing more drugs recently just to quiet my mind. It was working for a bit but now it’s not enough. I feel pathetic cause I can’t help it. All I want is to not think about her but my head just won’t turn off. Sometimes I’m not even seeing things as they are and I’m so mad that my reality seems warped. It’s fucked up cause I’m the one who ended things yet I’m still hung up and still in a lot of pain. I can convince myself of what’s true, why I did what I did, convince myself things will be okay again and I can move on only to wake up the next morning feeling the complete opposite. Hopeless, angry and bitter. 

I don’t have a best friend anymore cause I had to cut things off, it wasn’t easy for me to see my ex/fp move on. I don’t have any friends cause the only other one I had lives far away and never attempts to message first. They’re going through their own stuff I guess but this has left me feeling rejected by everyone. While I crave connection I don’t want it at the same time because connection is hell for me. It always turns into something unhealthy and these days I seem more mentally ill than ever. So I’m in a constant cycle of wanting to meet people, needing to, trying and then ultimately giving up because a fear of rejection and knowing what it will turn into. I can’t even stay sober long enough to remember to reply to people. I’m just really alone and I feel worthless and unloveable. I can’t connect with others and no one wants to connect with me. I feel like a terrible person. I feel crazy. I feel stupid. And posting this is going to make me feel even more stupid"
3,"Sorry for eating disorder post, this community is more active than the ED one I posted in, & I know BPD crosses over with eating disorders a lot! 


For some reason, no matter what stage of “recovery” I’m in from my eating disorder - which was previously anorexia, now not underweight or engaging in as many behaviours, so probably OSFED - I (24nb) cannot seem to kick a few behaviours that are interfering with my day to day life. 

The most annoying one is that I simply *have* to have less calories than whoever is eating with me, & will not eat anything that isn’t “safe” unless there are other people there so I can can eat less than them, therefore deeming whatever I do eat as “safe” (less = safe). For example, if I make hot drinks I usually take mine with 1 sugar & a dash milk, my partner has 3-4 sugars & dash of milk. However, if someone else is around that also takes 1 sugar & milk, I make theirs with a heaped teaspoon of sugar, & mine with my regular, pedantically level teaspoon of sugar. *Sometimes* in the past, when had a housemate I didn’t like, I would put more milk & sugar in her tea/coffee with the spiteful thought *”she’s going to get fat”* or whatever.. yeah, I know. Crazy. 

It extends into everything I consume, which is very difficult because I am mainly in control of cooking meals in my household (just me & my boyfriend, sometimes my other boyfriend is round for dinner). If I wasn’t cooking for my partner, I would exclusively eat “safe”, disordered meals.. which sadly I do when he’s at work, or starve until he gets home. 

It’s this weird cycle of absolutely loving to cook & eat, but the disordered thoughts are always replacing my milk with soy, coconut milk & cheese with LIGHT products, serving myself up 1 spoon of rice & covering it in sauce to be sneaky, or freaking out that things are spoiled; I feel like a teenager hiding these silly behaviours. 

Some other, less concerning but equally annoying behaviours/intrusive thoughts I cannot seem to shake are: I cannot eat anything that has been out on the bench that has left my sight, due to an unimaginable fear that flies have laid eggs on it. I cannot consume food after I have seen maggots or flies because I convince myself they (maggots or fly eggs) are in my mouth. Or rather, I try to convince myself they’re not, that’s how strong the feeling is. This seems less eating disorder related & more like an intrusive thought, *but* I’m wondering if anyone else with an ED has these weird thoughts? Is it cuz I’m autistic & it’s food aversion? I don’t know. I have a lot of textural issues with food. 


I’m extremely reluctant to mention my eating disorder (of 10+ years) to my psychiatrist, as the only time I’ve mentioned it to a medical professional or even indicated it was when I was 15, when I was diagnosed but not treated because I did not tell my mother, & in the psych ward 3 months ago, where it was completely ignored, which made me spiral further into thinking my disorder isn’t valid because of my weight. 

Any insights or validation or resonance with these behaviours would be appreciated."
3,"I started thinking about how my FP (also my significant other) used to call me almost every day and invite me over most nights. He would make an effort to cuddle with me frequently and he would video chat with me if we weren't able to see each other for a few days. He seemed generally happy and we had sex frequently.

It's been almost 3 years now and he keeps about half his clothes at my place, has a key, and keeps all his toiletries there so he basically lives with me part time, almost full time. He doesn't call me anymore, I always call him. He doesn't video chat me if we're apart for a few days. He basically puts in effort to give me attention every once in awhile, but it's not consistent like it used to be and our sex life has dwindled to almost nothing.

I understand that logically, people get comfortable together and stop putting in as much effort as they had to in the beginning of their relationships (whether it be friendships or romantic). I was mildly annoyed about our dwindling sex life, but I understand that fades naturally as well, even if I wish it didn't. I started reminiscing this morning about how things used to be and it sent me into a total panic. 

Has anyone else managed to upset themselves just by thinking about how things used to be?"
3,"My brother molested me when I was 10.. 5 years later, I had no where to go when my mom...kicked me out over and over, i went there cause they were the only people who promised a break from my mom's constant downing I was 15...  My brother raped me for three months did I fight, no, was I on heavy amounts of Xanax .. yes.I slept through an entire police raid, if stay here, i will literally think about it for the next year, lile.why didn't I try to stop him.. idk..i always freeze or try to make My brain stop, that's a thing in my brain I ain't found yet, it's all really fuzzy  and the factor in most my guilt because I don't know.  But that was your way of telling me how badly u needed me gone... I know...I can't stop thinking about that now.  shot, sent to war, and raped  again and outcasted and I learned from that point,  I'm probably going to die. U ever wanted something so bad, life changing and one phone call.. took it from me,, I wish I couldve gone back and not called Casey,  he called the police.. everything changed for me.. the only shot i was ever given was taken because I didn't keep.it.to myself..I was 20. My life sucked.. And I saw the future..i.knew.... it's crazy the irony of my life, I've been married twice wasn't in love with anyone until I met my SO, is that selfish to think the person I feel for, musta felt the same? My existence was horrible before you and it has slowly gone back.to that feelingbefore I met u... I think it was the darkness inside u that.i  related, I was always hopeful we could turn it from black to gray. It was lightening up for a while and I was slapped in the face when he came out as bisexual and especially into transwomen, u don't need a man who pays to be a girl, if u have one.. I can order a dick of any size.. I don't get it. Why I couldn't be you're life, u never understood you were everything and more.. my last dollar.. my last cigg..idk. that guy who made me feel confident has now shown Me how I could never compete with your hottie... I cant..After 7 years of being together, traveling the country together.. tearing down and building up. We're a horrible couple but that's what made us strong.. our unacknowledged pain, and how hard we denied it but always forgave each other when it surfaced because we knew.. . I started losing my denial when u came out, I didn't understand it and I wished u never did. Stonewalling me, gaslighting me... like u didnt understand it took everything to put that effort in and I did it because I wanted u to be happy even at the cost of me, I'd be okay.. . chump change when I compare to when I hear u really laugh, when u smile withoutforce ... Boys Girls aliens, I've never truly desired anyone but you, my entire Ora brain reiwired when I knew I couldn't make u happy, that changed my life.. U were beating the living literally living shit out of me and I felt like you were taking my life, my body, and it was at anytime u could end that for me.. so I found a way to feel somewhat in control of MY BODY. you never have to think about me again.. but it WAS always my body and that was my solice in dark times. It made me come back to me, and it kept me going when I LET people do what I ALLOWED THEM to DO MY body. You were wrong when you realized u couldn't forgive me and u stayed. U were wrong for never allowing me to feel, or me to ask necessary questions that weren't meant to shame u but to understand. I lose the battle because I don't understand it. I can't find a reason how anyone falls that deeply out of love with me and in love with something so logically ugly, guess we were always attracted to broken unacknowledged pain.. I can't figure out why no matter how hard I tried I couldn't change us. I don't know why you couldn't understand what I did was out of a really a lost place... as yours is too. For the last two years... I just wanted u Back the most.. I needed you.. and you were gone. Idk. I was really trying to be normal to make up for what I did. I was. I died at your hands more then once..... isn't that a rebirth? Don't I get another shot at life? No. I wished it worked that way. I'm sorry I don't understand why we couldn't find each other in the dark places. I'm sorry. I really mean it.. every time I say it. But you are now unacknowledging your own pain, and mine. I truly can't go home.. I can't stay here.. I feel like a retarded burden who can't grasp unlogical situations. Even through the chaos everything made sense.. it hasn't since u told me I could never be your fantasy.. when you shared your fantasy.. I died. It was always my goal to make u happy through my black areas.. because u always did. We stopped. But then I saw you get lighter without me. I saw enough to know, I need to go. Why should I be miserable, make u miserable when one of us has a shot.. that's where I am. U won't find me for a while, thats if I can stop being a coward.. a baby.. a loser for more then 10 minutes. 

Maybe it's not fair, but your were my support.. I was yours until this..  I'm sorry I can't be stronger, I'm sorry.  I can't imagine a future. It's not black, it's just abyss. And I can't do it alone, I can't. I'm sorry dude. I never could translate, i.hope you can understand in this last weird brain memo, I'm sorry I hurt you, i.was trying to ease my pain. I'm sorry. I'll miss you guys.. not really, all feeling stops and Im excited about that. I haven't had a break. I need one. I love you both."
3,"I was so sure this was my one. This was my girl and I messed it up. I fucked it all up. 

God, I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself.

I wanna die. I actually want to stop breathing. It hurts too much anyway. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck."
3,"hello!! im not sure if this is allowed so pls admins take this down if it isn't but i'm seriously desperate and didn't know who else to turn to

Im really unwell at the moment (I have a chronic illness + mental health issues) and am struggling to scrape money together for food and bills, and my therapist just hit me w a $180 bill (hopefully I will get some back on medicare) but i was wondering if anyone could even spare $1 that would help me so much so I can eat this week and pay my electricity just until i can get back on my feet and if you can't then pls dont but i didn't know what else to do!! I would be seriously so grateful and once im financially okay again and able to I would donate the amount I received to a charity (either LGBT+ youth related or BPD related) so that it would be paid forward !!

3,"Sooooo this is a huge victory for me. I struggled *so much* with my sense of self and didn’t know who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. 

I graduated high school in 2013 and left my home at 17 with only a backpack filled with everything I could fit in it. I established myself 650 miles from where I grew up, with no financial help from parents. 

I tried multiple programs but could literally *never* find something that truly fed me and who would lead me to an actual job. 

My life was chaos. I was homeless for a while (I was lucky enough to stay at a friends place so I was never out on the streets), I couldn’t afford basic necessities, I couldn’t pay my rent. I did sex work for a while. I was in unhealthy relationships. 

It was hard. But I’m quite persistent. 

In 2018 I met my partner. In 2019 I landed an amazing job that totally fuelled my passion for education and gave me purpose. In 2020 we moved into a great apartment. In 2021 we got engaged and I just got into my masters. In a year we’ll be married and he’ll have graduated from an engineering program. 

I turned 25 last months and for the first time in my life I know who I am and I’m safe. 

Life just gets so much better, just keep swimming."
3,"I got diagnosed with BPD when I was 18 (I’m 21 now) and I’ve began to think it was done too rashly by a doctor I only saw a couple of times.

I often read posts here and I find it hard to relate. I don’t fear abandonment, in fact I get over things faster than the average person so abandonment would be no issue to me and in relationships it’s usually the other person who clings to me and I’ve been called uncaring even when I’m not. 

My emotions are rather fleeting, sometimes I feel like I never felt at all because everything is just whatever to me although I’m still an enthusiastic person (if you get it).

My self-esteem is good, I don’t care what people think about me but I do have unstable relationships because I have a tendency to act out and I get angry easily.

 I can’t handle boredom and basically I do stupid stuff all the time (hard drugs, pick fights, shoplift, etc) and i’m super impulsive, it’s really hard for me to resist temptation so I also cheat easily and I find it fun to play with people’s feelings (I suspect it’s because drama kills the feelings of boredom that I dread).

I don’t self harm although I used to when I was younger, don’t feel suicidal, don’t dissociate although I’ve had a psychotic episode or two. 

My opinions change fast and I might suddenly dislike someone for no reason and people have called me unstable, I feel like people take life too seriously and that’s why I just do whatever just because. 

But why was I diagnosed with BPD? Could it be a misdiagnosis? I find it really hard to relate to this sub especially with people who are clingy and say they feel too much

Edit: My life is in a constant state of chaos as I’m in trouble with the law often, can’t hold onto jobs and have a ton of debt so maybe that plays into it?"
3,I always feel like I'm going to die soon and it's an intense feeling that comes over me. Has an almost crippling effect and makes me get consumed in my head. End up not moving for like 10 minute periods just thinking and being stuck in my head.
3,My friends say they worry about my mental health but don’t leave me alone and ask me what’s wrong when it’s convenient for them and when i say i don’t wanna talk about it or i just need some space for a while they won’t leave me alone until i tell them which makes me angry. they invite me out but when i go they straight up ignore me which makes me feel stupid and i regret ever leaving my house ever. i feel like crying when i’m surrounded by people who say they care but ignore me when they want to. i don’t understand this. why?
3,"He cut me out....AGAIN. My ex and I chose to be friends after some time apart. Things were ok at first, then I started to get upset because his words and actions never matched up. We'd get in arguments because of how he was treating me, and his lying, it caused me to have some mental breakdowns. I started to have major issues trusting what came out of his mouth and needed constant reassurance. The first two times he cut me out, I became suicidal as he's been a huge part of my life for years. Despite how he's treated me, I always miss him like crazy and want him in my life. I feel a sense of relief when he comes back. 
He took me out for my birthday brunch 5 days ago. He wrote me the most beautiful birthday card apologizing for how he's treated me...that I deserve better, how he's going to be a better friend to me, how I have such a good heart...Well then during brunch, I found out he lied again and lost it...started crying at the table and having a panic attack. We went back to my house and it continued. When he was about to leave, I became clingy and begged him to stay. I was scared he was going to leave me, cut me out again. He reassured me that was not going to happen, then he left. I even asked if he was just saying that so he could leave, and he said no. For reassurance, I gave him my spare house keys, to promise me he wouldn't cut me out.

Well I've tried to contact him a few times and no response. I've been completely ignored, and he's been active on social media. I haven't been suicidal yet, but I'm in so much pain and dealing with severe anxiety..the ruminating won't stop. I've completely lost my appetite and already lost a few lbs, I can't sleep and wake up with panic attacks at night. I've called the crisis hotline for support numerous times. This has broken me. I just want to hear from him, for everything to be okay. I don't know how to get through this...how do I stop this pain? This is severely and negatively affecting my life."
3,"I was thinking about this... all my past relationships.. family, some friends, and boyfriends have all used my mental health against me. I’ve told them and confided in them and trusted them. a lot I didn’t even tell I had BPD, I mostly just said I had anxiety and depression because of the stigma that BPD gets. but they even used those things against me and called me crazy and it’s just stuck with me. 

now I’m at the point where I’m 21 years old and I think I completely loathe myself. honestly, I’m at a point where my life is completely coming crashing down. and I’m not sure if this cycle will ever stop. I need to learn how to manage these emotions and not be so self destructive in the ways that I cope. 

all i think about myself are negative things. and it’s gotten to the point where I don’t even know who I am anymore or what to believe about myself. I’m in a complete mental crisis and I just don’t know how to come out on the other end."
3,"Hiya reddit. I’m a 28F and was recently diagnosed with BPD after a breakup led me to a fit of rage in which I punched a doorway and broke my hand. 

I can’t even begin to express my gratitude for finding this community. There are some struggles, like favorite person obsessions and extreme romantic fantasies, that made me feel so alienated and broken and weird. I also find it amazing how we all seem to write and compose our thoughts similarly. I bet we share a lot of the same gifts as well as challenges. 

I’m posting today because I’m at the stage in diagnosis where I’m feeling hopeless. I’m currently single, unemployed, slowly chipping away at my graduate degree and raising a beautiful 3yo daughter while I attempt to get my shit together. Now that I’m acknowledging my disorder, it feels like this insurmountable obstacle. I need some encouragement. Is anyone out there doing alright? Happily partnered? Made it through grad school? Kicking it unmedicated? Raising kiddos successfully? 

Please share your wins... I need to see them. I’m starting to feel like this BPD situation is going to keep taking everything from me and I’m terrified of treading in place until I die."
3,"It always seems like I can't explain myself, what I deal with and so on to many people. It's something that is consistent, and makes it hard to keep on going and explaining it to people. I just want to explain it so people understand more.

There's things like when you attempt to talk about what you go through and what not where it then gets lessened by the other person whether intentionally or not. Their responses like ""oh we all like that *sometimes*"", (I had another example on my mind but forgot), or they talk about how they are and what it's like in attempt to relate only for me to be sat there thinking ""you really don't understand what I said, or I explained it super poorly."" In the moment it can feel really invalidating, but as I have heard said before, people can only relate with their own experiences. 

When it comes to other people like on here or someone I know locally who has BPD, usually the blanks in explaination can be filled in and understood because well.. you are both dealing with the same beast. If that makes sense.

I just want people to understand, and to support me. Know that I spend almost all my time absorbed in something like a game or something else so that I don't think about things. Maybe, it would be nice if more people knew the chaos I was dealing with internally instead of just assuming.

Anyways, sorry for the long post. I just kind of want to know what others may experience on this. I love you all and I know there are some people here I have communicated with who have been wonderful."
3,"So I’ve cross-posted this in an eating disorder specific sub, but figure eating disorders cross over with BPD a lot & I thought I might post here too... 

For some reason, no matter what stage of “recovery” I’m in from my eating disorder - which was previously anorexia, now not underweight or engaging in as many behaviours, so probably OSFED - I (24nb) cannot seem to kick a few behaviours that are interfering with my day to day life. 

The most annoying one is that I simply *have* to have less calories than whoever is eating with me, & will not eat anything that isn’t “safe” unless there are other people there so I can can eat less than them, therefore deeming whatever I do eat as “safe” (less = safe). For example, if I make hot drinks I usually take mine with 1 sugar & a dash milk, my partner has 3-4 sugars & dash of milk. However, if someone else is around that also takes 1 sugar & milk, I make theirs with a heaped teaspoon of sugar, & mine with my regular, pedantically level teaspoon of sugar. *Sometimes* in the past, when had a housemate I didn’t like, I would put more milk & sugar in her tea/coffee with the spiteful thought *”she’s going to get fat”* or whatever.. yeah, I know. Crazy. 

It extends into everything I consume, which is very difficult because I am mainly in control of cooking meals in my household (just me & my boyfriend, sometimes my other boyfriend is round for dinner). If I wasn’t cooking for my partner, I would exclusively eat “safe”, disordered meals.. which sadly I do when he’s at work, or starve until he gets home. 

It’s this weird cycle of absolutely loving to cook & eat, but the disordered thoughts are always replacing my milk with soy, coconut milk & cheese with LIGHT products, serving myself up 1 spoon of rice & covering it in sauce to be sneaky, or freaking out that things are spoiled; I feel like a teenager hiding these silly behaviours. 

Some other, less concerning but equally annoying behaviours/intrusive thoughts I cannot seem to shake are: I cannot eat anything that has been out on the bench that has left my sight, due to an unimaginable fear that flies have laid eggs on it. I cannot consume food after I have seen maggots or flies because I convince myself they (maggots or fly eggs) are in my mouth. Or rather, I try to convince myself they’re not, that’s how strong the feeling is.

3,"I'm completely in shock. 

I've been looking for a diagnosis my whole life and my psych just casually throws it at me while we were on an unscheduled call just now. 

I want to call someone I love to celebrate but I don't know who to tell. I don't know who will understand how much of a relief it is to finally fucking know what's wrong with me. 

We even have a plan in place to start treating it right away, I'm already on my way to the pharmacy for new meds. 

Losing my mind with conflicting emotions right now but I really just want someone to talk to about it.

It's a beautiful day to be diagnosed!"
3,"Do you think you can address trauma by recreating in media and having it resolved like you wish it could? I think about it, but then I wonder how despairing it would feel when it just never happens like that."
3,"I was just reading that BPD is most presented in women, which made me wonder about you guys.

Have you ever had a problem with getting help as it is an illness mostly common with women?

Do you experience it differently, for instance ADHD can be very different in women and men?

I’m sorry if I sound insensitive or anything but I just got very curious reading about it."
3,"I met a boy online in a mental health venting community about a month ago, and it turned out we lived really close so we've met up twice since then as well as just messaging every single day. He's the most caring person I've ever met, as well as really cute, charismatic, funny, just perfect. I developed a crush as well as an intense FP attachment to him extremely fast.

The problem is he's severely depressed, has attempted suicide more times than I can count only since I've met him, and isn't ready to accept any kind of help. I've tried (and failed) to help him through suicidal nights a few times and I feel completely helpless because I've realized there's nothing I can do to help him. I have since told myself that I can't try to talk people out of suicide again because it puts a massive toll on me, but it's so hard to see him in pain.

We have good communication and have talked a lot about our friendship, and last night it came to a point where he told me he knows how much seeing him in pain hurts and worries me and he doesn't want to put that stress on me anymore. I'm so terrified that this means he's about to abandon me ""for my own good"" or something. I've tried communicating how deeply attached I am to him but I'm scared of explaining the FP thing because I don't want to scare him off. But he's convinced I'd be better off without him and I'm broken. He's 90% of what I think about and I don't know what I'd do if he left me and I had no indication of whether he's even still alive. This hurts so much."
3,"I mean, it’s so exhausting and not funny anymore. It’s out of control. I can’t stop watching his videos, podcasts, photos, stalking him. He has kids and wife and I feel so jealous. This is the person I don’t even know!!! I dont even know this man, but i got so depressed to the point of crying! He might be a jerk irl. But I can’t help it.."
3,"Anyone else have a difficult time when it comes to work? No matter what the actual job is you just feel that you're a waste of space there, that you don't perform as well as others. Just constantly putting yourself down and feeling super anxious to the point that you're almost sick before work. I never had a problem with holding a job. But I'm so sick and tired of dreading my job despite what it is. And this anxiety is starting to catch up to me. Thanks for letting me vent and if you have any advice It would be much appreciated. Stay safe guys."
3,"DAE realise how stupid and unnecessary it is to not want to speak to your friends + family but you feel like you have to keep shut. i feel like if i speak to them i’m giving them more privilege than i should (because they hate me, they’re plotting against me, why should i talk to them? it would be kicking myself in the foot)"
3,"In my adolescence, when untreated and undiagnosed, I routinely did bad things for the appraisal of my friends and bullies. Such things stretch across a spectrum from minor incidents to irredeemable, criminalising incidents. I have hurt a great many people, and I cannot excuse my behaviour. I am a despicable person who deserves but death. I am sorry."
3,"I practically cried for hours straight and starved myself for weeks because right after I came back from ditching all my mates for a whole month, they made a comment about me being fat while I was already starving myself most days and losing weight rapidly but I still went back to them a while after that happened but I still starve myself. Is it bad or am I normal for a person with bpd?"
3,"I had a close friend who was bpd. She did a number of questionable things like in the beginning claimed she had this ex that was terrorizing her life, that he had access to her phone somehow and was watching her every move and listening to every phone call. She even told everyone at our workplace this was happening. I had asked further questions about this over time and... yeah I really didn't believe her. She would even tell every guy she hung out with that she was being spied on, and would then call me freaking out absolutely convinced that they were doing it too and downloaded some spy program her ex supposedly used since she told them about it. I kind of asked.. well if your so afraid of it happening again then why tell anyone at all? She didn't have much of an answer. She really had this paranoia of being spied on or that people wanted her so badly that they were going to these great lengths. Just overall she seemed like she was going through some major crisis that, as I got to know her seemed to be exaggerations or just plain bs. She called me daily to talk about herself and her life.. I was really going through a rough time when we were friends. Despite that I really made a solid effort to help and be a patient understanding friend and it just really felt super unreciprocated. she just seemed to think the world revolved around her. And when I was doing really poorly with my depression and drug use, dealing with my fathers sudden death. it seemed like she was angry and impatient I wasn't there to play armchair therapist for her. Seemed like she only wanted me to feel better so she could use me as an emotional dumping ground, and that the relationship wasn't really as meaningful for her as it was for me, I felt used. I was leaving for a work trip early in the morning once and hadn't packed yet. But since she had something important to do I agreed to watch her daughter free of charge to show i'm a good friend. When she gets back she hangs out for a few hours and then wouldn't even give me a ride home, I acted like it was cool and I got she was tired but I was shocked and disappointed. I really felt like the relationship was based on what I could do for her over time and one day I just cut her off."
3," 27. Been working since I'm 18. I get fired 50% of the time. Through the years I got diagnosed, there's a clear pattern of illness getting worse over time.

I'm having a rough moment in life. I've just been taking my med and forcing myself to sleep since last weekend (anti-depressant that makes you sleep, not recreational drugs). Lots of dreaming so it's not like I'm resting while sleeping. I've basically been bedridden since last friday and only recently I'm coming out of bed and my back hurts but that's another story.

I can't work like this, I haven't worked at all for the last two weeks. I just pretend I'm working. Job is definitely taking me to the edge, superiors have started making demands and scolding me because of my fault.

This has been my fault, I've stopped seeing my doctor for a while, now he doesn't want me as a patient. I've tried to force myself to be employed through this hell and I only keep a job for some weeks only to get fired. I actually wish I was in the psych ward right now. Last week I was going to start crying and my mother just told me to fuck off and cry somewhere else. I'm back to living with parents and I can't expect support from them, they're doctors, they shouldn't have to put up with this, I recognize that.

Right now I just wish I had nothing to worry about. I don't even care about financial ruin.

I don't even know how to quit, I have lots of pending very important reports."
3,"and this guy online living like soooo many miles away is talking to me??? and for over a year now? i don’t know how that happens because i’ve never talked to someone for so long. undoubtedly, it is on and off, but in the end it’s still there. i don’t know why it happens. it’s so embarrassing. i hate it. i don’t trust them. i’m so paranoid over it. why is he doing this? what does he want from me? what the fuck. i hate him. what the hell is he thinking. oh my god. like just stay away from me. give up. are you seriously gonna play with me like that?? i’m not a toy. i don’t trust them. but that’s just my paranoia right? i can’t tell if this is intuition or paranoia. i can’t tell!! all rationality goes out the window when it comes to relationships w ppl i have romantic feelings towards?? 

everytime they give me attention i feel like a giddy schoolgirl fangirling over a celebrity!! and then i hate them afterwards. i just don’t trust them. i can’t trust anybody like that. i’ll never. i can’t let myself. i hate them but i want them 

it’s so embarrassing talking about them and coming up with all these scenarios in my head and trying to figure how to go about them. trying to avoid thinking about them. trying to avoid talking to them. trying to distance myself away from them. then it comes crashing down the second they message me and then again the cycle repeats itself afterwards. i don’t trust them. im saying all this and it just confirms that i’m obsessing when i don’t want to be. it’s embarrassing and humiliating. it makes me feel weak and powerless."
3,"Lately, I’m very nasty and mean. It’s like all the empathy I learned in therapy has dissipated, and I am back at square one. Ever since I stopped taking my lamictal, I’ve been exceptionally mean and unfeeling. It’s like there’s a hole in the spot where there’s supposed to be consideration and empathy. My bf thinks I’m very “cold,” “narcissistic” and “shallow” sometimes, and it’s bad because it’s like I lost the motivation to care. I have not been called narcissistic since high school, and I haven’t been this mean in a very long time. I cannot stand being this nasty to people, but again, there’s a lack of feeling to care, and idk why. Is it a self-hatred/ insecurity thing? Is it that my medication is drastically affecting my moods? why am i lacking motivation to care in the moment, and then when I hurt people, I feel remorse?"

Like your life is just running it's course and while you try to grasp any concept of what reality is, your brain just implodes on itself and your stuck back at square 1?. I have this feeling constant and it never goes away. Sure I use meds and what not to clear my head but then boom I do dumb shit like drink for 3 days in a row. Like why do I do that when I tell myself every day ""don't be an idiot, don't be an idiot""?. I'm in school, always wanted to go to school, and now I'm in school and I'm like ""fuck this"". Like why?. What the fuck is wrong with me dude?."
3,"All I'm trying to do is host a bbq this Saturday. Why is this so triggering? I've ended up inviting 10 people which is way too many considering the circumstances also my parents wouldn't alow that many. I'm so so paranoid that everyone secretly hates me and are making up excuses to not come. I'm being super needy asking for confirmation because I can't stand when people say ""maybe"". I'm worried that it will be a flop and I'll make a fool of myself. Idk what to do."
3,"Note: I’m sorry about my grammar I don’t know English well and when I was signed up for my English class I ended up in the hospital and had to drop it and my counselor isn’t helping me join the class so ya.

So I’ve tried DBT for a year and I’m going to be honest it’s just not working and my psychologist is constantly booked so I have no one to talk to about my problems when I absolutely need to. I recently had my biggest breakdown because of my bpd pretty sure I could’ve gotten myself killed if I did said action to the wrong person then again that person really chose to fudge me over when I was on my last straw. So leading up to this event which occurred Monday or Tuesday (last week) Sunday my boyfriends dad basically gave us an eviction notice and of course Monday I had my behind the wheel test I was stressed the whole time and the guy that was with me profiled my instructor he said “I haven’t seen his kind around here” which really got me going I ended up failing which didn’t make me upset but ya and I found out at the end of the day that my boyfriends dad just said what he said to get us riled up I’m not sure if it was this day or the day after when the straw just broke and I was at Starbucks with my mom and this black suv cut us off and oh my god that was just it I got out stood in front of her car and said “Back the fudge up” then she tried to argue with me saying she didn’t see us HOW DO YOU NOT SEE A YUKON XL THAT IS BIGGER THAN YOUR TAHOE YOU’RE EITHER USED TO FUDGING PEOPLE OVER OR YOU’RE RECKLESS AND DON’T WATCH WHERE YOU ARE DRIVING then she tried to scare me by driving up closer I told her I wasn’t letting her ruin my day even more then the passenger told her something and she backed out and drove off. I messaged my psychologist right after  then felt helpless because he said I should go to the DBT class again which he knows I don’t have time for (work) and when I called his office the next morning because I thought hey maybe they’ll let me have a one time appointment with a different psychologist that’s available they told me no and that they were going to transfer me to a suicide hotline which pissed me off all I did was ask for someone to speak to."
3,"Being that almost all of us probably suffered abandonment abuse and neglect from our parents, what are things you never got to learn from your parents that might help others?

For me the biggest is they refused to teach me to drive or help in anyway. I'm 24 and finally about to get a license

My mother has refused repeatedly to give me tax information so I could get fafsa and go to college, but I'm finally old enough to do it without her.

Other things like my dad being gone hand never taught me to shave, tie a tie, talk to girls, etc.

My parents being separated I never learned about proper relationships and love.

 being abused and neglected I never learned to trust people and never learned the whole worlds not trying to hurt me and use me.

They let me drop out of highschool and didnt do anything after multiple suicide attempts as a teenager and my step father used to beat the shit out of me and kick me out for weeks at a time. I had no self value and self worth and no way so young to get help on my own.

I dont know. Theres so much that normal parents do that many of ours didnt and I really would like to know what lessons and things you guys learned later on that you should have learned in loving family.
I love you r/bpd family🖤"

3,"CW/ sh and substance use

Hi, I’m new here and just got diagnosed with BPD not very long ago. I’ve had a very difficult time coping with this diagnosis, as I have been misdiagnosed constantly by mental health professionals since freshman year of HS (I’m a college sophomore now). Friday night, I had one of the worst episodes of my life. Triggered by rejection by a guy I had been talking to, I immediatley spiraled. I have been s*lf h*rm*ng since sophomore year of highschool, and in January relapsed and have been struggling since. I went to my room alone and started s*lf h*rm*ng and called my mom and just screamed at her about how badly she fucked me up. My mom has never taken my mental health seriously and growing up, made me feel ashamed constantly. 

Normally when I’ve had episodes in the past (not knowing that’s what it was since I was undiagnosed at the time) I would word vomit out of anger/hopelessness. But Friday it was on another level. I had been drinking a lot (which I’m starting to realize I do when I’m having an episode) and cussed out my mother and told her about my drinking, smoking weed, being an atheist etc. (My parents are very conservative and my mothers dad was an alcoholic). The next day I was so ashamed when I woke up I couldn’t even function. Is it a common thing to say these types of things during an episode? Does anyone else feel so disgusted with themselves for outbursting like this?

I planned on ignoring my mother until she reached out to me, but last night I called her with the intention of explaining why BPD caused me to have this reaction, but she invalidated my diagnosis and called me an attention seeker. How do you deal with loved ones rejecting your BPD? I feel so alone, and then her saying that makes me doubt myself and that I am an attention seeker, even though I know that’s not the truth:( help"
3,I am going to start taking therapy from some psychologist at the weekend and i decided to look at her photos. When i looked at them i noticed that i got restless for some fucking reason. Im not even sure but i think i felt like something bad was going to happen to her or i felt jealous. This happens to me when i have an fp in my life. Seeing them around other people really gives me anxiety. I dont even know why this is happening. Any ideas?
3,"Hi guys! This is my first time making a post here. I'm struggling currently with feeling much of anything. I've landed on the numb side the past few days. But I haven't even been able to feel empathy? I go through these periods where I cant feel anything at all, even empathy. No deep thoughts, no meaningful sentences. It's like my brain took a vacation. Anyone else out there?"
3,"TW: suicidal thoughts, friendship conflicts, swearing, abandonment 

my best friend (L) (20f) and i (21f) got into a really bad fight almost two months ago. i need to objectively know if i am being exhausting. we got into a heated argument all because of a scheduling conflict. she accused me of replacing her with another close friend of mine (K), which could not be further from the truth. both of these friends are of equal importance to me. it was my birthday and K and i were supposed to go out for drinks but we had to reschedule due to bad weather. unfortunately, we had to reschedule for the following day, when i was supposed to see my best friend. the plans with L were never set in stone, and we never had a time set. however, L initially was not bothered by the possibility of rescheduling and was actually excited because we planned on bringing another mutual friend (B) with us that upcoming weekend. B was coming from out of state. i thought this would be a great idea so that L, B, and i could go all go out to eat together and catch up! a few days pass, and L completely switches up on me. during these few days she was still sending me memes and shit like normal. the day before we have plans to go she starts accusing me of shit like, “you’re replacing me with K because she lives closer,” “you’re throwing me away for someone you’ve only known for a few months” (K and i were coworkers for a long time), “you only see me when it’s convenient for you” (i offered to drive out to her not that long ago but her boyfriend said he didn’t want any company at the last minute), and she just kept making me feel awful and brought me to tears. my mom heard me on the phone with L and wanted to know what was going on. she says, “L stop treating (me) like shit. She’s sitting here crying” and L says, “well it didn’t sound like she was crying. you’re invalidating MY feelings.” we were so shocked tbh. honestly, i could go on and on but that’s the gist of it. shit just kept getting worse. ultimately, she ended up blocking me, which she knows is a HUGE trigger for me. i apologized a million times, my mom tried to talk to her, my boyfriend tried to talk to her, everything. she won’t speak to me. she absolutely hates me and says i invalidated her feelings. she sent one of her friends after me, and her friend just annihilated me about how i’m such a shitty person to do this to L. tbh, i don’t even know what i’m apologizing for, but i feel like i did SOMETHING wrong. i have tried calling her and texting her multiple times but nothing. i am absolutely devastated and questioning everything, especially since we have  had a tumultuous past with arguing. however, it’s never been this bad. she always gets mad at me, and i don’t know what i’m doing wrong. i’m sorry if this made actually no sense, but i’m really having a hard time. i feel like i’m an awful person, and i just feel so sorry for everything. i wish i could redo everything. even if you just took the time to read this, thank you."
3,I have 0 friends or anything. I avoid even getting close to anyone. I want it so bad. I just want to love and be loved 100%. Why can’t I have this in life. My family gave me zero love and now that’s all I get in the dating world too. I’m tired 😞
3,"I’m gonna first start out by saying that i’ve been on these new meds and they make me feel like I’m going insane. But these feelings also feel kinda real. I desperately need any ounce of support. My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 5 years now. I suffer from BPD, and he’s been the person I’ve been co-dependent on throughout our relationship. He suffers with depression/anxiety and possible other mental health issues.

We moved into his hometown together in May of last year and got our first apartment in July. I have been the one paying the bills and rent this entire time since then. I’ve been unemployed up until a month ago, barely keeping everything afloat by driving for delivery services. my mental health problems have worsened significantly and i’ve been going through the worst episode i’ve ever had since then. he has not been working or doing anything to progress with his life, he tells me that it is his mental health in the way. he has not gotten the help he needs despite telling me he will. he tells me that he doesn’t want to be this way and that he doesn’t want to keep hurting me and watching me struggle but he can’t seem to muster up the courage to go get help. i’ve been patient for so long and giving everything i can to show him that i support him, mothering everything he does even. i’m so unhappy. he tells me that he loves me so much and i believe him but i also believe that he’s codependent on me as well.

I feel like i’m in an eternal struggle right now. I feel so much resentment towards him and I’m not sure if i’m even attracted to him anymore, but I also feel like I need him. I’m not sure if i’m in love with him or if i despise him or both. he’s incredibly sweet towards me but at the same time kind of mean towards me and i don’t like who he’s becoming. i want to have hope that he’ll someday get the help he needs and it’ll be okay. i want to be believe that he’s the love of my life and that he’s still the guy i fell in love with because he does still have those great qualities but is hurting me so bad at the same time. i’m afraid to leave because he’s all i’ve ever known for the past 5 years. i’m afraid of being alone. i’m afraid of regretting my decision. i’m afraid of life never being the same. i’m actually terrified that i won’t make it. what if i never find anybody better. i think i actually love him. i don’t know. i feel crazy. i’m sorry"
4,How do you deal with poor impulse control?
4,"I started taking lithium 2 years ago and changed my life. I had no bad side-effects,  I'm happy, in control and I lost so much weight I'm now in great shape psychically and mentally.

Thing is I'm terrified of kidney, liver or thyroid problems. I'm so worried about having to deal with any or all of them but at the same time how can I even let go of lithium. I tried a whole bunch of pills before but nothing came even close to the effectiveness of lithium.

Are there any other solutions out there as good as lithium?"
4,"Not sure where to start so I will pick here. Right now I feel like letting every manic urge I'm feeling just fucking run wild. Most of that was drinking, lots of meaningless sex with random girls, spending money I don't have, drugs, starting 15 new projects at once.

Slight TL;DR: Took psych evals and they didn't show up as bipolar. My brain constantly thinks things like ""hey you can't be that depressed because other people are more depressed and kill themselves"". So I answer slightly depressed. These evals were after I went to the ER so I didn't kill myself. 

Now onto my story/problem.. I was reading and something said to not compare yourself to others in regards to things in life because your feelings only need to be validated by how they make you feel. I may be poor compared to someone like those three richest guys but that doesn't matter. I make decent money and am shit at budgeting. I feel poor because I have more than enough and I can't make it work properly. I feel anxiety really bad, I'm sweating having trouble breathing or functioning. I must not have that bad anxiety because others have panic attacks. Instead I decided to realize that I'm having literal panic attacks and downplaying it to my psychologist and psychiatrist. I've decided to let myself feel those feelings and compare them to my center.

So far it's been fucking brutal. I spent decades pretending I could bottle my feelings and I could fix my mental issues alone. Self medicating with alcohol doesn't work because my demons can swim. My psychologist said that I'm what they call ""flat"" and that my outward emotional expression is really hard to read and mostly neutral. The only time he said there is a change is when we talk about something I'm interested in and I seem slightly excited. It also turns out that most people don't get asked if they are autistic in their lives. Ive been asked several times. High processing speed and emotionless has gotten me called a robot by people close to me.

So far I've been diagnosed with adhd, bi-polar, not bi-polar, GAD, PTSD, not PTSD, persistive depressive disorder severe with anxious distress, and the Doc at the mental hospital also had an opinion but I can't remember. I spent a week at the mental and felt like the doctors didn't take me seriously because of my ""flat"" personality and my comparison to others rather than to myself.

I answered honestly to my psychiatrist on the intake and she takes me seriously in a way the others don't. She said I presented with bipolar. My SO also said I might be bipolar. I talked to my psychologist and explained how I didn't feel I was as honest as I could have been. I explained some of my behaviors that have been happening since I was a kid. He is on my team now. I picked him as a psychologist because he is dry like I am and he doesn't let me walk around the hard stuff. The other people I had went to were really easy for me to change the subject and not deal with it.g

I dont feel like I wasted time because I learned a bunch about myself along the way I may have otherwise missed.  Every moment can be a learning moment and life's journey and the path of getting healthier mentally can be a long winding road that is about the journey rather than the end.

As most people do I thought bipolar was just the ups and downs. Depressed or Manic. My SO told me I didn't know enough about bipolar and I should do some reading. Turns out it's a complicated beast.

I've been paying more attention to my feelings and where I'm at during the day and night. At first I started feeling like my mood was rapid cycling, like within minutes of each other. As I paid more attention to my mood I started thinking about things that have given me that feeling before. So I'm feeling that feeling and then adding another memory doubling up my feelings. Feeling sad, lonely and not being good enough? Well let's add the memories of when my close friend overdosed or when my friend shot herself in the face. Feeling happy and relaxed? Let's remember those times like the birth of my kids or spending quality time with my close family. The happy feelings don't last that long as they are chased down by feelings of nostalgia. My brain tells me that times won't ever be that good again and the best has passed. The books the happiness trap and feeling good have been a good help on getting over my cognitive distortions.

Currently I'm medicated for bipolar disorder and it helps but I'm bad at eating well and sleeping right.

My feelings today have been strange to me as I get further into this journey. I feel manic and depressed at the same time often. There are times where I just feel manic or depressed but they seem to be combined most often. For example today I woke up exhausted and took my meds. I've been doing spring cleaning. I have my house from my divorce and I've been cleaning everything and getting all the junk and her stuff out of my house. I was feeling manic and motivated. While getting stuff done I felt surrounded by the ghosts of the past in my house. Lots of memories coming back. I remembered coming home the day my younger one was born and holding him in my bed and falling asleep with him in my arms. I remembered laying on my bed with the door locked crying my eyes out for what seemed to be no apparent reason and being unable to stop. I didnt want my kids to see me like that. That was the night I used the suicide text number.

My psychologist told me that I'm always doing something whether it's whatever new project I started (way to many unfinished), whatever to do list I made and I seemed to be hiding from myself.

I got a lot done today on my to do list while feeling this strong emotions. I'm trying to get my house to the point that I can manage it as a 50% dad and not have it look like a whirlwind hit it. 

After I got to a point where I felt I got enough done for the day I sat outside (left my phone inside) and just threw the Frisbee for my dog. I was told to just be and that mindfulness would be very beneficial to me enjoying life more. It felt nice to feel the sun on my skin, on my face, the warmth of it through my clothes, the light breeze gently blowing my hair, how happy my dog was just being. It was really nice. I came back inside and sat on my couch and just let all those thoughts I had set aside flood through me. I cried. I cried so fucking hard for about 15 minutes. I felt so down after for about an hour while being restless on my couch and feeling some extreme anxiety. During this time all I wanted to do was finish my to do list.

Maybe these mixed episodes are just a phase but it's really hard to process and go through. I feel a duality inside me and it's impossible for it to continue forever without me losing my shit.

I know this is rambling but it feels like where I'm at right now. The anxiety meds made me tired for about 15 minutes and now im wide awake. I used to write a lot and somewhere a long the line my ability to read and write has gone away but I feel the writing is coming back. Thanks for reading."
4,"I’ve had a shitload of Uni assignments and it will not get *any* lighter until mid-may. I’ve had such bad brain fog for days that I’m definitely going to miss a really really important deadline and my grade is going to take a hard hit. I’ve already missed deadlines, actually. I’m a little better today but I’m still definitely going to miss this deadline and get a reduced grade for a late assignment (god bless, they’ll accept it late instead of automatically failing me). It’s about 20% of my grade, too. Even the accommodations I have through the school are barely helping me. I know I’m not stupid, but man I *feel* stupid. 

How am I supposed to “be kind” to myself? This is quantifiable failure. I’m literally unable to do my work, I can’t do tasks on time. If this were a job I would be fired. There isn’t going to be a nice rest period and I can pick myself back up. This has serious long-term consequences and that’s just... how it is. But all the advice I see for when things get hard is just “be kind to yourself, be patient with yourself, let yourself rest.” I really can’t comprehend how I’m supposed to do that."
4,"Hi. I'm a teenaged girl (16f) currently suspecting I have bipolar disorder. The reason for suspecting this is twofold:My mother and sister have bipolar disorder, although only my mom is formally diagnosed. I would often watch her go from staying up late, working on housework and her job with little regard for her health one day, to crying over a bottle of beer contemplating suicide. The second reason is that my old therapist heavily suspected I had some sort of mood disorder due to my frequent, day to month long mood swings. So, I did what any reasonable person would do, and what any person here would tell me to do, and ask about possibly getting evaluated. I told him about the facts, alongside my comorbid diagnosis of executive dysfunction, but he refused to recommend evaluation, on the basis that he thought there was a high chance of misdiagnosis, and told me to come back if a bipolar symptom was actively hindering my function in life or causing problems. I don't know what to do now, because I really do think I need to get checked out for this issue, but should I pressure my therapist more on the issue? Look for a new therapist? Or try and just move on with my life?"
4,"I've never been one for conspiracy theories and other types of Qanon related horseshit. 

That being said!

I've come to realize that my delusions of grandeur and general paranoia, tend to be off-shoots of things that the average person could believe in. I guess there's probably a fine line to the whole thing though. But as mentioned, government agents after me/aliens/etc. have never been something I've personally believed in during episodes. I don't want to get into specifics, but thinking that you can take up say a musical instrument and assuming you put in the effort and time, you could be the best who ever lived that played that given instrument. Every skill out there is something you could master if you cared to put the time and effort in. 

On the paranoia side, for example when in an episode, you think every ache and pain no matter how minuscule is going to kill you because it's really some terminal illness finally manifesting itself. No amount of doctor visits serve to put your mind at ease for anything beyond a short amount of time. 

I feel like in some aspects this is all worse because other people don't really ever pick up on any of it, so you've got not real barometer for how bad any of it is. Unless of course you start acting out on the things which is another thing altogether. Is it worse when you're aware of it but fight with yourself to not act on stuff, or being unaware entirely? Though I'd say the latter just because of the capacity for damage that can be caused with it. I just feel like because I work so hard to keep outward actions/thoughts I'm uncertain about (which tends to be many of them) from being expressed, it gets tiresome as well."
4,My life is so shit
4,I am switching to Abilify from Zyprexa as I have used Zyprexa for a decade and a half and it’s not as effective as it used to be without getting into the more sedating dosages. I was told that Abilify I can take in the morning and it’s not as sedating. I am prescribed 2 mg. I’m nervous about taking it...can anyone tell me anything about their experience with it so that I have less anxiety about it? I don’t want to be sleeping for the rest of the week if this turns out to be something I’m uber sensitive to...
4,"Hey guys, new to this forum... I have bipolar 2 and have spent over a year in hospital and have tried everything from ECT to a cocktail of 10 meds. Right now I’m on Lamotrigine, Valproic Acid, Rexulti, Xanax as needed and then at night temazepam and seroquel. I still have really bad depression and this severe agitation sense of restlessness. The only antipsychotic med I haven’t tried is Clozapine as well as MAOI’s I would appreciate any advice."
4,That is all...
4,Struggling with self esteem and am way too aware of how people in my life have hurt me and how I’m a bad person. It’s making it difficult to get through my shift. Just want to go home and curl into a ball in bed but there’s a dog at my house that’s just going to bark at me and bite me over and over cause I’m such a shitty dog owner.
4,"Hi, I’m looking for someone to message about my bipolar symptoms (and their damage) who really understands. I do have a therapist, psychiatrist, and I’ve called the help line at my university, but none of these things really have helped because they don’t understand the scope of bipolar. I also am medicated newly so it would be nice to talk to someone else who’s medicated but I think anyone with bipolar would really be great. 

I hope this is okay to post if not I’ll delete it!

Edit: A few people have already reached out and I'm very thankful for this! I think I'm okay on messages for now though!"
4,"I talked to the psych yesterday but had a real shit day at work and a breakdown last night.

I feel a bit better today. We talked about cutting back on the weed and caffeine, and exercising and eating more, and I haven't smoked today. I'm still depressed as all fuck. Life still sucks and I don't really see a reason to continue to live other than my cat and my S/O. I'd be fired if my boss could fire me right now and I cant do anything right. But at least my psych was pretty cool and not condescending so I am looking forward to meeting again and hopefully I'll have a good week and progress to report. Don't think I'm gonna feel any better though but there's always hope."
4,"I've been in a group of friends for years which just let to drugs and more drugs. I started off with regular beer and weed. But than everyone became a full on greedy addict starting fights about who's going to snort the biggest line. Living in the rock-bottom. Not sleeping for 5 days straight on meth. Using me for drugs and money and making me feel like I did something wrong. I had to cut all my friends out. And finally met up with someone sober and had a great talk for hours. I really needed that and that meant so much for me. I'm happy about it today, and I just wanted to share to let others know that some things take time and it's worth to socialize with the right people :)"
4,"I work in software sales for a tech startup. I was on fire and really happy! Until it came crashing down 6 weeks ago and I started to have a depressive episode. I thought i was stable because the mania was gone, but really i was depressed.   


I'm scared but i think i need this. Last week I learned my lithium levels have been too low for quite a while. Now I need time to rebuild it back up. My job involves so much interfacing with people and so many uncomfortable moments, it's getting to me.   


Anyone had a leave of absence and not have it backfire?"
4,"So I’m bipolar 1 “supposedly” for the last 15 years and agree that I’m out of my fucking mind but in a good way. I get “out there”, like really “out there”, like mind bending LSD visions and spirt quest “out there”. I get caught up in the mental health system a lot but have never hurt myself or anyone else, I guess I have came to the realization that no matter how crazy the experience gets I will not defend myself. I know right from wrong no matter what state I’m in and won’t even try to protect my own life if it comes down to it, hardcore pacifist I would call it.

To me these experiences are profound and extremely spiritual.  I don’t do the typical things someone does when having a manic episode, I don’t blow my bank account or have risky sex, I just start bending reality. I usually go days or weeks in this state and often get fired from my jobs for not showing up. I finally lose my ability’s and get busted and thrown in the mental hospital and pumped full of drugs and then get released and go off of them seeking another manic spirit quest.

This has made my life very difficult and painful when the fun ends, I guess mania is the funnest drug I’ve ever found, I’ve done many types of drugs such as mushrooms and mescaline and mdma, and while I did feel the drugs I never experienced any of the visions I do during a manic episode. 

I know eventually if I keep going I’m probably going to die but the things I’ve experienced are out of this world in a cosmic sense and becoming medicated and losing touch with this other side of reality would destroy me. I read a lot of stories about manic episodes and I don’t see any like mine, I’m just wondering if anyone else travels the realm of the metaphysical?"
4,"I am a 31 year old male diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Disorder.

The specifics of my diagnosis are unclear, whether it is a familial genetics heritability, although I am certain it is from my childhood trauma from years of neglect, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse from my parents and others. 

Well, lately I’ve been noticing moderate to intense mood swings and irritability, and other general mania symptoms. I’ve come seeking advice on how to come out to your partner about your diagnosis. 

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 4 months, and honestly haven’t been able to tell her about my diagnosis. For a number of reasons. I’ve harbored a shame about my diagnosis because of all the destruction its wreaked in my life. I’ve felt I can protect my relationship if I held it back from her or protected her from the truth, but lately its been causing disagreements and arguments.

I just don’t have the words. How can I tell her? I’ve thought of showing her my diagnosis letter from my psychiatrist and so far it seems like my best bet."
4,A nap helping change your negative mood into a positive one is possible with someone having mood disorder?!.
4,"I am bipolar type I with mixed features. I’ve been swinging between high and low for several months now, I had some stretches of stability but mostly manic and hypomanic episodes, with bad lows when I crash. I’m still not recovered from my latest episode and I think I may now be in a mixed episode. I feel emotionally unstable. 

First let me just say: I am not at risk of hurting myself or others. I have however considered hospitalization because I feel so overwhelmed by my life. I’ve done some thinking and have concluded that a hospital stay isn’t financially possible right now unless it’s an emergency situation. I can’t afford inpatient treatment either. 

I’ve decided I want to rehabilitate myself from home. I want to rest, recenter and figure out a plan for getting my shit together. I’m not using any illegal drugs or alcohol right now so there isn’t any physical danger in remaining at home versus the hospital. 

I’d love it if anyone here had any tips or advice on things I can do at home to recover. If anyone here has been to rehab, I’d love to hear about what aspects of it helped you so I can try to incorporate those concepts.  I am not asking for any medical/professional opinions but rather just an open conversation on what worked for you during your experiences in treatment."
4,"Hello!

My pysch started me on a low dose of Lamictal (25mg) but after around twoish weeks, I started getting random rashes, so she put me down to 12.5 for a week. After that, I went back up to 25mg and got a hive on my neck and general itchiness around that area and my inner arms. She suggested to go back down to 12.5mg until our next appointment (which was today). I took it one more day but then when the rash didn't go down, I stopped for three days total (Saturday through Monday). 

I'm concerned about Lamictal rash. I do have sensitive skin and the weather is changing, but I feel like it's connected to the Lamictal. My pysch is not worried about the rash at all and says if it was SJS it would have happened in the first two weeks that I was on the medication. 

Online publications say it can happen at any time, so I'm not sure if what she is saying is true. These meds are def helping (I'm not diagnosed as Bipolar, it's for another issue), but I am scared of the random itchiness I am getting taking these pills. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Benign, random rashes on Lamictal that aren't a big deal? My pysch isn't worried at all, but there are so many resources that say if you get a rash or hives to stop use immediately. 

Thank you!"
4,"I’m in my mid-40’s and was diagnosed as bipolar two years ago. I’m a wife, a mom and worked in online marketing for 15 years (became a full time mom just before my diagnosis)

I currently live in fear that people don’t like me. That they think I’m weird or off. I’ve never had such terrible self esteem. I see a therapist and am on mediation but it doesn’t stop the incessant thoughts worrying about people and every interaction I have.  

I am living in a new state and away from my life long friends and close family. Not sure if this exacerbates it? I also live in a small neighborhood where everyone knows each other and I feel like it makes me more neurotic.

Any suggestions or coping skills? Is this common for bipolar?  I realize I’m not going to be everyone’s cup of tea, but I need to stop torturing myself. ✌🏼& ❤️"
4,"I am a 33 year old male here. I’ve suffered with bipolar disorder my whole life. When I was younger they called it manic depressive disorder. I apologize in advance if this doesn’t make any sense, I am trying my best to describe my feelings and see if anyone out there understands my feelings and struggles. When I was in elementary school I had a lot of energy. My teacher told my mom to get me checked for ADHD. My doctor told my mother it’s manic depressive disorder and that I have been in a long time manic state and therefore my over excitement is from that and not an ADHD issue. I used to get bullied when I was younger for my teeth being too big, my chin being too small(I have an underdeveloped chin and it looks like I have an overbite. Then I went to junior high school and that’s where I started feeling depressed. I had my first suicidal thought and became suicidal at 10-11 because of the stigma I was facing in jr high. A lot more bullying but now even meaner. I was a straight A’s student and I was always big hearted and liked to help people. With that I was taken advantage of and bullied. When I finished jr high at 13 I then started going thru puberty and gained a lot of height and natural cut as far as body shape because I was skinny. I gained a little confidence in myself. So now I’m a teenager and I’m thinking differently about life. Now I’m trying to get a girlfriend be popular typical teen wants based on how I grew up. I soon realized that my mental illness is catching up to me a lot worse than when I was a kid and I found myself hard to have relationships with people. Girls didn’t want to deal with my crazy constant mood swings which made it hard to have a girlfriend. So I go thru high school feeling alone and unwanted. In this time I get this massive rush of sexual feelings where I’m extremely horny and every girl I was even a little interested in I wanted to have a sexual relationship with. This ended up being good and bad. I eventually then started having sexual relationships with older women when I was a teen. I gained this false confidence and pride. A bunch of people in my inner circle which is really small were people from the wrong side of the tracks and introduced me to drugs alcohol and other things of that nature. I gained an admiration for being a criminal or gangster. I’m from NYC and come from a old criminal enclave. I got this instant rush of breaking rules and going against the grain. I then was exposed to all these things like fighting and violence, habitual drug and alcohol use, and wild and risky sex. For some reason I felt better in this environment than my normal life. I should’ve added this before but I come from a tight knit family with typical European family values, we were sheltered from the outside world. Once exposed I literally went against everything I was taught but not on purpose, it was more a natural thing. Now I’m 18 years old I dropped out of college because I couldn’t handle it mentally. I always had this feeling like I was ugly and unattractive. I ended up getting pretty much my whole upper body tattooed with different tattoos that mean different things to me. I always felt it was the best way to express yourself and I feel if people see my tattoos they would be able to understand what I am about a little easier. I also feel like I deserve pain so I take it with the tattoos. At that point I’m completely out of control with my life. I did get a blue collar job and I am really good at my trade which kept me busy most of the time and it helped get my mind off things. When I was 19 I met my wife. I fell in love instantly with her and she did not pick up on my bipolar she just saw a nice guy with a big heart. After marrying her she began to see my bipolar and my mental illness. We got married and now have two kids a girl and a boy. After I had a death in the family I became extremely suicidal with thoughts and even acts. I began an intense therapy and psychiatry regimen. They put me on as a high risk and under suicide watch. I was on Wellbutrin, olanzapine, quetiapine, depakote, lithium, colonzipam as my cocktail. I was taking these prescriptions and it was making me feel like a potato. I expressed myself to my dr and therapist. I eventually stopped taking them and quit going to the dr and therapist. I always argued with the dr but the therapist was great a non bias person to talk to. I moved out of NYC to another state and felt much better. But then it hit me hard again and now without treatment. I have no fear of anything or anyone. I get violent and black out and just attack. I get offended so easily. I feel like everyone is fake and a user. I don’t cheat on my wife but I have this wild sex drive that I cannot control. I love flirting with women and getting attention from them( must be because I’m so insecure and when manic I get overly excited and filled with that manic confidence). I feel like my kids were brought into a fucked up heartless world and I feel like I cursed them by putting them on this earth with so much hurt. I feel like it’s because of my own experience that I feel that. I have so many things in my head that make me miserable. I wake up angry because I am so sad and depressed. I don’t go to a dr because I don’t want to be medicated again. I know people in my situation are supposed to be treated for the rest of their lives but I had such a bad last experience that I don’t want to deal with it again. When I’m manic I’m literally an attention whore. I’m genuinely a great hearted person but my mental illness does not allow me to live a normal life with my family that I love. I don’t want to lose my wife because I have this constant need for a woman’s attention and Im always flirting because I can’t control myself. She also doesn’t like to go anywhere with me because the slightest thing ticks me off and I’ll start arguing and fighting. If I do get physical I get pretty bad because I can’t control my anger. I have never been physical in my life with any women or my kids, it’s only men that I have had any physical altercation with. I’ve been in a couple of life and death situations because of this. Currently I am depressed and sad. I’m so down that I’m fed up with life and I don’t want to continue, but I have so much to live for. It’s so hard when your mental illness controls you and your daily life. I can never be normal and I never felt being normal ever. My emotions swing around all day long which makes me mentally tired and unable to function in day to day life. I read the older you get the worse the bipolar gets. All my characteristics that I thought made me are actually the bipolar disorder symptoms which makes me feel like my whole life is a lie and I actually want to be a different person that what I am seen as. Not to many people know about my illness and I don’t like talking about it because when I do it makes things worse. Thank you for anyone who reads this and I today gained the confidence to make this post. I do feel much better writing this post up.

EDIT- I forgot to add that I am currently in a six figure job and have been for a long time. I have not been able to save any money. No matter how much I try I spend spend spend. If I see something that catches me I have to get it. This also puts a lot of strain in my life as well."

4,"I've been manic for at least 2 weeks.   I'm not getting any sleep, I'm sleeping like 2 hours a night.  I feel like I'm going to die yet also I feel fucking amazing.

I just had an adult conversation in which I said things.

This is how I feel right now:

Me:   Jesus take the wheel!

Camera:   Pans out to show that I'm saying this after I already ran the car into a brick wall and it's not even drivable  


edited:   It's ""the morning after"".    I only slept 3 hours last night and my eyes flew open at 3am and  I was like, ""Hello darkness my old friend...""  


 I'm still manic but I'm ok.  I went jogging at 6am this morning with a friend who helped me process what I did yesterday.  


I have no emotional hangover.   Not one regret.  What I said, actually needed to be said.     I have a lot of feelings in general and they are all very close to the surface and I am ok with this, I accept this about myself and thank God so do my friends.     


I am not picking out white dresses and running off to Vegas.   I saw him this morning after jogging, we had coffee, I just got home.   It was so unbelievably relaxed and natural.   There was no quid pro quo, no expectations, no ""what do you think about what I said last night"".   Just two friends having coffee and there was nothing special about it, except that one friend likes the other friend, and this fact is known and accepted and it's ok.   It's a fact like he has dark hair or that I had cream in my coffee.   Just a known fact, nothing that anyone needs to ""do something with or about"".  


Whether or not this ""thing"" has legs, I have no idea.   I don't need to know today, I don't need to figure everything out today.   It will be ok either way.  


I have a zoom appointment with my therapist in about 30 minutes to go over everything."

Ever since increasing my dose (about 3 months ago), I've felt tired, sad, sick, poisoned and lethargic most days.  Can anyone else relate?

Thanks"
4,My uncle has bipolar disorder. Meds make him fairly slow-moving and affect social skills. He has an English degree and very close to masters. Self-taught and fluent in Spanish and Italian. He’s had a security job for the past few years. He recently moved and hasn’t found any work. Old security company won’t get back to him regarding hiring. Are there any programs that could help someone like him find employment?
4,"Manic Molly train of thought:
When you live with mental illnesses for a long period of time, several good days in a row are more anxiety provoking than the bad days, because you get used to that trapped state of mind being the status quo. For the first time in almost three years, I am awake again in my better self. The anxiety now comes from the fleeting feeling of a this temporary state, but.... is also filled with a cautious optimism that I can maintain this balance of semi-functioning level of mental wellness.  :(:

4,"Just a question that has been bouncing around my head. I function at a mid level and frustrate myself a lot, especially when I compare myself to bipolar people who manage to stay in school, get prestigious jobs, etcetera. My family cut me off a few years before my diagnosis because of my sexuality. Do you have family support or are you at it alone? Is there anyone out there with little or no support network who managed to make it out of the minimum wage grind?"

4,Is it common to instantly crash into a depression after a very heated argument / fight with your partner? I was feeling the best I had mentally in many years before it all came crashing down. I think some of it was a PTSD flashback and my body is still stuck in fight or flight mode. It’s like all the dopamine in my brain evaporated in a few minutes time.

4,If I had a choice of life and death right now id choose death. Im so sick of everything and everyone. Nobody around me gets it either.

Ive been extremely happy actually but right now the little happiness in life isn't worth it
4,"Maybe not directly bipolar related, but I just love this subreddit, my family :)
But It seems like there's a lot of negative posts on Reddit today, and it's kind of triggering a few different emotions of anger, sadness, and empathy. 

I love Reddit, and I browse it for hours everyday but today I can feel it depressing me and making me angry so I decided to make this post and take a break from Reddit for at least a few hours. 

Anybody ever have problems with this?"
4,"Went in around 2. My therapist told me to go because my depression has been so bad. First they made me take off all my clothes even undies and put on paper scrubs that were very, very small. Like I couldn’t even pull the top to my waistline. Nor the bottoms for that matter. Just had my big ole fat person skin spilling out all over. And they put me in the hallway b Ed in the ER while they waited for a place to put me. When they finally got me out of the ER it was the PEC unit. I guess it’s the phase between ER and being admitted to the unit. It socks. You get lok a jail bed. It’s bolted to the floor. Vinyl. You get two blankets. One to use as a pillow. At least there was a tv. No remote. You had to stand next to the tv and hit buttons there to go up or down. 

Then it came time for night time meds. The gave me my night mare meds.  My zolpidem. Then dropped the bomb that I can’t take my specially compounded fibromyalgia meds. Without those meds I’ll be in chronic pain. Like opioid pain. But they couldn’t figure out how to get the pharmacist to approve my compounded medication. And the nursed even after I tried to explain about 4 different ways, just never seemed to quite understand what “compounding” is. And the pharmacist just.... idk. 

I threw a fit. Said I didn’t want to be there if it was gonna cause a flare.
So they discharged me. At 10! Pm on a Sunday when my potential rides are an hour away because that’s where I live. Finally got one friend to get me. He’s none too happy. He was ready for bed. I am grateful to him.  But fuck those psych nurses and fuck that pharmacist."

So yeah lesson learned."
4,"I just feel so worn out. I wanna get better but it seems like every med I try negatively affects me. One time they put me on antidepressants and it caused me to have a severe panic attack and seizure. I wasn’t on any mood stabilizers so I had a bad reaction, but either way I’d feel like my brain just doesn’t mix well with those. And lithium dumbed me down and made me hella depressed. Seroquil caused extreme suicidal thoughts, Zoloft almost killed me. Just am so confused. I’m trying lamictal at 25 mg but I stopped taking it for a few days cause I kept crying and just couldn’t stop unless I did something harmful to myself. I stopped smoking weed cause maybe that’ll fix what’s happening but idk, just feeling really lost. Does anyone know a good mood stabilizer they had a good experience with and not so many side effects? Would really help, just need some input. And I also feel very alone cause it feels like no matter what I do nothing is helping."
4,"3 years ago I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, last year I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and a couple weeks ago I was diagnosed with probable ADHD. I also have depression and anxiety which I’m sure is caused by any of these conditions (oh so fun!)

Currently I’m on 200mg of Lamictal, 40mg of Cymbalta for the fibro, and just started 150mg of Wellbutrin. I also have medical marijuana which has been a lifesaver for pain and anxiety, but is hard for me to dose effectively. 

My current plan is to wean off cymbalta because I’ve never felt it did anything for me and essentially replace it with the Wellbutrin. I was warned the Wellbutrin can exasperate anxiety. 

Are there any others out there with a similar med list? I love the lamictal, but I’m very unsure about how the Wellbutrin will effect me"

4,"tldr: drove across my state to pick up a girl I barely knew to hang out/stay over for a few days, it didn't go well.

*ahem* it's a bit of a book, but I'm trying to give a full picture, bear with me. 

My dumb-assin-ass did a stupid thing and drove across my state to pick up a girl I barely knew because we'd recently connected via social media over a post I made about the crushing conditions of modern society, and how little I wanted to be a part of it. She was stuck in our hometown, and by my estimation caught between her own bad habits and her toxic surroundings. (Drugs, bad friends, etc)

We'd started talking and quickly progressed to oversharing some pretty dark stuff about ourselves, to the point where we basically blew past the regular ""getting to know each other"" stuff. We'd gotten to the point where we'd started feeling some kind of intimate kinship in our shared experiences, regardless of the fact that we'd not even hung out in person. (we had talked on the phone a few times) 

The plan had been to hang out at my house (which my mother owns, and which I have to myself), and just kick it for a few days, do some gardening/other wholesome activities. I've been living in this house for years and have done a lot to structure my environment and activities to help me maintain a healthy lifestyle, as well as allowing me to keep up with my responsibilities. 

I'd been telling her about how much I benefited from simple activities like gardening, fish keeping, and yoga, and how I had all the gear to go on a little wilderness/beach adventure if she was up for it. She'd mentioned some toxic ex who'd been threatening her, or rather had threatened her in the past, not gonna lie, the details were sketchy and I didn't ask too many questions. Shit happens, you seem cool, and I think we both could use the company. 

I'd floated the idea of her maybe moving in (down the line) if she liked the place, and was willing to hold up her end (hold down a job, pay bills, etc - something I'm very much still trying to do myself). She'd been bouncing from crap job to crap job, and was getting extremely discouraged with her prospects, I have some connections in my city that could help her land a reasonable gig that'll at least serve as a jumping-off point.

I've been unemployed waiting to get my covid vaccine, and basically have spent the last few months in pretty intense isolation, which definitely contributed to my impulsivity. I had been working as a substance abuse counselor in a correctional setting before the pandemic started, and I had done well at it too, but decided to quit to visit a family member overseas, didn't end up going (thanks covid).

Long story short I spent most of the pandemic staying home, gardening, and really honing my musical skills (probably the *only* silver lining to my pandemic experience). I've always been a bit of a loner/isolated, even though many people seem to consider me to be a highly social person (I can be to a point), but the pandemic, and the total absence of normal socialization led to some pretty sketchy hookups that were fun, but ultimately regrettable. I've been extremely deprived of both normal person to person interaction, as well as physical contact, is my point.

She agreed to stay over a few days, so I packed up and drove three hours to get her. Upon arriving at her house I met her mother, who (100% justifiably) was quite skeptical about this strange man who'd come (seemingly) out of the blue to whisk her daughter away. I explained that I'd been talking to her about some of my hobbies and how helpful they'd been for me, which seemed to put her at enough ease for us to pack up and hit the road without incident.

The drive to my city was long, we listened to music, talked, and generally had a good time being in each other's presence for the first time in like 10 years, initially a bit strange, but we were at ease with each other soon enough. We'd had to stop and pick up a prescription for her on the way, got a few groceries, and we'd run into her ex boyfriends father (who was in possession of her dog, and taking terrible care of it), he didn't recognize her, and we didn't say anything to him. Having concluded our detour, we hit the road. 

Upon arriving back in my city, I gave her a tour of the place, and we decided to just kick it and watch some shows (I recall bob's burgers and it's always sunny). We'd gotten cuddled up and things seemed to be going alright, she was tired/a little under the weather (fingers crossed it isn't covid), so we decided to both turn in early, which I for the life of me couldn't. 

I couldn't stop shifting around trying to find a good position to sleep, so I finally asked her if she'd be okay with me being the little spoon (cuddling closer than we had before), she said sure. Words can't describe the deep peace and the comfort I felt being held like that, I can't remember the last time I felt that good, easily better than sex, for there was a sense of peace and wholeness here that I have lacked for as long as I care to think back. (I've had some good relationships in the past, but nothing for some time)

I stopped shifting around but ultimately decided to just let her sleep and move into another room since apparently sleep wasn't happening for me anytime soon. I'd been in talks with the director of the rehab facility I'd been working at, regarding their desire to hire me back at an insultingly low salary, and I'd been preparing to counteroffer, as well as bringing some sample materials I'd like to use in class and group activities. Our repertoire at the facility had been atrocious (corrections, go figure). Stuff like little video essays on mental health (philosophy, conformity, etc,), some relevant clips from movies and TV shows, as well as some relevant music, good material.

Whenever I tired of combing the depths of YouTube for content, and deciding which materials to present in which order, with which activity/discussion topic to follow the material, I shifted into a different activity. I love art and have decorated my bedroom richly with posters, prints, as well as art-postcards basically collaged onto the wall. I'd found the process of decorating my space to be quite rewarding, so I started to lay down the postcards on the tile-floor of my large, barely furnished living-room, in order to get an overview of what I had on hand.

As I laid the cards out, I started to realize that I was actually having fun and taking my time laying the postcards out, rearranging them, and even creating forced-perspective continuous images from some of my black and white postcards of a barbed wire adorned Berlin wall. Just playing, I am a sucker for minimally structured, creative activities (in a therapeutic setting), took some pictures, and took note of this as a potential group activity. 

Once I finished laying the postcards out across most of the living room floor, still not tired, I shifted gears and started to look over some of the stuff I'd written over the years (specifically the *good* pile). I'd developed a writing technique for myself that involved distilling content to its purest form (usually just a clean hook or a punchline), and flipping to a fresh page if I couldn't think of any way to develop the idea further. It led to tons of post-it's and pieces of notebook paper with hastily scrawled hooks and punchlines, as well as longer stretches of lyrics, and once again I'd learned how fun it was to rearrange these different little tid-bits into something more substantial.

So passed the night, never going to sleep for fear of disturbing my guest. Upon awakening in the morning she didn't seem to be feeling so great and started to talk about her (stolen, neglected) dog, and how she really needed to get her (the dog) out of her current situation. Seeing her beat around the bush I point blank asked if she needed to go back home now to deal with this, she said yes, 5 minutes later we're on the road headed back to resolve this situation (mind you it's a 6 hour drive, there and back, I'd done the drive the day before, *hadn't slept*, and just got back in the truck and started driving).

She seemed a little on edge on the drive down (reasonable, dog welfare is a bit of a sore spot for me too). I unironically offered to steal her dog back for her, but she declined saying she'd rather go the official route (the smart thing to do, I was mostly just trying to be supportive). We didn't talk a whole lot (that I can remember, it's honestly a bit of a blur, I was focused on the road), but the vibe wasn't tense, as much as concerned. We got back to her place, I hugged her goodbye, told her to keep me updated on the situation.

Cue silence, minimal responses, just an awkward shift from what had been animated conversation. I finally called it out and asked her if I'd unintentionally offended her or crossed a boundary without realizing it, because she'd clearly started keeping me at arms length. I made it clear that I wasn't gonna be a dick if she no longer wanted anything to do with me, and that I simply wanted to know if I'd made a mistake, in order to prevent making that same mistake in the future. She informed me that she'd gotten out of a relationship too recently, and that the *mutual* cuddling had been too familiar for her and that it'd made her uncomfortable.

*fuck*

I'd made every effort to *not* be too familiar with her, due to the fact that she was away from home in a strange city, and I wasn't tryna be weird about it. She'd put herself in a vulnerable position (admittedly an objectively foolish decision on her part), but I wasn't about to do or say anything that would suggest that I intended to escalate from what had been light, cozy cuddling (think my feet crossed and propped on her legs type stuff, it had been *fine*, good even). No shady alterior motive, just the anticipation of spending a few days with a cute girl hopefully introducing her to some wholesome activities to take her mind off all the chaos at home. 

I didn't probe too much after she told me that she wasn't ready to be familiar/intimate like that, and have come to the conclusion that I must have been too familiar, asking her to spoon me (once again, no bump&grind, just sleep). I was and am mortified at having misread the situation, and having let my selfish desire to just be held by another human being blind me to the fact that I crossed a line without meaning to.

I told her, ""There's how we think we made someone feel, and then there's how we *actually* made them feel. I'm sorry I misread the situation and didn't check in more explicitly, to make sure you were okay with cuddling up a bit closer."" Ironically I'd been thinking about how to approach/discuss boundaries that night, because things can get so intense and disorganized in my mind sometimes that it's easy to get confused and send mixed/the wrong signals. 

Wellll, that should have probably been the first conversation we had, because this was an avoidable fuckup. I should have first of all recognized that I was hypo enough to not be able to come to rest, while simultaneously being so exhausted and run down that my behavior was a bit muted (especially after being up all night and having to drive another 3 hours on no sleep), she used the word ""icy"" to describe my demeanor, which I say is mischaracterizing, I was just being quiet and conserving energy. She wasnt upset with me, and said she understood where I was coming from, but clearly the vibe had been harshed, and the good times were over. 

Conclusion, I was too hyperactive to have any person who doesn't *really* know me over, and I should have listened to the part of my brain telling me I'm an idiot and called it off. But here I am, like an idiot. Happy Easter everybody. 

If you're reading this Nicole, I'm sorry. Boundaries, what are they and why am I such a fuckup. Goddammit."
4,"Just started seeing a therapist and she mentioned how bipolar mood shifts can happen faster than the weeks or months listed in the DSM. I’m wondering if anyone would be willing to share experience of 1. how you experience rapid cycling 2. how long the mood swings are and their intensity + how long the rapid cycling episode lasts before you go into baseline, depression, or mania.  

It’s been a little hard to find info online (maybe because i don’t have my footing on the wording). I feel really confused knowing if i actually rapid cycle often or if i’m just moody and dramatic ! tytyty"
4,does anyone get extremely irritable or disoriented/sedative effect after taking lamictal? i tried increasing to 350 but even now when i take 200 mg it’s causing severe grogginess...??
4,anyone else notice that they self harm way more frequently and intensely when they are manic?? i used to think depression was the main cause of my self harm but lately realized that when i’m manic i will go so much further. is this a common thing or just me?
4,"Fwiw, I’m male in mid 40s. I’ve tried several different antidepressants some that worked for a while then stopped working, most of them didn’t. My depressive episodes just come out of the blue with no warning, no trigger, and I’m convinced it’s some sort of chemical imbalance. When I first learned about cyclothymia, I thought it might be what I have, but I’m reading a lot of hypomania symptoms in most of the posts about it, so I’m not sure i fit the symptoms. 

I’m curious about trying a different type of med since I’m pretty treatment resistant with typical antidepressants, I wonder if a sort of mood stabilizer or other drug typically used with bi-polar types, could help me. If you may have any thoughts on this or suggestions I might try with my doctor, please let me know. My wife and kids understand, and give me space when I’m down, but I know it hurts them because I can’t be my normal self and it’s really hard to be around them without ruining the mood. Any help would be much appreciated."
4,"Curious to see if it might work as an alternative to an antipsychotic like Seroquel or Abilify.

Edit: I'm talking about 300-450mg per day, not the homeopathic (2-3mg) doses. As trialed in the [LiTMUS study](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/adjunctive-low-dose-lithium-litmus-trial).

I take an antipsychotic (Abilify) at the moment to prevent occasional bouts of hypomania with bipolar 2."
4,"I’m already diagnosed with complex ptsd with unrelenting anxiety, insomnia and fibromyalgia. But something worse brings me suffering that I can’t pin point and wonder if it is mania. I need “new” experiences in order to find joy or a rush. The biggest example is my life life. I bet the rush and excitement from being intimate and dating a woman for the first time. I may last a quick fling or even a relationship for a year. But it will wear off and I will start self sabotaging the relationship. I want a new date( new adventure, new face, new name. (One nasty example: I once dated a very cute sweet girl in college but it was Halloween and I was jealous of all the other guys with other girls even though I had a cute girl in pjs in my room. Like wtf. I’m thinking go all the excitement around campus and I have a lovey girl right by me but I couldn’t enjoy the moment. Not a proud moment, I hurt that girl a lot with all my baggage.) It’s one thing when 20 in college, dating abound. It’s another in your 30s and getting older! I need to find the root of why I do this and how ai can find happiness or joy in one relationship and how to overcome my multiple demons. Suggestions and advice wanted!"
4,"I’ve been taking Lamotrigene and Abilify for close to two years now. I feel like they’ve worked, but I don’t like being medicated as it were. For health reasons, I want to stop taking them. I plan to do it properly, talk to my doctor and make sure we do it in a safe way. 

I remember I stopped my lamotrigene suddenly when I first started taking it and it triggered a bit of my mania. But I feel much more prepared emotionally for an episode if it were to occur than I was back then. 

I’ve been relatively stable, I’m about to graduate school. I’m starting therapy again next week. Life’s going okay. I’ve just come to the conclusion I no longer want to take medication for my bipolar. 

Has anyone else stopped their medication safely? Is there anyone currently living unmedicated? How is it?"
4,"How soon should you expect side effects after starting a new medicine?
I just got switched from latuda to Abilify and haven’t noticed ANY side effects. I’ve been on it two days so far.
With latuda I got akithesia literally the first day of taking it."
4,I don’t know why but once I started I couldn’t stop and I hate myself so much right now I don’t know what to do. Does anyone have any tips to calm myself down
4,"I have friend that I’m quite sure he is bipolar as the manic episodes applies exactly to him. He suddenly invites me and want to do activities with me, starts a new hobby, get some professional certificates, volunteering and even propose some investment idea to me to be his partner.

Then out of the blue, he ghosts me. Doesn’t respond to my calls, last time he told me to f**k off and he literally meant it and I felt really bad, I texted him back telling him that I’m there whenever he needs me. This happened the day after he gave me a ride back to my house which is 45 minutes away from his apartment. He even refused that I Uber giving me an excuse that he has to go to his parents house which is 5 min away from my house, but he actually went back to his apartment. 

This flip happened for no reason. When he is stable, sometimes he talks to me about His problems, family issues, regrets, work, his college experience etc. He acknowledges that is psychologically suffering, but as I  mentioned earlier I believe the root cause is the bipolar disorder... and he doesn’t know he has it.

Should I really f**k off? For good? I would love to say how can I help him by telling him it may be just a pill that could help you but I don’t think I could nor I dare to tell him anything about it. I just would like to get a bipolar patient perspective on this matter."
4,"TL;DR: i'm just now getting a handle on my diagnosis and then this guy managed to find a hole in the very tall wall i've built around myself and i'm scared and not confident in my ability to not ruin this on purpose.  


up until about 1.5 years ago, i had been in very toxic relationships with all people. i would purposefully make the men and women i was intimate with ""prove"" their love. it would get into... some sick and ugly tests. it also led me to get involved with some pretty violent individuals.

2 years ago i gave up hard drugs, and this year i was finally diagnosed and i'm currently trying to find the right combination of meds. i've been purposefully celibate for the last 4 years b/c i wanted to stop the cycle of abuse i was engaged in. 

but now there is someone and i'm letting him into my very small circle. we originally met several years ago and just recently reconnected. the fact that he knew me before has made it easy for me to be open about my past and my diagnoses (or shit maybe i'm missing all the social cues and just over-sharing 😬). anyway the information hasn't scared him off (i think).

what he doesn't know is i've been having a lot of intrusive thoughts about fucking this up on purpose. also seeing him put me into a hypomanic state, and that scared the shit out of me. i want to be just cool and calm and let things develop organically but the intrusive thoughts are screaming at me that that isn't possible. that i'm broken and i don't deserve to have anyone interested in me, even tangentially. 

maybe i'll get lucky and he'll be a cold hearted serial dater who was only interested in my body and nothing else. boy, that would solve all this + would really help reenforce the crumbling view of myself i'm still holding onto."
4,"He's wrong, definitely. He'll realize as he gets to know me that my pill induced stability does not say anything about my true self and that I appear more functioning than I actually am, but at the moment, he believes I don't suffer from any affective disorder, and that it was all CPTSD related issues.

And for a moment I was relieved. So, so relieved. I thought that maybe he's right, and it was all misunderstanding. For just a second, I thought I might be in the clear, and it gave me so much comfort.

I'm not the type to call bipolarity a curse. I'm actually quite happy with what I have - I'm greatly intelligent, highly empathetic, and very talented (and this is coming from within a depressive episode). I think that neurodiversity is hard, but in many cases worth it. 

Despite this, the thought of being 'normal' seemed quite pleasing. Not because bipolarity is bad, but because it must be much, much easier to not have it. 

I'll never know, though, because it's hereditary, and it's definitely there. But still. Must be nice."
4,"I stopped Rexulti after being on Vraylar for some weeks. Rexulti did a lot for me and my prescriber didn't want me to stop it until I got results with the Vraylar - he wanted to leave well enough alone even then and have me continue taking them both, but I thought it was a bit pointless to be on two antipsychotics and I asked to try to stop Rexulti. I've noticed my mood has been declining since I stopped it, slowly enough that I didn't really attribute it to stopping Rexulti (the couple times I couldn't take Rexulti for a bit all hell broke loose in about two days), but now I'm thinking it's connected. I'm wondering if I should go back to taking them both at once.

I don't want to go off Vraylar, because it helps with negative symptoms that Rexulti didn't touch (lethargy, anhedonia), but now that I'm feeling so depressed I'm having lethargy and anhedonia again, just flavored differently.

I don't know, I'm just curious about whether people are on this meds combo and whether it worked for them. I'm also on Depakote for mania.

I'm hoping the Rexulti helps, because every SSRI or SNRI I've been on has either done nothing or made me intolerably aggressive. Latuda did nothing, Lamictal did nothing...I really want to not feel depressed. I'm not taking care of basic responsibilities."
4,"I see a lot of posts where people are productive during mania/hypomania and get a lot done. I'm new to this sub and was wondering how many people really loathe being manic. (Diagnosed Bipolar 1)

My mania manifests as extreme uncomfortableness. I pace around constantly with my thoughts running a million mph. It's veryy unpleasant along with the inability to sleep. I've been in quite a bit of legal trouble due to recklessness/irresponsibility. I get little to no feelings of euphoria. I am extremely erratic during this period, sort of like a fuck it attitude, and unpredictable... it sucks!

Hopefully I can get on the right medication regime soon. Lithium seems to be a good option for Bipolar 1. (Currently on Lamictal and Seroquel 600mg).  


Thank you for the silver! I'm glad to see a lot of people here also share this struggle with me. "
4,"For the past several weeks, I've been depressed out of my mind. I've lost all interest in everything and I hurt badly. During this time, my cat also got sick and passed away. I'm miserable and don't know what to do about it. It's like I wake up and struggle to pass the time until it's time for bed again. Has anyone else felt like this, and how did you overcome this terrible feeling?"
4,"I know it’s statistically and objectively true that other people have debilitating mental illness besides me, but there’s an “inherent” thought that says otherwise. I can’t bring my most natural self to believe that other people besides me are depressed. My logical self says “Other people can have depression that’s equal to or worse in severity in yours” .. my “natural/inherent” self says “You’re the only one in the world who experiences *real* depression. This unrealistic belief could be a delusion? Or it could be that I don’t believe anyone else really exists? If anyone could give me some insight into my mind"
4,"So I am talking with this guy that I've known for quite a while, and it feels like it's going to be pretty serious. He told me that prior to us talking that he had an opportunity within the military, and at this point isn't sure it it will work out.   


The reason I'm putting this out there is that I'm wondering if anyone has dated/been married to anyone in the military, and how did this affect your mental health?"
4,I’d love to hear some positive things helping you get through life right now :)
4,"My chest does physically hurt right now. I feel deeply the loss of my ex. I had something so beautiful and it ended when he had to move to Saudi Arabia. The grief has been hard because of this disorder. I have had to call suicide prevention hotlines multiple times and eventually go to the hospital after getting to the point of planning. Since the hospital, things have been better but today I have felt the loss once again and the pain is physically manifesting as an ache in my chest."
4,"It’s spring my angels. You know what that means! Super strength and super resistance to sleep meds! I’ve taken everything I can and I’m just chillin like 🙃 I could get up and rollerskate for another hour rn. Who can relate? AYYYY 

love y’all I hope I fall asleep soon 😐"
4,"Most of the things I've done during a manic episode are things that i've regretted, that I am incredibly embarrassed by, things I'll regret for the rest of my life, thing I can't forgive myself for. BUT, there are things I know I will look back on years from now and laugh at. There are things I look back at now and laugh at.

BUT, what are things you've done during a manic episode that have actually been GREAT for your life? What did you do that ended up having a positive impact?

&#x200B;

* During a manic episode you shaved your head, your doctor notices a mole that ends up being cancerous and they end up conducting surgery before there's a problem and you're SAVED!

&#x200B;

* Did you decide to quit your job, end up finding out your passion ends up being painting?

&#x200B;

* You're so irritable during an episode that you hit your partner, cops are called, cops find out your partner had been abusing your kid. You never see your partner again, your kid is safe. 

&#x200B;

* You decide to share WAY too much with a random person on a customer service call...a 5 hour customer service call. All about your insecurities, your love life, and in those 5 hours, you inspire THEM to make positive changes in THEIR life. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(more extreme versions)

* You go to a cafe and your irritability and anger cause you to punch a guy you thought looked JUST LIKE your cheating EX (you were hallucinating) . Well, cops were called and they FOUND HIS MANIFESTO AND ASSAULT RIFLES apparently you thwarted his plan to assassinate Bill Gates and his entire family who was sitting a few tables away, so he ends up giving you Billions of dollars? You then go home and dye your hair pink. Doja Cat now wants to date you. 

&#x200B;

* So you decide that you are totally capable of stealing the Mona Lisa. You go to France, while conducting your surveillance inside the Louvre you spot someone who ALSO resembles your cheating ex (again you're hallucinating) and you realize he's stealing children and now he's going to sell their organs? (apparently this is a very old school teacher with whiskers taking children to the museum) Well, you start screaming and pointing at the children and the teacher, so they run away, seconds later a bomb goes off. TURNS OUT, someone was ALSO there to steal the Mona Lisa and they had planted a bomb. You have now saved a Nun and a group of school children. The Prime Minister awards you knighthood AND allows you to take the SECRET REPLICA of the Mona Lisa home...that no one knows exists...it was the original draft of the Mona Lisa that was made. MUAHAHA. You also dye your hair, Doja Cat still wants to date you."
4,"I’m new at reaching out like this. 😊 Hopeful maybe to meet others who feel really guilty after their manic behavior and how they deal with it. 

I hope that this is the right thread!"
4,Who else doesnt take medication and just induces mania.  It's pretty lit.  Creatine weed and coffee makes me the person I wish I was.  Weed and coffee is fun and all but creatine puts me into such a euphoric state I feel like an alien playing the game of life on easy mode.  Dance and clap with me everybody.  I find depressed women to be exotic.  Who else feels like if they directed their hypomania towards something can become world renowned?
4,"for all of my life, I've had only a handful of friends. I am not really good at keeping them, because I am terrible at calling or sending those messages like 'hey, how are you? it's been a while!' out of the blue. even though I do get back to anyone who send me one of those.

during school and college, I had at least one person that I was always talking to because, well, we saw each other every single day. 

when I finished college, I didn't have anyone besides my partner. they kept asking me to get someone else to talk to because they thought it would be healthier and would of course relieve some of the burden I (uncounsciously) deposited in them.

in the past few years, I was diagnosed with depression, then bipolar disorder (thanks to a terrible mania-driven debt), found out I really identify as non-binary, questioned my sexuality and my sex drive... and I've kept all emotions and thoughts about these things mostly to myself because I feel like my therapist doesn't get it (long short story, she is older and doesn't feel like I am non-binary but a woman and denying everything else. I know I should get someone else, but it's hard due to financial issues), my partner shuts off everytime I talk about anything of the sorts (and with this pandemic, being 24/7 together, I understand why they are shutting off), and the last two friends that I have are in a completely different time of their lives (one is single, with the mind of a little inocent girl (in a good sense), and the other is already a mother of two).

I have tried Slowly, my partner and I have an open relationship but I struggle to find someone because I want to talk and not really 'have sex right now', I have tried talking randomly to people in the internet, but I seem like I either am in complete mania (too many emojis and wanting to talk every second and changing the subject every time and not using a single damn comma), or I am in depression and I can't speak to anyone. 

and then, through the mania or the depression, the friendship becomes a burden to me, and I simply quit it (mostly ghosting people, which I hate) because I can't do it anymore. 

I think bipolar isn't the single cause to this, but it does complicate things very much... and right now I feel like I am getting to a very good place of stability, but at the same time I am afraid of trying to talk to anybody and iniciating a new friendship / rekindle old ones.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I've had no friends for too long and bipolar doesn't help, but I am afraid of trying to talk to anybody now that I am more stable. 

maybe someone has gone through any of this and can share something?

and thanks if you read through this damn long post. really appreciate it!"
4,"Just feeling sick of the endless and constant cycle. I feel depressed most the time, start to feel better, make plans for the future and set some BIG goals for myself that I'll think I can accomplish in less than a week, things kind of escalate and then fizz out and I give up before I have even started. I've been dealing with some suicidal thoughts, on medical leave AGAIN, started new meds two weeks ago and part of me just.. just wants to be done. I want to be done and just quit. Like everything else I've ever set out to do, I want to quit and stop dealing with it.

Just a bit of a rant."
4,"Do you guys know if bipolar disorder makes us more “susceptible” to catching AIDS/HIV?

4,"I recently started seeing my ex girlfriend again and I think my recent bout of depression is somehow connected, but, I'm doing the work.  I've been going to the gym, I'm trying to reach out to what support network I have, I'm taking care of myself and eating right and sticking to my sleep schedule as best I can.  I've been seeing my therapist every week.  I was even down to see the Cherry Blossoms today and I must have walked 4-5 miles trying to soak up as much of the sunshine as I can.  It's hard though.  This wave of depression has hit me like a ton of bricks and I don't know if I have anybody in my life that truly has time for it.  It's also been so incredibly long since it's been this bad and it's hard to stay focused.  

It's hard to remind myself that this too shall pass when I'm being frantic and a little clingy with my ex.  It's hard when I feel like my work relationships are suffering even if it's an inconsequential amount.  My mom said I seemed a little down when I went to see her yesterday and it's all kind of coalescing.  Work stress, stress with the leasing office and the power outage earlier this week, stress with the gf and how heavy her work schedule has been and how she's creating space in a very difficult way... I think part of the problem this week was how my sleep schedule got disrupted on Tuesday after a hard conversation with the ex but.... It shouldn't only take 1 bad sleep day to do this to me.

4,38F bipolar 2. I only recently well in the past few years been having panic attacks. What are in everyone’s opinion are the best ssri’s that help with anxiety. Just want to mention possibilities to try with my psychiatrist. He’s the best doctor I’ve ever had but I’m the most anxious I’ve ever been. I don’t want to be on any tranquilizers because I used to binge on substances and I can’t go down that road again especially since I’ll be back in my office soon.  Please help guys!! 😘 thanks in advance
4,"This is going to sound weird, I honestly don't know if it's my bipolar II disorder or my borderline personality disorder, but sometimes maybe once every 2 weeks or more, I get extremely emotional and cry **very very** easily at things that wouldn't normally make me cry. 

For example I'm watching Godzilla versus King Kong. The most basic of sad parts in the movie are making me literally tear up and want to just bawl. 

Normally when I see things like this I would think ""oh that's sad"" But it wouldn't phase me emotionally, I wouldn't have nearly as an emotional response."
4,"I recently started seeing my ex again for the first time in a year and there seems to be a very coincidental collapse in my mental state. We dated for almost two years and lived with each other for most of it. Things were messy at the end to say the least and we still have a lot of work to do. 

Monday started with her ranting to me about her mom and then attacking me over something completely unrelated. That took me out of my normal routine, I ended up using Ativan to get to sleep and slept in way later than usual Tuesday morning. That led to me not using my light box and Ativan again that night... and there’s been a series of destabilizing events all week. 

I’ve been doing my absolute best to stay active, eat right and not drink caffeine but it just hasn’t been enough. I’ve been hitting the gym and getting out tor walks a lot. The problem for me right now is way she has been creating space for herself has been causing me issues and there hasn’t really been a good point to talk about it with her. If she needs me to not contact her for a few days so she can gather her life together that’s fine, I just need her to be more explicit.  As it stands she basically created a no contact zone for an indefinite period of time and I have no idea where her head is at. 

Over the years I’ve really struggled to make friends and I don’t currently have anybody in my life that I can hit up to hang out or even really confide in while feeling safe. Nobody understands the depression. I tried to communicate where I was to my now gf and she kinda blew me off. Just finished a two hour walk but it still doesn’t feel like enough. I reached out to a coworker to hang out tonight but I’m unsure if those plans will come through. So it’s not like I’m not trying. 

TLDR: It just sucks when I feel like I’m doing everything right and the disease still gets the best of me"
4,"Recently, a close relative passed away and I am craving sex more often. Within the last 2 weeks, I have been having sex...a lot. Yes, it is with a known person, but I noticed a pattern.

4,"Hello to my fellow artists (musicians, and performers are also welcome) I saw a post in another subreddit (r/bipolar2), where an artist posted a picture of their artwork pre-diagnosis which hinted at their bipolar disorder. Do any other artists have work like that? 

I'll share. 

1.  I have always liked to draw, write lyrics. As a teen, I remember drawing a photo of a girl to represent myself. She had two sides. One side was a ghost, the other was alive and not really so happy. 

2. I also journaled a lot and remembered once drawing a deranged face to represent how I was feeling inside. 

3. Writing some twisted lyrics years ago about hospitalization (although never hospitalized.. yet at least)

Anyone else?"
4,"I was an A+ student my entire life, I have a degree even, I'm 24. I always lacked the ability to focus until the project/work/activity's deadline was coming closer. 

However, I was reasonably fine in that regards with my bipolar medications (lithium + antipsychotic).

But lately it has been extremely hard to focus at work. Has anyone experienced this under a Bipolar diagnosis only? The antipsychotics help with the suicidal thoughts, but they haven't been able to stop the constant stream of random thoughts."
4,"Hey there everyone. I’m new here but I’ll cut right to the chase. I’m 32 and I just received news that my adoption agency has located my bio mom, and she is bipolar. 

Wow. Such emotions. I found out the day I had a huge interview. Anyways. 

They spoke with her to confirm identity, and have sent a letter from me and some pictures to her. I think she will write back too. 

During the call where they confirmed identity, she shared some details about herself and this is how I found out she’s bipolar. She lives alone, has a daughter (who doesn’t know about me). 

Oh my god I have a sister. I’m so happy, I’ve never had one before. 

Anyways - guys can you please help me understand or be aware of anything around bipolar disorder that I can do to be mindful of her condition. It’s obviously very overwhelming and emotional and I want to make sure I’m making it as easy as possible for her. 

I wonder if she started developing symptoms from having to give me up. She did try and find me again when I was 2 but could not get any information, lack of rights. 

I’m American, she’s Korean. If that helps."
4,"Hello, 

I've been on this kick to find places where I can talk about aspects of me and bipolar is definitely one of them.

Like the title says, even before I was diagnosed, I have no idea what's real anymore. Not in terms of reality, I think anyway, but more so what's a genuine and naturally occurring feeling and what's a ""corrupted"" or ""influenced"" feeling / idea. Here's what I mean:

One day I wake up and my first thought is of suicide. Nothing triggered it, there's no stress, the sun's shining, everything is as it should be and yet that's my first thought shortly after I open my eyes (in fact, this was one of the first clues I had that something was seriously wrong with me). This is clearly not a thought that I willed into existence, it is a thought that was put there or encouraged or magnified by a depressive episode.

On the flip side, I'm happy, but like really happy and loose and giggly and I'm the wittiest guy alive and I care and I'm going to cure cancer and run for president and write a book. That's not normal either because my base state is a very calm and quiet self. These ""happy"" thoughts are fake. They weren't put there by me, they were put there by this hypomanic episode. I don't actually want to run for president, I can't actually cure cancer, and I generally could care less, but im also not the worst, I don't deserve to die, and everything is chill. 

That's without lithium.

Lithium has been a fantastic equalizer although I'm concerned about the side effects I keep reading about and what would happen if I ever got off it. It scares the shit out of me. On lithium, I still can't tell where I start and the drug begins. The peaks that were once the rockies are now the Appalachians. The iceberg of depression is now an ice cube. Instead of uncontrollable belly laughter and rainbows coming out of my ass, I smile gently and laugh accordingly.

Is this me? Or is this me on drugs? Is the great capacity for extreme emotion me? Or is that the disease? Was the happiness I felt genuine, or have I never felt ""normal"" happiness at all? Have I been a prisoner along for the ride locked inside and freed by lithium, or has that person never existed? I've always been one extreme or the other, I don't remember a time when I was simply me. Now I feel like I have training wheels on and a gentle hand on my back guiding me through life and while I appreciate not waking up to a hangmans noose, nothing matters anymore, everything is aight, I have no hobbies and don't look forward to anything and don't enjoy anything that much. 

It feels like someone strapped pillows to the sides of my face and everything is muffled. Off of lithium I'm an uncontrollable fusion reactor, or I'm a lifeless abyss. 

When I said I believe my base is calm and quiet and I'm quite uncaring, that's a wild guess. I really don't know. Every time I enjoy something or really enjoy something I wonder if that's just the mania. Every time I obsess and hyper focus I wonder if that's normal or just some other chemical imbalance. Every time I get irritable and it doesn't go away after a day, I think of the poor soul on the receiving end having to deal with someone who has no control over themselves. Who has no understanding of why they do what they do and is at the mercy of their wild unstable emotions as much as they are. 

I'll either tenderly care for you, or I'll brutalize you, or I'll be an endless void that will suck the emotion out of a room. There is no middle. 

Thanks for reading even if you don't respond. I don't actually expect to have you answer the question of where I begin. I try to keep my life as busy as possible so I don't think about such things, but I hate unanswered questions and I can't wrap my head around this."

I cried and cried and my husband got annoyed and told me he didn’t have the energy for me. I’m feeling very alone. He says he doesn’t have the spoons. I can understand that, but I feel so abandoned. He told me he would take care of me. I’ve had awful fears of him leaving me due to my mental illnesses. I always feared he would get tired of and wouldn’t want to take care of me anymore because of my mental health problems which are happening literally all the time. I’m just fucking up everything."

4,"I’m just really unhappy with life for some reason and I feel like my loved ones around me constantly blame my actions or decisions when none of that is the source of my problems. Does anyone here feel like bad stuff just happens to them or is unlucky? I work in a warehouse around 400 people so I made an appointment to get the covid vaccine and was denied because I’m not 65 years old. It just seems like I can do everything right and the universe still shits on me. I just feel rejected by society, and not significant at all. I’m not suicidal but I constantly feel like death is an Avenue to freedom, I’m tired of all the irksome obligations. I have a chiari malformation and degenerative disc disease which causes chronic pain every day. Yet I’m not a surgical candidate. Doctors laugh in my face when I tell them the pain I’m in. I can’t even get a goddamn Percocet cause I’m labeled as an addict because I’m so young."
4,"I have never disclosed most of this to anyone including plethra of therapists. 

I grew up in a not so stable home. Physical needs were met...food, shelter, etc. What no one knew was my father was a raging alcoholic and my mother was a manipulating, mentally ill woman capable of whittling down a person's self esteem within 3 sentences. Hell my brother used to enjoy getting everyone riled up out of spite and would stand back to enjoy the fall out. That left me, the youngest, to smooth tensions out, to be the master of peace keeping. My earliest memory of that was at 4 years old. That's a lot of stress on a 4 year old. The yelling, walking on egg shells, the physical violence left an impression. 

I did well through the early part of grade school. My perfectionism was starting to come through. The older I got the harder it was for me to interact with my peers. One teacher pulled me aside and said I was different...I was much more mature than my siblings.  I should have told her what was happening at home. Being mature and rational was a matter of life and death.

In middle school I was want to say I was bullied but it went so much further than that. The things that were done to me..it was really bad. My parents knew about the bullying. They would go to the school but nothing was ever accomplished. Fun fact I was almost suspended for punching my main aggressor but I managed to talk the discipline committee out of it. So slowly whatever self worth I had was gone. I spent my recess time in the library reshelving books.  

As puberty kicked in at 12ish I had my first 6 year long depressive episode. It felt like static in my brain. I could barely keep myself from crying. Fun fact: I once told my mom that I didn't want to live anymore. I was 14 or 15. Did she ask questions? No. Did she hug me? Nope. I was told to never say that again. I knew at that moment I was on my own. I had to be small and not stick out or be noticeable. 

High school time! I don't know how I got through high school. I focused on my music and my grades but I could never be good enough. I was a walking time bomb of stress and anxiety. I didn't have the greatest emotional control. The people who I thought were my friends only let me into the group out of sympathy. No one liked me. I guess I couldn't blame them. It just confirmed that I was worthless.  Why didn't anyone see how bad I was struggling? 

I started cutting in my senior year. Well cutting isn't exactly what I was doing. I wasn't using objects...I was using my finger nails to scratch away skin. God the release I felt through self harm was euphoric.  I continued this through most of college. 

I did try to seek help in college through campus services.  They didn't help. It was staffed my psychology students working on advanced degrees. Everyone saw the cuts and scars. No one cared to ask. Not. One. Fucking. Person.

This is getting too long and I am nervous to write the stuff that comes in next so...hey I took a good first step.

It wasn't until 20 tears later I was diagnosed with bipolar. I resisted the diagnosis for 10ish years. Most recently ptsd was added. I don't understand where I picked ptsd but it's apparently there."
4,"Are there any documented treatments in the medical literature or in your experience that counteracts the brain damaging effects of mood in BP? BP mood swings have been shown to have affects akin to brain damage over time, especially manic episodes.

I’ve seen vitamin E in the form of tocotrinols helps brain damage after a stroke. And (low dose) lithium is fertilizer for a brain. Exercise helps the brain in multiple ways.

What else can help stall the mental decline?"
4,Idk why but I keep having depressing thoughts. I just feel overall kinda sad and worn out.
4,"28/F I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II and panic disorder, and I have always painfully struggled with social anxiety. I was finally put on meds a few days ago. I accomplished getting help all by myself. And I know it's going to take a few for the meds to kick in and for me to adjust, but it stills feels like I'm not being fairly supported by my partner.

I try to keep my composure, but I can't help it. The moment something unexpected happens, I feel the panic well up in my throat. It strangles my voice from the inside when I never have a problem talking and chatting ""normally"". It's painful in my neck and my chest tightens. It steels my entire body. I'm nauseous, I'm suddenly sweaty and hot even though it was chilly outside today. All my energy gets sucked away. Then I have to pretend to go along with it and not make a fuss, because the mere fact that it bothers me is weird and stressful. ""Just roll with the punches"" I'm told. When I think about the situation logically, it sounds like an opportunity for a fun time. But I was surprised this time. I was caught me off guard, thrown for a loop- ect. I was the only one who didn't know the plan, and now I'm in a tedious situation that I wasn't aware that I was about to be in and it completely fucks my ability to brain. I have a busy weekend ahead of me, I have a lot on my mind, I go to work constantly, and on my 1 day off I can't even have things half way my way. I had a fucking plan, and I'm not even allowed to have that. Whatever. I'm the petty asshole for wanting to have control over myself I guess. I'm the fucking psycho because my needs are different than ""normal"". When I have a reaction to something, I'm left to my own devices. I don't want to keep putting my partner through this, but they're at a loss for energy with this now. They're losing patience with me. They're sick of babysitting my tantrums and panicked states. I'm working SO FUCKING HARD to try to get better and be better, but I need to be told things explicitly. No alarms, no surprises."
4,"My doctor prescribed me phentermine to help control my eating (i have binge eating disorder). It worked great at first but then I started feeling awful. 

I got horribly depressed and was dissociating and couldn’t sleep. I started self harming daily again and then I tried to overdose on my migraine medication and ended up in the hospital. Luckily I didn’t take too many (I panicked and ran and told my grandma what I did). I told the hospital staff it was an accidental overdose and they released me after 6 hours. I had to stop taking the phentermine immediately and my doctor increased my mood stabilizer and prescribed me trazadone to help me actually sleep. 

Now it’s two weeks later, and I am feeling much better. I am self harm free for 7 days. I am sleeping normally again. That phentermine really was not a good idea. I am so thankful to be feeling stable again. Thanks for listening."

5,"Just wanting to share my experiences with dissociation after frequent moves. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

I’m 26 and have lived in Australia, Canada and England since I left Ireland at 18.

I’m back in Ireland now and I’ll remember my life in Canada or Australia, go back to that moment mentally and then start feeling insane trying to work out how I got here again.

I also will frequently see doppelgängers of people I knew in other countries, in my hometown which also makes me feel crazy/like I’m in a Truman show situation.

My ex from Canada wrote to wish me a happy Easter and, despite living together and dating for over 2 years, I felt like I didn’t know her at all. I remember everything but the only feeling attached is confusion... everything is just “how did I get here? Was that (past life) really me?”"
5,"So i read about the recent news of Farhan Tawhid and i read his entire suicide note as well. I took a moment to really comprehend what he did and his story.. and then all of a sudden i felt really weird. Like, i was tearing up which was normal but i feel like i’m empty? (the sort of feeling you get at gas stations, airports, etc. I think the word is liminal spaces.) Anyway yeah so i felt like everything in my life just came to an end too and idk what to do next and it’s like there’s a wall in my brain i can’t continue doing my work for some reason. 

I didn’t even know him personally... it just hit me really hard. So idk why i’m feeling this way, it’s also the same feeling i get when my favorite show comes to an end, and i feel lost and stuck, yk 

but yeah thanks for listening!! any advice would be helpful"
5,It doesn't feel real. All I'm capable of is extreme escapism. Every little confrontation with something out my isolated hermit life is disturbing me. Life's a nuisance. It's like waiting for death. 50 more years to go for avarage life expectancy. Each day is an eternity of  in itself.
5,"for people struggling, I had mild dissociation  with really bad brain fog and I didn't realize it was dissociation  until I spoke with my therapist. I was prescribed  Adderall for my extreme fatigue and fog and it gets rid of everything and i can function. you need to be diagnosed with adhd though. I know it's hard for some to get doctors to take dissociation seriously so honestly lie about adhd if you don't have it. it's your body. you know how you feel, you know what might work and might not. but again, Adderall changed my life completely. I'm not afraid of mornings or being alone anymore."
5,"My sister's suffering from mild dissociative symptoms, how can I prevent her from becoming worse over time?"
5,"typically when i dissociate i feel detached and i feel like i'm not even real, but tonight it's worse than ever and i can't come back. i'm scared. i'm crying. i just want to come back."
5,"I had an interesting experience the other day. Im not sure whether this is a dissociation or something different entirely. Any advice is appreciated. So I was just sitting around in my living room, avoiding doing work and I zoned out for what I thought was a few minutes, maybe 5 tops, similar to daydream but nothing really focused on you know. However when I look at my phone again I realize that almost 2 hours have gone by. I have absolutely no recollection of this two hours,  and I know I wasn't asleep. I came back to in the same exact position that I was initially in, so it is unlikely that anything occurred during that period. There was no trigger for this, at least that I am aware of.  For reference this isn't the first time something like this has happened, I used to occasionally have mild dissociations when driving to and from school and work when I was younger, along with mild dissociation due to gender dysphoria. So what I'm asking is this a type of dissociation or rather something different. I am just looking for a springboard idea of sorts, a place to start to research and learn. Thanks!"
5,"I’ve yet to experience it before but when putting my trash into a trash bag, normal noises made me feel really stressed out and uncomfortable"
5,"Two months ago I had an extremely bad trip after smoking very strong weed with my boyfriend (I’m not a weed smoker) 10 minutes after that I didn’t feel like myself and I was saying and doing things I would never normally say and I didn’t even
feel real for two weeks after that. 

I was fine until I failed my driving exam, something I’ve been waiting forever to take because of covid and had high hopes for and ever since then I believe that I’ve been experiencing dissociation/depersonalization, the best way I can explain it is I’ve almost convinced myself that everyone is an actor or is fake and that I’m fake and my mind just feels clouded. Some days all I can do is cry because this feeling isn’t me, Is it normal to have this feeling for so long? Is this a mental illness? Can this lead to a serious mental illness like schizophrenia? Who do I speak to about this? If anyone knows the answers to my question please help me."
5,I feel like dissociating or obsessing/thinking about it 24/7 is making me over obsess of me thinking i might get other mental health problems
5,"I dont know if this is a symptom of dissociation but whats starting to bother me is that it feels like there’s something like a viel separating me from the world, and like i can feel my tongue at times and i am self aware of what my body is feeling n its rlly weird. Can this be normal dissociation or mild derealisation"
5,"I feel light headed and dizzy. I feel my emotions i find things funny and what not i just dont feel real thats the thing. It gets worser at night and i can do simple tasks, it just feels so weird because i know im here and alive i can even feel my emotions and i have my own thoughts but somehow im still dissociating"
5,"Today, I was in the shower, I looked at my body, and I just dissociated the fuck out. Happens from time to time. My head was in a fog, I felt completely numb. When I felt a little bit more clear, I felt..younger? Like I felt like a child. Later, I had dinner with my parents, and I (?) was acting totally strangely. I physically felt smaller, more tiny, and I pretty much acted like a child. All the while I was thinking *""Who the hell is this?? Why are you so weird???""* Now I think I'm back. A while ago I was getting ready to sleep, and then suddenly I felt very overjoyed, and I felt like my name was Steven, even though that was not my name. I also felt like a different gender.

This is not the first time something like this happened. I remember I was having another dissociation episode a while ago and I heard two people(?) arguing inside my head. Also, when I was being verbally abused, I felt like a totally different person. This other character would come inside my head, and basically try to protect me. They (?) would think **""I have to protect (my name), this is my purpose. I have to make sure that (my name) is safe.""** After the threat was over, I would sorta feel like myself again. All I know that this person is older, and probably female. Not sure though.

Who am I? Am I even myself? What is this? Please somebody help me"

5,"I see that the majority of dissociation can be attributed to some sort of serious trauma. I personally have no serious trauma, and about 3 months ago I developed some pretty bad dissociation very randomly. I have had issues with anxiety in the past, although it was mostly social anxiety, and I was on meds for it for about a year, but I’ve been off those for  4 years now and I’ve been able to cope quite well. I’ve been trying to live a healthy lifestyle with the hope that this would go away, but it hasn’t yet, and I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience with some sort of unexplained dissociation. Thank you."
5,"hi all, i’ve struggled with severe mental health issues since i (24f) was 13 years old but have had anxiety for as long as i can remember. a couple weeks ago my therapist asked if i’ve ever experienced dissociation but i didn’t really know what it was after she described it but i said no. but yesterday i think i might have experienced it but am not sure...i woke up already depressed and anxious. things just didn’t feel that real when i tried to go about my day. i couldn’t concentrate on doing work and looking at my phone was a lot. i don’t know how to describe how it felt to be honest. my head felt full and kind of hazy. the world around me felt strange when i tried to ground myself outside. do you think this was me dissociating? it lasted pretty much entire day. and no worries i will tell my therapist about it when i talk to her later this week"
5,"When I have an episode of dissociation, I can actually hear a voice narrating my life. Its like I'm the protagonist of a movie and it unsettles me."
5,"Pretty sure this is the right place to post and just warning there is slight mention of self harm...

This is like the only way I can explain it. It’s kinda like when you look at an optical illusion for a while then look at a wall and it moves and shifts but like make it the rest of your vision and everything moves, kinda like being high which I feel like I’m not very entitled to say cause I’ve been high once and didn’t have a good experience. I feel like I’m watching my world shift from and inch or two behind my normal view of sight and everything is a little more blurry than it should be. 
I could be sitting in one spot and everything starts shift up and I feel like I’m moving down but I’m not physically moving and nothing feels real.

This also happens sometimes throughout the day when I’m just walking, or in school or anything like that and time is just gone. I’m in class at 8 or 9 and all of a sudden I’m already at lunch and ready to leave. Like I realize I went through the first few hours and I can sort of recognize what happened and have certain memories of that part of the day but it’s all one big blur. 

I’ve been trying to focus on not self harming and I’m trying really hard not to and I feel like I’m not good enough unless I do it and there’s my other post, I feel inadequate, or something idk but I was just laying down scrolling through Reddit and everything was not real, well it was but it didn’t feel like it, it felt like for a second like I was high again but having nothing in my system and I was on the verge of having a panic attack. 

I felt shifted back from my normal vision, it wasn’t exactly tunnel vision but it definitely didn’t feel right. I could only focus on my breath and realized I had started breathing heavily and everything was moving sort of laggy and slow compared to normal. It’s the first time this has actually kind of scared me into thinking nothing is real and I don’t know what to do.

I’ve told my mom about it and she says I don’t have enough trauma for my brain to resort to dissociating and splitting from reality and she says I’m sleep deprived, vitamin deficient and maybe it’s just my way of living.. but I’ve only started really experiencing it big time in the last 9-10 months and my memory has gone to shit and everything is almost constantly shifting and I don’t know what to do. 

Could someone possibly give some advice other than go see a doctor or therapist cause right now that’s not an option...?"
5,"If a person forgets about their trauma, how to they know they were abused? How do you know you were abused if you don't remember any specific events?"
5,I've been dissociated now for 3 years.  I've had childhood trauma where I was abused by my father for 7 years non stop almost every day verbally and sometimes physically threatened and yelled at and insulted day in and day out. I've always had anxiety but 3 years ago I was put into a situation with someone from my school when i was in high school. And it reminded me of how i felt when I was with my dad but I felt powerless to fight back or do anything because I felt embarrassed. And since then I've been dissociated. Dissociated non stop for 3 years. I cant even remember really when I was last happy. I've been to 6 different therapists with no luck. It hasn't helped me. At this point I dont really know what to do and I wonder if Ill ever be happy again.
5,"Please don’t remove this post - the “resources” FAQ is very sparse, and I’m looking to hear others’ first hand positive experiences with their recommended literature"
5,"Good day! 

I am struggling with dissociation since my teen years due to childhood and adolescence trauma.
What bothers me the most is the dissociation leading to chronic amnesia.

Examples like me telling me friends the same news twice on separate events because I forgot I already told them. I forget whether I have eaten today. 

When I'm going through very stressful times (like I do now, I'm learning for my a levels) I even forget what I did each day and struggle to remember what I taught myself.

Now, here's my question: How do you deal with the amnesia that comes with dissociation? 

Should I be writing down everything I do and reread it? Should I just let it be and accept it?

Is it gonna get worse? What if I struggle to remember very important life events?
 Can I restore my lost memories? 

Thank you in advance!"
5,"So I started a new job at a specialty coffee business and this isn’t my first time working in a fast paced environment. 

This is my second coffee gig but my first post-ish pandemic. 

I’ve been navigating the stress to the best of my ability but my manager pointed out something to me that I found concerning:

Sometimes I stand for long periods of time doing nothing. And I have no recollection of doing so. 

I’m familiar with dissociation. I’ve done it before, but I’ve never blacked out so hard it affected my work performance. 

In result I’ve decided to leave in good faith with the company to go to a more intensive therapy, but I’m terrified because I’ve never experienced this deep of a dissociation unless I’m literally being berated/yelled at. 

Does anyone completely black out like this? Apparently it’s debilitating my work ethic and it scares the shit out of me."
5,"I’ve tried many different meds, I try rubbing my arms and light scratching, 54321 grounding method, deep breathing exercises, pushing down on my feet, etc.. but my body loves to physically dissociate (being unable to feel my body and my mind feels miles away)... I’m starting a new job next week and I’m nervous lol. Therapist said to keep trying those methods and maybe it’ll go away?? Ugh.. blood tests are perfect so it’s nothing physically wrong.. blah. I don’t do drugs or drink btw."
5,"Hey, does anyone has experience with rTMS therapy? I’m thinking about giving it a try...
Does it really help? I heard sometimes it doesn’t help at all and doesn’t really do anything."
5,"Hey, one year ago i got out of a dissociation through hard working (on my feelings and identity....) but i hadn’t had enough time to heal completely and a couple of months ago university started. i wasn’t ready... because of the sudden stress and pressure i dissociated so much that i forgot most of my old dissociations and can’t work on my past anymore bc everything is so foreign to me. It’s so much stronger and different compared to the first time dissociating

Can anyone relate? I really don’t know what to do now..."
5,"I'm currently with someone that I consider is my very best friend and the love of my life. I'm very happy and lucky to have him in my life but I know how hard it can be with myself sometimes or how tough it can be when I go through episodes or recover from them. I accept how I am and he does too because he's amazing, but how can I really ensure that I'm not letting my disorder control some aspects of how I deal with things or my relationship? 

Recently I've really focused on how I deal with problems or situations. It's very easy for me to shutdown and I recognize that it very much affects other people around me even if it's not my intention. It gets very hard to speak or have linear thoughts or recognize social cues when I dissociate but I am working on it. I know communication is a big answer for so many things and i don't want to be unfair to my significant other and just shut down because it isn't fair to him. I've been working on just trying really hard to open myself up and ask questions or talk things out when things get hard (something I really struggled with, sometimes he would have to even ask for me to say anything because speaking up was so hard) and I can say that I recognize improvement on this behalf ever since then. I love him with all of my heart and I just really want to be better and be the best that I can be so I can truly make him as happy as he makes me and so I can just be the best version of myself. I want to make sure that my actions reflect my intentions even if it's hard to speak out sometimes, he just deserves the best.

This is one of my main problems but I really want to and is actively working on this but I don't want to lose hindsight of progress. Do you guys have any tips on how you ensure that you're really seeing the big picture in your relationship and on how you try to progress from having a dissociation disorder for yourself? Or how do you guys deal with dissociation in your personal relationships/friendships to where you can make sure your partner gets the love that they deserve? Thank you for reading and any tips would help!"
5,I don’t know if I should go or not I am experiencing the symptoms but I have no intention of hurting myself or others I feel like I’ll just be sent back home. I’m scared to go to the er I’ve been to a mental hospital 4 times I’m scared to go back.
5,"Hi, I'm 21 and I have a lot of experience with dissociating...especially ever since covid started it seems to have gotten worse. Anyway I'm in therapy and essentially it's seen as my coping mechanism when things make me anxious and what not. 

Usually i experience this unsettling feeling where everything outside of me feels off and almost like everything is glitching if that makes sense? Often it's very subtle and grounding techniques can get my mind off it but occasionally it becomes very prominent and takes over me and I begin to panic.

For the last I would say 2 weeks I started noticing subtly that I don't feel like anything that has happened actually happened, which again I'm often used to, but it's been for a prolonged period and I'm finding that I cannot connect with things and events that happened the day before seem like they happened ages ago.

Another thing I've been noticing is forgetfulness, I will tell someone something and they would tell me I've told them before but I would have absolutely no recollection of doing so which is weird? I've also been much more tired recently but this could do with the fact I've been on 3 different antibiotics in the last 3 weeks for a persistent uti.

I guess I'm wondering if I should be worried?"
5,"I work really crazy hours in front of a computer, sometimes 100+ hours per week, mostly programming. I basically work Elon Musk hours (but unfortunately without the billionaire wage).

Lately I've been feeling extremely dissociated, sometimes so intensely it fills me with panic. I look at my arms and body, and it's like I'm looking at a different person. I feel mentally detached, like I'm on autopilot or my conscious mind is somewhere else. I feel like I'm on low-level psychedelic drugs, just not in a fun way. I keep reminding myself that if something was truly broken with my head I wouldn't be such a productive software engineer. People who are dying can't do super high-level cognitive tasks.

Obviously getting away from the computer would help, but my job is super demanding and it's not realistic for me to cut my workload. I'm making a lot of money and I'm responsible for a lot of other people's jobs, I can't just stop working like this for probably at least another 12 months.

Is there anything I can do to come back to reality a little? Some kind of medication or exercises?"
5,"I have trouble with hard conversations or talking about my trauma. I want to help both my partner and I have the tools to recognize an oncoming episode of dissociation. 

I recognize that when I start floating away, no actual problems are getting solved. I want to be able to problem solve rationally, without getting overwhelmed and feeling like a basket case. 

I feel like grounding and coming back to reality after it’s already happened is one thing. But I want to be proactive with nipping these episodes in the bud beforehand. 

My partner doesn’t recognize when my eyes are glazing over and I’ve gone quiet. He’s a Chatty Cathy, and will keep talking. It’s not intentional, and I know he feels bad, and doesn’t want to make it worse. I think it would help to figure out how to communicate when he’s lost me. How can I help both myself, and him recognize that oncoming state of overwhelm to slow it down and handle it gently? 

What methods do you guys use? What are some things that have and haven’t worked for you?"
5,"So I want to ask people who would understand how I'm feeling. I started my first job, I'm 19, I've worked places before but only as a volunteer because I couldn't commit. I got my new job and it makes me dissociate all day long. I'm getting bullied there by some of the other girls, my family tells me to tell them off but I'm not even present to be able to do anything. On top of that when I get home I go crazy with impulsive behaviors like drinking, cutting, yelling at people for nothing. I decided to post because it's the weekend and I got my check and I was thinking about buying cocaine. Idk why I'm behaving like this at a time in my life I have been most productive. I am, by all means, ""happier"" than I have been in a long long time. I love this job. I love what I do and it could not be a better fit for me. Maybe it's because of my first 2 weeks, less friend interaction, or maybe it's because I have to re associate at the end of the day when I'm already tired. I've been working closing so when I get home I am exhausted but wanna have fun. Maybe I'm ranting for no reason, I just want to know how to go to work and stay me and how to enjoy being where I am when I'm there."
5,"He is 4 years old and said the word ""bitch"" and I told him in a calm and warm tone that it's not a nice word and that people feel offended by it but that it's ok that he didn't know the meaning of the word. He was so ashamed by this, that he wouldn't look me in the eyes and when I called his name he didn't react. I took him in my arms and apologized, but he was like a lifeless doll, said no word, no eye contact, tears rolling down his cheeks. I held him in my arms and then I told him that it was my fault for being insensitive and that I didn't want to shame him and so on... I thought that leaving him alone in this situation as for ""giving him space"" would just make him stuffing it down and forgetting it, so I stayed sitting next to him and just ""being there"" with him. After a while he went out for some minutes, came back and we went on playing..
I don't know if this really was dissociation, but I felt so sad for him, it was awfull. It reminded me so much of myself. I think I know how he was feeling: worthless, unworthy of forgiveness and love, abandonable.
I don't know if I reacted in a bad way. Should I have given him space?"
5,"Starting early in march i had a depersonalization episode and i kept having them for no reason at all maybe because of relationship stress, but now since im not stressing over relationships i feel im lost and dont know what to do with life. Life feels bland and i always nap and sleep in order to not feel like im not in my body. Ive tried researching but every day i feel like i keep loosing myself and its stressing me out. Dissociation is now starting to play into different fears of mine, such as death"
5,"The more i look into dissociating the more i feel lost, is me obsessing over dissociating causing me to dissociate more and can it be harmful long term"
5,"When you live your life on autopilot and with depression (for me also pure-O OCD), then after a few years something suddenly “wakes you up” to what your life has come to.

How it isn’t what you wanted at all, you didn’t take the time to focus on what your heart truly desires, you settled for less, you hung out with completely wrong people, you made many wrong decisions, and you didn’t care enough to go on the right path, and now it’s too late.

It’s like you see ruins after a war, but now you can’t do anything about it. All because you weren’t ever completely present in the moment to notice the unfullfillment inside you, and you didn’t take care of yourself.

And because everything suddenly feels so strange, you feel disconnected with reality, and prefer to escape it as much as possible, with excessive daydreaming and internet use over many hours of the day.

I mean, I was always kind of a loner, but I always kinda routinely “grounded” myself with watching old videos from Youtubers every few months, and I kinda got some insight on what has happened since the time i last watched them, and that was how I got “guidance” on my life (and what I should do next) from my “past” self..? Then once i didn’t do that, i would just feel weirdly lost, idk"
5,Did testing for dissociative identity disorder today and met the criteria for a diagnosis. I’m very confused as I’ve always thought of people with did much like the movies but my therapists said people can have it more subtly and be more high functioning. I don’t feel like I have multiple personalities but I do have a lot of blackouts and memory loss from disassociation so who knows how I act when I can’t remember. I’m a little fearful of this diagnosis and what it may mean about my brain and how things have gotten. I thought this was all just severe dissociation but knowing something else may be at play is very frightening
5,"Ive been prescripted setraline (zoloft) for depression, anxiety etc and mood swings. i did inform the doctor i dissociate daily (im always flicking in and out, for longer periods when im tired or in social situations) but he didnt ask any questions about it and didnt mention it at all. just said he recommends i go on medication. im really really worried about taking SSRIs for many of the potential side effects and fear of the unknown, but im wondering how it could or if it will impact the dissociating at all? positively or negatively?? anyone else? currently not recieving therapy either which is another reason im so worried of starting the medication, without further support"
5,"I am scared to start taking it because I don't know what I am supposed to feel when I take it.

If you have been prescribed citalopram could you please share how it went/how is it going?"
5,"So it’s been awhile since I’ve been around a huge crowd of people since COVID really took a huge toll on everything. Alongside my dissociative disorder, I have extreme, EXTREME anxiety. I had been nervous about getting on a plane, but mostly nervous about going through the airport. TSA, long lines and so many people coming and going from all over the world gives me a tad bit of anxiety. Take in mind, I also was traveling alone through the airport today and that might’ve contributed to the huge episode I had while waiting to board my plane. 

First arriving to the airport, I start to experience some uneasiness. Mostly some slight shaking of my hands and feeling a bit nervous going through TSA. I just start to notice all the people there and I can’t stop thinking about how “ all I need to do is board the plane, and I’ll be OK.” I started to notice something was off with my brain when I got past TSA. I was on the underground bus sitting down waiting for my stop when all of a sudden, I started feeling so strange. The bus was kind of shifting on the floor very subtlety and it threw me off but I eventually shrugged off the weird feelings I was having, I got up... And I walked off the bus. 

As I’m approaching the boarding area for my flight, I noticed I was an entire hour early. A surge of panic started jolting through my body and my brain. I felt very disconnected from the world around me. As if, I was a strange entity invading the space around me. I felt so far away from people mentally. I ended up going on and out of the bathroom, 5 different times before the flight left. It got so bad, I thought I was going to have to ask someone for medical attention. My heart was pounding out of my chest, light headed, very very dehydrated and really disoriented. I tried to throw up in the bathroom, for the uneasiness was so disturbing, I felt physically sick. I was hyper away of myself being nervous and felt as if it was so bad, I was making others alarmed around me. I tried tapping exercises in the bathroom stall before going back out to sit and waiting for my plane, but it seemed like a endless feeling of dread and a peculiar sense that consumed my mind. 
 
“Will this feeling ever go away?” 

I couldn’t think a single, positive thought as I drifted off in to this disturbing mind space. On top of things, my phone was on low battery. I called my boyfriend and managed to get words out and talk about what I was going through. Hearing a familiar voice sometimes helps with the dissociative episodes but I felt so far gone. 

I found a charging outlet and convinced myself to get through whatever was happening. All I could think about was wanting to just pass out and not exist anymore. It was so scary feeling so out of my own body in a room full of so many people I did not know. 

As a side note; I took some CBD oil thinking it would calm me down but it did the exact opposite. I’m not sure if the oil only worded my situation or it just didn’t cure my anxiety this time. Either way, I plan on staying away from CBD oil and I’m going to try to avoid traveling by myself. 

As far as dissociation, it is a very real and scary thing when you’re by yourself and no one is there to assure you of anything. Does anyone else’s dissociation co-sign with their anxiety attacks? I feel as if they happen for me at the same time, just making my experiences worst overall."
5,"I’ve been experiencing a sensation recently where I will be on my phone typing, playing a game, scrolling etc and all of a sudden I will stop recognizing my hands. It feels like they’re typing and moving completely independent of my brain and I don’t even recognize them as a part of my body. it isn’t like I actually forget they’re my hands, I consciously know that they both belong on my body and that they are mine. its more like I just am suddenly not involved in their activity and they appear to be foreign and unattached to my existence.

I am naturally a very anxious person. my mental health has taken a harsh hit over the past year, and new anxiety symptoms have been showing up in my everyday life. is this an experience that could be tied to some form of dissociation/dissociative disorder? I also am pretty sure I have undiagnosed attention deficit disorder, so my focus and attention are sometimes less in my control as well. does any of this sound similar to anyone else’s experiences? should I be worried?"
5,"im not sure if psychiatrist is the right word but whoever can prescribe pills/diagnose is who im talking about, anyway awhile back maybe 2/3 months ago i had an appointment with her for the forst time because my therapist thought it might be helpful to get medication and a proper diagnosis. she seemed really sweet but once i mentioned dissociation it seemed like she didnt really care, i eventually ended up being diagnosed with ptsd and given zoloft but it dodnt work and i stopped on my own accord because i felt helpless. i keep thinking anout it all and it feels uncurable. and its So hard to find anyone that specializes in dissociation disorders and when u do they r booked up for months. i feel so stuck. :( just a rant :("
5,"If someone has brain dissociation, can it be reversed, if day you’ve resolved those traumatic memories? Or does it just stay that way?"
5,So I’ve had to deal with DPDR for about 2 years now. I believe the main cause of it for me was marijuana but I’m not too sure. Over the last year I’ve quite weed and have worked on improving my thoughts to combat my dissociation. However there is one symptom that I don’t know how to deal with. The best way I can explain it is my vision always seems a layer away from reality and I’m separated a bit. I no longer feel actually distanced from reality and things don’t look weird anymore to me. But I still have a visual distance that I don’t know how to go about fixing. Would trying to ignore it and act like I don’t have it fix it? Or should I be more aware of it? Any help is greatly appreciated
5,"Do you ever feel so impossibly empty, that you aren't sure where anything starts or where it ends? Like you're floating at the bottom of the sea, or walking through pitch-black darkness? The thoughts in my head, are they mine? The things I say, do really I mean them, or am I saying things out of social expectation?

I had a psychotic break four years ago after a traumatic event. Lost a substantial amount of memories, probably won't ever get most of them back. The memories I do remember, they feel... reconstructed. As though they were something that happened to someone else.

I don't recognize myself, because all I see in the mirror is a face and a body that has never really felt like mine.

I thought I'd adjusted as well as I could. Some days harder than others, and all that. I though I was moving on and making my peace with all of it. Engaging in all the right things like work, hobbies, and so on. Even through 2020, I managed quite well.

Until I couldn't do it anymore. Something I only ever seem to realise in retrospect.

Lately I feel like an impostor stuck inside a stranger's skin again. It feels like some VR game gone horribly wrong. I don't know why that feeling came back. I haven't felt it in a long time.

Everything has spread out too far and nothing feels real. My emotions aren't mine. I just...watch this body feel them, in some strangely removed sense. I cannot focus on anything. I have to work so much harder at being ""present"" when I'm really somehow a million miles away.

That's the thing about the emptiness, isn't it. The distance from everything is welcome, until the distance *is* everything, and whatever existed before feels like it's gone.

Not really sure what the point of writing this is. Wondering if anyone can relate maybe."
5,"it seems to me to sort of be the opposite of disassociation. at random moments i’ll just be hit with the fact that i am alive i go to school i live with my family i exist i can feel and see and hear and touch things. it’s really uncomfortable when it hits especially if i’m in the middle of doing something. it can also mean i think fuck what if life isn’t real, what if this is all a dream or a joke or some other big scary thing. i’ve talked to other people about it but i’ve never heard of anyone else experiencing it. i couldn’t even put it into words to google it. please let me know if you experience it/ know if it’s normal"
5,"I have DID, because it is genetic within my family and my sister also heavilyI recently have acquired this new “symptom” in which I can’t really taste when i dissociate. It’s a weird thing, I’m not really sure what triggers it. But I will be eating something (usually my favorite foods, bagels and baklava and my favorite iced coffee) and they seem to have a lack of taste and I can still feel the texture of the food but the taste of it is barely there and I if I think too much about the fact that I can’t taste, it gets to a point where there is no taste at all. I’m not sure what triggers it but I am fully aware of when it happens. And it freaks me out that I can’t enjoy my favorite foods anymore. Maybe because it is too “exciting” or overwhelming that I can’t handle it? I don’t know.. let me know if this happens to anyone who suffers from DID. Thanks y’all 🙂"
5,"Is it common to go years rarely having dissociative episodes only to suddenly get them constantly? I would only get them if I was extremely stressed on rare occasions, but after recently pulling up possible flashbacks, I'm getting them all the time. I don't even think these flashbacks are real memories (they're memories related to preschool, but I loved preschool and never was scared to go, so I don't believe these are genuine flashbacks) but my brain seems to be treating them as genuine. So I'm having lots of episodes where I feel very detached from my body and reality, I have waves of intense emotion where I really want to bawl my eyes out before snapping back to an emotionless state, and I feel like my body is a robot. Sometimes I think of what might be flashbacks and I curl up violently and try to cry. These episodes last for hours and will sometimes continue even after I wake up from an episode.
Is this something that is common or is what I'm experiencing not dissociation and something else entirely? Google results says that's what dissociating is but I have so much doubt towards what I'm experiencing. Trying to get a therapist but with the pandemic going in, it's hard to get anyone right now, so I've just been feeling lost and confused for the last several months."
5,Does anyone else kinda love dissociation? And dissociating. It helps me escape the real world. I wish I could never leave the feeling honestly.
5,"I've been hit by this junk pretty hard for a little while now. The onset was so rapid and ""unprovoked"" that I'm wondering if there might be a physiological element to what's happening. I know certain issues specifically in the temporal lobe can cause DRDP symptoms. I even read an interesting paper relating symptoms to vestibular dysfunction (aka vertigo). I'm hanging in there, but the persistence and timing of this just doesn't seem to fit a psychological explanation (although, I'd take a psych-cause over a brain tumor, epilepsy or stroke damage any day)."
5,"So I've been dissociated to various degrees for most of my life, but now I've reached the point (working at home during the pandemic has contributed mightily to this) where my job has just about gotten too hard for me to do anymore. I've been pondering retiring to a simple life in Mexico. But I was wondering if there was any chance I could leverage my condition (with formal diagnosis) to get my boss to structure my job in such a way that it's sustainable. The ADA includes mental health conditions, and employers are supposed to make reasonable accommodations, but I'm wondering just how much leverage it could give me. I'd be willing to take a cut in pay and job title, commensurate with whatever duties I have post-restructuring."
5,"So we have had validation from a psychotherapist that we aren’t faking and that what we are experiencing is real and is okay since we have been working on internal communication 

We have periods in which their is denial and blockage of switches which appears to cause headaches or migraines. So We really want to be open with them but still struggling with the reality of it despite the fact that more than one mental health person has now commented 

We’re waiting for a psychiatrist appointment now and on top of all that we believe that we are on the autistic spectrum, so that’s fun 

And so much dissociation lately too and don’t even know if we mad about it either

Why is it so hard to accept and to get proper diagnosis for stuff that has been experienced since the vessel was very young, based on clips we recall and things remembered by family or friends and partners"
5,"So the past 2 or so months my dissociation has gotten a considerable amount worse and i still haven’t learned to live with it ig? Sometimes i feel like i’m not myself in my head or there are two different people in my head, it’s kind of distressing. I’ve talked to medical professionals and they’ve said it’s only dissociation but how do i live with it without panicking myself every other hour? for instance i’ll be sitting and i just think hmmm having a body is weird, my voice sounds weird, or the worst what if life isn’t real. It’s hard to get these thoughts to go away and they’re very unsettling. In other word how do i stop questioning everything, how do i stop believing i my dissociation (ie. life is a simulation, not being real) Help would be greatly appreciated"
5,I feel like I'm.. Degrading fast and hard. Its been bad for years but the stress and anxiety and the covid-ity of the world and my personal life makes it so much worse. I want to be a person again and remember things and stop being...  gone for long stints of time. I miss experiencing life and remembering it and being there for all those moments
5,"Anyone with DID or knowledge of it I was wondering what you think? So I don’t know what’s been going on but on top of my dpdr I’ve been experiencing odd things. I researched and DID came up but I’m not sure it fits because I don’t feel I have alters with formed identities. Instead it’s subtle changes in my identity that do not feel like my usual self, emotions and memories that do not fit with what I am doing, and sometimes I’ll just have a feeling like I’m a different age or even gender and do things that cause me to question why I would say or do that. I still identify this as me but at the same time it’s confusing.

Edited to add that I have running conversations in my head all the time that I feel almost left out of or like they are kind of far away if that makes sense. Nothing bad or scary just stuff that doesn’t fit with what I’m doing which I’ve always just ignored even though it can be distracting."
5,I have not been getting enough sleep lately and I feel a little bit out of place and I forget stuff easy and I feel like I’m not always 100% in the world and I also have ocd and anxiety is it normal to become dissociated when these things combine or just on there own?
5,I've been dealing with dissociation over the last several weeks as a response to being fired from my job. Has anyone else ever experienced having a conversation while you are dissociating? It's strange because I feel like I'm lucid but I also feel like I'm not. Sometimes I try to speak and no words come out but sometimes I talk but I feel like I'm literally in no control of what I'm saying because I have no control and feel like I'm just watching myself do all this.
5,"Hey guys, it's my first post here. After being treated and medicated for depression and anxiety, I'm not seeing any improvement in my symptoms. They used to be mild but now they are getting to a point where they affect my life.

I don't know if it's dissociation, I don't really know what this is actually, but I can't see my reflection. I mean, I can perceive the image in the surface but I don't see anyone. Not even myself. I know it is me but I don't see me. I covered my Room's mirror and I avoid seeing me in other reflective surfaces. It terrifies me for some reason to the point I flinch and have to look away. 

What is happening to me? What can I do?"
5,"I was diagnosed around 6 years ago with dissociative seizures (and honestly never understood what these or dissociation in general was until recently, I’ve only recently realised that I have huge chunks of my life missing, and that these black outs and ‘weird feelings’ were cause by dissociation - which I still can’t quite wrap my head around) and while looking into it, I couldn’t find many people who have this issue. I’ve seen a lot of people describing their experiences with DP/DR, DID, OSDD etc, but not dissociative seizures and I was just wondering if anyone had similar issues and had any advice on how to handle them? 

Also apologises for any formatting issues, this is literally my first post."
5,"I’m not entirely sure if this is me even dissociating but my anxiety and stress has gone up quite a bit in the last little while and I’m constantly out of it. Today in particular I “zone out” but when I do the world shifts. It’s weird for me to explain and I feel stupid talking about it.

This is like the only way I can explain it. It’s kinda like when you look at an optical illusion for a while then look at a wall and it moves and shifts but like make it the rest of your vision and everything moves, kinda like being high which I feel like I’m not very entitled to say cause I’ve been high once and didn’t have a good experience. I feel like I’m watching my world shift from and inch or two behind my normal view of sight and everything is a little more blurry than it should be. 
I could be sitting in one spot and everything starts shift up and I feel like I’m moving down but I’m not physically moving and nothing feels real.

This also happens sometimes throughout the day when I’m just walking, or in school or anything like that and time is just gone. I’m in class at 8 or 9 and all of a sudden I’m already at lunch and ready to leave. Like I realize I went through the first few hours and I can sort of recognize what happened and have certain memories of that part of the day but it’s all one big blur. 

Sometimes I don’t feel real either, actually scratch that, most of the time I don’t feel real but today, like I said, was pretty bad, and I lifted up my left arm and my vision went wonky, stuff was moving, my view of sight went back a couple inches like I was watching a movie on a big screen and my arm didn’t feel like mine, it was light and airy and moved fast and had not a lot of control like it had fallen asleep without the pins and needles.

Sorry I feel really dumb saying all this and have no clue if this is the right place to post to get any sort of info and help back. And thanks if you took your time to read this. Sorry"
5,I notice that I do this quite often when I am listening to things about my trauma. Idk why I zone out by staring at the floor andthen soooo sleepy. Is this common.
5,"Hi, 
Lately I feel like when I get anxiety i feel HIGH. wtf is this I’m so scared"
5,"I used to think it was normal for people to set their dreams. I get in to bed choose a vision or scenario and press play. Its the same every time: a dream about me wading in clear still water with no top and no bottom. I think i’m drowning but i’m not panicking or gasping for air - its all very calm. Funnily, I actually think this is/was me ideating suicide or death. 

The second is me dreaming about a character I watched on TV when I was 14. Sometimes I am her. Sometimes we are together. Kind of like an imaginary friend but less interactive - more watching things play out in the right order. But it’s this intrusive obsession that cuts in to my life because I take several naps a day to press play and see these two visions - deep waters or Michelle. 

I want to think or dream of other things sometimes but these two bring me so much peace and comfort from my anxiety and internal criticism. Now, I’m in therapy so I’m learning not to judge my actions either way but we’ve gotten to the point of talking about my disassociation and I freeze up and insist we talk about something else. In one session I just cried in silence for the whole thing. I know these dreams are not my only disassociation symptoms. I probably have a dozen triggers and symptoms that I don’t even know of. I’m sure not every one is watching harry potter and drag race on repeat since lockdown started like some kind of gay wizard hermit. 😂"
5,I have aphantasia ( I don’t have a minds eye I can’t remember things with imagery)  and I’m not sure if it’s just because of that but when I think of my memories they feel fake . When I look at my camera roll and all the things I’ve done it feels like I’m looking at someone else’s memories not my own. I’m wondering should I be worried by this or is this normal? Even when I think about yesterday’s memories they don’t feel like they happened to me..
5,"Lately I've been getting really fed up with not being able to think, feeling out of body all the time and not cognitively aware of my surroundings and have had a terrible memory.

I recently have discovered a bunch of testimonials on YouTube about plant medicine. Particularly Ayuhasca. And I know any substance like that gets an automatic resistance from a lot of people, but I've been doing a lot of research and what I've found is that it seems to have the ability to heal deep seeded trauma. I've been looking at a center in Costa Rica called Rythmia and it's the world's first medically licensed plant medicine sanctuary where they have trained doctors and staff leading you through a week of Ayuhasca ceremonies that supposedly 93% of people have life changing events. 

I was wondering if anyone here has tried such a thing. What your experience was and did it help at all with dissociation?

Thank you for your time."
5,"On Jan 7 I took my first lexapro pill, had a bad reaction. The doctors told me to stop.

The next day, and ever since (24/7), I’ve felt like there was a glass wall in front of me, disconnecting me from the real world. The world looks fuzzy, and it’s caused me to question reality. 

Also, 24/7, I feel as though I’m half asleep. My memory is terrible, even as the present moment is occurring I only half feel like I’m remembering it or truly here. 

What could this be?"
5,"I started getting panic attacks again in December and was put on 40mg Propranolol 3 x a day. Three weeks ago, I had to give a speech in front of my professor and a judge and I'm pretty sure I dissociated. I had tunnel vision, nothing felt real and I don't remember giving my speech at all. Immediately after it ended, I had the most intense panic attack of my life. 

I have two interviews this week and I'm worried that it's going to happen again. Would appreciate some help and advice."
5,"Hi everyone, so I've been seeing my girlfriend for 2 years now and not recently she started being depressed all the time and ignores my phone calls and messages for a long time telling she doesn't feel like i exist or anything else exists until ahe sees it or touch it . She said she's not even sure she exists .am a military boy so I can't be there all the time . 
PLEASE HELP IT'S GETTING HARDER"
5,"I won't go in too deep, but discovering and researching dissociation recently has made me realize I may have been suffering from this (along with depression and severe anxiety) for basically the past 8-10 years...and boy it has done some major damage lol, extremely wasted time, missed opportunities, spiraling downwards, going nowhere **very** fast, all that jazz. 🙃

Oh well, maybe at least knowing what I've been suffering from will help with future, onwards I guess."
5,"This is my first Reddit post, but I feel like I need help and advice. So my reasoning for posting under this community is not to undermine, stereotype, or put out misinformation. It is more for my own mental help. 

Okay so about a year in a half ago I realized I started having amnesia episodes. I think what made me first realize is when I would be driving. I would start at one destination and either black out and come back to being there in a matter of seconds, or come back and realize that I’m completely lost and have no clue where the hell i am. There were multiple scary times where it’s happened and I’ve had break downs or panic attacks, because it’s a scary situation to be put in. At that time I weighed my options and after a while longer of these episodes happening I cut out driving. This was a very hard decision with me being in my prime time and just getting my license. Although I told my parent about my situationist was brushed off, and became a very sensitive topic for me. They would say things like “why have your license if you’re never able to drive” and although I know it wasn’t meant to be hurtful it, made me feel so useless. Jump ahead a bit and what made me really realize something was wrong is when I was at college. My first two weeks there, I thought I was adjusting pretty well. With covid going on, being away from my family, and some shit not working out how it was suppose to. My mom would call me everyday, and I would get up and go to class, call my friends all normal shit. Well I guess subconsciously I wasn’t okay. On one particular day, I remember mom calling me and asking if I was okay and just saying that I seemed off. Once again I assured her that I was fine, everything was going great and I was super happy and excited to be there. Well a bit after that call is when things started to change. I started to become a bit chaotic and reckless, which is nothing like how I normally am. I attempted to shave my eyebrows and face with a razor I think? I say I think for the fact I can’t fully remember what the object was. Another thing about that day is I changed my clothing about 3-4 times. And each time would change back to what I was originally wearing Bc who tf agreed to what I was doing??? Everything is somewhat of a blur honestly. Once again another jump in the story, I don’t remember why or how but I remember being on my bed with my computer. I suddenly started to feel really ill. I got a really bad migraine and started to feel super nauseous. I remember saying “damn keliana, you didn’t drink enough water” and arguing with myself that I didn’t feel thirsty and felt no need to actually get up and get some. However I didn’t win that argument, I remember getting off my bed, and when my foot touched the floor it was like I jumped into an entire new universe. It was like I was seeing everything from a new perspective that I couldn’t recognize. I couldn’t remember my name, where I was, who I was, how I got there. This obviously brought on an entire break down. I remember having this feeling like I could see, but that I was also blindish if that makes sense. I remember touching everything around me and going “it’s okay calm down, your keliana. Your feeling sick, you need water, this is your dorm room, you just feeling sick. Grab your water bottle and fill it up” mind you all these conversations are going on in my mind. And at the time aren’t really a different distinct voice, just sounds like myself. Which has always been normal for me. I’ve talked to myself for as long as I can remember. I don’t remember a time where I didn’t talk to myself. I had this huge window in my room that I so fucking loved. It was such a beautiful spot to just sit down on the ledge and look out at. But suddenly I was to terrified for the curtains to even be open. I had this weird Idea that Someone across in the other building was planning on sniping me. I shut the blinds and crawled on the floor for the rest of the time I was there. I did start to feel a bit better later, but it was such a scary and odd experience. Since I couldn’t get my guinea pig up to the dorm with me as my support animal, and the process was taking so long After that me and my parents agreed that I should come back home. I don’t think my mom understood how deeply it was even after that until she witnessed it first hand. One day once again everything was fine I was in the car with my mom and siblings. We had just come back from shopping and it was a good day for me. While in the car though I suddenly got the feeling again. I started to feel pressure right on my head, and started to get nauseous and the paranoia set in. I do t remember a lot, but I remember my mom asking me questions and from what I though, I thought I answered them right. Turns out I didn’t , not my name , my birthday, where I was going, who I was going to pick up. When my mom finally did calm me down I remember just being so irritated. So many words were trying to come out my mouth at once that nothing was making sense, and I was becoming so irritated that I think I even said “omg shut up” and my mom said to calm down and some other stuff I can’t remember. *small side note, my mom has dealt with similar things with my grandmother who was professionally diagnosed with did* so she told me some grounding techniques. Another thing is the difference in perception of reality. I was abused from a very young age until 12 when my mom finally got custody of us. There would be times where I would tell my mom a story and everything is wrong or not close to the truth. Like I remember living with my dad when I was in kindergarten and us having such a happy loving life, and him making me blueberry pancakes. I remember it so vividly that it can’t be fake. Yet I never lived with my dad fully at that age. I stayed with my mom. Yet I don’t ever remember staying with my mom until she got custody of us. I remember living with my dad was hell. The shit he put us through was horrible. And I remember crying all time in my room on the floor petting my head saying “it’s okay keliana, it’ll get better, one day you’ll see mommy” at this time I was in 3rd grade and was already having suicidal thoughts. The only thing that kept me is the thought of leaving my younger brother with my father. I was his mother at the time. I made breakfast for him, woke him up for school, helped him with school work, took him to school and picked him up. I made sure that although I didn’t have anyone to talk to but myself, he always had someone to protect him. That was my goal, my job if you can understand that. Anyways idek how I got to this subject. I remember when I first started realizing that I was “weird” was when I was 12 and my mom got me back. I would have these moment where I wasn’t myself, or everything seemed fake or like a game. I randomly started talking in third person. It just seemed normal. I would always respond like “keliana wants.... keliana said.... kelianas hungry.......” I remember my step dad saying that it was weird and he definitely didn’t mean it in a detrimental way but that’s how I took it. I began correcting myself and working really hard to not seem weird. I threw away all my stuffed animals and began to just talk to myself more in my head. I regressed and became once again dependent on myself. This started a long list of mental problems, from eating disorders to depression and suicidal thoughts and actions. Recently now that I am of legal age and can legally smoke things have once again changed up. Whenever I feel a “switch” it’s more  amplified. I remember very traumatic things that I shouldn’t remember. But it’s not all bad. Sometimes it’s good and I’m happy, and remember amazing memories. One specific time after coming down from a high I found myself typing in my notes. *THIS IS COPPIED DIRECTLY FROM MY NOTES THAT DAY* 

“If someone don’t answer this damn phone 

I’m good I’m grounded, moved to Yari on the couch
 
She said your loud

Teenaged huh uh josh

Some old man screaming at me like in a movie zhbdjdjsudbe being disowned. People holding me back. Him screaming you can’t do that, stop her. And people in the background holding him back trying to calm him down

Bitch turned my notes app off

They won’t stop fucking arguing

Like I’m trying to act normal

Hurry before they start yelling again”

This is the first time that it was like I was there there with them, I could see them and hear distinct differences in voices. I remember the guy yelling at them to stop me, and other people holding him down. And my cocky ass saying “it’s my fucking life,my phone. If I want to type and write this out you can’t stop me”.  Another time which is more recent. I was laying in bed. Not asleep fully but not fully awake either. And I suddenly had the need to use the bathroom. And I was like “fuck that I’m not getting up” and a little girl saying she had to use the bathroom too, and another women saying at since I had to go I might as well take her too. And I remember saying “I do t even want to get up to go myself, someone else take her” and the argument continued. Like five minutes later I got hit in the gut and could jo longer deny that I had to go. I remember sitting up and going “fuckkkkk fine I’ll take her” and I remember when I opened my eyes I was like no. Did I just fucking imagine that shit? Did I just hear all that shit in my mind. I did have to go to the bathroom though so I didn’t think to much on it. Recently everyone’s been kind of silent and it’s been good, but scary and sad as well. I think maybe it’s because I criticized myself and them so much. Continuously telling myself to stop faking shit. Because that’s what I feel like I’m doing. Faking. But I also feel like it’s to intricate to much details for me to remember to fake. I thought maybe I hurt there feelings and that’s why they are silent. I still get random conversations or thoughts, or find out that I bought some shit I know I don’t remember buying. I did apologize though, I said that I would try to make an effort in being more understanding and reasonable. And also start asking for permission. Which someone decided to get another piercing without asking and you wouldn’t understand the shock when I woke up the next morning to find it. Either way I think I’m trying to cope better. I remember I made a “joke” when out with a friend I hadn’t been out with in a while. It instantly hit my gut when I said it. I made the joke “it would be my fucking luck keylin comes out” or something similar. And i remember a lang in my chest as soon as the words came out. And instantly apologized. Well I didn’t apologize in my head Bc I was so shocked I accidentally said it out loud. And my friend was asking who I was apologizing to. And told her enough but not the full truth. Also the reason I don’t know if this is real that I’m talking about is because I don’t have names for everyone. The guy who yells at me and we argue a lot I don’t have a name for. But I love him, he’s so caring and although we argue a lot because of how stubborn I can be I wouldn’t trade him, because he also comforts and prefects me so much. And he’s the one I hear most of the time. Telling me I should eat, drink take this, do this. Idk I love him. There’s another guys who is around my age, his name is josh. I don’t know much about him other then we get into trouble together and hype each other up to much. He was hyping me up the day when the guy was yelling at me. Like “yea it’s her life” yards yada. There’s any. And idk if it’s a guy or girl. I have always told people I would change my name to Amy since I was as young as 7. Everyone thought it was Bc my aunt name was Amy. But it always had a deeper meaning. I would make all my sims characters named Amy as the main character. Which would be a girl, but i have pictures of me dressed up in real life as a guy at that time. Then there’s keylin. Keylin is for sure a “macho man” and he even just now said to remove the quotes from Macho man😂 he started about 4 years ago. It’s a spin off from my own name, and I hope that if I ever have a son to also name him that. Anyways this is so fucking long and Idek where I was going with this anyways. Last point I want to say is that when I “switch” it’s not always a bad or full black out experience. Sometimes it’s a full blackout, where next morning hopefully I can figure out what the hell i did before. Sometimes it’s like I’m coherent and there enough to respondish. Like I’m more just observing and watching, but can still put in whatever I want to say. Other times is where I’m not fully black out but I’m also not fully there. It’s just a roll of dice in which I’m gonna get. Also I know people have very distinct voices when switch and speaking out loud, but it’s hard for me to distinguish. Sometimes it hits me and others around me, and we are like where tf did that voice come from, but it’s also hard Bc I’ve always had a passion for languages and accents. So am I just picking up what I’ve heard and am repeating it???? Idk but if anyone has any answer please let me know. I know I should talk to a therapist, but I dont have therapist money right now. Please don’t be mean when responding, when I come back to look at this later after I make a note I don’t want to fall into anything dark as many things are easily triggering. Which I also know why post it. At this point it’s just be nice❤️ if anyone has anything they want me to go deeper into let me know and I’ll try to as soon as I can. I hope this is easy to understand, all love K❣️❣️"
5,"I can't find anyone else who has similar symptoms to me anywhere and I don't know what's happening. I've been to a therapist and she says I have depersonalization and dissociation disorder but they don't really fit to what's happening. And I definitely don't have DID because I just don't have the trauma for that. Don't get me wrong, my life has been shitty enough for plenty of trauma but. You know. 

I often dissociate and begin to believe I am someone else. 1 of them is a character from a book series I've been writing. 1 is a child with no preexisting character. And what really gives me pause is that 2 of them are existing fictional characters. Anime characters. Which is fucking cringe, I know. I hate it too. 

I still retain memory from when someone else is in control, which I see memory loss is a main symptom of dissociative disorders. 

When it is someone else, I often mistake the people around me for people in their universes. When the illusion is broken and they realize that their loved ones aren't with them, they often panic and cry ect. My boyfriend had been putting up with one of them and pretending to be his boyfriend and whenever he'd remember that his friend didn't exist he'd break down and would yell. However for the most part they all seem aware of the fact that they only exist in my own brain (which gives them quite the crisis). 

They all have their own tastes in things however none are too far off of my own desires and opinions which leads me to believe this is completely my own doing. One of the anime characters that ""lives in my brain"" is very loud and rude and physically aggressive. While I am MUCH more so of all of those things, I'm not even nearly close to the level of aggression he possesses. 

I don't know. I don't know what's going on with me. Do you think this is a big placebo effect that I've tricked myself into believing is real? 

Tl;dr: I don't have did. But it sure feels like I do lmao."
5,"Does anyone else experience this? I feel a presence of someone else but never to the point where they’re completely taking over. To my knowledge, I don’t have DID, but it worries me regardless since I’m not sure exactly why it happens but it only seems to happen when I’m dissociated. Any one have any pointers?"
5,"Tw for a lot of things. 
There are a lot of things I feel I can't tell people because they'll think I'm lying. What has caused me to dissociate my whole life is having to suck it up and hide who I am. It's not like I don't want to tell everybody my trauma I just feel like I was never allowed to. I'm not allowed to feel anything ever. I feel like I've never been allowed to to the point it doesn't feel like it even really happened. Society does not allow an open conversation about trauma and assumes you don't want to talk about it. Maybe I do.
I was so sick as a child I almost died, I had an autoimmune issue and it caused inflammation that probably damaged my brain. 
My mom had dangerous men (johns) at my house often. 
My mom was in a coma from a car accident when I was 6. 
My mom did hard drugs. 
My father rejected me due to me being born with too brown skin, although a paternity test proved he was the father.
I was abused by my grandparents physically and mentally. 
I was abused by a friend sexually, and felt guilty my entire life for asking for it to happen again for 3 years. 
I was severely bullied in school. 
I chose to be in an abusive relationship because it was comfortable. 
I'm choosing now to address these. I don't have to ""get over myself"" I'm allowed to be sad, upset, and angry that these things happened. I'm allowed to feel every emotion at once about my childhood. This was years upon years of daily trauma. I refuse to wear something pretty and smile just because that is how someone is supposed to act. I'm allowed to be me. If you want to tell something you are frustrated you had to hide you don't have to worry, you don't have to. You're allowed to be upset."
5,Currently right now I am grounding techniques aren’t working and it’s horrifying. When I go into therapy it gets worse. I’m having medication issues so I’m assuming that’s what’s causing it. I feel dizzy too does anyone have any tips ? I’m also diagnosed with ptsd for reference
5,"So i dont have really anybody to talk to about all this. I never really posted in reddit before, but this seems like the right place to post this. (correct me plz if im wrong) Anyway Ive always kinda been struggling with anxiety especially health anxiety since late teens. Well of course with all the Covid stuff going on things have gotten significantly worse. Well to keep things short i ended up getting covid and suffer from PTSD now. Ive went to the doctor afterwards and they said i was good to go back to work. But in my mind i was convinced my heart was damaged and i would never be the same. I later had a total mental collapse (panic attack at work) and had to give up my rank at work which i was in management. I ended up having to settle for a lesser job which i still get by so its not terrible. Other than a little damage to my pride and a snicker here and there by choice associates. So now im stuck in this anxiety phase and cycle of feeling like im getting better, and then completely collapsing wash and repeat. But now i feel like i been having this sensation of going outside of time. Its hard to describe but it seems like time is either sped up or im just forgetting things (spacing out). Like i can see things from a different camera angle. I can see myself from celing sometimes. i can see from a birds eye view of the sun setting and moon rising rapidly over and over again. But then SNAP im back. I come back to my senses and trying to realise wtf just happned. I realise they im aware of what im doing. Going to work, talking to people, eating, etc etc. But i dont feel like any of its real or matters. I find myself in a daze until my anxiety brings me back to my senses. Just to torture me about how im going to die, or whatever my mind is trying to convince me of that day. So im either completely out of it and im just on auto pilot. Or im in a panicked state like im in right now trying to convince im real and im going to be okay. Im not going to lie i wrote this not just to get advice but just incase something was to happen to me. Im not sure how much longer i can go on living like this. I been planning and plotting on how to ""wrap things up"". But im always to afraid to do anything when comes time too. I just want to be normal i just want things to go back how they used to be. Ever sinced this Covid nightmare started and the world went to shit. I try to sympathize and know im not the only one suffering. But its hard to relate when no one is talking to you and your doing everything alone. I dont really know what im asking for in advice. But just anything would just about do. I noticed i dont like consecutive sunny days because it seems to trigger it more. I dont know i think like it seems anything in repetitive behaviour or repetitive surroundings makes it worse. Please if anybody is going through anything similar. I am more than happy to talk about it and go through some functions with you. Thank you for reading my long story."
5,"So, almost a year ago in May 2020, I got in a car crash. I was too much in my head while I was driving and I hit a motorcyclist. He lived, though he was injured, and I left the incident plagued with guilt and trauma. Earlier tonight, I got an email from the lawyer from my insurance company about whether or not we would do a settlement or litigation etc. Soon after reading it, I dissociated HARD. At first, I was just kind of detatched. Then I got pulled into the part of my brain where I put trauma memories. I call it ""The No-No Room"". While I was in there, my victim proceeded to beat me up. He was punching me, kicking me, and throwing me around the room. I was on call with a friend of mine and I was able to use his voice as a way back, but I can still feel my victim trying to pull me back so that he can continue getting  revenge."
5,"Again, I only just took it for the first time an hour or so ago, but my intrusive thoughts are gone. My dissociation is gone. I feel real, I feel okay. I feel happy. I feel safe, and my thoughts are so normal and just.. calm. I have no more bad thoughts, I feel good."
5,"I went out to eat tonight at a beautiful sake restaurant in Clearwater FL. I sat while waiting for my food and all of sudden I just stopped moving. It felt like everything around me slowed down. A very slow tempo music played into my head, the way it thumped in my head started to literally drive me crazy… I felt like I was in a depressed game after someone is going through withdrawal. I couldn’t snap out if it for a good few minutes. The room starts to expand on me. I have never ever went through this before and it absolutely petrified me."
5,I feel like I don’t know why I’m here and constantly questioning reality. I feel like nothing is real and every happy moment I have is meaningless because I’ll be dead one day. I question why I’m alive and why this world was even created. What’s the point in all of this? I feel uneasy thinking I need to actually breathe in order to survive and require oxygen. The thought of being a floating ball in space makes me feel very uneasy too. I just don’t enjoy things anymore and I’m a lot more frightened of things than I I used to be and just so much more aware of being alive. Any ideas as to what this is? Dissociation is the closest thing I could come to

Hi, 
Does anybody else ever experience feeling like you’re somewhere else? Almost like you’re living in a depressing movie sometimes? Like things just feel like you’re not where you are... like you can ground yourself back to where you are but it feels like you’re in a movie or like you’re somewhere else? 
Also lately when I think of a certain place ( a town near mine that I went to school in and have a lot of friends in, and I do my shopping there) it’s like in my brain I perceive it differently then how it actually is there. Idk if it’s depersonalization or disassociation but when I THINK of the place, it feels different and distorted then how it actually is when I go there"
5,"i don't think i can even explain this but i'll do my best.

for a while now i've had somewhat severe anxiety, and due to that i've started developing depression again after recovering completely from middle school (im 17f). then, i think it started a few months ago, i began becoming hyper aware of life and myself. like everyone has moments like that from time to time but it was scary and intense and eventually became constant for me. i couldn't do or feel anything without asking why. i couldn't look out over a beautiful horizon with trees and wildlife without thinking about how strange it truly is and i feel alienated. it's like that feeling you get thinking about what alien worlds might be like, but it's my own. concepts such as trees or bodies make me feel uncomfortable. eventually, after it got so bad, i finally forced myself to come to terms with this world. i told myself it's my world, i belong here, it's not alien at all. i made a post here during that time and i got the same advice i found elsewhere: ignore it and it'll eventually pass. 

now, it's slightly different. it's so hard to explain. it's like a constant, numb discomfort. anytime i experience anything like passion or happiness, i simultaneously have this feeling of ""it's worthless, it's nothing, it doesn't make sense"". sitting in a room i feel strangely aware that it is a room, a concrete square on a patch of earth. of course. this is true, but when i was more mentally stable, these things were just.. normal. if someone were to tell me that clothes are weird because it's a piece of fabric that covers your human meat body id be like ""uh yeah lol?"". 

and that's the other thing. now, if i look into any other time of my life, future or past, it feels inescapable. for some reason it seems to cloud all my memories or dreams in a false perception that i didn't have. it's like i can't possibly believe that there's a way i was alive and thinking without being so uncomfortable in my reality. and when looking to my future, it feels like i'll never be able to heal. i believe i can heal from anxiety and depression, but somehow it's so hard to believe i can ever look at this universe the same way again. it feels like i was transported to an alien world where the concepts the human mind can understand are gone and replaced with a different, supposedly normal one. 

even this long text post i feel does no justice to how i feel. i feel unsatisfied with my description, but it's the best i can do. i should also mention i'm christian, and this also plays a role in my discomfort. i somehow feel this is only normal to god and that the universe is only designed this way because he's creative. i just can't feel normal. when i've talked to people about how our universe is so finely tuned it can't possibly be random, i've gotten the response ""it just seems normal because you've grown up this way. if the universe was any way else, that too would seek perfect"" a few times. the way i feel is like the opposite of that. i know i should feel this is all normal, that things like oceans, trees, social interactions, i shouldn't be critical of their existence.

i also have a strange issue with doing things not *everyone* else does. like it's hard to listen to music i don't think is popular, or play a game that not everyone knows about. it's hard to explain but basically whenever i see a video with a  low view count or a game lobby that's mostly empty, it gives me anxiety and a weird feeling.

i feel like there's more i want to say, but i don't know what. i just want this to end and for me to never know this feeling ever again, but i'm scared that's impossible. and please don't just say ""get professional help"". i can't right now. the best i can do is use free resources online and i have a couple friends who are there for me, but they don't truly understand"
5,"It's the lack of internal feeling, will(power), agency, evaluation of the situation, non-passivity, awareness, and coherent narrative to the point where I seriously like don't even understand that I'm a real human being (trauma, sigh) because I wasn't treated like one in the past. Just a small human outline to scream *at*. 

Maybe it would be better if I was not just screamed at like a mental punching bag but I was just communicated with *by* yelling HAHAHA. because what I mean by being screamed *at* like I was an inanimate object or animal is that communication was only one way and not two ways as a feedback loop that occurs when one is yelling but also communicating with a child. I think that this is one of the core causes of my dissociative personality, which is having no two way relationships in my entire life, ever. Friends at school, yes, but no one who I ever developed and shared a personal and ongoing history that involved the core of my being in. No one to really think back to and nobody who I can always call and reminisce with. Nobody who really knows or knew Me, no childhood friend or aunty or cousin or siblings. Not sure if there's anybody I could ever actually say I have been close to. Strange how I only realise this now, that I've never cared for anybody outside of myself (sounds slightly worse than it is, I'm not sure how to word it to make it seem like I'm not a sociopath ahahah), even though I've had a few relationships before. What I mean is I care like I care for my friends, but ""*I* love you and care about *you*"" is a foreign concept to me. 

Narrativeless. In my later years I would not reflect, I'd just do things for 100% of the time I was awake. 

Maybe not for much longer though. I am remembering some things from the past where I had a friendship where we would hang out a lot but I would never say we were actually close. ...But I think that in an alternate universe, we could have been. 
I am not sure how I feel about him. ...Shit. I don't know at all anymore. 

I seriously forgot I existed as a human being in other people's eyes and shit. Lol. I guess human relationships are where one develops a sense of self but ehh..."
5,"I just left everything. I took 4 outfits, way too many socks, a bunch of jumpers, 3 pairs of shoes, one can of deodorant, a book, my bible, my chargers, my phone, wallet and keys, my tablet, 2 pillows, a blanket, a pencil case with various stationary, a small notebook, my TTRPG Dice and Rolling Tray, whatever was in my car already, a laundry basket (holding all my clothes and stuff) and a leather satchel (holding everything else).

Why did I do that? I've left so many friends behind. My family were in a panic, I let them all down. There's still work to be done on my house. I left a bunch of stuff at my sisters place. I could barely talk to my mum on the phone Sunday morning. I've only told one friend I've even left. I was suppose to meet a bunch of my mates at the pub Saturday night. They were there for me. They were gonna have a open pit roast lunch next Saturday. How do I even tell them I'm gone.

I'm 500kms away. I only had a week until I left anyway. I'm lucky I already had a job lined up. I had 120 bucks, most of it got eaten on the drive down in fuel. An old bloke from church has put me up for a few days, and my mum is going to get me a hotel room for a little after that. I slept in my car the first night. 

I can't explain to them why I left. I don't even know how to face the ones I let down. I've never felt such shame before in my life. Even typing this feels surreal, like I'm just along for the ride. I'm switching between deep feelings of guilt and sorrow; and a detached view where my only thought is ""why does it matter, they only miss you now youre gone"".

My mum said I need to go to a hospital, but I don't know how a hospital is going to fix me, I'm not injured, I'm not even diagnosed. I can't afford food, let alone therapy. My rational brain says that thus we the right decision but made at the wrong time. My irrational brain has all the controls and I'm lucky I was able to get up for work this morning.

I'm sorry if this isn't the place, but I needed to put it somewhere to make it real and if anyone knows how I could confront the friends I left in the dark, that'd be a huge help."
5,"My friend messaged me this evening that she’s been having these episode sheets she suddenly forgets who she is or where she is or what she’s doing for periods of time, along with feeling like she’s not really here sometimes and that in those moments she feels like she isn’t in control of her own body. (she describes it as fog as well.) we did some research together and we’re wondering if she could be dissociative? this has apparently been happening for a while but she’s been scared to tell anyone since she didn’t wanna be perceived as crazy. I just wanted to know if she could try to get diagnosed with having dissociation or if these are all coincidences. i’ll try my best to answer any addition questions in the comments, although if i don’t respond for a while it’s because i’ve accidentally fallen asleep (it’s almost midnight where i live but i want answers for the sake of my friend)"
5,"So I've realized something recently. It's been on my mind because it has a lot to do with my dissociation, I think at least. Does anyone ever feel anxious and feel like they are constantly out of place, even when they're at home? Especially when you move homes? Like, does dissociation get worse or even better with moving? Because I remember the last time I moved, it was to escape something, and my mind never really acknowledged that I was out of all that, I think. And at that time I was 11. Now, fast forward, I'm 16 and about to move again. But this is the first time in my entire life that I will be moving for good reasons, like they're are a lot of positives to this move. The only concerns I have are about my dissociation. This house that I currently reside in, it has never been a home to me and I am just now realizing that. I hate coming home to this house, or trailer rather, and opt to go to my grandmother's when I can to get away. I have gone through countless reality loops at this house, to the point to where it almost feels that I have three or four different personalities. Does anyone else ever get this? Please tell me. But my main question is, is there a chance that this move might bring me out of this rut that I have been in since I was 11? I mean, my dissociation has been going on way longer than age 11, but it kinda took its big debute at that time. You know? So is it possible that moving again, for a better reason and a better future, could lessen my symptoms? I am going to also be starting a new school next year, which scares me because I never feel right with switching schools and I always have trouble with the new type of work setting and people, and this always worsens my symptoms. But could this better situation improve that too? Any commentary would be greatly appreciated."
5,"Only problem is I don’t have the means to. But I want to so bad. When I dissociate really bad I just want to get in my car and drive until I run out of fuel, then make a new life wherever I stop. I don’t care where it is. I just want to be in a new place where no one knows me and I’ll pretty much be dead to those I did know. I want a clean slate. The thought of continuing my life now makes me sick. Does anyone else go through this when they dissociate?"
5,"Does anyone else feel like their perception of life is like super meta to the point where you feel disconnected from reality? Like on the one hand there's my trauma and I think it has a lot to do with feeling like I'm a monster. But at the same time, I am sick and tired of feeling this way and don't want to believe this about myself. It's like I'm aware that I'm not supposed to believe this but at the same time I believe it.

It feels like I need to say the correct things to my therapist to release the emotions to be free from this hell, but at the same time I am aware of what I'm doing and then I don't feel any emotions because I'm like thinking one step ahead of myself. It's so weird and it freaks me out and makes me think I've lost my mind and will never recover.

I didn't used to think this way. I wasn't even aware of what happened to me until I was in college and took mushrooms and saw myself and realized I was really messed up. Until then I had been in denial and didn't even know, I just knew something was wrong but never told anyone. Then afterwards, after I realized what was wrong, it's like I felt like if I told someone everything then I would be free. But it wasn't like genuinely me telling them, it was just knowing that if I did it then I would feel better. I am struggling to describe it and yes I know it sounds fucking crazy. I am worried that when I took the mushrooms, maybe it fucked me up or something even more because now not only do I feel like shit because of the trauma, but I also am existing in this meta universe where I am constantly trying to escape from this mental prison but at the same time, I am aware of what I'm doing and that makes my efforts to escape not work because it isn't organic or it isn't how life is supposed to work.

Just today I was talking to my mom about this stuff and as I was saying something I felt a surge of emotion and started to cry, but right as I started to cry I became aware of it and the emotion completely died because I was aware that I wanted to cry to be free and then it's like the sadness completely went away and I was just thinking about what happened. It's like I'm watching myself and my thoughts and am detached from reality and my emotions completely.

Does anyone else deal with this? I don't know how to make sense of it. It scares me and gives me a fuck ton of anxiety because it makes me feel psychotic and hopeless. Like not only do I have trauma but I have this meta dissociation that honestly seems way scarier and impossible to overcome. Even as I type this, a part of me feels like if I can somehow express these thoughts and feelings, I will be freed from them. It's like I can't trust myself or something. I just don't understand."
5,"So yesterday I felt super out of it, I had been for a couple days, I think since Thursday. Now feeling back to normal, I’ve noticed I don’t remember it like it was me. I can’t connect to what happened, but when I was in the moment I felt super .. horrible, and now I feel like that wasn’t even me functioning my body. Like it was another person. So strange. I felt like nothing meant anything to me, my stimulus check hit and I wasn’t excited like I normal would’ve been, I went shopping and didn’t care. I didn’t want to do anything. Weird.. any ideas?"
5,"Fair warning- it’s going to be a longer post because I feel the need to explain when it started and anything that might help. If anything needs to be explained upon, pls let me know and I’ll try my best.

As a child I would feel like a video game character. I vividly remember walking out of a restaurant at the wee age of 5 and kicking rocks. When all of a sudden I got hit with this feeling of being controlled, like I wasn’t in control of my own body. Like I was a character in a shorty arcade game. In my naivety I looked up at my dad and asked if he ever felt this before and if it was normal. He chuckled and said it was. Looking back I think it was to prevent me from freaking out further. From then on I vaguely remember feeling this again every so often, but I was young and didn’t know it wasn’t “normal”.

Flash forward a decade and high school is kicking my ass. I haven’t felt like a character in maybe a year(?) and I’m focusing on classes. This is when my underlying anxiety surfaces. I’m “spacing out” more, I’m jittery, and all of the anxiety after effects. I think it’s time to point out that my whole family has suffered with minute anxiety, usually this is shown by a shaky leg or just spacing out. Though I don’t think spacing out is anything to do with anxiety but it’s VERY apparent in my family. It’s when I started dealing with depression that I started to feel detached. Not in the angsty “don’t talk to me” detachment but I felt out of place in my body. I would also go mute in these “episodes”, needing to control something in life. I also seemed to feel, smell, and hear everything. It was a total sensory overload, which lead to me feeling alienated even more. I would feel my mind draw away, I would get dizzy then run on autopilot.

Now I’m 20 and I’ve been medicated for G.A.D and it’s... ok. I don’t get overloaded anymore and I can almost go the whole day without spacing out and feeling detached from my body. Some days are better than others, the latter of which leaves me in a foggy-dizzy state where I feel like I’m living someone else’s life or I’m in a simulation. Normally these are tied with a brief anxiety spell, either from slight ptsd or something that just made me nervous. I also have a playlist consisted of songs that tend to trigger this otherworldly feeling. To either escape or to remind myself to not listen to them, I can’t really recall why I made it.

In the past I just assumed it was from my depression making me feel numb but as I’m going through this community I’m... conflicted now. I have never had the “out of body” experience before or have had any memory loss (that I know of). Are these the worst it can get? Or are they the normal things that you have to have?? Honestly I just want to know how to explain to people what it happening to me. I haven’t had a straight answer about what my mind is doing for around 2 years, and even then it was a “eh, maybe these will help??”."
5,Does this sound like dissociation?
5,"Some people think I'm autistic but I don't think I am. I think I was treated like a lot less than a dog emotionally when I was younger. Maybe something like a pack horse or easily scared rabbit that one scares for their own satisfaction until they're tired of doing so. 

I believe something went fundamentally wrong at ""birth"", that being, early childhood per se- I had a vision of myself in a pot induced semi psychotic period as having a rotting fetus inside of me, waiting for its real mum and dad to come, but they never did, so it's just always been rotting in there (I'm 20 now.) Also a strong feeling on acid that I've been in the 'waiting room' of life for, like, forever now. I know I never individuated. Haven't yet, at least. 

My object relations are really fucked because of this, I'm basically truly an emotional orphan. Idk what I've been doing these past 20 years lmao. Well, being passive I guess. I feel like a child emotionally and for some weird ass reason, I'm only realising now that like, other people exist and that I exist and am alone. I'm very egocentric and lack true agency and psychological aloneness at this current point in time. 

So every past self feels like a different entity. I don't remember or understand these entities when I try and look back on them now. They are strangers to me and thus I am a stranger to myself. I've never been properly loved so now I just feel like a floating entity who lives in the conceptual realm. 

I spend my time simulating conversations in my head with people that I know. I don't think that this is normal. 

I hope that neurofeedback and EMDR helps. Man, at times I feel so peaceful. But I have never, never really been in a real emotional human relationship. I just am, like, here. And I always have been. Not separate from the environment. Mm... The sky is pale blue and foggy today. Peace at last. 

Not really. The rare times I do feel alone, I feel like I have been given a death sentence by my parents to be cast out in a horrible place where unlike other shitty families, *I could not do anything about it.* The powerlessness conceptually haunts me to this day and it still awes me that I was once (at birth I guess) truly happy and trusting and open to this world. 

It feels like nothing is really real except this current moment. Thanks, foggy numbness, I guess. But I feel I started to ignore reality because being a real person and entity in other people's minds is just too much for me to handle. I don't even know how to feel about the fact my body is... Eugh. Completely in the complete mind of another (sigh) I wish I could just delete off this oh my god I just want to hide from this forever and ever and ever it feels so disgusting and intrusive goodbye I am gone idc abt my persona and how I appear to others nothing is real I'm not real. That was the first time I started to dissociate for sort of real instead of just emotionally numbing my tears and sadness because of easy to understand trauma like yelling. : )

But I am. 

By definition, there's nothing worth it coming out for from this fog, right, and that's why I'm not rly coming out. I feel safe. I feel safe and I would feel remorse for the things I've done in the past that have hurt my friends and be a better person. But I don't want to do it because the friends I've hurt won't ever be able to fill the void. I want to be here and own my fkn self and be ALIVE of my own accord and as a debate independent being who isn't attached to her parents or family whatsoever. Just me. And be free from all I want to let go of (I think psilocybin in a few months will help me do this.) And then fall in love with life all over again and be reborn into a place where I always wanted to be. A safe place, that is. I don't know if this universe is really safe and that it has a plan. But at least I'll be in control as adults are, and not under the jurisdiction of the people that I used to live with (I live alone now). I guess friends make me happy but now is not the time yet. Sigh..."
5,"When I dissociate is either random or because something triggering from my childhood trauma came up. But is it possible to dissociate because of more recent trauma?, when I dissociate I get quite bad memory blocks. It’s kinda like the trauma gets repressed temporarily well I’m dissociating, I thought this could only happen from childhood trauma or old trauma? Is it possible then for more recent trauma to be blocked out too? I won’t go into detail but its been almost half a year since more recent trauma happened and Iv noticed I tend to dissociate when it comes to mind and I can’t remember what happened at all. I thought it was strange since it was recent, Iv only recently found out from my therapist that Iv be dissociating so I don’t know a whole lot, sorry if this kinda dumb question lol."
5,"something I've always struggled with is deciding how I talk, and while I've been at high suspicion of identity-altering dissociative disorder(s), I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, though it can definitely be connected to my lack of cohesion in terms of a personality or sense of identity.

let me explain. the only constant in my verbal expression is my diction; my vocab, how I form sentences, pacing, grammar and the like. the only thing that I have trouble with is consistently pronouncing words and expressing in that sort of way. sometimes I have a twang, other times a british/russian crumple of the tongue, and other times a very nasal sound, and more.

what's your experience with this? what did it turn out to be? how can I find my way of speaking, integrate the rest, or stop changing my voice all the time without noticing?

thanks!"
5,"First off I'm not really sure if this is dissociation, but basically for me it kinda feels like hitting your funny bone but in the brain. There's just this kinda sudden snap and everything goes numb. Sometimes I even get this kind warmish tingle down my body. It feels like I'm living more in the current moment because my memories are turned off and eyes and ears are more sensitive to my surroundings.

I think my first time feeling disconnected was around 4th grade. I just kinda remember waking up one day and feeling like my personally was slowing changing. That caused me to have panic attacks which kinda turned to depersonalization or dissociation episodes. Also during that time I would basically force myself to dissociate because I was so nervous about feeling like I was going insane that I would sit there and think really hard about going insane, and by thinking about it I would start to dissociate.

It feels exactly like you're pulling an all nighter and half way through your brain decides its had enough and flicks off the switch. Then again maybe that's not a normal sleep deprivation feeling and maybe that's just me depersonalizing from lack of sleep idk.

But I noticed I get this feeling whenever I'm at like at concerts, theaters, circuses, fireworks events, or sports events. Generally I feel fine but once they turn off the lights my eyes go all dilated and I suddenly get really anxious and sensitive to all the loud surrounding music and flashing lights, and then my brain kinda shuts down and everything goes muted and numb. It usually doesn't happen if there is decent lighting though.

Sometimes I dissociate for no reason like if I'm playing video games or watching tv. Sometimes I dissociate because I imagine that I'm about to dissociate and then actually start dissociating.

All my dissociation episodes only last about an hour or 2.

But yeah, does this sound like dissociation/depersonalization and is anyone else triggered by dark places?"
5,"i don’t know what this is or if it’s even dissociation but i feel like i’m living in a memory everything i see seems so familiar and i get a kind of nostalgia from it, and i get emotional from smells of things and things that happen to me. it feels like i’ve lived it before, i cant explain. it’s freaking me out."
5,"Literally everything looks super far but so close.. I feel I could do anything without consequences, and that I’m outside of my body. Is this dissociation? Or am I in psychosis? Should I go to the hospital?"
5,"I smoke weed everyday, at night mostly, around 10pm or 11-12pm. I smoke a couple times after that time and I’ve been dissociating more. I dissociate when I’m super hungry or tired, which is so weird? I hate it ): but I’m scared to stop smoking. I need help!"

5,"I don't think I have dissociation but I have a condition where one day I woke up when I was 10 and I had no feelings- no happiness and no sadness. It took 10 years and I'm sure time, hormones, maturity, brain restructuring and nearing the age of 25 (where the brain reaches its full size) all played a part in it, but here are some recent diet changes that helped and helps me \*feel\* more:

1. decaf green tea
2. vitamin d3 supplements
3. b12 supplements"
