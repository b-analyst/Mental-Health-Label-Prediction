1,"Hi guys,
I have been diagnosted with a trauma from bullying (not PTSD, but it's similar, a ""soft"" version of it so I'll post it here).
For like half a year I have been having the following issues:
When I am trying to sleep, I wake up every hour and I keep having the same nightmares every time. I always dream about how I am in school again and how I meet my bullies, which are quite a lot. Sometimes I am remembered of bullies I don't even think about, which causes new unpleasent memories. I am at a point where I don't even want to sleep anymore, I keep seeing these people every time I fall asleep.  

Is there a way to stop these damn nightmares? It's driving me really crazy. All I want is having a peaceful life and relaxing sleep. Also, why do I keep waking up every hour?

Thank you for your answers."
2,"Sooo, in November 2019, around Thanksgiving, i had a suicide attempt.  I ended up with severe injuries, and spent a few months in hospital (2 months) and then a month and a half in a psychiatric hospital.  But the strange thing is, i have almost ZERO memory of being in the ICU, BUT, i remember everything else; i remember being in the ER.  The last thing i remember is ICU nurse giving me a call-button for my IV pain medication, which was a very short memory (i think it might have been morphine).  Then i have one very clear memory of waking up from surgery and eating a sandwich and throwing up a lot. My only other memory is EXTREMLY foggy and vague and really short, which was talking to a psychiatrist.   Then i just remember waking up in the pediatrics ward after my other surgery. I was in there for approximately one week. so why can i barely remember anything??? I don't think it was due to trauma, because i remember everything before they gave me the pain meds, so my theory is that they either sedated me, or the pain medication was naturally sedating. I just want to remember SOMETHING more.  Thanks"
3,"My absence record at work is fine. I’ve only had 1 day off in the last year. I’m just about to put a sick note into work, because I feel like I’m getting worse and my doctor has upped my medication.

I told my manager on Friday about my mental health and he just kind of shrugged me off.

I’m worried in case they have a go at me for putting in a sick note."
4,"I was diagnosed with PTSD back in December.

I thought it was just really bad anxiety at first. I couldn’t put my finger on one of the symptoms, though.

I explained the symptom to a co worker. I said ""when I’m around lots of people, or when I have been put in a situation, when I feel threatened. I feel as though, I’m not in the room, like it’s all a dream. Non of it is real""?

my co worker then said that it could be dissociation.

I told my therapist and they told me that dissociation is a whole other mental health condition.

it means split personality.

Dissociative Identity Disorder.

however, my therapist said a symptom of PTSD is dissociation.

I’m really not coping at the moment. I’m certainly not fit for work. My life is a complete struggle at the moment. I’m close to the edge."
5,"Hi all,

what I'm about to describe might seem silly (to me, it definitely is) and perhaps unmatched to what ""real"" PTSD is. My ""trauma"" is nothing close to sexual abuse, violence or something that serious, but it gives me some problems in daily life. So here we go.

In few weeks, I'm about to have an exam of skills and knowledge obtained on a certain course (no neccessary to go into details here). Yesterday, I had dreams that I failed it and I'm afraid I'm about to have those dreams regularly in following weeks. Anxiety attacks are becoming frequent as the date of exam is closing in.

This started to happen during my college time, when I first experienced such dreams. Always some time during exam period in January, June and September. It became regular, especially during senior years. I graduated and left college in 2013, but I experienced those kind of dreams and anxiety moments until 2016 (always, each year during January, June and September), when it kinda faded away. I can say that I stressed pretty much regarding finishing college, since no viable option was left if I failed.

Nowadays, every time I'm about to take some kind of exam (whether be language after completed course, driving exam, literally ANY kind of test/exam where my knowledge is rated by someone, instructor or professor), I start experiencing anxiety attacks and bad dreams at least several days before. No matter of importance, it can be just some petty course, even if I'd fail, it wouldn't have any negative impact on my life (contrary to exams in college).

Is it possible that this ""trauma"" has been caused by stressing too much about successfully completing exams years ago? It's becoming quite annoying to deal with. Is there any method to get it under control?

Thanks for your answers!"
6,"I’d like to talk about what’s happening to me and hopefully it’s at least a bit understandable. It’s going to be a long post, because I want to be clear what’s going on with me.

I suffer from severe anxiety and other weird problems. I haven’t had a clear diagnose. I’ve been to therapy multiple times and I have heard a few things coming by like avoidant personality disorder, agoraphobia, ocd, autism and more. The only thing I’m aware of is my official diagnose on ADHD and social anxiety disorder. The last one is obvious for me. I feel severely anxious around people, but it does not seem like a typical social anxiety issue though. I’ll come back to ADHD later on. 

So, if trauma can be the reason of why I feel this way is correct is kinda vague for me. My coach (not a official therapist) is pretty positive in the case. He showed me the symptoms of (c) ptsd and I must say, I relate to a lot of them. 

First of all, I must tell you where I deal with and I need to tell a bit about my past as well. I’ll try to keep it short, but that’s going to be a bit hard though, because there is a lot to tell. 

First of all when I was 5 years old my parents divorced and my mom met a new husband. My mom got pregnant pretty fast and soon we became trapped basically. At least once a week there was a situation getting out of control which ended up of me or my family getting hurt. Physical abuse, but also mentally. This went on for 8 years with a few situation that are still in my mind, but it’s mostly the constant feeling of not feeling safe. This all seems blurry to me though and I ask myself if I actually didn’t felt safe. I’m not sure, it’s a long time ago. Things came to climax after 8 years where the husband of my mom beat my mom up and we literally escaped to another place. 

I was very insecure at that time. Mostly socially. However, I am pretty good at hiding it. I finished high school which is quite a achievement if I look back again. Not much later I started experiencing with marijuana, which made me feel a bit paranoid or however you want to call it. However, I was smoking weekly with my friends, because I didn’t want to be different then them. In my first year of my new study I fainted in my classroom which was terrifying. Especially if you take the social anxiety in consideration as well. My first major panic attack happened because of marijuana. I basically experienced many of the same things I had with the fainting. One day in summer I decided to try magic mushrooms. Very impulsive. My friends experienced with drugs and I didn’t want to fall behind. The fear of losing control was very prominent while taking it. I just felt a incredible feeling of unease. I also took it in a forrest which wasn’t comfortable at all. I regret it still.. After that I finally decided to stop doing these drugs. Not much later however I experienced full blown panic attacks while feeling sober. However, it’s often not noticeable, because I feel like I have to hide it. So usually I pinch myself heavily when I feel there is a need to hide it. I started to feel super anxious in public and especially in places I couldn’t move out easily. 

I went out to search for help and after a few months I found some. I went to therapy over there for longer then a year. Long story short, it didn’t made me improve. It actually just went worse. They didn’t had a clear plan to really help me. I just did a few things here and there once a week. When that was over I fel in the deep and I spend longer then a year without help. I was waiting for therapy, but the waiting lists are very long. I started to develop more and more fears. Many aren’t easily to explain. I think the best way to describe it is that my mind constantly notice things that I can place in the category fearful and danger focused on going insane and losing control. In general I felt like I experienced the world through different glasses then others. The world just felt (still feels).. Unsettling. It’s just very hard to explain unfortunately. It’s just a constant feeling. Everything I feel and see.. Just feels fearful. Like I’m not supposed to be here. I also experience(d) intrusions which made me totally freeze up. Intrusions about hurting others. At least, I hope they are intrusions. Certain colors, drinks, foods, and numbers became fearful to me. Everything I can place under the term dark makes me totally anxious. In the meantime I went to look for help 1 time at a different place and it was a horrible experience, although it was just 1 meeting. I felt like I was in some kind of horror movie. Everything just felt very fearful. The people as well. 

I didn’t even tell about this yet, but I spend almost all of time at home. The first thing I wasn’t able to do was going to my study, later the bus, friends, family, grocery stores till a point where just simple walks where not possible anymore. A important notation is that I still live with at my moms house, so that’s why that’s possible. The contact with her is relatively good, although my fears are blocking the full potential. 

1 year later out of nowhere they called me for a appointment. In the meantime I developed all kinds of things, so the original question for help wasn’t really valid anymore. The time was limited to just 3 months and was completely focussed on exposure. Long story short (again). It didn’t help me. They send me to my current coach and I’m waiting for a new psychologist. I recently started in a social group via my coach where we go outside and just do some work like cleaning gardens and such. A huge step. Today I went for the first time and it was super tough. Most of the things I describe here where things I experienced today in high intensity. I felt just super intensely weird and overwhelmed. And again, it’s just hard to explain. 

I’m depressed. That’s not even a doubt. I think that also makes a lot of sense. I’m 21 years old now with no hope for the future. It just feels like I’m doomed in a fearful world. Sometimes I think about ending it all, but I know I’m way too frozen for that and I know it’s wrong at the end of the day. I’m afraid there is nothing I can do. I’ve tried a ton, but it never made me improve. Emotionally I feel completely stuck. I can’t cry. I hate how I lack of empathy. Although all of this avoiding is not only for myself, because I don’t want to hurt someone. I fear that I have something as schizophrenia or something like that as well, although everyone says I don’t have that. My fears just feels very weird. The way I think feels very out of order. 

Honestly, I can say I wish I was normal, but I don’t know what normal is anymore after feeling like this for almost forever. Social contact is something I struggle with. I wish that wasn’t the case. It’s just that my brain is just constantly speaking nonsense. I don’t know.. 

If anyone made it this far. Thanks for your time. If someone thinks he or she can might help. Please don’t hesitate to send a reply."
7,"Hello All,

I question if this is PTSD. 

I have been through a lot.

history:

Alcoholic parents- never hit me but demeaned a lot.

Ex-Husband abuse- He came back from war different and would attack me. But not the fist to the face. He'd push the air out my chest by pushing me down and with all his weight. He'd also put his full weight on my shoulder I injured in high-school. He'd also lock the door in the car speed and poke me in the face till I'd cry. He threw me in the Tub when I was throwing up from morning sickness. He verbally abused me and financially crippled me. It's been 10 years and I finally finished paying the debt I was left with. I was too afraid to fight so I paid.

My daughter's passing - She lived to be 4 years old. Don't like talking about it but she was sick then fine then sick then fine then sick and she went over her dad's house and never came home. She passed in her sleep.

Sexual abuse - I went on a date and I concented to sex, what I did not concent to was the manner. I was bruised from head to toe bleeding and bite marks. I never said no or stop because it was terrifying. I was also used to being obident with from the ex-husband but he never sexual abused me.

Since then I tend to find the same kinda abusive asshole. So I've stop dating, 3 years now.

I did get into drugs and alcohol for a bit of time, quit that too. I drink responsible and never past a certain point. (once a week, if that)

I have issues sticking with decisions and change my mind often career, hair color, fashion, car, and diet. Horrible memory issues that hit me at random. I feel lost a lot of the time and not worthy positive things. I am also confident in my work ethic and capable I can do any job. I lack confidence is social situations and relationships. It's been 9 years and I have finally decided to make friends, all female. Males scare me if they give me a compliment or want to hang out. The second I step out of my comfort zone, I almost have a mental break down. I keep moving back home too. The voice in my head is my ex-husband and my other ex. I sleep what I would consider normal, like before all this but I do still get out of control nightmares and I have issue knowing where I am when I wake up. I also can deal with paranoia the my ex husband is going to find me and hurt me. I always use my parents address even when I don't live there, I've changed my phone number an insane amount of times. 

Is this PTSD or something else? I've sought help for dealing with my daughter passing but I never connected well with the therapist. So 3 sessions only. 

Any suggestions would be much appreciated, I am sick of fear and doubt."
8,"Hey all,

First time on this specific forum so I'll try and be as thorough as I can. 

Basically I've had two different diagnoses, from two different medical professionals, one being PTSD and the other being a hybrid of various phobias and my pre-existing panic disorder. 

Let's start with symptoms. Most prevalent are insomnia and night terrors. Lot of sleeping problems based around my body being ""frightened"" awake, like how a loud bang or something would scare me walking out and about. Heightened aggression is also on the list, I'm way more on edge and aggressive than I've ever been in my life before. Things like loud noises, being trapped in enclosed spaces or among big groups of people, all send me into a frenzy of panic attacks, followed by my cognitive functions stopping entirely; I literally cannot think so I either freeze and stand there for 10 mins or I start destroying everything around me. 

Context: Almost died a couple times (all events occurring while I was alone), usually in situations that arose and passed in a matter of minutes. Also seen death plenty. Family members, pets, all dying in real time right in front of me. Then again, I'm under the impression that most people go through this. The only outlier was an incident in which I fell under lake ice as a child, and had to be rescued and resuscitated. 

My point: I've never been in lethal combat or gone through any other severely traumatic experiences outside of what's common. Yet I'm constantly ready to 'fight or flight' with the lightest of triggers. Loud noises and icy water. Two seemingly normal occurrences, make me fear for my life on a regular basis. I can understand the second one, but I cannot make heads or tails of my sleeping issues, and my aversion to excessive noise. 

Is this PTSD? Or simply a mix of phobias compounded by an existent panic disorder? I don't know much about PTSD so it could very well be a type of panic disorder on its own, which is why I'm asking for advice here, on this forum."
9,"TRIGGER WARNING:

Mention of rape and description of forced sexual activity in this thread.


Hello I’m new here.
I’m here to ask this because I genuinely don’t know. Apologies that this will be long.

So I’m 23 and a few years ago when I was a teenager, I was in an INCREDIBLY abusive relationship. It only lasted a few months and I did break up with him, but in those few short months, the things he did to me have left me with a lot of trauma. A lot of emotional, physical, mental, verbal and sexual abuse. Just all of it. 😞
For a little more context and so you can hopefully understand my story a little more, I’m a transgender man (female to male), and I am gay; I currently have a wonderful, supportive husband.
(Note: I’m not interested in people’s personal issues or opinions or whatever about either of these facts, so please don’t bother going there in the replies. These facts however, are relevant to a part of the story.)

Anyway:
I was in this abusive relationship, and he did rape me.
This was proven to the police, and in a court of law. Obviously at first he denied it but then later confessed, and after a horrible and long ordeal, he was finally put in prison. However, there was an incident mere DAYS before the one which got him imprisoned...
I don’t know whether it was rape or not.

He had two best friends; one of whom was also his cousin. They weren’t particularly nice people either.
On this particular occasion, my then-boyfriend had these two friends over at the same time as me. We were all playing video games together.
But the three of them kept making sexual comments, whispering to each other and laughing.
Something about it all made me very uncomfortable, and I kept wishing they would leave.
At one point, I went to the bathroom, and when I came back, they were all standing up and the TV and console has been switched off.
My then-boyfriend was laying a towel down on his bed.
I figured his friends were now leaving.
My then-boyfriend held his arms out to me and pulled me against him to kiss me. Again, I was pretty uncomfortable doing this in front of his friends, so I gently pushed him away.
But he pulled me back and kept kissing me and his hands were wandering.
Again, got uncomfortable in front of his friends, and asked him if they were leaving now, and he laughed and said no, we were going to “put on a little show”?
I turned around and at this point, his friends were now sitting down...touching themselves!?
Obviously I got even MORE uncomfortable and told my then-boyfriend I wanted to be alone, just me and him. But he said no, it’s rude to ask his friends to go home, and besides I “needed to prove my trust in him”!? I said “are you kidding? You’re still trying to earn back my trust?” (He had cheated on me - a one off as far as I know, and had somehow manipulated me into giving him a second chance even though I had dumped him after finding out. He was VERY good at messing with my head.)
He said “this will prove it. This is something I would only ever do with someone special.” And I had no idea what he was talking about.
The next thing I remember, was his friends starting to grope me all over. I had recently had my top surgery (double mastectomy), and one of them said to my then-boyfriend “I thought you said he was trans? Where are his t**s?” And my then-boyfriend said “oh he had that surgery already.” Then that same friend went “ugh where’s the fun in that?! Oh well. We’ll have to make do with what’s there.” At that point my then-boyfriend told them I hadn’t had my ‘other surgery’ yet.
I freaked out at this point and said to his friends “I’m not here for anyone’s ‘fun’. I’m *insert name here*’s boyfriend; not yours!”
They laughed.
My then-boyfriend then took over and pushed me back on the bed... 
The next thing I know, all three of them are on me from all angles! I couldn’t get up and I said I don’t want to, but they didn’t listen to me.
My then-boyfriend told them it’s fine and to go ahead. He doesn’t mind!
I said “well I mind!” But again nobody listened to me.
Then they took it in turns to have sex with me. I tried to get up but they would keep just pushing me back down again.
They were all pretty muscular and masculine guys and I had trouble pushing them off me. But I didn’t shout or scream or fight. I did try to get away but they would just drag me back in place and carry on like I was a rag doll...
Eventually I just stopped. I couldn’t do anything. I completely froze and was dazed, I remember feeling completely “out of it” even though I hadn’t been given anything to my knowledge?
I just... there are parts where I remember exactly what they were doing, and there are parts where I just draw a blank and don’t fully remember...
When they were all done with me, I just lay there and couldn’t move.
My then-boyfriend slapped me on the behind and said “good boy. You did really well. I’m proud of you”.
And I couldn’t even say anything.
Then his friends all got cleaned up and dressed again and left. My then-boyfriend told them “same time again next Saturday fellas. I’ll text you.”
The whole time it was happening, none of them spoke to me. They did everything with my then-boyfriend’s “permission” but not mine. They just passed me around between them. And I was so “out of it” in my head and my body just felt limp and like I had no control over it. 

Anyway I’m sorry to go into such detail. I hope I didn’t trigger anyone. I’m so sorry if I did!
My question is, was this rape?
Because I did freeze and my mind went blank. I didn’t do enough to stop it but I definitely didn’t consent, and I didn’t want it.
I didn’t climax or anything like that. I know that much. I definitely didn’t enjoy it!
I know I was so stupid. I would never willingly sleep with more than just my romantic partner - I’m not that sort of person! 
I feel like it’s all my fault though because I didn’t do enough.
I finally confessed all to my husband and a close female friend; both broke down in tears and said they were so sorry and that it was gang rape... 
Was it?
I’m not entirely sure.
I did not consent to any of it, that much is true. But I froze and didn’t fight hard enough.
I quite literally didn’t feel like I could even move! I felt too light to move, if that makes sense?

Please can anyone shed some light on what you think this was? I really don’t know if it was rape or not? Since I froze like that and didn’t push them off me hard enough or protest loud enough. I didn’t want it I swear! They asked him instead of me, but...
I’m so confused. I’ve held on to this for years and I blame myself entirely.
I’ve never told anyone until now. They knew about him raping me on his own, though.

I feel like an idiot even asking, but I genuinely don’t know. The trauma from it has been eating me up and affecting me in various, very specific ways ever since.
I couldn’t hide it any longer.
It’s been causing me to act impulsively out of fear (fleeing the house and pushing my husband away - without meaning or wanting to! - at the slightest argument), avoiding certain things like gaming because of what was going on just before this took place, and just having awful thoughts and nightmares. It’s been getting worse and worse. I know I’m traumatized, whatever it was. I’ve been feeling so low and worthless and hopeless, just feeling dirty and disgusted in myself and like a sl*t... 😞
I hate myself so so much. I can’t bear it.
I know me fleeing the house at the slightest argument, and pushing my husband away is hurting him, and I hate myself even more for it. I don’t mean to hurt him of course! He is my whole world. He’s been. so understanding and caring and supportive though, which just makes me feel even worse. This is why I eventually had to come clean to him about it. He’s been fantastic and I hate myself so much for hurting him because he’s just been so supportive and so kind and caring about this whole thing. I don’t deserve him 😢 

Please help me shed some light on the truth? Was it truly rape? I don’t even know anymore. I get so many mixed messages and mixed feelings about it.

Thank you so much for reading this far.
Sorry if I haven’t made much sense."
10,"I am of course new here and I thought maybe talking or rather typing and reading things that others are going through similar to me would help... I have PTSD and BPD due to a horrific childhood abuse in every form of the word. I am 41 now and have made some really bad mistakes due to me trying to ""punish"" myself as my dr said because it is what I know. So a little back story is I am married with children and have a wonderful spouse. However after we had a child something really changed me and I decided to cheat and cheat more than once and when I did I became someone I am not in real life. My spouse has kept me around and even helped me through a few hospitalizations. I am past that part where I feel the need to cheat and become anything other than me but I am really bothered by how I block EVERYTHING out. I don't remember most of my childhood nor a lot of the years while I was cheating. It's like I can remember somethings like they were yesterday but I literally feel like a black hole when it comes to a lot. I feel lost sometimes when my spouse brings up the past because I can easily forget about it BECAUSE I really don't remember it. They however do and sometimes it builds up and it unleashes (which I do not stop because everyone needs to be able to get things out) I get super emotional of course because of the way I made them feel and what I have done to them but I also get so mad at myself when I get asked questions or get asked if I even remember because they do not think I block things out they think I just don't want to talk about it. Honestly in reality I wouldn't enjoy talking about it but I would prefer to be able to. I get HORRIBLE flash backs from my childhood but when I try to remember things its like I am trying to remember what happened to someone else. I feel alone in this and just need some kind of hope that I am not the only one dealing with something like this... Does anyone else have any problems like this and if so how have you been able to live with it? Any insight might be nice"
11,"Long story incoming with lots of background detail on existing relationship for context: 

I have a very loving relationship with a man who I’ve been with for five years now. He has supported me and stayed with me despite a large amount of that time being long-distance, with me relocating three times for work or education related reasons, and at times rarely being able to see one another, and although there has been strain because of these issues, our bond has always been incredibly strong and loving. There have been times in our relationship where perhaps I did the wrong thing - for example I decided after we should break up at one point when I was studying overseas, as I was finding the distance too difficult and missing him too much. This only made the situation worse, and I realised this wasn’t what I wanted, and we were able to reconcile things. Another two years later, at a particular point while we were living together, my partner was incredibly busy working two jobs, and I was busy with my own job in a bar, and as he was very tired and we were rarely having sex or connecting emotionally, I began to feel neglected, and started to develop feelings for a person I worked with. I communicated this to him, and we had a week or two apart while I figured out what was going on, and ultimately I came to understand that I was just needing more support from my partner, and was afraid that I was losing him emotionally, and that I didn’t want anyone else, so we were able to rectify things, although understandably it took a while to rebuild trust in this situation. 

This year I had been planning to move overseas for a one year job contract, but due to the pandemic my departure date of last September was continually pushed back, and me and my partner passed a year living together really happily. I was amazed at how while other couples seemed to be struggling with strains of the pandemic on our relationship, we had only grown closer. The only real issue we experienced in our relationship at this time was that I struggled with his extremely overblown reactions to what he perceived as criticism. If I would ask him a seemingly benign question sometimes like what he had planned for the day, he would suddenly switch into this angry irrational state where he shouts at me to **** off, before coming out of it and realising that I wasn’t intending to attack him and being very apologetic for his behaviour. This has led to many arguments with me not understanding why he would speak to me that way, but one thing that kept coming up was that in the moment when he felt attacked he would say he was incapable of rations thought and just reacted. The more I read up on this, the more it became apparent to me that he was suffering with PTSD. He has told me about various traumatic events that happened to him when he was younger that left him returning to his mother’s home and barely living for quite some time, only really leaving the house to go to the pub. He also  suffers from various unexplainable ailments such as fibromyalgia, random sharp pains and headaches, and issues with IBS, which it amazed me to read are common in trauma sufferers, and allowed me to make a lot more sense of what he was going through, and feel more sympathetic to it. He struggles also with being in places that are unfamiliar to him, and will be on extremely high alert at all times in these situations, struggle to take in conversations and react to small changes in the environment. I had previously thought this was just some form of anxiety, but the more I read on PTSD the more all these patterns of behaviour fit together. I also have been reading lots of books on PTSD to try and help me understand how to help him better, as he is incredibly reluctant to speak to a therapist. 
 
At one point in the past couple of months, he broke down and told me he couldn’t cope with me leaving overseas for the job, and that I’m his whole world. I tried to tell him that it doesnt have to be forever, and if we aren’t coping well with it either I can come back or he can come out there, and we will see how things go. It seems silly now, but I had planned at around the six month mark of being there to ask him if he wanted to marry me, but I never communicated this to him, so I can understand where his doubts would come from about me going, especially after the break up we had the last time I was over there.

During the pandemic, my partner also lost his grandmother who he was not able to see leading up to her death at all, and although he rarely showed emotion around this, I understood it must have caused him a lot of pain. Earlier this year, he also found out that his grandfather’s cancer was terminal, and he had been discharged from hospital so can no longer see him. He is a very sensitive person who feels things incredibly deeply, and although he may not often verbalise his feelings, I understood that he was really struggling with this.

This was around the time I noticed a sudden and dramatic change in my partner. Some days he would be still be his usual self, but there were becoming more and more days where he would sit on social media all day doing nothing. He started to develop obsessions with the past, constantly scrolling through decade old pictures and changing his social media profile pictures to these, obsessing over finding pictures of his old cat that passed away a long time ago, and suddenly taking an interest in hobbies he hadn’t pursued in a decade or so, such as skateboarding. I became increasingly concerned because I could see him spiralling and didn’t understand whether this was grief or PTSD, and he was also spending significant amounts of time making emotional and personal posts on his Twitter account,which is very out of character for him - he tends to just post about films or post jokes. He seemed to be connecting with more women via social media, which was making me feel incredibly insecure, and we spoke about this a couple of times and how it was making me feel. He very rarely seemed capable of genuine smiles, and all his silliness that I love so dearly seemed to have disappeared overnight. I tried talking to him about this on several occasions, and he told me he was just feeling numb to everything at the moment.

Eventually, it got to a point where I felt I was being as supportive as I could, and he was still reaching out to other women on the internet a lot, and liking their selfies etc, and I told him I felt this was really disrespectful to me, especially as we had already spoken about how it makes me feel. He seemed understanding of why I would be upset by it and apologised, but the whole time it felt he was almost not even in the room with me. At the end of this conversation, I asked him, ‘There isn’t anyone I need to worry about is there?’, and he hesitated before saying that there might be, and that he had been speaking to a girl on the internet over the past couple of weeks that he thought he might have a crush on.

I was in shock and devastated at this, and I asked him did he still love me, he told me that yes, he loved me deeply, he had never been more attracted to me, and that he still thought we were insanely compatible and were soul mates, so he couldn’t understand it either. We talked emotionally for a while, and he kept reiterating that he loved me so much. I admitted to him that I had wanted us to get engaged in the near future, and he broke down and told me he had been thinking the exact same thing, and had had a lot of thoughts about how the wedding would be.
He told me he had spoken with his best friend about these thoughts he’d had about this other woman, who had told him that it’s quite normal to get crushes when you’ve been with someone a long time, and that what matters is how you choose to deal with it. 
we agreed to give each other space for him to clarify his feelings, and at the beginning of the week he would message me telling me things like how he had never had any doubts about me and always been totally crazy about me, but then towards the end of the week he suddenly became very robotic in his messages and cold, when he replied at all. I was unsure at the time whether I should carry on messaging him and supporting him through what he was dealing with, but then two days ago had a realisation that as long as he isn’t sure if he wants to be my partner, it’s not really my place to give him constant reassurance despite my feelings towards him, and it was doing me a lot of harm.
Having this space to myself has made me realise a lot of things about my own past traumas and fear of intimacy that causes me to become very uncomfortable when things are smooth, and explains why I have felt the need to move away so often in the past. I realised that moving overseas for this job isn’t really what I want, and that I would much rather make plans together with my partner, and find more satisfying work I can do here, as I was already having doubts about whether the job was really right for me. I’m working with a therapist to help with my own fears of intimacy and goal setting for the future, and have been doing lots of mindfulness and self-care activities to try and clarify my mindset. I am also seeing a rape counsellor to speak about something that happened to me when I was in my year abroad at university. I communicated all of these realisations I had had to my partner, as I was feeling that it was likely his feelings that I was abandoning him may have been a huge cause of his emotional withdrawal, and he told me he was really happy to hear this and wished he had known sooner, and that he just needed time to process what he is going through.
I don’t understand how a person can be madly in love in one instance, and withdrawn and numb the next, and I can’t help but feel he has intentionally or subconsciously put up some kind of guard to protect himself because of his fear of me going away. The strange changes in his behaviour tell me that something more is going on than this being just about our relationship.

Can anyone who may have been through a similar pattern of behaviour, or knows more about PTSD give me some advice on this situation? I’m deeply in love with this person, and would do anything to help him through this, but I appreciate and respect his need for space."
12,"Hello everyone, 
So my sister was sexually assaulted during a trip she went one year ago to visit her best friend who was participating in a student exchange program at that time. Her friend was basically very busy during my sister’s stay so one of those days my sister decided to hang out with a guy she had just met there. They just went for a morning coffee and then he suggested to  go to his dorm room. Unfortunately, his intentions weren’t pure and my sister was forced to experience something so horrible, so devastating in a trip she has been dreaming for months. When she told her friend what had happened she wasn’t very supportive , as if she couldn’t realize this was a sexual assault. She couldn’t understand how serious things were. She never understood and never helped my sister. So when my sister came back she was totally broken. As we live in different cities we were only talking on the phone every day at that time . She hadn’t told me  what happened until six months later, when she came to stay with me for a month. I was shocked. I could tell something was torturing her those six months as she was telling me that something bad happened on that trip but it never crossed my mind. Oh my god, it was horrific. I didn’t know how to react, I just cried and cried and hugged her. I was devastated. I still am. The thing is i didn’t know what was the best way to help her. So I decided not to ever bring it up again, I didn’t want her to remember and relive those moments.  I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing just pretending it never happened. I’m just scared. It’s very difficult, I think about it almost every day, what I should do or should have done because it’s been a year now. And I don’t want this to affect my relationship with my sister. I’m so afraid to ask her how she feels. I don’t know what to do. Can someone help me deal with this and advise me how to help my sister ?"
13,"I was in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship several years ago (I'm female, partner was male).
Sometimes I see him in other people, and get a bit disturbed. I had a boss recently who had the same personality as my abusive ex, and I had to quit the job because he reminded me too much of him. This has happened with other people sometimes -- friends, potential partners, coworkers.
I even see it in myself sometimes -- I'll get super impatient with someone and have a slight outburst, but I recognize it. I consciously realize what I did, and that it is probably a result of having been in an abusive relationship.
Is this part of PTSD? Seeing traits of an abusive ex in other people?"
14,"******LONG READ ******


So lets begin with the good. I am 27 (M) she is 28 (F).


My ex and I were together for 6 years. I became very close with her family and siblings. Constantly going over to their houses for family events, dinners, and doing double dates with her siblings and their partners. Each week we made sure to go on a date forsure and spent many other days throughout our entire relationship. My ex and I were best friends, she doesnt have any friends. We took trips each year together, we got 2 animals together, we lived together for 4 years together. I would always do romantic gestures like leaving things on her car after work, or flowers randomly, or bath and spa nights. I put her on a pedastal and did my best to make her feel truly loved. 


We never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things. Thats how well we fit together. Similarly we had many of the same interests and even tried each others interest. I was there for her through tough times when both of her grandparents tragically passed away. I was an usher to walk the caskets down, which can tell you how close I was to her family. Each year I went with her family on family trips. 


Further, we had similar values. We both didnt smoke, didnt do drugs, highly valued our religion that we share and had many similar world views and values for relationships. We valued each other enough to stay in communication every day no matter what by texting or talking. When we lived together, it was never an issue with cleanliness, cooking, etc. We both did our part and never expected the other to have to do such. We had similar future goals and dreams (travel, marriage, family, living on a lake, etc.) 


I can continue, but lets just say that we both felt very happy and in love together. We both expressed this daily. I never lied to her, I never cheated on her, I never did many things that would hurt someone outright. Further, I always tried to support her with her trauma and her own issues.


Now for what happened:


My ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.


She grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and wanta to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. 


My ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.


So no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have 3 things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.


First thing:


My ex and I go to my cabin. She gets on an ATV with my cousin, I make sure they both have helmets and I tell my younger cousin she needs to drive very responsibly because my girlfriend was on it. She said thats okay and I even told my ex if she would rather drive with me she can, yet she was alright going with my cousin. 


15 minutes later they are involved in a head on collison with a truck going around a very sharp turn at like 15 miles per hour. I was following them in my car and I was behind them by like a few hundred yards so I didnt see it happen due to the curve. Anyways I ran to my exes side. Held and compressed her leg as she was bleeding. Fast forward, I followed to the hospital and went into her room and waited the whole time with her. She was able to leave within 2 hours and had a tear in her muscle behind her knee, as well as a traumatic brain injury, and further a deviated septum.


We go back to my cabin, and I pretty much take care of my ex the next 24 hours til we leave for home. I helped her bathe, get dressed, made meals, grabbed ice or heat stuff, and even tried cheering her up by watching comedies she likes. 


After dinner my aunt (mother to my cousin) asked me for help. I asked what for and she explained to me that my cousin didnt finish her test to drive the ATV before we left. I told her that I feel uncomfortable doing that and so I opted out. An hour later she asks me again but now tells me that if I dont that the state could sue my grandparents. My grandparents live month to month on their retirement and social security, thus I felt obligated. Later I found out they had insurance and that she was manipulating me. However in this moment my ex felt like I broke her trust by taking this test that I felt obligated to take. She felt like I intentionally set out to cover it up that my cousin should not have been driving. I see where she is coming from but also I felt pressured into it by my aunt and I explained this to her but she said it hurts her still and her trust was broken. I apologized by writing her a letter explaining how I never intentionally meant for that.


Now fast forward 2 months, my ex is still healing and I bring up possibly going to my cabin for a holiday and asking if she wanted to go. She said absolutely not, because my uncle and cousin may be there. I said I understand but this worried me because I was thinking about our future and how it would work regarding family occasions. I brought this up to her and we had a disagreement about it. I asked if they could come to a future wedding of ours, or if we held a family holiday would they be able to come? To which she said again absolutely not. I expressed how I felt about this considering this uncle was the one I was closest to. I said do you think in time your feelings will change? And she said no because of the permanent damage she felt from the accident. Then she brought up covering up for my cousin and that I should never speak to them again because of the pain they put her through via the accident and trust breaking. I took about a week to consider everything. During this time she thought and convinced herself I was choosing them over her BECAUSE I was arguing with her about them being in my life for future events. My family members also never reached out past the first week following the accident and she felt hurt by this. Yet, I reached out constantly and was supporting her healing process. I even wrote to her parents my apology for the damage she had been dealt. Unfortunately I will touch upon this later but her dad banished me from their house and family events.


I blocked my cousin, aunt, and uncle and sent them a long message regarding everything. Up to this point 2 months after the accident I had not spoken to them, and had been supporting my ex's healing progress. So not only did I not speak to them, but I blocked them and wrote what they did wrong and how it was not acceptable. Thus in this moment choosing her over my family members. She came back at the end of that week despite all of this and said my actions showed I chose my family over her and she felt very hurt by this. She said my actions to argue against her for people who hurt her was clear to her how I felt. These arguments were never yelling or anything, it was simply me asking if they would be able to be at certain events and my reasoning why I would appreciate them there. And even after me making my actions clear about not speaking to them since, and blocking them, she still felt betrayed because as she said, ""my actions are clear and you chose them over me.""


Well we dropped this topic moving forward because she was focusing on healing and I blocked them. Yet she still seemed hurt. Now her father is a great person, yet he is strict and he has autism. She never shared with her parents all the details. Simply the details of the accident. Before the accident I was at her house 2/7 days in a week I would say because that way my ex and I could see each other because she liked being at home. Then 2/7 days at my house. And 1 of those 4 days we would do a full date all day or all night. Anyways, since the accident her father grew very resentful to me. Despite my apology in writing, and even in person. He would argue with my ex that she needed to break up with me and that I was not a good person because I let her get on a dangerous machine. Mind you my ex is 27 and I am not controlling thus I did what I could by warning my cousin to be safe and giving them helmets. So her father blamed me, and he told I am not allowed over to their house. So now, my ex and I only saw each other at my house and less. Even so, my ex told me that she had to lie to her father where she was going because he would consistently yell at her to break up with me because I am not a good person for letting her get hurt.


Fast forward 3 more months, were still doing weekly dates and still having sex frequently. We are getting into a better place as we close into graduating. At this time, we were at our parents doing internships. I still am not allowed over and she is even having me pick her up a street over because she did not want her dad to see when we would spend time together. This was hard for me but I never argued about it and just understood despite how bad I felt that her dad hated me when I didnt cause the accident. We are spending less time together because of her father on her back, and because she doesnt prefer to always come to my house (I have smokers in the house and she hates the smell, as do I but I need to deal with it until I could move out again) i would always spray and light candles to make it better.


Event 2:


Now another month forward we are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that we are unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it must have failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have an anxiety disorder which she knew about. My panic is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and intrusive thoughts. These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: ""I am so grateful and happy for this. I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me even more then they were with the accident."" She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure some things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I push myself to work and find a career. She agrees but still seems really sad. 


I see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her thats okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast have of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby our of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. 


After seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month looking for work 8 hours a day. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat. Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.

We give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.


Another week and at this point we are going together to all of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I want to keep our baby, but if not then I still want children in our future. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision.


Finally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.


A week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. 


The day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. 


It happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.


We do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs, and still doing our weekly dates as best as we can with covid and not being able to go to her house. 


Fast forward 2 more months. And she got a job! I am still looking because in my field (teaching) they were distance learning and not in need of subs nor teachers. Soon summer was upon us and she was working 40 hours a week.


Event 3:


Well by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion, the previously mentioned betrayal she felt from the accident, and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. 


Well for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours).


She had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things.


Now to the most current thing:


Still in this realm of feeling sad due to time spent, and everything, my ex and her family go on their family vacation. The one normally I always go on, yet I was not even invited and my ex never brought up considering inviting me. They leave for a week and I am happy for them to be going.


When they return I plan a date for my ex and I the following day. It goes really well until the end. She begins telling me about the trip and how her sisters friends went. This made me feel sad and left out and I began to cry. I explained that I just felt excluded from her life the past few months. Especially now between the bbq and the trip where other people not even affiliated with any family member aside from being friends with them was invited. As well as the lack of her inviting me to do things we use to do together.


She is mad and tells me it is completely out of her control. And I tell her I understand completely that part (cabin/bbq) yet I wish she would try to invite me to more parts of her life I can be a part of.


The next day she is majorly distant, and so I call her and she tells me she is pissed at me. I give her a few days. Then we meet up and essentially she tells me that she doesnt know if she can give me what I need anymore. Going on to tell me that she doesnt see a future together, she doesnt want to have children with me, doesnt want to get married. She tells me that she spent a week having fun and that I ruined it by bringing all of that up. Then that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.


2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you."
15,"Back when I was only 21 years old I had been in a very physical and verbal and mental and emotional relationship with an ex-boyfriend who was 20 years old at the time and he had told me that he had been enjoying watching and viewing porn and it made me sick to my stomach. So badly that I just thought that if I had used my own body for his issues then I could save children,  while he was doing the act on me and I felt hurt by how my body would just let go and he was pleased by how my body would do stuff in reaction to his sicken ways.. I got confused on why the body would reI was told by that ex-boyfriend to call him personal family names it made me feel sick and he had raped 5 different nights throughout our sicken evil relationship in 2011 while we would be in his grandparent's basement and he would tell me if I ever told anyone no one would believe since I enjoy doing sexual stuff in my past. It made me sick and I went to court for an order of protection against that ex-boyfriend at that time I was fearful of him since I had let him use my apple iPod and I never knew until later that he would use that to view all that disgust and sicken stuff. I was fearful I would be charged by the police since it was my item and my iPod.  I am sorry I felt as if I never get out of that sicken evil relationship. I could be hurt and even murdered by this ex-boyfriend. I still feel if I told anyone maybe he could get help mental with his issues. Am I being too hard on myself since I had been raped victim back when I was 15 years old by a disgusting pig who lied about his real age at the time back in 2005 and shown me a fake drivers license saying it 17-year-old person who turned out be found online on the sex offender registry in my local US State website and that 17-year pig turned out to be really a 23 year who had raped another minor even younger than me being 15 years old at this time.



I am really sorry if I had triggered anyone. I do not mean any harm, I am just very confused on why my body had reacted like that with the ex-boyfriend who is a disgusting pig of a person."
16,"I have PTSD from military service and it has been causing lots of issues. I'm so distant from my family they don't hardly know me anymore. I live in a constant state of panic, fear, anxiety, and depression. Three years ago I took a big promotion and pay raise and it required moving away a few hours from friends and family. The job was great and I was glad that I made the move but underlying symptoms and health issues soon started surfacing.  My family had a very difficult time with the move and still trying to adjust in some ways. 

My employees started commenting on how I was forgetting things and not getting any direction from me. It was almost as if I weren't there. My boss had a stern conversation with me and was threatening to fire me. Never in my entire life has anyone threatened to fire me. I've always been a top performer and never had a bad evaluation. My boss and I had a good relationship so I opened up a little to him and he had no idea what I was dealing with. He said my staff had come to him saying that I was forgetting a lot of things and was disengaged. He wanted me to get better and work things out. 

Several months before this I had fell into severe depression and wanted to die. I hated myself and my life and had no will to live. I remember waking up a lot of mornings wishing I had never been born. This I know carried over into my work life and is the reason things transpired the way they did. 

I talked with my family about what I was going through and they wanted me to take a step back and go back to my old job. Less stress and being closer to friends and family seemed to make the most sense. Things were lined up and ready to go for the transition back to my old job until COVID had other plans. I took another job and was determined to not repeat the same mistakes. I stayed six months, busted my tail, worked crazy hours, and had glowing reviews. Only problem is the drive was 1.5 hr away and working 12+ hours a day wasn't working. A company 10 minutes from home called me out of the blue and offered me a job for about the same pay.  Now I'm two jobs down the road and scared I'm about to have another unpleasant situation at work. I've had three jobs in the past year and really don't want to do a fourth. Over the last 15 years (excluding the past year) I've only had two jobs. I think I'm hypersensitive to any perceived threats and my mind goes crazy playing out doomsday scenarios which tends to lead to being homeless and living under a bridge. This can stem from something as simple as ""hey how is that report coming?"" My mind will somehow take that harmless conversation and turn it into a final warning and one more slip up I'm done for. 

My wife has said many times that I'm drifting further and further away. She said she can't remember the last time I smiled or laughed. We haven't been intimate in a long time which bothers her. It's really difficult for me to be intimate because of the depression and anxiety. 

How can I balance PTSD, my loving family, and career? I'm worried I'm forgetting things, starting to get disengaged, and feels like I'm headed down the wrong path. I feel like I'm paralyzed and can't do anything to correct any performance issues. In reality I may be fine and don't have nothing to worry about. I want to overcome this and hate feeling this way! Once I can overcome this I want to focus on reconnecting with my family."
17,Why can’t I get out of this town where I was adopted into and always been lied about and Physically and mentally and financially abuse my whole life I’ve always treated everybody with respect and worked my ass off And I was there when the people that adopted me and abused me until they died of old age but yet I’m still a Big piece of Crap and now I’m broken down and just about crippled the only way out I can see is to die I’ve been begging my whole life for God almighty to take my life but he won’t let me die it looks like he gets a joy out of watching these good Christian people torture me until I go crazy or what ever
18,"Hi everyone!
This is all very new to me but I just feel like I need to write this down.
Just started therapy and that’s only making it clearer my girlfriend doesn’t want to work on it together.
My story:

I’m a lesbian and in a relationship with a woman who also identifies as a lesbian, but has a history with men.
About 8 years ago I got cheated on by my girlfriend at the time with multiple men.
Some of those men confronted me with ‘evidence’, harassed me (I should leave her alone, what can she do with a girl, she needs a real man..).. I really loved and trusted this girl and always believed her excuses when she had to work late or had family things.
Until one night, one of the guys she was seeing, broke into her apartment while we were sleeping upstairs. He pulled me out of the bed and beat me, threw me down the stairs.. He said I should leave his girlfriend alone (MY girlfriend I thought..), said really disrespectful things about lesbians, humiliated me, I was devastated..
Obviously I broke of what I thought was a relationship.
I was completely lost, didn’t date for 5 years.. I didn’t really trust anyone enough to start a relationship again.
And as long as I didn’t commit to anyone I didn’t really feel the issues I had developed from that experience.
Now I’m with a woman who has slept with men before and I completely freak out by that thought. She also is friends with a guy who she used to sleep with. He comes around all the time, she doesn’t get that it bothers me (she knows my story).
I don’t expect her to drop her friend for me, I just don’t get why he needs to be here weekly.
He cheats on his girlfriend, he’s a real macho, I don’t trust him at all and have difficulty trusting my girlfriend.
This has been a constant argument for us, so I realized I had to work on my issue.
I’m started edmr.
Talking to my therapist has made me realize I’m not crazy, I’m not overreacting, I have ptsd.
My girlfriend says things like : you’re overreacting, this guy is something that’s in the past, there’s nothing to worry about..
One time she also mentioned to a friend how great he is in bed, while I was sitting right there..
I get that my jealousy and stuff is not easy for her, but I feel like I deserve better..
Now she told me that we are over because it’s too much for her and she doesn’t wanna feel like she can’t see her friends..
Anyways, just wanted to write this down.
I’m done with feeling like I’m crazy/overreacting.. I’m ready to work on my issue, with or without her support."
19,"hi, I've been searching for info and other's experience with EMDR and any possible side effects. I've had trauma in my life so I'd say I've got PTSD and I heard about EMDR, it sounds like I could benefit from it. Now with the Covid-19 and variant viruses I could not get help irl so I was wondering about doing it myself, hearing about that you move your eyes from side to side while talking about your traumas? I'm wondering how do you do it and I hope I get the help that I need here. Thanks so tremendously"
20,"TW i am going to talk about my own experiences with my past and i hope someone can tell me what they think. 

At 17 years old, i met my first ""real"" boyfriend. He was an avid weed smoker, i mean 15-20 joints a day and at this time, i was young, impressionable and definitely wanted to seem like a cool stoner girl. So, naturally, i smoked everyday with him ignirant to the abuse.

What makes this story 10x worse is that at the time of meeting him, he was in the early stages of paraboid schizophrenia. I did not know this at the time as i had no awareness of the illness myself. However, there were things that seemed odd but as I was so young I brushed them off bc I thought he was the ""one"". Long story short, he emotionally abused me, accused me of cheating everyday, called me horrible names and refused my help. He would even get paranoid about me looking at strangers in public. 

He was also an avid drug user and because i wanted to impress him, i took cocaine and ketamine often with him (which he asked me several times to buy for him to which i would). At the time i thought this was normal. Looking back, i have not only caused trauma for myself but now a list of mental health problems i didnt think i would ever get. I was very ignorant. 

One time he had a schizophrenic episode to which he locked me in his room and cellotaped the doors so i couldnt leave. He was seeing people that werent there and thought he was going to die. This was very traumatic for me as i was so young and had no clue how to help. I stayed up all night with him until 11 am when the crisis team came to evaluate. 

I was told several times it wasn't healthy for me but the abuse and manipulation kept bringing me back. 

Its been 2 years now and i dont really think about him, however, i notice my anxiety has gotten worse, I struggled for a long time to watch tv and relax doing the thing's i enjoy, i was a slave to his abuse. I sometimes have flashbacks of the events but nothing too extreme, however its affected my motivation, happiness and anxiety. 

Could i be suffering from ptsd? I never thought I could be until i read more about it online. 

Thankyou"
21,"I've been referred to psychology for trauma treatment and received a letter today saying I'm on waiting list for EMDR.  Not what I was originally expecting but apparently waiting list is smaller so I'll be seen quicker.

Has anyone else had this and what does it entail?  How long does it usually last etc?"
22,"Anyone on a steady dose of Ativan for ptsd?  I take an anti depressant, a mood stabilizer and 1 mg of Ativan every other day.  My PTSD is bad plus I have a disfiguring autoimmune disease so the dr has allowed me to stay on the Ativan indefinitely....plus I am 63 so it’s about quality of life verses quality.
Anyone else take Ativan regularly for a number of years."
23,"I have PTSD from witnessing a murder as a child, OCD for me goes hand in hand with it - my issue is rationalizing what is likely and what is nothing to be worried about.. Since I have OCD I can obsess and become terrified of almost anything. To make it short I had a gaming group and so did this other guy, he was mad that people were preferring me.. He started slandering me weeks ago and I didn’t care then girls that used to be in his gaming cult Bc that’s what it is messaged me and said he stalks people relentlessly, he doesn’t leave them alone once he has a target that’s that. So this made me a little uncomfortable and then the girl showed me his mugshots and all his criminal history including murder for hire and tons of violent offenses. The guy himself messaged me and said “this is unacceptable you can’t have people defend you” (I didn’t know people had come to my defense) I could sense his god complex where he needs people to bow down to him... so I simply said I apologize sir I never realized this would be such an issue I’m deleting my groups and anywhere I’ve posted anything gaming wise and again I am sorry if I caused u any issues that was never my intention. He said get your people to not post in my group (they were just saying that I am not charging them and that he was slandering and bullying) I said I will and again I’m sorry and I do not know any of these people personally goodnight. He says “you know we are almost neighbors? You’re like 45 mins away from me”  Then I deleted my entire Facebook out of complete fear … I’ve been obsessing over this and it’s very scary to me. I definitely don’t live as close as he thinks Bc I don’t say where I really live on FB. But either way there’s some creep that could potentially be stalking me idk! I’m so scared what if he was to show up somewhere near me OVER a friggen video game ? like I’m so uncomfortable. Everyone try’s to tell me don’t worry he’s just some guy who needs to feel in control sooo I thought I would let him feel in control and delete everything and maybe he’d go away but I just don’t know what to think! I’m like so scared and I ordered extra security cameras and all that meanwhile he lives 700 miles away… idk so obsessing. HELP ME RATIONALIZE. I can tell
This guy is poor, uneducated, unstable, seems like he is on drugs or maybe he just is not well... but what are the chances someone halfway across the country is really going to try to stalk me and ruin my life"
24,"I've been diagnosed with PTSD after an accident I was in several years ago.  I experienced anxiety for several months after the accident, then it went away with the help of an Zoloft.  Now, it's come back and I've been shaking with headaches and adrenaline surges for the past 2 months.  I can't sleep without ambien. I can't watch TV without shaking...the sound is messing me up.  Bright lights mess me up, too....and ibuprofen isn't touching these headaches.   The Dr. keeps increasing my antidepressant, but it's not helping.  I'm also taking therapy and so far, it's not helping. I'm losing hope....why does this continue on....is there no cure?  Should I be talking to a specialist instead of a GP?  Should I try a different antidepressant?"
25,"Hi - I'm new here. This thread will contain content about sexual abuse. I apologize if I'm in the wrong forum or in the wrong place. But, I would like advice on if I just experience sexual abuse or assault or if I'm thinking too much into it.

2 weeks ago I had to get an x-ray done on my neck. A week later, the office that referred my x-ray called saying the doctor that saw me wanted me to see him at his clinic, in-person, to discuss results. I've gotten x-rays done before and most of the time results are discussed over the phone, so him saying I had to come to his office to do so alarmed me a little bit. Mind you, his office is at a different location than the one I saw him at (30 minutes away difference). So I scheduled my appointment to see him.

He tells me my results (yes, something was wrong...but it's not really important to this story) so then he asked if he could feel my neck. So I moved my hair to the side and he starts feeling around. Then he moves my hair to the other side, made a comment that my hair is soft, and starts massaging the other side of my neck. He massaged my neck and shoulder for a good minute, saying I need to get a massage done. I've had back problems for years and I've never had a doctor...massage me...like that. He found a ""knot"" and said he wanted to try and 'get it out'. So I nervously laughed and kinda shrugged my shoulders hoping to get his hand off. He stopped and brush his hand across my back when he was done.


Small. But enough for me to feel uncomfortable. I've been sexually abused before, so this is why I posted in the PTSD group (yes, I'm diagnosed). But never by a doctor and I don't know if he was just doing his doctor thing or if this was borderline sexual asssult."
26,"Hi. I’m 22, diagnosed with PTSD but haven’t been to therapy in a few years bc it’s really expensive. I used to take meds for depression but I’m not sad anymore. 

Lately I’ve been having weird episodes where I feel like I’m not a real person and I don’t know what to do. This has happened before, when I was a kid. I was just walking at a baseball game after school and suddenly I was convinced that I wasn’t real, like my body was a corpse just moving on its own. And people interacting with me were interacting with some version of me that no longer existed while I was spectating. 

I just graduated college and it’s happening again, but really badly. I’m not sure if this is normal for PTSD-havers to experience? It’s worse than my normal “dissociation” for me. I feel like I’m actually a Thing, an echo, an object, a body and I need to check to make sure I’m not transparent or cold or fake. 

I genuinely feel so crazy talking about it. I know it doesn’t make sense. I’m not even “sad” but I feel and sometimes truly believe that I’m a ghost or a corpse just walking among real people or that everything is all fake. 

Is this a normal symptom of PTSD? If other people experience this, how do you stop? How do you be productive?"
27,"I’ve suddenly been having intrusive thoughts of hurting myself and they scare me so much. I haven’t had much sleep this whole month and I read that sleep deprivation can cause that too. This is causing me so much distress ever since my panic attacks started. I’ve never in my life felt this way before. I want to cry and scream because I want these thoughts to just go away. I would never act up on them because I’m terrified of death or suicide. Every time I hear of someone passing, my body just goes numb and I start to panic. I’m super terrified. Why am I feeling like this? These thoughts come and go and sometimes they stay to haunt me. I’m so scared. Please help! Any advise?"
28,"My wife has a fairly large online presence, and is a big advocate of mental health awareness and all that, but I don’t FEEL like I have much support, day to day. Is it me? Am I too dependent? I guess it would have to start with, what even does “support” look like? Day to day. Through ups and downs. Fights, all that. Can I expect that? SHOULD I? If my mind is always putting me down, will I know if the support is there? How would you know if someone wasn’t, or stopped supporting you? What are signs of support fatigue? Like, someone just can’t. How do you know if you should leave someone because you might be too much and dragging them to a darker place? Are these relevant to anything I started with?
I feel very lost and alone and I’m in this weird mental prairie and there is just nothing but clouds and rain for miles."
29,"I thought that I was the problem and that I was broken and messed up, but I was having a normal reaction to an abnormal (unhealthy) situation. 

It seems like for a lot of my life, people made me to feel like I was the problem and like I was difficult.

I got out of a toxic circumstances in my life and then healed myself using self-help and therapy, and now I am mostly better...I am still having flashbacks and ruminating and having the occasional panic attack...but I am functioning and getting better.

I guess I just wanted to say that it's ok to shut down or to want to run and hide. It's ok to respond to traumas in ways that are socially not always accepted or understood.

There is nothing wrong with us and we are not actually broken...we're reacting based on our natural predisposition + traumatic trigger.

You are ok wherever you are in your journey."
30,"So recently everything that's gone on with my nieces (which is still ongoing and I'll explain in an update soon) have brought forth something that comes up once and awhile, which is I think I was sexually abused as a child.
Every time I pondered this,I quickly shoot it down as impossible but this time the feelings and suspicions are not going away.

I am not sure what to believe.

When I was 8 years old, my sister was married and had a baby and I loved babies, so I always was willing to go over. While during that time my parents were split up and things were stressful, my brother closest to my age was being sexually abused by his cub scout leader (idr what they are called) so my mom pulled him out and was arguing with the church to get the pervert removed,things were so stressful my brother chose to live with my dad. That caused more fights. I knew a lot about what was going on because my mom didn't believe in leaving me in the dark. I was also informed that my older four siblings were abused by our grandparents in the past, my sister who had the baby supposedly lied about being abused and she was just an attention seeker because the oldest 4 had been abused and she was so ignored. My mom supposedly feels bad and calls it sick sibling syndrome and says its her fault for ignoring her so much and that is why lied. I don't know what's true, that happened 10 year before I was born. But I do know, I have always been afraid to be like her, she is a compulsive liar and would get me in trouble, my family didnt like her and compared me to her when I was bad, I was afraid to be l like her.
 
Anyway I was bored, stressed and lonely and so I was always so willing to go to my sister's house to play with her baby, I honestly pretended they were my real family, my sister was my mom my brother in law was my dad and the baby was my little brother.
My brother in law played with me a lot, I enioyed it a lot, but at points the way he'd grab me thinking back it was inappropriate which is why I would yell stop and normally he would. I'm still piecing it all together. But instead if rambling nore I'll cut to the chase. One day, I ran into a porn dvd. I remember the cover in great detail, I found it while I was in his room playing, waiting for him to come capture me in our game and when he came in I asked what it was and he told me, in detail. I remember most of that incident in very clearly however, after the conversation, I don't remember a thing but, it's always felt like something bad happened.
As shamed as I am to say this, I started experimenting with other kids too right after that, consensually of course. I was very hyper sexual for years, yes sadly before puberty(though I started my period at the age of 10). Now I'm repulsed by sex of any sort. If I wasn't abused, I was at least impacted greatly by the incident.
It's something I go back and forth on. Like my emotional mind is convinced I was abused but my logical mind reminds me I have no proof, not even a memory
..although there is one other incident that might prove it happened which is when my sidter  was divorcing him a few years later, I overheard my mom and other sister speaking and my other sister said ""He was talking about making murasakibee his wife (wont and cant use my real name*"" and my mom looked replused and said ""she's 10! ""
That was the first time I felt like I remembered him touching me, I felt at the time he did it a lot. But I quickly went to going with that it was impossible.
There have been several times after that I pondered it but I figured I was wrong. Or I wanted attention because my brother had been abused. I never once brought it up, this is all contemplations I have only had in my head.

Recently though i realized, I have kept all these concerns to myself and I keep going back over and over and really, who am I fooling? Who am I lying too? I am so convinced it happened yet I call my own self a liar. Maybe I'm paranoid or I imagined it. I have no physical memory of him doing it to me, just emotional. I try and try but it does feel like something is off.

Sorry if none of this made sense I'm nust trying to figure things out"
31,"Emotionally bused at the hospital today. 
My words twisted. 
The doctor was playing mind games on my constantly 
Broke the law by calling a family member and telling a secret, she even told me she did. 
They were talking at the phone before I even saw this doctor first. I find the phone number in an old phone of this person. 

I felt devasted and depressed, numb. 
I saw it coming somehow. 
Trying to stay strong. 

Is my fault because I knew who I was dealing with, both of them...

32,"TRIGGER FOR PHYSICAL ABUSE, SEX, DECEPTION


I feel like I need to get this off my chest but I also kind of need advice for handling it. I really love her and I wouldn't want to leave her. If there's a way I can help her, she really deserves it. She never struck me as the type of person to do something like this or even have mental problems that would bring her to do something like this. Now it's really really messing with me and I'll need help getting through it. Even seeing things about pregnancy or best friends triggers the hell out of me... I can't even go to work and trust people or talk to anyone who we saw at school or look at memes.... I have live with no friends or no one to talk to but now there's no trust. If this counts as a catfish, then I got catfished in real life.

She's literally the only family I've had besides for my boyfriend.. We met through a big mix of friends who were at the breakfast and lunch table. I'm a few years younger than her though she was in high school with me for 3 years because she would miss a lot of school and get held back due to her own family problems. Back then 3 years was a long long time, just because I was going through so much, constantly getting kicked out of my moms or dealing with her drunk boyfriend and moved in and out of the foster home because of physical abuse and things like that. She was there through everything. She was my role model, my hero like a mom to me, literally like a god. She would always bring food to school help with my medical problems and give very genuine consider advice. Never judge me for anything no matter how big of a nerd I was. She's literally my big sister. Even after she graduated and moved away, she still supports me online 6 years since we first met. She became my sister, but as lot of times she was actually like my mom and I called her mom and it felt so special and genuine and she would hold me just like you imagine a mom would....

The thing was, back in high school about a year after we met, she started talking more and more about a best friend. (I never met this best friend but of course through genuine daily conversation, I just didn't have reason to question his existence. ) He eventually became so important she was talking about dating him and she has a lot of pictures of them, and he and I would talk online in a meme group with her and other people at school. Cool enough. I never went anywhere and this is a really big city with many schools, and she was popular with so many people, so I really didn't question anything as long as she was happy and safe. Eventually that conversation gradually turned into them being in love. I was happy for them but a shit ton of stuff was happening for me and I was going through a lot with my mom's boyfriend. Her support still came in and both of them would send me money and things, so he became like family to me too. She helped me through my first sexual experiences, a pregnancy scare, my mom's boyfriend's abuse, me losing my little brother, everything. He was also by my side. When my boyfriend hit me and blackmailed me and I got suicidal, she was EVERYTHING, she'd come over at 3 in the morning if I needed it.

Her senior year came along. She was definitely going to be graduating that year and she also had some plans for college. I was a junior and I was kind of sad but I was already coming to terms with the senior thing and I knew she would still have my back. I knew her boyfriend would have my back too, especially when she revealed that he proposed to her and they were engaged. This was my first positive exposure to marriage with science for all my fantasies, so I can't explain how excited I was for them. January rolled around and before Christmas break ended, she stopped by to bring me some presents, and told me something that made me super super super happy-- she was almost a month pregnant! Everyone at school eventually knew about this within the first few months and she was so proud about it, of course I have no reason to doubt it. She would tell me all about her pregnancy and all this cool stuff about her life, both of us ended up making some new friends, and whenever her boyfriend was working a lot shall I would have movie nights and things like that. As her belly grew, we would go baby shopping like sisters and eventually I forced her to let me buy her some baby clothes as a present using one of my compensation checks. Same with food, eventually she caved in. She was now out of contact with her family and starting a new one and she was getting her life completely on and all she had to do was graduate, I was very very proud of her. She had all these amazing ultrasounds and it was all so beautiful, she gained a little weight but carried it very well. She caved in and eventually let our mutual friend give her massages and feed her and everything.

Graduation came. She was six months along. She got me my support kitty, who I still have and live to death and even named after an inside joke. For whatever reason, she ended up not attending graduation. No big deal even though it was a lot of money and time spent planning for me to get myself and a few other friends there. I knew she'd graduated and I just assumed she wasn't feeling well. But not only did she disappear from graduation, she basically fell off the face of the Earth physically. I never saw her anywhere around or her to literally anything about her from anyone else, even though she never change her City on Facebook which she's very active on and even listed online jobs. Her only existence was on my screen and she would answer maybe a few times a week, sometimes every day, sometimes not at all. Though she always tells me that she loves me and she is very very supportive and I always have what I need. Eventually in the Summer she did have her baby and nobody even knew about it until she posted online, which I understand because she's had a lot of problems with her family and did have problems with a few people at school. She can have stopped posting on Facebook for a while, posting maybe once a month and stopped using her other social media. She's only had maybe five pictures of her baby, even in private messaging.

About a year-and-a-half later, the fall after I graduated, life really wasn't going well for me. The only thing I had to look forward to was her revealing that she was pregnant again! She just found out that she was almost 3 months and everything was going very well for her. Needless to say, no post on Facebook, the birth of this baby was the same exact same as last time. Since this one was a girl in fact, she would be named after me! The middle name would be the nickname that she gave me and I practically graduated my role as her baby girl  and let it go to a second child who I knew would have an amazing parent.

They started coming in regular contact with me almost everyday since their kids were one and two and she was a stay-at-home mom. Constant support, constant good advice and comfort, 3 a.m. phone calls whenever I need it, food whenever I need it even though it's sparingly, her giving me a ride to work when I need it. Now that I look back on it, should have two babies sleeping in the car with blankets over the seats, and of course I would listen like a small bean and I wouldn't have any reason to doubt her or make her parenting difficult.

All that being said, am I allowed to see the babies when awake? No. None of our friends are. There's always some kind of excuse despite her being a stay-at-home mom. Do you know why? Tuesday evening, I was on Facebook. I commented asking for another picture and talking about how cute they were and everything. I noticed all her boyfriends old comments, which would be him answering other people's questions on her behalf, we're all deleted. Because his account didn't exist. Deleted account Maybe? Now that I think about it, probably suspended because it's fake with no way to verify it. I was asking people have to get in contact with them and they had literally no way to contact. I want as far to message someone who worked in the same place he was talking about working at, and they had no idea who it was. Nobody who works there at the idea who he was and so did nobody at the school he went to. Just amazing.

The pictures also had comments from her cousin, who is extremely blunt because she is special needs and obviously doesn't know about this whole sham. Comments were saying things like ""There's the cutie dolly! She finally came! Etc"" normal for her, and then one stood out --- ""did you see those baby's that are like the baby alive they eat and make sounds but there for adults and I know your just the avid collector so are we expecting one of those next month??? :)"" .... Yeah, that didn't sound right to me, at all.

I looked through more and finally noticed what once felt a little off. They have the same positions each time or have pictures that hide their hands/etc, all pictures of them sleeping, which adds up to more suspicion. I went back to the post with the cousin's comment, and it was deleted, but not before someone else from school could comment asking wtf. 

I went ahead and messaged her grandma, who had made a Facebook a while back ago, and was the only family she mentioned in a positive light. Turns out, she's living with her grandma, lost her job (because of her boss committing a felony and assault), has no money for school except for the college classes she did, has gotten in trouble for harassment and sexual misconduct, just living a shitty life in an efficiency with nobody except me and two friends she keeps in touch with, and being a mom to her baby dolls. I asked about boyfriend and grandma wouldn't say much but she did relay that there was a guy by the same name she used to have a lot issues with who she currently stalks and hacks..... His current girlfriend told me that he's told her about him being sexually harassed by and lied about. But girlfriend is also a huge drama queen, by the impression I used to get from her.

I have never felt so low myself, let alone knowing my only family member who helped through EVERYTHING imaginable is now and has always been lower than anyone I know...

Everything was taken from me last night. My family and the person I trusted most, the only person I trusted in my entire life. I don't even know what's real and what's not and I keep looking back at everything that wasn't and there's no cutoff to it.... She is obviously sick but I don't know what to do for myself or for her. 

Tl;dr: she was my best friend and the only one I could ever trust, going through sex and abuse and grief. Her boyfriend and her became like family in my darkest hour, and Tuesday it all had been ripped from me. Her babies and her entire life are fake as f, she's went out of her way to deceive me and everyone, and her boyfriend was probably her catfishing me (based on a boy she may have harassed and now stalks to the extreme). After all she's done for me to keep me physically safe and taken care of as well as emotionally supported, I am now deeply concerned and she deserves any help I can give her. I don't know how to help. I don't know how to move on for myself. Even seeing things about pregnancy or best friends triggers the hell out of me... I can't even go to work or talk to anyone who we saw at school or look at memes...."
33,"Hi, my parent's house is full of really horrible memories from my childhood that leave me feeling like it's unsafe to stay here and like I'm going to be hurt. There is currently no way to move out because it would cause me to really struggle financially no matter what help I could get. I'm looking for advice on how to feel safe at home? I have this constant anxiety that has even caused me to try to run away. I know I'm not in danger but my brain doesn't. Is there anything I could do or tell myself to lessen these feelings of being trapped, threatened and vulnerable? Thank you"
34,"When I was 14 or 15 I had a lying problem. I lied about my mum being dead. Me having cancer. My dad abusing me. This went on for around 6 months and was eventually stopped when one person I was lying to contacted social services and I got called into the head teachers office, who told me someone was concerned and I ended up telling her the truth. My mum got called into the school and I went home and we had a family discussion, followed by my dad going through my social media accounts checking my messages between people. A few weeks later, other people found out I was lying and we all got called into the head teachers office where I got shouted at by the people I had lied to. I deserve everything I got. I’ve struggled with my mental health since this, mainly with anxiety and depression and recently having been diagnosed with PTSD because of what happened/what I did. I’ve been through several other traumatic experiences since this, mainly abusive boyfriends and I always tell myself I deserve to be hurt by other people because of what I did. I haven’t talked to anyone about what happened in 10 years. I know that I deserve to suffer because of what I did. I’m now starting counselling and whilst I can talk to the counsellor about the abusive boyfriends, I’ve yet to be able to tell her about the lying as I’m worried she will judge me for it. I know I am an awful human but I would never even think of lying about anything like that again. I was just a stupid kid. I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s ruining my life."
35,"No meaningful connection to my family.

Witnessed a sexual assault when I was a kid.

A girl that made me like a part of myself took her own life, because life was cruel to her in ways.

I can't talk to anyone because rhyming off my problems just trivialises them. I hate that all I do is infect people.

I trigger when people try to set me up on dates, or ask me intimate questions about my love life. I especially trigger when the men at work start their misogynistic BS.

I only understand being alone. Every day I'm suffocating, and there's no one to talk to, because infecting others is a selfish option."

37,"Hi everyone.

My name is Ally and I'm posting here looking for a little reassurance/comforting advice. I've been dealing with (mostly untreated) C-PTSD for over 5 years along with other mental health issues, and it's been an ongoing process for me with lots of ups and downs, and unfortunately not a lot of therapy as it's not been an option right now.

I'm looking for some advice as today I ended up seeing a photo of a person who was very connected with that time in my life and it triggered me horribly, setting off feelings and emotions I can't control or get rid of. It upset me so badly that it triggered my OCD on top of it ( I deal with what I call PTSD-related OCD, too - feeling like if I do something that at all connects to that event, it will either happen again/undo everything I've worked so hard to fix, or send me back to that place, if that makes any sense) and I feel like everything is going to go bad again. I know it's irrational (and probably stupid), but I can't help it and I'm panicking. I've worked so hard to get myself to a better place and while life isn't ever perfect, I'm scared of losing it all. Has anyone felt this way, and if so, what did you do? And did whatever you were afraid of, actually happen? I've done a bit of DBT work in the past and keep trying to use the skills and remind myself that what I'm feeling is not real, and it's not the same circumstances and therefor doesn't mean anything, but it's not that easy as most of you probably know. 

Anyway, thank you for reading. It's nice to have a place to not feel judged."
38,"Just to clarify, Terry is not my real name, in case any concerns.

Basically this event happened a couple of years ago, but it was so close to home that I became a very paranoid and anxious person. I live on a busy street, but it's a nice area overall. There is a plaza on the busy part of the street, and a group of teens tried robbing me one night, and I defended myself. Unfortunately, this seemed to piss them off, because months later they saw me again in the plaza and violently assaulted me in broad daylight, in front of many people.

Because it was so close to home, I was always anxious about running in to them again, while on the bus, waiting at the bus stop, getting groceries etc. I'm not sure how to move past this incident and tell myself that a third incident won't happen.

ONE REALLY IMPORTANT factor of all this is that I've been afraid to get legal intervention, because I do not want to escalate things further and potentially cause danger to my family, and not just myself.

Because I don't feel comfortable going to the police, I feel a little helpless. I'm not sure what I could do to prevent a third incident. Can anyone please give me some advice on hot to not feel so FEARFUL? I've honestly avoided certain parts of the area, and it's becoming too draining. 

Please do not suggest moving away  - I am trying to avoid living in fear and acting on emotion.

Thank you



If anyone has some logical, realistic advice they can give me, maybe"
39,"I’m 31 now. When I was 18, I was in a horrible car accident. After that I was scared to be in a car or a car that would go fast. When I was 21, it suddenly hit me, my first panic attack that sent me to the hospital. Til this day, I can’t be in a car that goes fast, I drive slow and try to be a cautious driver. If my boyfriend goes over 75 mph, I’m already freaking out telling him to stop. I’m constantly checking how fast he’s going. There’s times when I can be perfectly fine, I start to think about all the bad things that can happen while being on the road and then I start getting a panic attack while driving so I have to call my boyfriend or a family member to be on the phone with me while I make it home safe.

Thank you in advance for your answers. Xoxo"
40,"I moved back in with my abusive mother back in September moving back from another country and having no other choice, I’m now in a situation where she’s started to continue her old patterns of abusive behaviour (not physical because I’m an adult) she’s always infantilised me but it’s become worse now I’m aware of it and she does controlling things like not letting me cook for myself or do any housework asking ‘if I’m trying to be more independent’ by doing normal things and telling me not to vote because her boss who she rents from would be aware of me living in her house and she didn’t want her knowing (she didn’t tell her until February 5 months after I moved in) being weird about the government knowing where I live. 

I’m trans and I was outed to her before I moved in and while she said she accepts but she’s always been a bigoted person and she doesn’t get my pronouns right and calls me by a name she decided suits me better and not the name I want to be called and also makes really uncomfortable remarks about my body (commenting when I don’t bind for example) and and asks invasive questions regarding my transition. I moved in knowing it would be hard for me to try to survive around her but planning to get a job and work to save up in order to move out but she’s become controlling about me finding work and uses my mental health as an excuse as to why I can’t work and suggested giving me ‘pocket money’ every month instead so I don’t have to work and asking why I need money. 

Because of all this and the memories of the things she did before (kicking me out as a teenager, blaming me for abusive men not liking her)
I have panic attacks and flashbacks almost daily and her attempting to again control me as an adult has been making them worse forcing me to uncover new memories that I hadn’t realised I had pushed down before that I’m not ready to process, I’ve never had therapy before because she prevented me getting it growing up so I wouldn’t be around people I could report her to but I’m on a waiting list for therapy now because the waiting list for trans services is so long and I planned to use that to work though my abuse without her knowing, with the lockdown now that’s been pushed back even more and I have no way of knowing when I’ll be able to talk to someone. 

I really need help I’m feeling more and more scared and stressed about my chances of leaving when she’s so controlling about me working and having money so I don’t know what to do. I have nowhere else to go my father is also abusive and I tried living there once as a teen and he threatened me with homelessness if I i didnt do what he wanted and all other relatives side with them. I don’t know anybody I can go to. I would like to know how anybody who’s situation was similar was able to work/get money to escape"

42,"I know that from around the ages 4-5, I, along with my sister 2 years older than me, were molested by out neighbor. I don’t it remember it being rape but I have very clear details of it happening. I tried to “confront” my sister about it when I was 12 but she got very angry. Which is proof enough for me that it happened. I am terrified of hurting children. I’ve been that way since I could remember. I have intrusive and nasty thoughts about them that happen only when I’m around them. I think it’s anxiety as I’ve never acted on those thoughts. Nor do I have the desire to. I have had depression ever since 5 I believe. It finally blew up into schizophrenia and depression of which I was rediagnosed as bipolar 1. I have a lot of cognitive difficulties stemming from the depression. Honestly, though I know people shouldn’t say they just want to move on and not tackle their issues but I’ve known I was molested for a very long time. The depression pretty much numbed me out but now that I’m on the right medications, I’m starting to be happy again. My cognitive abilities are coming back but, as of yesterday I was obsessing over what happened to me so much so that the little emotional stability or happiness I felt just dwindled. (I used to be very bright but I know that because of what happened, my brain as a way to protect me, broke into pieces.) I just want to move on. I know it wasn’t my fault. I know I didn’t deserve it. I know that if my older self could have gone back and stopped it, I would have most likely killed that man. How can I move on. I only see my therapist twice a month and with the Coronavirus, I’m not sure when I’ll see her. I keep having the same drowning dream that I thought went away. Any advice would really help."

50,"Hi this is my first post.  I was dx with PTSD after some abuse in my relationship and also childhood.  And a lot of bad choices on my part.  I still blame myself and am not sure it was really abuse.  Me and my husband worked through things, it was hard, and the abuse has stopped now.  But a new problem has happened.  His sister has told us about a genetic condition that he has to be tested for.  It all became a big fight as his family will not talk about it.  Then I find out his parents knew all along.  And never told us.  The condition can be life threatening if not known about (we have kids).  My husbands dad has been very verbally abusive to him and so has his sister   .  It reminds me of how my husband would deny my /my kids experience and  I feel utterly shell shocked  and am now not sure I can trust my husband.  I told him this, as I was feeling unable to cope-i wanted reassued-  and he got really angry and told me how much I hurt him as I'm the only one he has left.  I feel so bad he needs me now but I'm so scared and untrusting inside, I'm not coping well and am not sure if I'm paranoid or if he is untrustworthy.  I used to defend his dad and now I feel so stupid and a mug.  I always believe people cant be so bad.  I always think they're just misunderstood but I can't believe what's happened.  And it's making me doubt my husband again.  I'm so shocked a parent could with hold such information from their child and them attack them on asking about it.  I'm utterly lost.  It's been a long line of stuff and I'm overwhelmed.  I have a therapist but it's the time in between.  And I even find it hard to talk to her though I'm starting to trust her after 3 yrs.  Often I want to sack her because she isn't available enough.  And also I don't want to become reliant on her.  Does anyone understand any of this?  I can't seem to get the help I need."
51,"Where do I even start to be honest, I hope what I write in this thread possibly educates or even help someone perhaps. To let them know there not alone in this and I too was and sorta am still haunted by this that it caused me to get C-PTSD. All because of what people have done to me online the most my whole life. However  as I write this now I'm  not surviving  anymore  but thriving and becoming more at peace and happy with my life. I'm learning to let go and not let what happen to me effect or ruin my life anymore. Now I tell you my story. I joined here to "" try "" to converse with others practicing my social skills being around people once again online. You heard or possibly heard over the years and still hear the horror stories that happens online with some unlucky innocent people excluding kids and teenagers. Though it can also just as well effect adults just as much too. You heard about Catfishing, bullies, pedos, creeps, extreme mental health individuals from those who won't seek help nor want it. Them then brining you down with them severely with your own mental health at stake. You trying your very best to help or even safe them from not ending there lives. That it's becoming a extremely dangerous road for you to be around the person as you think if you stop helping best you can for them they end themselves,  thus blame yourself for failing. 

 

However that's not all what happens online today that no one wants to talk about. Nor want too discuss  and sweep under the rug because it happened  to them and their ashamed or blame themselves for falling for it or it happening to them. Really anyone reading this online is not as safe as you may think nor a good place to post a lot of your information  on as well pictures of yourself. It is dangerous to tell the real harsh truth, you can believe me or not but it is the truth. 

 

Where you can meet extremely messed up individuals that enter your lives that could cause stalking, threatening you, exposing you by black mailing and anything else you hear as well in movies and television today like hackers as well. I'm here to tell you what I wrote happen to me about half of those things starting at age ten when I met a pedo online. Thus began my traumatizing journey  being online like every other kid and teenager  was in the 2000s. It being the popular thing to be so call "" cool "" and accepted by everyone.

 

People in society  today don't  really talk at all about these things to kids and teenagers not enough as they truly should. To truly prevent kids, teens or even adults taking there own lives or other very bad things happen to them. I mean really talk and explain what could happen if you post pretty much your whole life sharing it on social media, pictures, information and ect. People can and will use it to steal your identity if your not careful causing those types of problems for you if your not cautious as you should be when talking to people online.

 

As for talking to people online today in this society it's okay to do it since a lot or half of the population in this world only have online sources to interact and meet people. However no one really wants to do or try to be cautious when talking to yes strangers online and you then be friend them just like that. Listen you truly and many people including my family even professional  therapists  told me you don't  truly know anyone online at all.  Society  puts it out there like its the ""  normal "" thing to do but really it's not. It takes years to truly know someone and trust someone online. A process I do is talk to them a long time do voice and video chat with them to prove they are who they say. 

 

Then if you both want meet each other irl and hang out, ect and know what they look like then I think thats alright. Not knowing what they look like or sound like. Them  giving you excuses of them not wanting to even just for a minute  to prove to you they are who they say is a major reg flag. Personally my opinion and what I learned the hard way you should reconsider  talking to them for safety. All this is the dark side of the internet people ignore and think it won't happen to them so be friend someone quickly, fall in love and date quickly and ect. People truly don't  get it can effect them badly as for me traumnically and pretty much ruin there lives if not careful as they know they should.

 

I could go on for hours of telling you all the red flags I know and think everyone  should to be careful of if meeting people or already been talking to them if there truly a legit person to you. Being 100% truthful to you about who they are and not lieing to you, messing with you with mind games, manipulating you to get something from you and so on. However for red flags I know would help people it  would take a long time so sadly I can't say it all to be more helpful in this this post, apologies. Since this is probably a long post already. However I think anyone reading this gets the idea of being safe online and what you should and shouldn't  do so none of these things happen to you.

 
I've  tried to help while being online more active at age fourteen to people sharing my story and trying to save them from my fate I had happen to me sadly.  Some listened to me took my advice and thanked me. While others didn't care and thought I was werid or wrong about the online world, since that what I said wasn't a big deal, true or could possibly happen to them. Putting themselves out there not caring  like everyone did to be "" normal "" ,  cool and accepted by society. 

 
All I said here is the truth as well my opinions we should all do or try and be more cautious when being online I suggest to help you be safe. I would be saddened if anything I went  through happened to anyone else. Lastly I like to say follow your intuition,  if you feel even the slightest off about a person, things don't  make sense or add up about them there a person you need to leave and not have in your life for your mental health and safety. It's your choice and life what you choose to do with it. All I ask is just be careful is all online. You can listen to me or not but it's what I learned over the years.


**Note: I hope this alright to post this and hope no one gets mad and debates with me on my post. I'm  just sharing my story and vewis on online safely and my opinions on how to make it safer. No one has to take my advice since its your choice and life afterall to do what you want."
52,"Yesterday was another trauma anniversary. I had made a post saying I was going to take a forum break so I don't lash out at anyone while symptomatic. I've decided that instead of running/hiding I would go with what I'm feeling and talk about it until it all passes.

Yesterday evening I started feeling super anxious and breathless. Like close to hyperventilating and I'm still feeling that way now. I'm going with it and consciously trying to keep my breathing at a slower level. Even doing that though, every breath I take I feel it catching right below my ribs.

I have a sickening feeling below my ribs where it's catching. That feeling of something really, really horrible is going to happen to me. Fear. Deep,deep terror.

I feel like I've done something very wrong. Like I'm waiting for severe consequences for something I've done  

I'm shaking uncontrollably. Even my shoulders are visibly shaking. All the shaking feels like it's moving inward inside my body,to that place below my ribs and collecting there.

I feel like crying. Or screaming. 

I am seeing flashing lights in my mind on and off,police car lights. 

Along with the shaking I'm shivering cold. Shaking from fear, shivering from the cold.

My right hand is hurting.

I just feel like I wish I would die rather than go through this.

I know all this is in my mind and will eventually pass. Hopefully it will pass soon."

I highly reccommend reading this post to get a better background of my culture.

 When I was a teenager, I read a newspaper article about a man who was abused by his abusive father. He was honored because he endured the abuse all his childhood and never called for help.

He says that's unconditional love. I say it's madness! My blood boils. He could've ran away. But he didn't.

I understand where that shit is coming from. You have to honor your parents in Korean societies. Since that man was Korean- American and US easily puts restraining order, they don't want to lost their family member.

If that shit is the case, flee! Run for your life. Do you want to be maimed for the rest of your life? Physically and emotionally scarred? But no. You have to suck it up. Fuck this.😡

But I guess same shit goes for me too, if my family member physically abuses me (they didn't). Just suck it up and keep your fucking mouth shut.

I got traumatized for reading that article and the memory haunts me right now.

I don't want to suck it up and endure the damn abuse. Hell, no! It's a dangerous thing to do. But wait... I have no fucking choice. If I don't, I might face persecution that is worse than abuse. Korean- Americans are more nationalistic and old- fashioned than the Native Koreans. If I EVER sued a family member for abuse, they might harass or physically harm me. Now, that might be not true, but I'm scared it might happen..."

59,"It was exhausting to be honest. 2020 is coming to a close. Although 2020 wasn't difficult as 2019, it was draining.

The year started off great... until the middle of March when my mother relapsed. Her tone was off, and she became suspicious of me. I forced her to take her medication, but she was bitter and angry days later. She was having auditory hallucinations, and I had to struggle through school. I couldn't understand jack shit on the lessons, and didn't learn much.
Thankfully, the ordeal was shorter than last year. My mother was ill for seven months last year, but a small fraction of that this year. Last year was hell. My mother was more violent and no medications seemed to work on her. The doctors rejected her, and I had no money to institutionalize her. South Korea is poor in mental health and the government is reluctant to pay us off. And fuck yeah! US is worse off in terms of medical care. We couldn't afford a DAMN THING in getting us basic medical help. This why the hell we ended up in South Korea. We couldn't afford medical care, and Korea could provide us affordable medical health.

I told the same issue on Reddit, and a user was distraught over my issue. The user said:

""Wow... I genuinely could have written the first portion of this where you’re describing the afternoon depression that keeps creeping in earlier and earlier each day.

As for the rest of it... my friend, you’ve got so much on your plate. I wish I could hug you. Genuinely. I’m so sorry that you’ve got all this educational and familial pressure. I wish I had a solution. As for now, just know there’s someone over here in the US thinking of you. And hoping you can catch a break.""

No one has a solution because my issues are so severe. I've went down in the deep end.


Thankfully, she is much better because she is taking pills from a hospital that is known for its legendary status. Samsung Hospital (Yes, Samsung has a hospital in South Korea) is Korea's #1 treatment center. Finest professors treat the patients with excellence.

But I'm exhausted. So exhausted. Tried to fight off the depression that came after the chaos that lasted less than 3 months this year.

I was sexually abuse by my uncle when I was a kid plus I have  abandoned problems because my mother left us to USA when I was a kid and I didn’t see her for 10 years. We still had contact by phone. Anyway, I never told anyone about my uncle I just pushed it on the back on my head a pretender it never happened. Life went by and I end up coming to USA to visit my mother. I was supposed to stay with her for 9 months.  I felt in love and I never came back to my country. My now husband started to see a red flags in my behavior and he started asking questions and somehow he dig out what happened to me. After I told him I was never able to stop thinking about it it never wanna to go away like it did before. He advised me that I should tell someone else too so I told my Stepfather but all I heard from him is You can not tell you mother about this! I was devastated he just swiped it under the table! My husband finally convinced me to see a professional and I was going there every week since January and it really started helping me and I felt good. I learned that my mother is control freak and she want to control every aspect of my live by criticism me and molding me how she want. And with my therapist help I started finally standing back to her. Until about month ago my therapist said that she would like to meet my mum and learn her view. Why did she left me as a kid and maybe talk her into changing her behavior toward me. I was nervous becouse my mother is not a easy person to deal with, but my therapist promise me that she will not argue with her and she will not let her take control. I agreed to bring her in. Thinks went really bad. They end up arguing and on the end my therapist throws my mother out of office. I was a little disappointed in her becouse I thought she is professional and she will have experience dealing with difficult people. But I didn’t tell her that I just apologized about my mother and I said I will see her next week. She stopped  texting me or call me again or show up on sessions. And I don’t understand what happened. Her phone goes straight to voicemail. I gave her two weeks but still nothing. My husband tried to call from a different phone and he got signal with no answer. When I am calling from my phone I am getting only voicemail. Now is been over a month and I still didn’t hear anything. I feel like I lost my friend. Like another person in my life left me. I mad becouse she mad a mess in relationship between me and my mother and she left me with it by myself.

62,"Has anyone been in a toxic relationship and it gave them ptsd?

My ex was a doctor, he represented authority to me and I put my trust in him, told him about my life and childhood. He'd be emotionally abusive and made me hold my breath constantly about whether or not he wanted to be with me / if I was good enough, yet would question my sanity if I wanted to leave. 

As a doctor he was quick to see who I was, what were my scars and how to use me.
He played his little mind games for a few years and when things ended, I found myself to have symptoms of withdrawal, feeling physically ill and very traumatized. 
I couldn't listen to the songs I or we listened to during the relationship, go back to certain places we went to together and to this day, certain behaviors and words really make me panic. I still relive some events, have plenty of thoughts and fear / anger.

I think what scares me the most to this day is that I didn't think a doctor could be so disturbed and twisted."
63,"So I don’t know if this belongs in the ptsd forum but I didn’t know where else to put it. So I have been told I have ptsd from a therapist but I don’t really know if I do. I don’t really feel like what happened was really that traumac. Like, sure it was upsetting, but whatever. So i was raised by my grandmother because my mother was a junkie and basically fried her brain. My aunt was in and out of my life since I was a baby. she and my grandmother don’t get along. They basically both say the other is a narcissist. i personally think they both are, but they both think they’re the victim of the other. The last time my aunt was in our lives they both used me to pretty much spy on the other. So I was trying to be loyal to both of them. At the same time I was being swayed to see things the way my aunt did. It eventually all blew up. My aunt who I thought had my back and loved me turned around and threw me to the wolf that is my grandmother. My grandmother is fine about half of the time but sometimes she’s cruel and confusing and hurtful. But she has a way of acting innocent. I’m an adult but I can’t afford to leave. So I feel trapped. Anyway, so my aunt left. Completely out of the picture. Once in a while will either send a hurtful message about me or a message trying to “expose” my grandmother. When I hear from her it’s very triggering and tonight she sent me a home video of when I was a kid. It just instantly made me sad. I played it over and over again. I don’t know, just seeing myself young and happy and oblivious to how I would end up. Just very saddening. I miss her and a my cousin so much, but I don’t trust her at all. I can hear her voice in the video talking about what I’m doing in the video and she sounds like she cares about me. But I know how she has hurt me. Theres no repairing what she or my grandmother has done. But I have to live with my grandmother. Also she seems to know when I’m at my lowest or most vulnerable. It’s like she has a sixth sense or something. 
 This is a lot, I know. Any advice or kind words would be appreciated."

Walking by the river people approach. I feel they are judging me. 
Someone argues with me. I'm in danger of attack. 
Is it just me?"
65,"I am new to this forum.  I am (literally) allergic to all psychiatric drugs.  I am unmedicated.  Last time I went to the hospital, I was sent to the state hospital as a violent patient when I tackled a desk.  I was psychotic due to the doctor giving me throzene, as an antipsychotic.  Even after I informed her antipsychotics work in reverse on me.  She refused to stop giving me it and when I got the state hospital they continued (forced) to make me take it.  After a week, it was discovered I was also allergic to it and it was discontinued.  Doctors can not help because there are no meds left to try.  Hospitals can not help because there are no meds and more people (crowds) make matters worse."
66,"I have had ptsd due to 28 years of DV. Only go out if absolutely necessary, hate phone calls i don't recognise also texts and emails send me in a panic. I just cold and carry on. Psychiatric assessment diagnosed other issues beside. Now my son has had a really had accident. While waiting for air ambulance etc he was on the phone to me screaming and crying. He will eventually walk again, but he is in a mess. I can't get the call out of my head, I can hear it in my sleep. I cry to even open my front door. It's been over 3 Seems now and it's not subsiding. Really struggling. To add insult to injury cap want reassess me for esa."
67,"Apparently I qualify for free trauma counselling/therapy , which I think I am going to take. I’m really scared to get it but know I need it. Tomorrow I’m calling to register for it."
68,"(second post with the same topic/subject)

I need a little help. I myself have depression and anxiety so I hope to find a home here but my motive is to help someone else. I have a dear friend suffering deeply from complex ptsd and needs some reassurance that she is not alone. She does not have familial support or much outside of a few close friends. She is finally in a loving caring relationship and I love her very much but it is not enough to heal years of abuse and pain from several deep losses. She is most recently suffering from the loss of her dog. He wasn't just her dog though. He was her son, her best friend of 10+years and the only one who really knew what she was going through. They are both survivors of years of physical and mental abuse and he was her saving grace and she was his. They made it out together. I would like to show this her at a later date (and encourage her to join as well) and show her that she is not alone. I can not erase what has happened or make the pain go away but I can steer her in a direction of healing because she is an awesome person and is worth it. If anyone finds any of this familiar and maybe show that healing is possible, may you please say hello. Thank you :)"
69,"So recently I've been having trouble with the fact that my PTSD, Anxiety and NEAD have been taking over, does anyone have any advice on coping mechanisims? and possible things which are good for escapisim? The world doesn't make any sense anymore."
70,"Hi so basically, I've never really talked about those events that lead to me developing PTSD, yet they involved a lot of people. I think its about time my stories were released into the world so here I am, telling my truth in an attempt to find a way through, or at the very least show someone else that they aren't alone.

pre warning- my memories are a bit fragmented.

When I was 10 years old, I was on a school trip. I was sitting at the font of the top deck, we were travelling down the road when suddenly a fire began to spread along the left side of the road, which was covered in a line of trees. As we travelled further up we saw that a car had crashed into a lorry and the lorry had set fire to a tree. One of the drivers had died at the scene, that was the first time I saw a body bag. The police helped our driver make a 3 point turn without backing into the fire...that was just foreshadowing.

A few months later, I was on a different school trip. It was january and snowing quite a bit. We were travelling to a historical place of interest and were basically in the middle of no-where, the only thing in sight was a roadside cafe. I was at the back of the top deck, the row in front of the row where the engine was. This time I sat with a friend who got travel sick, she had the window seat and I had the isle seat. Suddenly all the people behind us started standing up and smoke began to pour out from the wall. A teacher's assistant came upstairs to see what all the fuss was about and she shouted downstairs to the driver ""STOP YOUR COACH IS ON FIRE!"" She told us to stay in our seats. My friend was confused as she had been asleep and had only woken up when she heard the TA. I told her that the fire was right behind us and we were told to stay in our seats and cover our faces. I don't know how long it was until we got out. I was told to take my bag so that my friend didn't trip but I dropped it on the stairs. As soon as we left the bus, we were told to cross over to the side of the road...a fireman was kind enough to rescue my bag and my friend was hungry so I gave her my lunch....the next thing I remember is a bang as all the windows burst, I got separated from my friend and there was the sound of 60 people screaming. The driver was smoking a cigarette. Then there was fire engines and police and ambulances. So many people were screaming in agony, our lungs felt like they were burning from the inside, people were getting checked out by the ambulance crews for smoke inhalation. I couldn't calm down, I don't know all that much of what I did or how long it all went on for or even how I got back to where I'm from but I couldn't calm down and I was being shouted at. I had to go home with someone else whilst my parents came home from work, they thought I was over exaggerating until they saw the pictures. My mother knew that I had been diagnosed with PTSD after the event but she didn't tell me that that was what it was called until February this year.

Later, when I was 14, 6 of my classmates nearly died because of a rockslide whilst we were doing a watersports residential...

Finally, February this year. I was meeting up with a long-distance friend who I had met in person once and had become good friends with online. We had a great day and got to know eachother even better, even became closer as friends. We were walking down a side road on the way to the train station, where we were due to part ways when we saw a woman attempting to walk away from a man. He was really aggressive and sounded as if he was either on drugs or alchohol. We hid in the shadows. He grabbed the woman and pinned her against the wall...another passer by asked us if we had called the police, my friend told them that we were about to so she asked me as I had my phone out. But I couldn't move. I was completely frozen. All I could do was give her my phone and stutter that I couldn't make the call. She called police and they said they would be 5 mins. They weren't. They were too late, the man pulled the woman away and they still hadn't arrived. We debated about if we should wait but the other bystander said that they would and advised us to leave as it was getting late and dark. My friend and I parted at the train station due to the fact that we live in separate places. I had to travel home alone.

I hate how powerless I was the first time. I don't know if I can forgive myself for what happened the second time, I could have done something but I didn't. I shouldn't have frozen. Those people were screaming out in agony and I didn't know how to make it stop, I wish none of it had ever happened and I wish those people hadn't gotten hurt.

I don't know what happened to that woman, but I sincerely hope that someone helped her escape that situation.

I will forever be greatful that I was the only one out of those people on the coach during the fire to have developed PTSD, even though I hate living with it I'm glad that none of them have to suffer through it."
71,"In a nutshell, 3.5 years in a relationship with my partner. She is undergoing DBT at the moment for BPD. In 3.5 years I've been through isolation, manipulation, gaslighting, physical abuse and all sorts of other terrors. This has lead me to councelling, anti depressants and the diagnosis that I am now codependent on her. So now I'm the crazy one - or so she'd have me think.  

My partner is now 34 and desperate to have kids, before it's too late. She told me she was leaving me and we agreed to take a month apart. She has moved out. 

In this past month, she has been attending DBT and there is a noticeable change in her behaviour, and I have really been getting back to being myself and getting stronger, although I miss her greatly.

My psychologist has now diagnosed me with PTSD as a result of the relationship as I'm still experiencing the odd nightmare and exhibiting fearful behaviours. 

The problem is, it's just about decision time...do I commit to her and have a child? I really do love her and if this ""new"" her sticks, we'd have our happily ever after. Or do I just let her walk away. The thought of letting her go makes me feel empty and her being with someone else would be really upsetting.

Otherwise, I could be committing to a lifetime of abuse, if she goes back to her old ways. She really does not want to be like that and she is trying so hard, but I just can't stop thinking about all of the ""incidents""."
72,"Hi all,

So, my spouse has CPTSD, and has done for around five years.  The initial diagnosis determined that it was prompted by the medical trauma associated with the death at birth of our first child, and also some earlier traumatic experiences.  The episodes at first took the pattern of a breakdown triggered by something (not always easy to tell what).  She would fall to the ground, sometimes rolled up, and would be screaming or sobbing.  After the first time, and especially after the first few times, we figured out how to deal with it a little better, using various techniques to reduce the severity of the episodes.  

Since then, things have been a mixed bag, with some good times, and often periods of months without issues, and some very bad times, with breakdowns on all sides (I have suffered from depression, and we also have two children with special needs).  My spouse has a good therapist and has gotten good advice, and she hasn't had a serious episode of the initial type in years.  Still, she had trouble with sleeping - lots of nightmares - and stressful situations often bring out serious issues (almost every vacation is preceded by a near breakdown).

Now though, we have a new situation.  She feels very dissociated from myself and the kids (and the dog).  She feels like she's meant to be somewhere else, like that she's meant to be where we were 12-13 years ago, and that either she's switched place with the spouse who is meant to be here, so that her ""other"" life continues with her being replaced, or that she's simply travelled forward in time, with her life and loved ones from that time being left with her having disappeared.  

Now logically she knows that is not the case, but it's how she feels.  She feels very dissociated from us, and like we are basically strangers.  She talked to her therapist, and the therapist said it's cause she is burned out, and needs an escape - so her mind is basically seeking escape routes by dissociating and imagining this other option.  She said it was probably depression with psychotic features, and was somewhat related to the PTSD.  Her recommendation was to look into ways of getting a bit of a break from things, and that even researching options like that was helpful in terms of making the escape seem possible (I guess thinking it through). 

Now, she had a sort of a creeping flashback type of situation on Thursday night, and had a difficult time dealing with on Friday (but not all the way, like she was still seeing the kids as hers), then she went to sleep on Friday evening and slept through to the next morning.  I was hopeful that the next morning she'd have slept it off, but she was having a much harder time, and was texting me to say that she'd done this and that ""for your kids"", as though they weren't hers (I was at work).  She had to go lock herself in her room for most of the day.  Luckily she had an appointment set up for that evening with her therapist (pre-arranged), and after she talked it out with the therapist she seemed to be doing better.  She talked things out, and by late in the evening she seemed to be her usual self, and we were able to spend the evening together.  She was able to lie in the next day, and when she did get up seemed fine, was affectionate with the kids etc.  Then she had one or two moments of frustration, and had to take a break in the bedroom.  Following that, she quickly reverted to the same as the previous day.  

So the timeline was Thursday middle of the night - flashback, Friday daytime some feelings of exhaustion and frustration, slept a long time through to Saturday morning, then most of Saturday till she spoke to her therapist she felt dissociated.  Then from around mid-afternoon today has been dissociated again.

Does this sound recognizable to anyone?  Has anyone experienced similar issues, themselves, or with a family member?  Any advice on how to handle this?"
73,"Lately i have noticed my anger {i have bipolar? PTSD}is getting a little more on wedge "" i am yelling at my poor dogs and i scare them and i truly feel bad , i snap at my wife and she is getting sick of my ways she told me i walk around the house like a BEAR and snapping at the poor cat who freaks out when i yell "" i guess what i am trying to say is i am feeling the negative energy of the anger i'm feeling - my marriage is solid and its a happy marriagei want to get a handle on this before i loose it all.

74,"..then when I stopped drinking immediately without medical help, I slipped into psychosis, unbeknownst to me.  I would have rages beyond control and this lasted for 2 years until I was finally hospitalised.  Now, I still don't drink but I don't have much of a life left and I'm traumatised that I lost my home, my stability.  I am trying to piece my life back together, first by accepting that I got ill, the fact that I have to take medication, the fact that my immediate situation has no quick fix.  I could have/should have/would have gone into rehab had I known only drinking beer for cheer was not ""only drinking beer for cheer"" - I was not against the idea and I went to see a doctor at the time, as well as joining an infamous self-help group that I thought was officially helpful, as opposed to using the word ""God"" to be the answer to everything.  I had nothing against the word ""God"", or thinking laterally about healing but I really needed expert help.
I take Abilify now - has anybody else taken Abilify for PTSD and does it work long-term?"
75,"Hi! I'm sorry that it's not so detailed, I tried to get some important parts, but also tried to keep it relatively short. Please tell me if you want to know more details or something. :)

I had some stuff go down a few years ago regarding my mothers ex-girlfriend. 
She would scream at me in the middle of the night (over really small things like me not putting one plate in the dishwasher), accuse me of stealing in her home, read through my phone, kick me out, turn me into the police (for something I didn't do), call my friends and pretending she's me, mentally abuse me, etc etc. 
What I do most nowadays is tiptoe around my own house because I'm scared whatever I might do will cause a hysterical reaction and me being mentally abused as per usual.. 

A few weeks ago I experienced a similar situation with my dads girlfriend. We were all sitting down, eating dinner, and my dad jokingly said that I could live with them as long as I needed to. I thanked him and said that I'll consider it. my dads girlfriend told me that when my little bother is starting to grow up, I might need to move downstairs so that she and my dad could be upstairs close to my brother. I said of course, ""it doesn't matter to me"". We had a normal conversation after that, but after a few minutes she turned to me and said in a hostile tone that I was being arrogant. I said to her that of course I was going to move out someday, thinking that was what she was referring to. She said ""you know that's not what I'm talking about and you're being really selfish right now!"". I asked her calmly what was going on and I didn't know what I had done. She told me that I was being selfish and arrogant for not caring about what they wanted about the room. I explained to her that I was sorry she took it that way and didn't of course not mean it like that. She kept yelling at me, and I kept it together. It felt like I was being torn apart when she screamed and yelled at me for something so harmless as me offering to help when my brother grows up. At last she stopped and I took away my plate and went upstairs, I felt exhausted and cried myself to sleep that evening. 

Then a few weeks later, she started yelling at me for not saving enough money. I tried to tell her that I could possibly not save more than I earned, and that 60% of my earnings went into my savings account. But with covid-19 and me studying I only had about 3 months worth of a full pay, and the rest was 8000kr (about 800 US dollars) a month. 
I felt like my argument as to why I could not save that much a month was reasonable but she didn't. She kept yelling at me that I should just go out and get a full-time job. We had a long discussion and I really tried to keep it together but when I finally went to my room I cracked. It was horrendous. The first 20 minutes i scream-cried, and for the next hour i lied sniffling and semi-crying. I didn't move out of my bed that whole day and could definitely not go to the kitchen in case I met her. 

Nowadays I'm scared that I will get into another useless argument with her. 
Could my reaction to this be PTSD or is it just trauma catching up with me from my moms ex girlfriend? I know you're not doctors, but maybe someone has a similar experience and wants to share?"
76,"I have never been formally diagnosed with PTSD  but I believe I probably do have PTSD to some degree. I have discussed this event once in the 20 years since it happened- with my husband and afterwards told him I never wanted to talk about it again. It was deeply traumatizing to me and broke something inside me I can never fix. I guess I’m just seeking some perspective on how major what happened actually was because I’m still so affected by it to this day and it’s been even closer to the surface since I became a mother myself. I mean, have I made it out to be more than it is in my head? I remember every detail like it was yesterday. But I feel you don’t hear about this kind of thing very often in terms of people “speaking out” with their experiences.

***TRIGGER WARNING- description of event involving firearm**

My father is a classic narcissist- the kind who is well respected and successful. He was never really physically abusive, a few times I got spanked but nothing serious. Both parents were functioning alcoholics and home was like WW3 a lot of nights.

One night when I was about 12, a huge argument erupted that I was dragged into and he pulled out his firearm something he had never done before. Instead of trying to protect me, my mom ran off to hide and left me to get chased down by my huge father who pinned me to the wall by and pressed the weapon right between my eyes while screaming he was going to end it for all of us. In a pure act of instinct and the only possible thing I could do, I kneed him as hard as I could and I think he was so shocked it gave me a split second to run, grab the phone off the base (late 90s, no cell phones) and locked myself in the bathroom calling 911 while he tore the door off the hinges. I can still hear myself like an out of body experience telling that 911 operator “he has a firearm” and her asking “who ” before he got in and hung it up. I think at that point he realized the position he was in and I was in such shock that I did exactly what he said when the cops came. I lied and told them he was just cleaning his weapon and I got confused. Being Mr. Pillar of the community, he sweet talked his way out of being arrested, but got his firearm confiscated. And then, it was never spoken of again. I woke up the next day, got ready for school
and was expected to just go on as if it never happened.

I don’t know if he would have actually used the weapon in that moment of seeing red but I know that night ended my childhood. It ended my ability to ever trust anyone 100% again. I could never look at my mother the same because what woman would leave their own child to fend for themselves against a  grown man with a weapon? How could any police officer buy that bullshit story from a petrified little girl? I absolutely went off the rails and in the years that followed ended up in a slew of other bad situations that likely never would’ve happened had that incident never happened. Sometimes when my own husband and I have a disagreement, it’s like I travel back in time even though he’s a loving man who would never do something like that. I also have flashbacks whenever I see a news story about a family who was killed in a murder suicide knowing how close I came to that being me.

I have a few people close to me who know something happened to me but seem to assume it was a sexual trauma because I refuse to talk about it. While I’ve never lied and said that, I’ve also never really corrected the perception either. I’m afraid people wouldn’t get why it was so life altering for me because I didn’t actually get physically injured. Also the fact my father is still so well respected and loved by everybody.

Thanks for listening and your perspective."
77,"🗣Today I was thinking about my memory. Things I’ve experienced in life. One thing that sticks out for me is that I seem to have always gotten my way through kindness and being polite. The more I think about it the more I think I should’ve battled my inner demons better because now I feel this overwhelming feeling of guilt. The one thing that shows the same feelings of guilt which has been posted here a lot lately is pleasure.

 I think to categorize it into different kinds of guilt would be useless. And to categorize it into different feelings of guilt confuses me. I wish I didn’t take out such aggression on myself sometimes in times of struggle because then I wouldn’t feel so ashamed or guilty. Thanks for the read"
78,"Hello Everyone,
This might be a stupid question, but I feel like I have no right to call what I have a post traumatic stress disorder. Many people lose their loved ones and the grieving process is different for everyone, so why do I feel like this is more than just grieving?

Let me explain. I lost someone close to me not too long ago. He was my best friend and growing up we did everything together. During and even after college, we would go off together on weekend trips. We didn't live in the same town, so we didn't see each other as often as adults, but every time I was in town, we would hang out. To my family, it seemed like we were inseparable. He got me in ways others didn't and there was no topic off limits between us.We didn't always agree on things but it was never confrontational, just sharing of opinions. I never judged him and he never judged me.

During one of my visits, I had noticed he had lost considerable amount of weight and looked a bit gaunt and sallow. He said he had been sick, vomiting and unable to hold food down the last few weeks. Then during my visit, he went in to the emergency room because he had fainted at work. That was the start of a very difficult month before he passed. I won't get in to the specifics of his illness, but he became quite sick very quickly. He was diagnosed during that ER stay and we decided I would be his power of attorney to not complicate things. He was single without kids and only had his mom and siblings. We feared that his mom and sister would be unable to make the difficult decision and honor his wishes.

The month was filled with emergency visits followed by a few nights of ICU stays. I postponed the start of my new job in order to be there for him. I became his advocate, talking to the doctors, understanding his medications, advising him through the process. We talked about his illness, the prognosis, what to do if he and when he got more sick, who to share the information with. Every time he went in to the ER, I flew to see him and spent nights in the hospital with him until he was discharged. Then I stayed for a few more days until it seemed as though he was stable, then flew home. I would only stay home for a few days before having to fly back because he was back in the ER. This went on for a month before he went into a full coma and the prognosis wasn't good - his brain was swelling and would continue to do so until. He would most likely never regain consciousness and on the slim chance he did, he would not be the same. 

Based on our conversation prior to this, I knew what he wanted and made the decision to remove him from the ventilator. I sat with him until he passed away less than 12 hours later.

I have found it extremely difficult to concentrate and be motivated at work. I find myself wanting to stay in bed most mornings and feel angry and sad most days. 

Is this just normal grieving or PTSD? Is there a difference in how to cope if it is PTSD?"
79,"My PTSD has given me the terrible curse of hypersexuality. Anything even remotely related to my trauma or even menial things makes me aroused, 

I'm always aroused, things that shouldn't arouse me do, and I feel so guilty being with a man who is very...non-sexual. He's not asexual by any means but his sex drive is very low compared to mine, I feel like I burden him.

Many people tell me I'm too aggressive or open about my sexuality, I feel like I burden everyone around me, anyone else dealing with this I guess...under-spoken about side of sexual trauma? 😥"
80,"And what if I wasnt at abused and I'm making it up... I hate this feeling too beside the obsession. 

What I wanted to ask was.. 
Is it part of ptsd to think obsesivly about a person (and feel like can't get that person ""out of your head"") who was abusive for a long period of time and the abuse happend recently? 
Or is just another symptom of my ocd? 

Sorry if it doesn't make sense what I wrote."
81,"Hi! I am Alex and this is my first post.

My problems relate to intimacy relationships. I had 3 past relashionships and am cureently in the forth.
My issues start when I cannot deal with some situatiin. For instance, I cannot have an argument without feeling a lot of stress and chest pain. Also, if my girlfriend pushes a little to strong, I start having very unusualfeeling or reactions. For instance: at first, I feel that I am right to be upset, but after she does not serve me justice(like accepting that it’s her failt), I start to feel really really guilty and direct everything towards me. In that moment, I feel like I really want to die, to punish myself and I event hit me pretty hard. I expose all this things to her and she is supportive but she has her limits, past which she either gets angry or leaves me alone. She is really supportive with me a lot of the times also.
I finally went to a good therapist that understands me and was able to make sense of mu reactions. It appears that I have those feeling because I was neglected and had very bad relashionship examples when I was a kid. My mother always yelled at me and made me feel guilty. Often I cried my eyes out asking her to forgive me and she would not move a muscle to show me it’s OK. Now, it’s like the same applies with my intimate relashionships.
My therapist says she has to also make some changes, and I really think she wants to, but she also comes with her emotional baggage. And due to that she is really reluctant to go to therapy.
Right now, I am feeling very bad, I’ve hit muself and I feel to do it again. I am very stressed and lonely and I feel I don’t want to die anymore. Cannot do anything or talk to anybody due to fear and guilt. It seems the only thing I need is her affection, and now she is also exhausted and cannot do that for me.
Also, my therapist suggested sometimes that if she is not willing to do something for me, I should take the right decision and break it. But I love her like no other and I know she loves me back.

I just don’t know how to handle all this.."
82,"My girlfriend went through very bad childhood trauma which understandably she finds it very hard to talk about. Her family don’t really know much just the general of what happened because they went to the police. Her friends all know, she’s open about the fact it happened it’s just the details of it she won’t really tell anyone. She once told her ex girlfriend a bit but her reaction was terrible and I think that scared her off from wanting to open up again. 

the other night we went to her friends house and the topic was brought up, she’s only been friends with this person for two months but her daughter had a similar experience so I’m guesssing they all chatted about it  at some point when I wasn’t there. I’m really happy she was able to find that support but part of me is a little upset, I understand it’s her story and she will hopefully one day feel ready to talk about it but I kind of feel like I’m the only person who doesn’t really know anything. Everyone kind of knows bits and pieces but all I know is that she went through sexual abuse for a long time. I feel like a bad girlfriend because I don’t know anything and she just doesn’t talk to me. I’m also a bit upset that she was able to speak to other people and not me? I know it’s selfish and I’m sure it’s because they shared a similar experience but I just feel so shut out.

I just wondered if anyone who has kind of been through the same may understand her reasoning behind this? Or be able to explain things a bit more to me? I want to be the best girlfriend possible for her and help her as much as possible."

84,"Hello there.
 
Has anyone been through this and found a way to get past the gatekeepers?

  **** I dont need assessment for agoraphobia or ptsd because I already have diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum ****.
---------------
It's taken me around 4 years to get to speak to the correct team for diagnosis assessment (START team / nhs) in Lancs.
I've been told that I tick a good amount boxes for agoraphobia and cptsd by several GP's, several therapists (some of have refused to proceed with therapy because I need more intense therapy) AND the psychologist psychiatrist who assessed and diagnosed me with being on the autism spectrum.

My gp referred me for diagnosis (to the START team).
So the START/nhs team. 
I was first pre-assessment was with an admin/secretary of sorts.  I was told from the beginning of the call that ""diagnosis is a label"" and to just go to cbt (which is where i was sent from because of needing diagnosis and more intense treatment).
This call ended with being told I can re self refer at any time.

I asked to re-apply, self refer again and was told a manager would call me back.

Two weeks later I got a call from someone saying they had no idea why they were asked to call me.
I explained and was met with the same theres no point, you wont benefit blah blah.
This person isnt the dr and is not in a place to tell me not to bother seeking diagnosis.

While explaining the list of professionals who have told me that I need further help, I mentioned the psychologist psychiatrist who assessed me for autism spectrum.
The man on the phone asked ""did you get diagnosed"". 
Yes.
""And what help did that get you""?
Slight peace of mind but no treatment yes because I cant leave the house and havnt been able to communicate because of the suspected agoraphobia and cptsd.
He continues to try to convince me that I dont need diagnosis because it doesn't help.
I persevere and who knows what little info he took with him to put to the actual doctors to see if I can get assessment for diagnosis.

The following day I get an answer phone message from him, telling me that case will be closed as drs said that **** I dont need assessment for agoraphobia or ptsd because I already have diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum ****."
85,"As a child I had been criticized very harshly from both my parents, but especially my mother. Nowadays, every bit of criticism from people around me has the potential to throw me into another PTSD crisis, which entails endless days of obsessing over the words, feeling panicky, deserted and in existential agony, cannot sleep well, feeling unable to escape from negative thoughts, etc. 
Has anyone experienced such PTSD symptoms? I need your help and advice! Please."

88,I had a mental breakdown because of my past this last Friday I got drunk something I don't do a lot of. And I was married and I was with the same woman for a long time she used to abuse me. So I've been dating this one girl for about a year. She's never once hit me I love her. I kept asking to quit getting hit over and over and that I was being abused I don't remember the night but she's never put her hands on me so I must have been talking about my ex-wife. I do have this problem when someone tries to touch my face and she noticed it long time ago I flinch and I'm used to someone hitting me I've been divorced since 2016. And I really don't know what to do. I really thought I found the one. She has been wonderful to me but she said if I do it once I'll do it again. And she's talking about the drinking. And everything else I guess she has her own pass and I've always looked past it because I thought that's what you're supposed to do when you're with someone. I was so scared that night when I was in the car and she was driving. But I'm not scared of her she's never done anything to hurt me. And I did not put my hands on her or anything. I do get angry sometimes and upset I'm not perfect. In the last year since we've been together she's got drunk once and I got drunk last Friday we've had a few drinks here and there but neither one of us has ever got drunk. My ex-wife about 2 weeks ago now did email me she told me I was worthless and that I was garbage and that I was a failure and I'm always going to be that. And quite a few other things. I don't know why I did what I did.
89,"So my father molested me and my sister. His father was awful towards him and beat him, therefore it makes it ok (?!?) to molest his daughters. Umm...

I have finally met a very wonderful man, who is totally understanding about it all it seems. But I still drink. I still have nightmares. What happens now?"
90,"Hi every one. I’m new here. The reason I sought out this forum is mainly because I’m desperate to tell my story just to stay sane. I’ve never had therapy before, at the moment Im on a long waiting list but I’m not sure if they will believe me as half the time I don’t believe what I feel myself. I‘ve been so anxious and hyper vigilant, I cant shake off the ever present sickening worry that some drama is just about to unfold. I suspect I grew up in a toxic family environment and probably a victim of long term childhood trauma. I’m not sure if my childhood experience qualifies as ‘trauma’ or ‘abuse’but im definitely traumatised and I feel so anxious. Basically I want to share my story with kind people if only for affirmation that I’m not absolutely mad in believing my current desperately anxious state of mind is linked to my childhood.
 
I did not grow up in the UK where I live now. I grew up in an environment where my father left to find a better job overseas (he never did) and we were left behind to fend for ourselves more or less. My mother was targeted and abused by her own narcissistic mother as a child and subsequently married my father who also came from a dysfunctional family that was often violent, verbally and emotionally abusive in the extreme. When my father abando us under the pretext of finding a better life for us, over the years she unravelled mentally and bordered on the unhinged. My life under her roof was a nightmare with few good parts. I have flashbacks when I question if all this ever happened. She had terrible tantrums where she would cry and bawl for hours. She had episodes that brought out all the pain she suffered over the years and I became the target so to speak. She was targeted by her mother with her older sister being the favourite, the pattern was repeated here. She had frightening turns where she expected me to grovel for hours for forgiveness mostly over nothing for example saying I did not want to visit a relative with her or did not want to go shopping with her right now or even choosing the ‘wrong’ seat if we ever dined out. Any perceived affront to her brought back all the rejection of her past and she was inconsolable and cruel. She hit out with whatever was in her hand and showed no mercy. She cried for hours and I had no escape from punishment until she calmed down. My life was hell. I walked on eggshells. These episodes were infrequent but regular and predictable. My sister had in her late teens somehow landed a job which brought in a good salary so she became someone my mother looked to as her salvation. This sister became her main focus and I became the scapegoat. In my mother’s eyes my sister could do no wrong especially when it came to her dealings with me. Knowing that my sister took advantage . Growing up we were never close and she was never nice to me and couldn’t care less if I was hurt or cried. All her callousness was overlooked though because I supposedly made things up and was lazy and rude while she was useful and could earn money. I never felt safe. Life was nothing but pain and counting the days till I left. My mother used all the money she got on her own needs and wants. I could at times borrow her clothes but nothing was ever bought for me. I had to pretend and manipulate in order to breathe. I hid from my sister who was domineering, loud and a bully if she saw me. She had an air of dominance and superiority which unfortunately my mother completely failed to check. She still can be a bully if I let her, especially if I was unfortunate enough to live within her power my life wouldn’t be worth living. I was in trouble with my mum if I didn’t show my sister meek compliance. Ironing her clothes, going with her if she demanded it etc. Protesting was useless, she was always found right by my mother which meant more abuse for me. I stopped complaining because I knew the outcome. To this day this hasn’t changed. My younger brother was my sister’s favourite who said yes to everything but later made excuses and was forgiven. I was more straight forward so very much the problem. I wanted equality and safety but made to feel more like the hunted, the prey. The feeling hasn’t left me, I’m seeking therapy. I still startle to find their phone messages waiting for me. Years ago I cried for months and years in secret and prayed to get out of this hell. I was a timid, kind, conscientious and respectful young person compromised by my circumstances. Please note I wasn’t able to leave home or work or be independent safely in that country any sooner. The abuse ended when I left the country in my early 20’s. Its been 15 years now. I have visited them and invited them over too . Things have vastly improved in that I live on a different continent and I have two beautiful children and a good husband. My mother and sister have probably long forgotten all this because it’s easy for them to forget but the undercurrent of their superiority remains. My mother’s narrative of my childhood is glowing full of all the ‘support’ I was given which I believe is a form of unintentional? gaslighting. I think I still live my mother and feel sorry for all that she went through. I still can’t express myself to them. They don’t believe I suffered at all, just that I am rude, selfish and ungrateful when they can’t control me over something. Numerous times in the recent past when I have tried to talk to her about how her unfair treatment of me with regard to my sister she doesn’t admit it at all. To add insult to injury at the end of the conversation she would always tell me to call my sister, ask her how she is, suck up to her, fear god and not be unkind to the poor child?!? My mother and sister are both controlling in their own way. I can talk carefully to my mother but in the end due perhaps to her dependence on my sister she will always side with her if put on the spot. I will be labelled selfish if I express any need, even today if I ask them say to alter their plans /visiting dates for example they will not be happy with me. My needs don’t matter. To them my needs are ‘selfish demands’. The only acceptable answer is ‘yes’. The outcome is I like to be alone. I don’t like them staying more than a few days.. I have developed a mistrust of people. I feel they will necessarily disrespect my boundaries. Maybe I still love them but I’m allergic to them as well. If I don’t comply with their demands they will withdraw their ‘love’. I must stay within reach, ready to be controlled if the need arises. I don’t know why I’m still so afraid of their anger and being unloved and forsaken. I don’t want to risk their goodwill but I don’t want to be walked over any more either. If I don’t text my sister back my mother sends me long voice messages that I’m not being a good person. My anxiety is tgat my sister will force a visit and act all close and become overbearing and I can’t seem to find any peace .  I know I need help or I’m going crazy. I’m sorry if all this doesn’t make any sense..."
91,"Hi all.

I got out of an abusive relationship three years ago. I am very much over her romantically, but occasionally think about her/worry about her. I also worry about hurting her feelings so I’ve never deleted her from social media/blocked her from anything and I am always willing to reply to her or say hi if I see her.

This is causing major tension and possibly breaking up my current relationshp. I’m very much in love with my current partner and I would hate for it to end over this.

I’m wondering if anyone can share experiences with not fully being able to let go of an abusive partner - maybe any articles or podcasts if they’re out there (I haven’t been able to find anything on this specifically)"
92,"Hi,
without going into too much detail, i was forced to take the morning after pill by the abuser, i obviously have pain from the assault itself but.. the manipulation surrounding the experience after is almost too much to bear.
Does any body else have experience of PTSD around events involving morning after pill? 
I don't know if this anxiety and self loathing is relating to pregnancy or because I didn't fight him. Thanks for your time in advance"
93,I suffered a severe nervous breakdown last year that turned into a psychosis (brought on by stress not drugs)... I was going through something very intense & couldn’t sleep for weeks because psychosis made me feel like I was dying... since then there have been strange & perplexing changes to my body that have not changed back.... one of them is that alcohol no longer affects me at all?? Previously I could have 2 drinks & feel tipsy - now it doesn’t affect me at all... have tried to drink and experiment with different quantities to no avail... it’s very perplexing... not to use as a crutch but to not be able to experience any effects at all is bizarre? Anyone had this happen to them?

95,"When I was living alone back in 2015, I had a break down of some kind and my family was there at the time, just my mom and dad. I was living in supported living, I have Asperger’s so it’s hard to process things properly but I had such a melt down, the police were called. Obviously I started to panic and I had no idea what to do. I wanted to run away and never come back, I wasn’t drunk, under any influence of drugs. 
so anyway, the police came and started talking to me, and I was adamant I was not going with them, they wanted to take me to the hospital so I could talk to someone. However at the time, I was terrified. 
so finally, and this is where it became hell. I was literally handcuffed and dragged out of there screaming for mom and dad to stop them but they didn’t listen and I was placed into the back of the car, I hadn’t committed any crime other than the fact I didn’t want to go with them. 
so I was taken to the police station and placed into an actual Cell, I was absolutely terrified and couldn’t believe this was happening to me because of my mental health, I hadn’t been screaming and making a noise, I wasn’t being violent. 
I remember being told to undress which I said no to obviously, and the lady officer said she would psychically make me change into these clothes. I was shocked and crying so I did it and was humiliated as I got changed. 
I was left in the cell all night. I had nothing but a small wash basin and a camera watching me all the time. 
I asked to speak to the doctor and he did come to see me but never come back with Any medication. I never saw him again. 
I was placed into that cell without being told why I was there. I am traumatised about it to this day and have never told anyone ab it because I was ashamed. They were cruel to me because I had a mental illness. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. And because I have autism, I still don’t understand why my family would allow something like that to happen, infront of them. My dad picked me up the next day and my mom said if that ever happened again I wouldn’t have a home, but I did not do anything wrong. I felt I was being punished for my mental illness. 
as I get older I wonder why this happened and just wonder if this has happened to anyone else. The police gave me no explanation on why they did it. 
I asked my mom a few months ago and said it had been for my own protection but that’s not protecting someone, that’s causing enormous stress and anxiety and physical pain Because they literally dragged me outside to the car and it was the most humiliating thing to go through.Sitting in that cell all night wandering why this happened to me."
96,"I remember when i first met my wife (about 12 yrs ago) and i was standing in my bedroom i started to hear voices calling my name "" Richard Richard Richard "" they were not telling me to do anything they were just calling my name and it completely  freaked me out and i was stuck standing there in my bedroom so afraid to move or talk , my wife was unsure what to do however at some point i ended up in the ER having having absolutely no clue how i got there ( my wife drove me ) all i remember is seeing a bunch of colors swirling around the room and like a little boy just so afraid , the Dr came in the room and asked me a bunch of questions ( am i suicidal or homicidal , do i feel safe ) he told me after doing a bunch of tests that my PTSD caused me to decompensate and lose touch with reality then he went into what kind of childhood did i have and that of course opened the flood gates to i was molested by my mother and foster father when i was 12.


My past doesn't own me like it used to but i damn sure will never forget how alone and afraid i felt in my childhood and how alone and afraid i felt as an adult, when i was having the ""episode"" of PTSD in my bedroom nothing that i could remember triggered me but not being able to sleep and up all night the night before i was manic (I'm bipolar) i spoke to my therapist about it and she said i could definitely be triggered by lack of  sleep as my brain cant handle going that long without sleep'

AnywayI'm no longer having flashbacks or am i triggered , thank you God , I'm in recovery for alcoholism ( over 8 yrs sober ) and being sober has been the best thing that has ever happened to me ( except my wife of course ) i try to live my life as best as i know how but my source of comfort and happiness is Lisa as she is so silly ( i need hat in my life ) :loveshower:and ALWAYS so positive( i also need positivity in my life as well ) anyway i never expected to go on for so long but i wanted to share a part of me that not a lot of people know yet comfortable enough to do this without feeling souncomfortable, thank you for taking the time in reading this i hope it can help someone because with people in my life i know it helped me."
97,"I was bullied very badly in high school. The whole school, including the teachers used to bully me. High school ended 10 years ago and I still have those awful memories.

101,"Hello,


First of all, sorry if this is in the wrong forum. There's a lot of things this can go under but I figure PTSD was the most fitting but I don't know. Also, this is going to be a large thread so I can explain a lot about myself and what's lead up to how I'm feeling now (it's basically my life story summarized). Also do be warned, some of this might be hard for some to read as it deals with child abuse, attempted suicide and potentially PTSD. With that, I thank you for your time reading this and let's start.


I'm the youngest of four siblings. I have a brother that is the eldest (6 years older than I) and two older sisters. My parents weren't ready to have children and my brother came as a surprise to them. They struggled in learning how to become parents suddenly and without warning. My brother struggled with discipline in grade school but the teachers didn't inform our parents of this until it had became a big problem. At that point our parents asked his teacher at the time what they should do for him and the teacher suggested corporal punishment. Our father obliged with this suggestion and started taking a belt to my brother whenever he misbehaved. It escalated from there though and our father took this as permission to do whatever he deemed appropriate to duel out punishment. One case in particular with my brother was bad. We had a furnace that heats the house and is ran off of oil. It caused a lot of problem if the furnace ever ran out of oil so our father made sure to always keep it filled. There was a spicket on the piping that came off of the tank that was used to turn off the flow of oil to the furnace when it wasn't being used. Us kids liked to play with it not knowing what it was for and were warned not to do so. One winter day my oldest sister turned it off while playing with it. That night it got really cold and the furnace wasn't working because the oil had been turned off. My father became furious and assumed it was my brother. In the middle of the night he grabbed my brother out of his top bunk bed by the ankle, dragged him outside, down the concrete steps and slammed the side of his face up against the oil tank yelling at him about how it's never supposed to be turned off. It wasn't even my brother that had done it. My brother went to school the next day with a bruise covering the entire side of his face along with a swollen eye. CPS was called but our father talked his way out of it with lies and nothing further was pursued. This further empowered our father's sense of corporal punishment.


Fast forward a few years to when I was a young kid before I was even in school. I was the youngest of four with an absentee mother and a father that worked all day. No one was around to watch over us kids. So, with nothing better to do and no supervision to be had I became the play thing of the group. I was constantly abused physically, psychologically and sexually by my siblings. They had nothing better to do because we lived a very simple lifestyle (we barely had broadcast TV back then) so it was just a game to them. This lead me to not have any trust in my peers and thinking that treating people this way was normal. I took this mentality into grade school and, much like my brother, had disciplinary issues always getting into fights with other kids unprovoked. The teachers informed my parents (who were separated at this point) and my father, again without investigating, just assumed that it was the same story as my brother so he started taking a belt to me. This made my issues even worse and I began to misbehave even more at school where I wasn't around my siblings or father. One day it got bad enough that I got suspended from school for a few days which made my father furious and he lost his temper fully. He grabbed me by the shirt and threw me into his room hard enough that I had a very large rug burn on my arm from it. He then proceeded to take a belt to the back of my legs until I couldn't stand anymore and I wailed in pain like I've never done since. It scared my siblings that heard this go down and my brother even stood up to our father and said that he thought I was actually seriously hurt. I went to school the next day and had my ""usual talk"" with the school counselor. I didn't know what they were at the time and just liked talking to them because they had fun puzzles for me to play with while I talked with them. I was young and didn't know anything. The counselor saw my arm and asked what had happened. I  nonchalantly said that I had been bad and my father threw me. They were rightfully concerned and coaxed me into telling her the rest of what had happened (I had no idea what was going on). CPS was called and pictures of my injuries were taken. The back of my legs were covered in bloody welts from the belting I had received from the night prior. I spent about a week with my mother while CPS investigated what went on. Once again, our father talked his way out of it and I was guided to tell CPS lies about what had happened. I went back to living with my siblings and father. During these years I had constant nightmares about my father and siblings.


We lived out in the country where your neighbors pretty much never interfered with your affairs. It was a common belief out there that the best neighbor was one that didn't exist, as in one that kept to themselves. Our neighbor at the time (who's name I still remember) saw what was going on with my siblings and I constantly. He was one of these neighbors that kept to himself and certainly wasn't going to tell a father how to handle his kids. He was always to me though which thinking back now it must've been because the things he saw my siblings did to me. One day though, it just became too much for him to not say anything. My father was working on building a porch and our neighbor saw him out there working on it. He called my father over with the excuse that one of the supports wasn't straight. He then proceeded to tell my father about everything he had seen over the past few years. My father had no idea and it caught him completely off guard. Not only was our neighbor taking the risk sticking his nose into family business but what he had to say completely shocked my father. My father didn't want to believe it at first but he started looking out  for it. Sure enough, he began to notice what was going on and the words our neighbor had said were true.


Our father decided that working double time and leaving the kids home unsupervised was a bad idea. Simply providing for the family wasn't anywhere near good enough. So with this knowledge he decided to leave his job and stay at home full time to try to get us kids back into check. He continued with the punishments but they got less and less severe. I had serious behavioral issues all the way until the 5th grade. My teacher at that time, bless her heart, went the extra mile to try to fix my behavioral issues. She would give my father daily updates on how I was doing in school and if I was misbehaving. She also wouldn't deal with any of my stuff in class and wouldn't hesitate to kick me out if I misbehaved. However, she also spent a lot of time outside of school rewarding me if I had a good day. We'd regularly go out and do fun things or go get pizza and whatnot if I was good. She was the first time that I was rewarded for being good, not just simply avoiding being punished for being bad. That year was still rough for me behavioral wise but with her help that was the last year I had such issues. I still had (and still have) anger issues but they were way less severe than they had been in the past.


Because of my actions throughout grade school I was ostracized by my peers in middle school (6-8th grade). We lived in a small town so we all knew each other and I was known as the bad kid. Even though my behavior was mostly fixed I had no friends and no semblance of a social life. I became the loser outcast that people got to pick on because I wasn't allowed to fight back. My academics suffered from this and school became hell for me. I hated being in school and regularly skipped classes to avoid having to go. I remember one kid who was on the wrestling team and was a year older than I was. He was particularly a problem but the school didn't do anything about it because he was their star athlete. My father would always tell us kids that if someone did something to you that you need to let it go and try to walk away so I did that with this kid. A couple of days it got worse though. One day he slammed my head repeatably into a desk until I had a lump and a bruise on my head. I went home with that and my father called the school furious about it but they wouldn't do anything. So, my father added another rule for me to follow. If you tell a teacher but they don't do anything and you can't get away then I was free to fight back if I didn't start the fight. The next day this kid shoved me in the back from behind into a wall. I told the PE teacher and he didn't care so since class was over I just grabbed my things and started walking to the next class. The kid followed after me and shoved me again so I turned around and cold cocked him in the face. A fight ensued but was quickly broken up by an art teacher passing by. We were both suspended for fighting (even though I was defending myself) but my father treated it like a vacation. This, however, further solidified my loser status at school. I basically became an untouchable afterwards and none of the kids would have anything to do with me.


Despite being a brilliant kid, my academic problems continued throughout the rest of my schooling. I should've been held back in the 8th grade but the school literally just wanted to be rid of me so they passed me on into high school. I was smart enough to skip a grade in math but so disinterested in school that I was regularly on the borderline of failing my classes. People tried working with me to improve this but nothing really worked. That was the case up until I met my high school science teacher. He made school fun with me and, much like my grade school teacher, turned me around but this time on a academic level. At that time I was slated to have to be held back a year because of how many classes I had failed. However, with his help I managed to get back on track enough to graduate on time. I had him for three classes the last two years of high school and I can easily credit him with my remarkable academic recovery. My senior year was the only really decent year I had in high school. I joined the Track and Field team because it afforded .5 credits towards your electives which I needed to graduate on time. On that team though, I had a serious break out moment. I helped out the team a lot, broke out of the shell I had formed and found myself part of a group of my peers for the first time. I remained in Jr Varsity the entire year but at the end of the year they gave me a Varsity Letter for how much I had grown and helped out the team. My father and I were very shocked when they did this. We had just gone to the award ceremony to support the other players and were baffled when I was called up to the stage as well. I ended up graduating on time and walked with my class in 2007.


At this point the relationship with my father and siblings had mostly equalized. I went to work with my father as a designer at his engineering business he had started. It was an excellent job and I learned a lot from there. However, the economy crashed in 2008 and work dried up for my father. He only had just barely enough work to keep himself in business and ran out of work to give me. Relations in our family became rough over the next couple of years because of the poor economy. My oldest sister had long since moved out and my other sister got married and move out. My brother and father fought constantly and my brother ended up moving out to live with our mother. About 6 months later my father and I got into a fight where he drew blood on me so I left as well. I decided that I'd never live in that house again and that our relationship was over permanently. The next few years were really difficult for my brother and I as we stood in line day to day at day labor places trying to get any work we could find for the day. We worked some of the worst legal jobs out there during those years.


Eventually, the economy started to turn around. Around this same time our father found faith as well. My brother and I think that use leaving surprised him and made him have a change of heart. He became a totally new person, good example of ""born again"" deal. In the several years since he's become a big foundational part of my life and one of my biggest supporters. I lean on him a lot for help, guidance and support now which I used to never think would happen. I went back and worked with him on some projects here and there when he had the work. Through him, I got introduced to a weld/fabrication shop. I made an arrangement with the owner to do some work for him in trade for him teaching me how to weld. He decided to hire me after I took to welding as easily as I did and I worked for him about two and a half years. I learned a lot working for him and became a much better Designer because of that experience.


Although I was working at a good place though I wasn't happy at home. I was still living with my mother at that point (from when I moved out of my father's place) and our relationship was getting worse and worse. On top of that I kept trying to reach out and form friendships and relationships with no success. Having almost no social life throughout my upbringing made me rather awkward socially. I always seemed to get along better with people a lot older than me than I ever did with my peers. During this time I had four relationships that ended with me being used and hurt (cheated on three times and stolen from once). I had an ever decreasing self image from this and just felt that I wasn't good enough in general. If my relationships kept ending that poorly I must have a fault that needed fixing and needed to make myself more worthy of a relationship. While my welding job was teaching me a lot and was a good job I decided that I needed to do something more with my life. My father and grandfather both served in the military. My grandfather was in the Navy during WWII and my father was in the army during Vietnam. I had always had high regard for those who served and thought there was no better service you could do than that. I am a very caring and charitable person so I thought it would be a good fit for me as well. In addition, I figured I'd be able to get some good training with electronics which would suit me as a Designer. The Army was also always advertised as a band of Brothers and Sisters so I figure it would be a good place to connect with my peers as well. So with a combination of all of that I decided that it was then or never to join up since I was 28 at the time.

I initially intended on serving in the Air Force due to my intellect but made the mistake of going to an Army recruiter first. I took the ASVAB there and scored a 92 (likely my poor writing skills dropped my score). I was disappointed in the score but to the recruiter it was as if he just struck gold. He handed me a booklet with all the jobs in the Army and told me to pick my top five and he'd guarantee that I'd get one of them. I ended up picking Radar Repair Tech with was the same as what my father did during Vietnam. The recruiter also had me do a mock PT test which I failed the run gloriously (wasn't even close). He assured me though that my intellect would carry me through the Army though which turned out to be a flagrant lie (the Army ONLY cares about your PT score).

With my head full of hopes I was shipped off to serve my five year contract that came with a juicy sign on bonus because it was a needed job at the time. I got to reception which is basically the honeymoon period before you get hit with Basic Training (boot camp). Did alright but couldn't march to save my life. We did the couple weeks of in-processing and they went mostly uneventfully. Got to the point where we got assigned the unit we were going to spend Basic Training in and I got one that was notorious for being difficult. They certainty lived up to their reputation. First day of basic training I had that usual, ""Oh no, what in the world did I just get myself into?"" moment that a lot of recruits have. It became quickly apparent that running was not my strong suit in any sense. In high school I did body building and in Track I was a thrower, not a runner. I had always been built for strength, not endurance or cardio. I could do more one handed push ups than anyone in the our detachment (proven a few times) but I was nearly the worst runner out of all of them. In my time in Basic Training I failed every PT test except for my final attempt which was a make up test beyond the normal tests (ie, one last try). Because of this poor physical performance I was quickly made to be the focus of all negativity in Basic Training. All of the other Drill Sgts wanted me kicked out except for my Sgt. He was hard as nails but at least he gave me a chance. I was quickly made out to be the enemy amongst the rest of the recruits. They seem to like to do that with every rotation, pick out one person to make the enemy to unify the rest in their hatred of them. Got so bad that I started sleeping with my e-tool under my pillow in case I got jumped in the middle of the night. Every academic thing they threw at me I aced. I soaked up knowledge like a sponge and could help teach it to others as well. Good discipline and a team player despite the way I was treated but I was still what they call a ""shit bag"" because I couldn't run. That was the only reason for all the flak I was given in basic training. I ended up injuring my left shoulder early on in basic training. Much later in AIT I would be diagnosed with a labrum tear that went untreated causing a cyst to form along with bursitis, tendonitis, a collapsed A/C Joint and a bone spurr. Despite this I never failed the Push-up portion of my PT Test. I forced myself to push through the pain because you were heavily encouraged to not go to sick call unless it was an emergency. The only time I went to sick call in basic training is when I got the barracks cough bad enough that I started coughing up blood. At that point my Drill Sgt forced me to go to sick call and even then I was ridiculed for doing so. No, basic training is supposed to be difficult but I can say I had it worse than usual. My Drill Sgt, close to graduation, told me about the other Drill Sgts wanting to drop me out. When I walked across the stage I shook his hand and he told me, ""Continue to prove them wrong"". That meant a lot to me and was something I told him prior that I had always done with people (I've had a lot of naysayers in my time). I then went on to AIT where I was to receive nearly a year's worth of training for my job. I went in optimistic thinking that now everything was going to be better. Now was when I can show my worth as a smart soldier, not a strong soldier. I was completely wrong.

First thing getting off the truck at my AIT station was me meeting my new First Sgt who just got done working out. First thing he asked all of us was what our PT Scores were. I didn't sugar coat it and told him I barely passed the run portion of the PT Test. He didn't like that. He hated it even more when we did our diagnostic test and I failed it because the Basic Training test is actually easier than the real test. He REALLY didn't like it when he found out my shoulder was seriously injured according to my pain. Him and all the other Sgts thought I was faking it and that there wasn't anything wrong with my shoulder. Once again, I was singled out because of my ability to run and the fact that I was injured. I went about 6 months in AIT before finally getting an MRI of my shoulder reveling how damaged it was and how much worse it had become because it had gone untreated. I was again labeled as a shit bag soldier and for the first time told to my face that, ""I was a waste of tax payer dollars"". I was a waste, because I couldn't run well and I was injured. It wasn't because I lacked discipline or wasn't smart enough to do my job. I was a waste of space, time and money because I couldn't run. Despite all of this, I excelled in my training in both Basic Electronics (BET) and with Radar Repair. I finished BET with a perfect score and a month early. I excelled in every test I was given in the Radar Repair portion of the training, never failed a single one and was top of my class. None of that meant anything. I helped out my fellow trainees that were going through depression and suicidal notions to point where the Sgts would get me if they needed help with something of that sort. Still was less than dirt though. I volunteered in the surrounding community so much that I got noticed with a Certificate of Achievement for my charity work. Still a waste of taxpayer dollars though.

The stress of it all got so bad that I thought about just giving up. I was even calling Air Force recruiters and talking to them about potential jobs in that branch and how long I'd have to wait after leaving the Army to join. My stress got so bad that I broke out in a case of the shingles which every medical professional I saw at the time said was stress induced because I had no prior skin conditions and I was too young to have shingles. I was on the verge of quitting but Holiday Block Leave (HBL) was coming up and I was going to be able to go home and see my family for the Christmas season. I decided that since the surgery for my shoulder was slated for after HBL that I would be a good soldier and tough it out until my surgery. Perhaps then, things would finally change. Turns out, as far as AIT was concerned, I was correct. I went on HBL, came back, got my surgery and things changed on a dime. Suddenly all the Sgts realized, ""Oh crap, he was actually injured and despite all that he still put up with everything"". Their opinion changed drastically and although my stay in AIT was extended 6 months due to my surgery, my period of recovery from my surgery was spent relatively nicely. I had earned their respect, just had to go through hell to do it. After I recovered from my surgery I passed my PT test, was awarded Distinguished Honor Graduate for my accomplishments and awarded an Army Accommodation Award (standard award for DHG's). I though the worst was behind me at that point. I thought that I finally was going to be able to go off to ""the real army"" and show what I had to offer. I would be treated like an adult, not like a kid anymore. I would be able to prove my worth and show the skills I had to offer the Army. I was once again filled with hope and once again met with nothing but disaster.

As a Radar Repair Tech that graduated with honors I was sent to an armored tank battalion that had zero radars in the area. I had no radars to work on whatsoever. They didn't even know where to put me because they didn't need someone that was my MOS. They put me in their Electronics Repair Shop that worked on primary fixing Night Vision Goggles (NVGs). I thought that there could be worse places to be so I might still be able to help them out with NVGs. Nope, the Warrant Officer in charge of the shop wouldn't let me do a thing because I wasn't qualified. Yeah, they guy with over a year of intense electronics training on equipment that costs tens of millions of dollars isn't qualified to work on NGVs that only cost a few $10k. Despite my protests I wasn't afforded the opportunity to help with their electronics. I also was denied reassignment to a duty station with actual radars for me to work on. Nope, I became in charge of landscaping and watching over front desks of various places. As if that wasn't bad enough I had also injured my back in the final stretch of AIT but pushed through the pain to pass my PT Test. Early on in my duty station I would get a MRI that showed two herniated disks in my lower back that were pushing up against nerves causing issues with my right leg. Received zero treatment for it apart from being prescribed muscle relaxers and put on profile (limited duty) for the injury. This coupled with my previous low PT score on the running portion of my AIT PT Test once again labeled me as a shit bag soldier. Once again, while in the PT group designated for those with injuries, I was told to my face that I was a waste of tax payer dollars. A waste of space and a shit bag for no other reason than I'm injured from trying my damnedest to try to pass a test that has nothing to do with fixing radars. Worthless because there was no work that they would allow me to do that I was qualified for. I was made worthless and reminded that on a nearly daily basis.

But wait, what's this? Another glimpse of hope? Turns out that my unit was deploying on rotation to South Korea. I heard that they actually needed my MOS over there and I'd actually be able to do my job there. I'd be able to show my skills and that I wasn't a waste of space. There was one other guy in my unit that had my same MOS but he was applying for special forces training. If he got accepted I could take his spot on the deployment and go to Korea. I waited in anticipation to hear if he got accepted or not. I talked to the doctor in charge of screening those that were going on deployment and convinced him to overlook my back injury. All the stars aligned and I recieved notice that I was on the deployment list. I was once again completely excited at the opportunity to prove myself to those around me. I was finally going to be able to work on radars. Yet another glimpse of hope leading up to what would be the final let down.

Got to Korea and got assigned to Camp Casey where ""the elite go"" and where I was supposed to finally have radars to work on. Nope, no radars anywhere in the area. No work to do once again. Even with a skeleton crew and a huge backlog of work the Warrant Officer still wouldn't let me work on simple NVG's. Once again, I was just a worthless waste of space. A good for nothing shit bag soldier. Still I tried my best. That had been my only fault, refusing to quit. I became quickly apparent that nothing had change except that I was now in a foreign country and on my first deployment on top of it all. To make things worse, the other people in my shop had been deployed together before which served to further alienate me from them. Let down after let down after let down, that was the story of my Army career up to that point. I started to seek medical attention for my back injury because it was really starting to effect my leg and was starting to scare me. Received no treatment for it and was just, once again, prescribed muscle relaxers for it. They were stronger ones that were supposed to help with the pain more but came with the side effect of making you constantly drowsy. Yeah, great combination to be drowsy on top of being unable to sleep due to the stress and pain on top of orders changing on a daily basis. I ended up being, and I quote, ""5 minutes late to being 10 minutes early"" to formation twice and written up both times for it. As stupid as that sounds it's true, ""5 minutes late to being 10 minutes early"". We would get periodic check ups from the higher ups stationed at Camp Humphreys to the south which was the major base. On one of these check ups I was taken aside by a Sgt notorious for being an ass and bullying people out of the unit/army. He told me that the people up and Casey were supposed to be the best of the best (hogwash, they did nothing when I was up there) and because of my write ups that I'd need to pack my bags and go back with them to Camp Humphreys under his unit. Mind you at the time I was seeing a dentist for a cracked molar (from clenching my jaw all the time due to stress), a doctor for my back and a behavioral health counselor for the mental stress/depression/anxiety I was going through. All of that came to a screeching halt.

I followed this Sgt back down to Camp Humphreys like a good little soldier and didn't put up any fuss. Who knows, maybe I could do something of importance down there although I doubted it at the time. No it ended up being the same thing of being worthless and having nothing to do all day other than sit in a shop doing nothing. However, this time it was worse because of this Sgt. He liked to bully people and liked to force them out of the Army, he was notorious for it even with the higher ranking officers; and now he had his sights on me. I tried to get new dental appointments scheduled, denied. Tried to get new doctor's appointments, denied. Tried to see behavioral health, denied. I tried time and time and time again to get help and was stone walled by him at every turn. Furthermore, the profile that I was on for my back injury was constantly scrutinized by him. He kept acting like a lawyer and trying to find any loophole he could to try to get me to do tasks that would hurt my back. He even went so far as to take me to see the First Sgt and our Captain to argue about my profile with them. They luckily took my side but he didn't stop there. Every single day he'd find me and find some BS thing that was wrong with me and reprimand me for it. I kept trying to get help and was getting stonewalled the entire way while being backed into a corner. The foundation of my mind slowly began to crumble as I tried over and over and over again to get help. I only had a few people around me that I could be safe around, that knew I wasn't a bad guy and that sympathized with the situation I was in. Slowly though, that group dwindled out of fear of this Sgt.; they didn't want to end up on his list. I was left with one friend that stuck through me through it all who was also injured and also had had to deal with this Sgt in the past but he persevered though it. This guy was my only support while away from home and family. He too, didn't get along with they guys in our shop. We used WhatsApp to communicate over there and they'd be constantly fighting with each other on it.

At this point I was losing a grip on my anger and starting to feel the anger that I felt in my childhood grow and become harder and harder to control. I started drinking heavily when off duty to numb the pain in my back so I could go to sleep. In privet I would harm myself in various ways. I'm surprised I never broke something doing that. The point is my anger was growing more and more out of control but I was doing my absolute best to try to not express it around others. At my core I'm a caring person and want to do my best for others. I don't want to lose control of my anger and cause problems for others again. One night in particular though, it all came crashing down for me all at once. We were staying super late at night (past midnight at this point) cleaning rifles for the Sgt in charge of the armory. This sgt was a very nice guy and I liked him a lot. At the same time though he was super particular with the cleanliness of the rifles. You had to clean it all to the point where his tiny little finger couldn't find any trace of oil residue in any part of the internal parts. I was not skilled at cleaning rifles and didn't have the right tools either. It was late at night and my shop was the only one in the entire unit cleaning these rifles for the entire unit. We weren't going to get out until all of them were cleaned. I was absolutely furious at this point and was barely able to control myself. On the forth check of the rifle I was cleaning he still found traces of residue in it and told me to continue cleaning it. I snapped at him and told him that was the best cleaning he was going to get. He was very shocked to hear me say that and mind you disrespecting a Sgt is no small offense in the Army, you usually get in big trouble for that. He looked at me with a shocked face and asked if everything was alright with me. I told him no and I was trying to get help but was getting none. He apologized but said that he needed me to continue cleaning the rifle (luckily I didn't get in trouble). I went back to the spot where I was cleaning it and put out in the group chat that I thought it was BS that our shop was the only ones out here cleaning these rifles for the entire unit. I saw another comment from my friend saying to not contact him again and that if he was neeeded for something to go through the the shop's sgt about it. What I didn't know was he wasn't saying this in response to my comment but to one of the other guys in the shop that he was in the middle of fighting with. In my state of mind I thought he had just cut all ties with me and that I lost my last supporter in all of what I was going through.

This devastated me me and was the final breaking point. I decided right there to give up on everything. Not just the Army mind you, everything. I felt like I was being backed into a corner that would going to lead to a dishonorable discharge and there was nothing I could do to prevent it. I had been told that a DD on your record was as bad as a felony. With that knowledge I figured that any life I'd have after a DD would be worthless to me. Worst of all, I was afraid that I was going to lose my anger more than just snapping at someone but actually fully snap. Like I said, at my core I'm a deeply caring person and don't want to hurt others. With the loss of hope and the feeling of losing control I decided to end it all myself rather than hurt anyone else. The rest of the time cleaning the rifles was spent in a daze as I planned on taking my life that night. I had a full bottle of pills that I had stopped taking because they weren't helping along with a full 750ml bottle of tequila in the freezer. After getting off around 2am I went to my room, grabbed the bottle, put my bed up against the door to bar it and wrote my farewell to everyone. I had a personal laptop that I wrote it on and deleted everything but it from my desktop. After writing that I down the bottle of pills and chased with with half of the bottle of tequila in one go. I sat there for some time, I don't know how long until I started to feel it take effect. I had prepared a text to send in our group chat to make sure that my note on the computer wasn't missed. However I wanted to wait until the last minute to send it so that if they responded right away it would be too late. I crawled up in the corner of my room with the effects of what I did well under way. I forced myself to drink more, pretty much drowning myself in it. As I laid there bleeding from my nose profusely and feeling my consciousness beginning to lapse I sent the msg telling everyone what I was doing and that I left a note on my laptop explaining everything. Hours later, I woke up in the shower for some reason. I had moved my bed away from the door, gotten undressed and started taking a shower for who knows what reason. I became lucid to the sound of pounding on my door with my friend screaming and asking if I was alright. He knew how to pop the lock and came in as I was leaving the bathroom. He asked again if I was alright and I said yes in a dismissive matter and slumped against the wall and started convulsing. He dragged me up, laid me down on my bed and called the first sgt who said to call for an ambulance. My friend stayed by my bed side and made me keep talking to him as I kept trying to drift off to what I thought was sleep. The paramedics came and took me to the hospital. The entire way they kept having to talk to me, use pressure points to wake me up and remind me to breathe. The muscle relaxers seemed to have been shutting down my diaphragm causing me to lose control of my breathing. They successfully got me to the hospital, pumped my stomach and a bunch of other things that night. I spent the night in the ICU as they watch over me. I remember the First Sgt and the Captain coming to see me while I was there. What I had done surprised them apparently. The Captain in particular was deeply troubled, she was kinda like a mother of the unit. Apparently none of what had been going on with me had been relayed to them. The sgt that was in charge of me kept it from going up to them and they were completely out of the loop. She cried by my bed side apologizing for what had happened and telling me that she had no idea something like that was going on in her unit (she was new to the unit). It moved me to know that she cared that much and I felt guilty for putting her and everyone else through what I had. My attempt to not hurt anyone had in fact hurt a lot of people that night.

I was discharged later the following day and put on watch for 2 weeks after that. There wasn't anywhere I went that I wasn't being watched. I had regular meetings with behavioral health after that, talking about what had happened and how I was feeling. The biggest things I felt were guilt and lost. I felt lost because I had no plan for any sort of ""after"". That night was supposed to be the end of it all and I didn't know what to do next. I also felt guilt because of the amount of people that I hurt that cared about me that I didn't know felt that way. The amount of support that rallied around me was extremely shocking. I decided to do the only thing I could think of and just followed their instructions while also using my experience to help other soldiers. Our unit had a bad rep for suicide cases before this new Captain came on board and she didn't know about it in time for me. During my remaining time there I was able to use my experience to talk two soldiers down from their own suicide attempts, one of which had been harming herself already. Luckily both of them made it and got the help they needed as I did. I did the only thing I could do with my pain as I had done all my life which is why I'm as caring as I try to be. I turned my pain into a tool to help others survive their current issues. After the two weeks of intense watch and talking with behavioral health about everything that had gone on an investigation was launched about what had taken place. I gave my testimony and don't know what happened after that. The investigator had me proof read the transcript of my testimony on my last day there. I was leaving to go back home and be honorably discharged due to mental trauma.

Afterwards and even now I have issues feeling worthy of being called a veteran. I've had a lot of people telling me that I did nothing wrong and literally gave it everything I had. To me though, I still failed and that's difficult to deal with. Slowly I'm coming to terms that I was just a victim of a series of unfortunate events and was just not meant to be in the Army. It still hurts that I wasn't able to be successful.

I've been out of the Army since January of 2019. Almost all of 2019 was spent doing nothing apart from mentally recovering from what had transpired and getting my feet under me again. Only my father, brother and younger of two older sisters know what happened. The rest of my family thinks that I was just discharged due to my back injury. Since then I've fought with the VA and have received almost no aid that I'm due. The only thing I've gotten from them is a dental exam. After fighting for awhile I gave up on the issue and decided that I have to help myself in this matter. Late last year I got my resume in order and applied as an Entry Level Technical Designer for a civilian company that makes rockets. After about a four month application period and many interviews I was hired on with a salary that was 50% over what I had asked for. I've been working for them since and have been really happy at the company. Still a bit weary from my experience in the Army and getting used to co-workers and supervisors that like me and treat me as a highly valued employee. I also managed to meet a girlfriend through a mutual friend and we've been hitting it off very well. A lot of thing have been going well for me, when I look at myself now. I have also not drank since my time in Korea.

However, I've become evermore ""the strong person"" for everyone around me. Like I said, I use my past experiences to help out those that I can. Despite things not going wrong with me, there is a lot of bad things going on around me that I'm having to help others with constantly. All the while I can hardly sleep at night due to nightmares. This morning was particularly bad as I might have gotten about 2 hours of sleep but woke up more relieved than tired. I was relieved to be awake and no longer having those nightmares. It's becoming more and more difficult to be ""the stone person"" for everyone and it feels like I can't talk about my problems. I feel like if I talk to other people I'll be burdening them with my issues and they'll feel less open to come to me for the help they need. Despite having family around me that care for me it feels like I'm alone with my problems. About the only person I can turn to is my father but he's dealing with a lot as well (his sister just had major surgery done). He's a strong man of faith but I feel bad burdening him with my issues as well. I wish I shared his faith as I see the same faith give him and so many others strength. I feel alone with these issues and it's getting harder to deal with. I'm constantly afraid. I don't want my work to know because it's the best job that I've ever had and I don't want to jeopardize my position there. Even now I feel like crying writing this but I can't because I don't want my brother to hear it. I'm afraid to tell Sarah (my girlfriend) because she's also going through so much right now with her city on the verge of shut down and having a neighbor with covid. I can't even go see her because of all the lock downs. The friends I've met since leaving the Army are people that I help out a lot with with advice and moral support. I'm afraid that if I bring my problems to them that they'll stop making the progress they've been making because I won't be ""the strong person"" in their life anymore. They'll also feel less open to come to me for support because it'll burden me too much.

There's a lot of stress and loneliness that I feel right now and I don't know what to do to help it. One of my friends who knows what has happened to me thinks I may have PTSD but I've not been able to see a therapist about it due to the lock downs and fear jeopardizing my work. I've also have received no help from the engorgement that's due to me from my service. It's becoming more and more difficult to ""stay strong"" and help out others as well. I don't really know what to do about it. I want to still be in a position where I can help those that I care for that need it. I want to remain strong for everyone but don't know who it is that has my back and I feel guilty for feeling this way."
102,"I get triggered by the TV, at the moment there's a lot of talk about how children need to get back to school after a long break due to Covid19, some people say it's not safe - others say that children will suffer more by staying away from school & not just because of the academic side of things, it's said they need to be with their peers for social development - it just makes me think how being with my peers at school served as a complete utter character assassination which left me with zero confidence & zero self-esteem (getting Covid-19 would have been far preferable)."
103,"I'm in my 30s and have suffered from PTSD, shyness, social anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts for years from bullying I went through in high school, college, and office jobs. What also pisses me off is that I had to quit from jobs due to bullying, resulting in huge gaps (as in years) in my resume not to mention the mental health issues I had to deal with which prevented me from interviewing well for jobs and resulting in literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost income. One job in particular that I was bullied at, I was terminated at the end of my at will employment period. I literally could be almost a millionaire now if not for the bullying

I just wish I could sue them and get justice. Or at least sue my brother because of how he constantly bullied me when I was younger and I had literally zero self-esteem during my teenage years. But I figured I would have no chance since the bullying occurred years ago. Also there wasn't any physical violence involved nor were there any obvious racial slurs said. Also, I'm not part of the minority classes that so if I claim discrimination my guess is I won't be taken seriously. Also I figured even if I won the lawsuit, I may still end up losing alot of money due to lawyer fees

Has anyone ever filed lawsuits against their past bullies? Is it worth it?"
104,"hey guys

I hope all is well with you these days, and everyone is as strong as can be. 

I really need some help and advice on an issue which I feel maybe PTSD although there is assurance or diagnosis on this. 

 it's more due to the fact every so often I experienced periods of of extreme rumination on fear over my past high school bully who actually threatened me. Trouble is when I try to explain all this to anyone, it's complicated and long because I made mistakes in high school which I I remember and wish I could crawl into a ball and never come out again from. 

No I am 28 and working as an engineer in a good job that I enjoy,  for some reason over the past maybe 8 to 10 years, I have gone through episodes of extreme fear and worry which exhaust me me when I remember my bully who used to to pester me almost everyday for 3 years. 

Whats frustrating is he picked on me is actually my fault because when I was in school I got in fights where I lost them by why slapping instead of punching which of course everybody laughed at. 

I know this sounds really silly and you will probably all laugh at me even more, but the trouble is after that happened he picked on me every single day saying how I was a little b***h, to the point where eventually I had enough and told him if he didn't stop I would get my brother  who is a gangster to sort him out. 

Now looking back I could kick myself in the ass inside out for saying such a thing because as it turns out and I suspected then and knew that he was actually a type of gangster. so he just laughed in my face and then proceeded to threaten me more and see that he would bring my ass down and I have messed with the wrong guy. 

 At the time I didn't really think about it much, but over these past few years these memories are coming back and making me fear for my life. 

Because in the back of my head I always remember that threat which was not a joke and makes me feel totally helpless embarrassed regretful and on top of that impending doom if you know what I mean if I ever saw him again. 

As you'd expect whenever I remember that time I remember the other stupid mistakes I made which were very avoidable is there any way to at least overcome this to live a normal life again as I'm exhausted everyday from this rumination."
105,"⚠️Trigger warning *Alcoholism *Abuse


Do you ever get triggered by smells?
I had a few drinks. A few very strong drinks. I’m now sweating booze. It reminds me of a guy I dated a few years ago. He was a great person when he was sober. It was pretty rare. Sadly I felt the most loved around him when he was consoling me after he hit me or cheated on me. 

I started drinking because I’m feeling a little neglected in my current relationship. It kind of makes me miss being hit a little."

108,"Hi I’m an 19 yo from Morocco and I got dragged to smoking weed back in 2019 and I enjoyed for a couple of months, until one day back in May 2019 I was with a friend and we smoked outside at night in a sketchy place and I remember inhaling a higher than usual quantity of weed, after I finished smoking I decided to walk back home in a dark silent street where the only thing I was hearing was a cricket sound, after a couple of meters away my heart started racing and my eyes started to turn in some symmetric rhombus pattern and I started biting my nails and putting my hands on my face subconsciously , I disconnected from reality and I felt like I was an alien I didn’t know what was going on nor who I am nor where was I and everything lost meaning, my consciousness went back from a couple of seconds then went away again , when my consciousness got back a mountain of questions rushed my mind (where am I , what am I , where was I, is what happening really happening) and I started to run as fast as I could towards my home after a hundred meters or so I was about to faint and it felt like my heart was going to fail , when the consciousness got back for the second time I believed that I was gone insane and my life was basically over and I regretted every decision I did in my life, my consciousness went away again and I started walking towards my home like if I was set on autopilot only that thoughts were racing my brain and it felt like I was losing memory every 1 second, I finally got home , I entered my mom’s room and I was staring at her and my aunt with a white face saying (I need to sleep), mom thought I lost my mind so she took me to another room and grabbed a blanket and made me lay down and I started shaking and my whole body and brain hurt me real bad , my aunt started asking me what happened I was telling her a little bit of the story every time my consciousness was back, I was on autopilot for 90% of the time and only for a short period my consciousness would go back and I was telling her during that period , after an hour or so I told her everything, and she started comforting me and telling me that it’s the just the weed and that I haven’t lost my mind and that that feeling would go away shortly, my heart stopped racing and I started to feel a tiny bit relieved , I tried to sleep but I couldn’t it felt like I was trapped in my own mind and thoughts, it was a terrible experience, I slept and the next day I started to feel a bit better and I started to gain my consciousness and control back to some extent and I started to recover emotionally from the accident.

I recovered in the next couple of days and I thought that whatever happened happened because the weed being mixed with something else

I resumed smoking weed shortly after, my grandma passed away in January 2020 and derealization started to appear a little bit but nothing concerning I thought that I was derealizing a bit because of my grandma passing away, anyways a couple of days after grandma’s death a friend invited me to smoke weed and of course I joined , it was a dark night we went to a sketchy empty place and we started smoking and for the second time I made the same mistake I inhaled more than usual again we walked for a couple of meters and I started to feel really high , for a second it felt like that I started to understand the meaning of life my heart felt a little bit weird after that happened we walked again for a couple of meters and a couple of guys called us , I got scared I thought they were thieves my heart started racing and I started to stare at one of the guys that were walking towards us and it felt like I knew him but I didn’t know him at the same time, his face looked familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, seconds after the guys left I started to relive and reexperience what happened back in May 2019 , consciousness would go away for minutes and go back for seconds back and forth , I took the chance when I was conscious and asked my friend to stay over at his place for the night because I couldn’t go back home and let my family see me like that again , my friend already knew about my first bad trip so he tried to calm me down and comfort me but it didn’t work I was telling him “ I need to sleep, lets go to your place”, on our way back I couldn’t walk too close to the road because cars were scaring me and it felt like I was going to be hit my a car any minute ,minutes after walking that felt like years for me we got to his place and I tried to sleep and it was really really hard for me to sleep but at least I felt a little bit safe, hours later I slept and woke up early the next morning and got back home, I kind of didn’t recover that good for this time the derealization was kicking in every now and then but nothing concerning I thought that it might be an aftermath of my grandma’s death, I stopped smoking weed for good this time . a month later in February I was playing video games with my crush online and I asked her a question and her answer was a bit disappointing , the feeling of disappointment reminded me of the bad trip , it felt exactly like the same feeling of the disappointment I had about my life during the bad trip, It might have been the emotional shock after I heard the disappointing answer , I had a panic attack and I rushed to sleep, the next day I felt a bit better, a week after it I was calling at night with the same girl and I asked for a relationship and she said no and it happened again and I rushed to sleep again , the next day I felt normal to some extent,

A couple of days later we were calling again and we went quiet for a couple of minutes and I started to fall asleep and she suddenly yelled my name , guess what happened ? my eyes started to move the same way it was moving in the bad trip and they were being fixed in the same angle it was being fixed during the bad trip and I thoughts started rushing my mind and it felt like I was dreaming , I don’t remember what happened afterwards I think I slept and the next day I didn’t feel any better I was feeling like if I was high and like if I was dreaming I was derealizing very hard nothing felt real it felt like I was really dreaming I was feeling alien to my self and I started to dissociate every now and then and the feeling didn’t stop for months. To this day its been almost 6 months now everyday when I’m about to sleep I tell my self “it will end soon maybe tomorrow” it feels like I’m still in the bad trip , my consciousness keeps suddenly kicking in and I start panicking and when I panic my eyes starts to follow symmetric shapes and I start feeling dizzy and my decisions and thoughts feel like they are not mine I’m really tired I was suffering from depression and anxiety for years and after this life just got a thousand times harder , I unfortunately can not afford therapy and I can not tell my parents , I’m really lost and I don’t know what to do , I keep my self distracted all day and all night by playing video games by day, and watching videos on YouTube by night until I fall asleep .

I used to take a medication which is “Curacne 20mg” its for acne and it contains “isotretinoin” which I read that it might have negative mental side effects and that it might cause psychosis and other mental illnesses so I stopped taking it shortly after

I all of sudden start to feel that I'm waking up from the trip the same way I felt before but the feeling goes away quickly and I also start to realize whats going on but It just feels like that I cannot accept whatever is going on and It stops and I keep getting flashbacks of the trip and I keep hallucinating .



I’ve been coping this way for the last 6 months but no improvement noticed, the acute panic attacks decreased a little bit but everything else is still there, the other day I had to do something outside and I was walking during the morning and I started to hear the cricket sound I started to panic and I started to derealize and feel very very weird ,I got back home asap.



I am sorry for the long text and the terrible English and I hope I can get some answers from you guys

Thank you very much"
109,"Hey guys

I hope you are well today and things are going ok. 

Now to cut a long story short, I worked as a bar staff at wetherspoons 2 years ago to get by during studies while in London temporarily.  

After about 2 months I was fired as customers complained about my inappropriate flirting and going too far with it, which I hold my hands up as being totally wrong and out of line. 

I was giving 2 warnings and it still happened as well as making a homophobic remark which came out the wrong way when I was joking with a colleague. 

Trouble is I am diabetic and feel a lot of these mistakes were not because of that but it played a massive apaprt as when u r hypo could say wrong things that I most definitely would not do or say normally. 

Trouble is, now I'm in a good job as an engineer and health has I moved, but whenever the fleeting memories of what happened there pop up I feel like crawling into myself and feel almost sick with worry. 

Obviously a lot of it could be farfetched now, but I have a feeling of fear like what if this was brought up in the future or my current employer found this out, it would be disastrous. 

I seriously don't know what to do about it and it feels like a trauma which is even worse as I'm the cause of it. 

Please help I feel so bad and scared."
110,"I am meeting with a new psychiatrist in a few weeks.  He will have my records from my prior psychiatrist.  One thing I could never be quite honest about with my new psychiatrist was the amount of bad thoughts I have had....though I would never harm myself.   The only med that stops the thoughts are benzos however we all know the level of addiction.  So, bottom line if I tell my dr that unless I take a benzo, I am at risk of hurting myself will he hospitalize me?
I take an anti depressant but I am convinced that it is making me worse.

Anyone have any success with a med that may act the same as a benzo?  An anti psychotic perhaps?

I have so many issues...Ocd, ptsd, anxiety, depression....it is awful.

Thank you."
111,"I'm o seed with though of revenge now my mind won't shout down to let me sleep?

Anyone else?

I need to vent everything. So sorry. 
I'm going to ask my money back from an abusive doctor i trusted like a fool. I trusted because it made me confused and because no one else accepted me as a patient at the hospital. I will ask my family member to tie my hands when I see him. I will promise o will be silent about the abuse and about his insucces of treating me. But I won't. I know this isn't just ptsd. I have antisocial traits and others. So I don't know where to post this."
112,"After working my CNA job I was pretty tired but I had to do some art projects after work. The whole time I was blurting out random words while I was painting. Like “Ew! Gross! I’m gonna throw up! Yuck!” Because I thought it would some how stop my flashbacks.

I thought saying these words would some how stop the memories.

I notice I blurt out random words more often when my brain is tired from the day.

Can anyone relate to me? Is this from ptsd ? Or is this from my schizophrenia/psychosis? Does anyone know?

Also the words I blurt out don’t always have any relation to the memory."
113,I just remembered some past Trauma where I was not in good mental states and my husband was jumping on my head with his knee but I couldn't move to fight back...it was like I was frozen.  The only thing I could think to do is call for help.  He stopped because I started screaming for help.  I have trouble resolving the emotions and feelings I get when I remember this event.  I get upset that I couldn't move.  I get upset that I was so delusional I didn't call the police but screamed out to the secret society so that they were aware of what was happening and do controls to stop the violence.  I get really angry and think deviant.  He was making me angry and I lunged after him only to go catatonic when he attacked me.  The same thing happened for one of the rapes.  I totally lost control of my body and fell limp as soon as the attack started.  I don't know why this happens.  How do you manage unresolved emotions and feelings surrounding past trauma?   I think the catatonia comes in at the absolute worst time and I don't know how to predict when it will happen and it bothers me that I couldn't fight and that my mind went into an abnormal state in these traumas.
114,What medication worked for you in treating your ptsd?
115,"Hi guys :) 
I'm just trying to learn myself here. Please could you help me understand what a flashback is (I have googled it) and please could you give a couple of examples with context?
It would really help me, thanks"
116,"Hi. 

I have some caring responsibilities for my partner, and I am looking for advice from other users on how to discourage partners getting themselves discharged from community mental health teams. 

My partner has PTSD and severe depression, has active suicidal thoughts, and has recently started to develop disassociation and derealisation. My partner was with the home-based treatment team for a few months and has been transferred to the CMHT two months ago. 

My partner wants to be discharged from the CMHT as they don't think they will get better, they don't trust their carer and staff at the CMHT (due to pass incompetence and staff problems at the CMHT), and they don't think the CMHT will provide the (long-term) therapeutical support that they need to get better (due to limited numbers of sessions available at the CMHT). Therefore, my partner wants to be left alone. 

I strongly oppose that. I still see the value from the CMHT and believe they are making slow yet steady progress. Also, due to Covid-19, if they get discharged then there will be months of waiting list if they want to go back in the system again.

However, I share their concerns with the CMHT as well. For example, we recently asked for a care plan, but only given a very short document that basically says what my partner's current issues are - without any mention of what the future treatment plan is. There are also limited resources within the NHS, and I am aware that the systems is not fit to provide a long term support that my partner needs. I want to go private, my partner doesn't trust private services either / or doesn't know where to start from. 

I want to know whether there are people here who manage their relationship as well as provide support for their partners. Also, if people can share some good practice examples of encouraging partner to stay put and not get themselves discharged from the CMHT, that would be appreciated. 

Cheers."
117,"I’ve been able to manage my Complex PTSD in the past few months, but unfortunately life has its way of throwing you a curveball when you least expect it. This past weekend, my dad was admitted to the icu in critical care and has been on life support for the past week. My dad seemed okay one minute, the next he’s in a hospital bed and I know I shouldn’t but I can’t help but blame myself. My dad and I have always had an amazing relationship. He’s been my biggest supporter and always tried to keep me safe and protected from my moms abuse growing up. I’ve had the incredible luck of finally getting to live somewhere just worth my dad, and it’s been a blessing. Recently we’ve been fighting here and there and I was beginning to avoid him. What I didn’t realize was by me being petty and angry over little fights here and there I didn’t realize how sick my dad really was, I didn’t try to help him and it’s just breaking my heart. On top of it all, me and my dad might be getting kicked out now and I’m not sure if I have anywhere to go and I definitely am not able to find a place right now that I can afford on my own. It feels like all the progress I’ve made is lost. I feel broken and scared, I can’t stop having flashbacks and panic attacks and I’m unable to control my emotions or anger, and it genuinely just feels like I have no one. I know I should reach out to friends but I don’t even know what to say. It feels like I’ve lost control of everything again and I’m powerless, like I’m incapable of even doing basic tasks. It’s just a lot, and I know I just need to stay strong but it’s hard when I can’t talk to the one person who would be able to calm me down, and that’s always been my dad."
118,"I was diagnosed ptsd quite a few years ago but wondering if my diagnosis fits if anyone else experiences this? atm im having terrible hallucinations and extreme paranoia. im seeing blood, sinister figures, smoke filled rooms, actors with blue liquid coming out their mouths, half my face sliding off, a hanging noose, voices of a sinister man instructing me to do terrible things, a feeling of being watched through the walls, lent someone a book thought my thoughts have dissolved into authors words and exposing my desperation, thought someone had stolen an app off my phone, thought someone was being telepathic with me and can hear what im hearing, thought id been given an important mission to speak with an influencial poet etc etc endless. I asked dr for sleeping pills as not slept for four weeks but was refused, they said im experiencing these things because of childhood trauma and its affected my development but to just try ground myself with music, art, nature etc but im really unsure whether this is ptsd at all as ive not met anyone similar to me?"
119,"Hi everyone of this sub forum. Is a PTSD thing or something that I hate my carreer? Since september 2019 I was overloaded by my teachers. I've finish my carreer in June but I'm not happy with success, In March I've got a trigger because those guys wanted that I did a work of 1-2 weeks in 1-2 days, because supposedly ""I'm a pro in my area"", but that is bulls""#$#"". Now I don't want work in my area nevermore, even is hard for me remember those days. I need work in my carreer for help my loved ones, but I can't. I can't with another collapse. Even in november I've falled in existencial  and suicidal thoughts. I'm more unstable since March 2020, coronavirus don't help me too much."
120,"since lockdown I have had 1 and a half hours sleep a night. I think its been three months, my symptoms are getting more intense and strange. I am very distressed, may 28th I made a suicide attempt in hospital. I was referred by psychiatric team to psychiatry I waited weeks she didn't call she just discharged via letter. I finally was given a phone appointment last week with a different psychiatrist who discharged me after an hour. I sobbed asking for a medication review therapy or respite. he said no and told me I might as well discontinue my meds as they are not working anway. I am so suicidal. I cannot talk to my partner  because theres no point. my partner just walks away from me when im crying. I have three children and a duty to them . I need someone to talk to especially someone diagnosed ptsd who has hallucinations, mania, paranoia, delusions and suicidal ideation"
121,I just had some flashbacks and started shaking and trembling as if I was freezing cold...still shaking with this feeling like my jaws want to clench now.  My house is cool but not freezing.  Has this ever happened to you?  Do you get any other symptoms while having flashbacks?
122,"Last year I lost my mother and my relationship.

My bf and I were long distance and I discovered he had been cheating on me really since we started dating (a year and a half.) I loved this man with my whole heart and he was a huge support to me during the loss of my mum.

When I discovered this news, something in me just changed.

I discovered he lied about being infertile, and got someone else pregnant. I had to take a pregnancy test and blood/urine/self-swab, all of which came back negative luckily.

It has been over a year since I lost my mum and 6 months since losing him and I feel flat, numb, sad, defeated, hopeless, paranoid. I don't trust or like people or see the point in anything. At times I feel suicidal and I often feel very angry. It feels unfair that I lost my mum. It feels cruel that the man I loved turned out to be a sociopath (by his own admission) and felt able to lie to me and put my life at risk just to have unprotected sex.

I don't know how to begin to get over the pain."
123,"So I had childhood emotional trauma which led to ptsd and on and off severe depression. I have sought help and after many years of therapy and hard work, the flashbacks stopped pretty much, the nightmares faded except when stressed or triggered. It has however had lasting impact on relationships and my utter lack of self worth. I had been coping and recognising triggers and slowly getting better at preventing a full spiral into deep depression. 
Recently however I have experienced a massive shock and trauma and as it's raw still my logical brain is telling me the nightmares, the images, smells etc are normal as it's raw and it will get better. Except I'm struggling to believe this and terrified this new trauma will overwhelm me completely. I cannot shake the feeling of here I go again. Plus I'm petrified the historical stuff may rear it's head too. I'm on a waiting list for counselling, but as that's months away, I wondered if anyone else can relate and give tips to keep me grounded."
124,"I find myself wanting to end it all when I'm faced with improving my life. Can anyone relate?
My home's a mess because each time I decide to clean it up I feel deeply hopeless and suicidal. I never used to be this way.

I remember saying; 'I'd rather die than go through that again' during and after trauma. When I look back I see how I contributed so it scares me to feel motivated, ambitious or self focused.

It all feels too hard to 'try'. The end result is always the same. I get into strife. I survive because it's in me, but thriving isn't.

I don't even know why I'm asking."
125,"Hello


I'm new cause I have exhausted all options, just reacjing out of anyone knows anyone etc from Hertfordshire or Bedfordshire area, I need EMDR threpay but in person, face to face, but due to COVID no one is offering this, any help you guys can offer that would be great"
126,"I'm sorry if this is not the right place but it's the closest I could find this to fit in.

I got my social anxiety in 2008, which was one year prior to the final year in elementary school. In the final year it really got to me, I thought everyone hated me. Later that year my teacher asked if I wanted to go to the last school trip and be at the last day graduation thing. I said no to both of those things. Since then I've regretted it so much. It feels like I never finished that chapter in life. And elementary school classmates are something special, you grow up with them for 10 years and I have so many memories of that school.

Years passed and it's hard on me. Every dream has been about at least one of those classmates, and I mean literally 99,9%. And every now and then I dream of that last day, me being there and I always feel that sadness knowing we will all separate and go through our own lives on our own.

Now when I look on Facebook some of those classmates have their own children, some have married and all of them have a job and apartment. I have none of those.

It hurts so bad afterwards when I have a dream like that. I hate having this guilt but it keeps on coming. I can't go back in time."
127,"After having years of therapy over the r*** I went through, when I hear others say that some celeb victims are possibly liars, it is confusing and triggering. R*** is not a joke at all. Having PTSD, self harm episodes and trust issues for years are no joke. I hate being in a position where I don't know who to believe. It's so triggering and I understand why people don't talk about their r***, who wants to be known as a liar, no one does!"
128,"Hello,

I have some serious issues with being startled even when I was on medication.  I told my psychiatrist about it but now that I am thinking about it, I probably didn't use the right words.  I will be going back to the psychiatrist again soon, but am wondering how to cope with this if you have any advice.  I had a bad reaction to meds recently and it made it worse and more complicated.  Although I recovered for the most part I am still pretty jumpy when touched, approached, or if something deviant/ vulgar is said.

Today it is the worst it has ever been but I need more sleep."
129,"""I should have thrown you down the stairs years ago you little s***.""

This was the message I received from my older brother today.

You might ask; what did I say to make him so angry? I said Boris Johnson has not done a good enough job to contain this virus and disagreed that ""Boris Johnson is the only politician who can get us through this.""

This was an argument on a group whatsapp thread with my family (I live abroad so it was one of the ways we kept in touch with each other).

It's important to understand that this is the norm for my brother when I disagree with him. If we are in the same room he physically attacks, along with swearing and insults about my intelligence and he doesn't care that my family are there to witness it because they do nothing to stop it.

I am afraid to ever return home to see my parents for fear that he will try to kill me to hide the worst of the abuse he inflicted upon me as a child, the worst being the sexual abuse when he became a teenager.

A few years ago, I made my peace and forgave my parents for the ways they failed me and made a point to find the areas of life that they didn't fail me in. It is so much harder for me to forgive them for how my brother turned out and I don't really know how much of that I can put on them other than to say, that they should have waited a few years before having me, so my brother could finish his formative years and not be stuck where he is with the emotional capacity of a toddler.

Deep down I don't want to blame anyone for who they are, as not a single one of us signed up to be here and none of us have any control over the circumstances to which we are born into.

That being said; I am really struggling not to hate my brother for who he is and to not be angry with my parents/grandparent for their part in how he has turned out.

Ever since I was a child I've been a polymath and I like to talk about everything. My parents didn't support me in getting an education so I did that for myself and feel I have had to be mother and father to myself since a very young age. My mother has bipolar, my sister self harms, my dad belittled and insulted us growing up calling me stupid, weak and asking why I couldn't just think logically about things. I've since been in actual logic classes and read many books on the subject, (Cohen being my favourite) so as an adult it is evident to me that what my dad calls logic is not real logic at all and he only pulls it out when you disagree with him. Not when you are actually being illogical. Most dads would be proud to have a son who at 8 years old was talking about the sort of things I talked about, but my dad just saw me as an opponent to crush and exercise authority over and my brother copied that and it has reached the point where I feel like if I said something as simple as, 10 plus 10 equals 20, they would start to doubt that because I'm the one that said it. I've even witnessed it first hand where my dad or brother will agree with something I've said to them once but only because it was coming from someone else.

I'm really sorry that this is so long, but I need to vent. I am at my wits end and I'm afraid that I will probably never have the kind of familial support that many of my closest friends have had and take for granted.

Having to call the police on a parent for attacking you months after an extremely late Aspergers diagnosis is not something any child should have to do, but I've done it.

They treat me like I'm evil and that they are protecting the world from me, when all I want to do is be my pacifist self and contribute what I can to our collective moral progress through my work in ethics and metaethics, so that I can feel like I've done what I can, in the field where I can do my best, to make sure that fewer people have a childhood like mine or the ones far worse than mine.

I'll end on this: to anyone who feels like there must be something wrong with them to deserve the kind of treatment I've described from your family, the only thing wrong with you right now, is that you believe that.
You are not to blame and it wasn't your fault. No excuse is good enough for abuse. Remember that please and know that there is someone out there who loves you, will fight for you, will give their life for you and would jump into any fire to save you from it, if given the chance. Do not hesitate to contact me if you need someone to listen and empathise with you about absolutely anything. I won't give unsolicited advice, I'll just listen."
130,"I’m really frustrated because I’m exhibiting signs of ptsd but my psychologist isn’t listening to me and says “I MIGHT have some trauma” and in turn, I’m crying everyday for hours and no one will help me. I’ve basically been suffering for a long time. I was an alcoholic drinking everyday to numb the flashbacks and just recently have been trying to stop because I received 2 DUIs. 



This is exactly what happens:

I’ll be going through my day and someone can say something or I can see something on television and it’ll trigger traumatic flashbacks. I start crying uncontrollably and I’ll start re-living what happened 



I have flashbacks of me being put on an involuntary hold for a 5150/5250 at the same hospital that I INTERNED AT! My nursing school friends were there working at the same hospital! I was so humiliated! 



Then to make matters worse I ended up failing my last class of nursing school and had no way to pay for 180,000$ in student loans.



I have psychosis and I think I have ptsd from my psychosis episodes. 



I felt like when I started hearing stuff that I was going to die because I kept hearing these military helicopters and the military men telling me “Go back to the Philippines!” Over and over and over again. I felt like I was going to die because I was so confused with where this was all coming from.



I remember being so confused because I am a U.S. citizen and I was only a year old when I came to the United States and I don’t even remember anything about the Philippines. 



I was up all night for weeks trying to figure out where the voices were coming from. I was so confused I was basically trying to take apart cable boxes trying to figure out if the voices were coming from there.



I thought I was a targeted individual and that wearing leather jackets would somehow protect me, that these necklaces I found on eBay would stop the electromagnetic radiation, that wearing silver crosses would somehow protect me and my family.



I was so sick that during the 5150/5250 involuntary hold I refused to take any medication because I believed that the pharmaceutical companies were out to kill everyone because one of my last memories of before I had psychosis were of me studying about the side effects of medication.



my psychologist thinks “I might have some trauma.”



Is she joking?! She’s taking it so lightly when I feel like I really need help.



I feel like I freeze up during my therapy sessions and she doesn’t know the extent of the suffering. I don’t know what to do."
131,"When is my rapist ever going to get punished for what he has done to me? I have PTSD. Why do I have to feel big regret when I never wanted this in the first place? I did say no, I even blocked him because of a gut feeling but later unblocked him because I thought I was mean. I did say no, but my no was ignored by this rapist. Why was I unable to see that this rapist was going to mess my life? I feel like a loser, maybe I should have communicated louder about my problem with his rapist ways. I did communicate enough though, I am 100% sure of that, but this rapist ignored me every time, my voice and opinions did not matter. Why do I have to suffer for years ongoing when the rapist is getting away with it? 

I'm extremely upset by this. Worst regret of my life, he was a former classmate (not my actual friend, I hated him) who turned into a rapist and targeted me. When you have a former classmate who is a rapist it's confusing, it's like Stockholm Syndrome or Trauma Bonding. That's why it's hard for people to believe me. But I know I am saying the truth. 

After years I heard there was a major awful event that happened a few minutes from where I was raped, how horrible!"
132,"Hello! I'm new here and new to this diagnosis, and I am struggling a ton to validate myself. Just wanna preface this with a trigger warning for sexual assault. 

Long story short, when I was 4, a family friend (he was only 7) forced me into a closet with him in my own room, locked the bedroom door and made me do things to him  and vice versa. I remember feeling so disgusted and ashamed that I wanted to throw up. He then forced me into the bathroom with him next to my room, and made me watch him go to the bathroom, etc. There are some details I want to keep out because it's just too gross to say. But I do remember him telling me I can't tell my family, and he'll find out if I do. I was terrified and swamped with guilt. Eventually, I had a panic attack in school and confessed to my teacher, who told my parents. 

After that, it was all sorta brushed under the rug as ""children experimenting."" I ended up being diagnosed with OCD two years later because I was so anxious all the time. I repressed the memory for years, until I started to date. I never went to therapy for it until 20 years later because it was ALWAYS brushed off. But eventually, the OCD treatment (exposure therapy) made it worse, and I started having issues with intimacy and relationships. I'm 25 now, with a therapist who is treating me for PTSD. 

I am having so much trouble accepting this diagnosis, as I feel it couldn't possibly have been a ""big deal."" I feel like I'm being dramatic and looking for excuses as to why I'm such a mess. But I have every ""symptom"" of sexual assault, like fear of being alone with any guy, shutting down or feeling disgusted by intimacy, trouble dating because I never feel safe or interested enough. I've been battling depression and intense anxiety as well, along with a ton of other issues like anger, trouble focusing, binge-eating, drinking to numb the pain, and INTENSE guilt and shame. It is debilitating. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has been through this? It's such a unique experience, as it was with another CHILD, so I know it's not his fault. But why is it still affecting me to this extent? I feel like it's insensitive of me to claim I was sexually assaulted when so many others were assaulted by adults or had worse done to them. The guilt and shame are overwhelming.

If you made it this far, thank you so much even for just reading it."
133,Unsure what's wrong with me but I know my mind set has not been right since I found my mam on the morning she died dont know what to do even 3 years down the line
134,I'm having a lot of triggers.  I keep feeling like something terrible is going to happen.
135,"I don't know what to do. Everytime she is pregnant, if I disagree with her about anything that she is really angry about she says ""This isn't good for the baby and my blood pressure is spiking"" and its usually because she has said something extremely offensive toward all these different groups that she has imagined grievances with based on propaganda and she's just angry at them and I'm trying to calm her down, then she flips her shit and starts acting like I brought up the subject and keeps inferring that we are going to lose the baby and then accuses me of mentally abusing her because I don't share her anger toward whatever demographic she wants to target that day. She keeps saying I am not respecting her boundaries which seem to change with the fucking wind and yet I'm always the one left feeling violated while trying to get her to let go of all this hate and disgust she has for all these different ideologies. 

So her ex husband brought up Antifa a few days ago and she got really angry about that and because I corrected her and said its a movement, not an organised group she basically thinks im advocating for them and that I hate her and think she's racist when all I really think is that she just needs to read a fact checker so she cant stop feeling angry at what is a false narrative that doesn't help her.

I'm getting so tired of this now though. Every time she is pregnant, I feel like she blames me for the miscarriages because I can't seem to stop making her angry or making her anger worse when it isn't caused by me trying to put up a boundary so we don't have to have really horrible conversations about race, gender, sexuality. I am just so damn sick of the generalisations that are thrown out everyday and they seem to just come out of nowhere to the point where I am like ""How can someone be angry at so many different people all the time that they don't just explode?""

Btw, other than the miscarriage accusations, this is what she is like outside of pregnancy and I am at my wits end. 

I can't be her therapist and I know we are all going through a hard time right now but I am not responsible for my partners emotions and it is not my fault that she is so angry at all these different people. Even before coranavirus hit I've been getting scared to go out with this women because she seems to get into altercations wherever she goes, she was screaming at kids in line at a fast food place, I had to stop her from chasing a women down the street on the way to the ultrasound which I found myself uninvited to because I wanted her to calm down. Then there is the road rage, the other week she sped up when I told her to just breathe and count to ten. 

Whenever I bring up the anger problems she usually barrages me with a backlog of uncommunicated issues she has with me which seem to be many when she is angry and few when she is not. 

I love her for who she is when she isn't like this but it's tearing me apart and I feel like I'm losing myself in this relationship and that I'd rather die than leave her alone after she has been through so much shit. Runaway father and an extremely abusive mother. 

My partner in lucid moments gets extremely guilt ridden and ashamed of all of this behavior and she did used to be worse, we both did really and we have improved a lot as people by being together... I just worry that I can't weather the storm for much longer and I need her to have some kind of anger management breakthrough. We are both PTSD and on the autistic spectrum. 

The worst is when she directs that anger at herself, sometimes the things she says about herself would honestly make me hit someone if they had said it about her. It's like I love her but I hate the part of her that hates her.

Sorry for this long rant. I don't know if I even want anyone to weigh in but I needed to get it out."
136,"Hi, I’m wondering if you can help I’ve been referred today for EMDR  but believe the waiting list is quite long - I was wondering if anyone here has had it and what your experiences of it are ?

Did it work?"
137,"Hi everyone
Ten years ago I was in a bus accident that someone died in. I still have flashbacks. It was an accident but I feel guilty even though it was an accident."
138,"I first listened to Lakey Inspired (a hip-hop artist I discovered) during March. I went through horrid experiences early this year, and his tracks soothe me.

I suffered too much this January through March, and even worse in Spring.

My mother was suffering from delusional disorder. She believed that she was facing persecution from dark spiritual forces manifested in evil-minded people, despite there was none. She raged about it, and caused trouble. I went to the doctor to get help. He gave her Risperidone and Lithium to ease her anger and delusions. They seemed to calm her down, but she went back again.

She was so angry that she became alcoholic. That seemed to calm her down, but my doctor warned that could bring dangers.
He urged me not to have her drink alcohol.

I tried that for months. I tried telling her. I tried pouring the alcohol out into the sink. Nothing worked. There were times she never took her pills properly. I tried to force her for months, but it doesn't work. She was spiraling out of control and I couldn't stop it.

But my mind pushed me to push harder or else everything is over.

I suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I have been taking pills properly, but this situation scared me beyond limits.

From what I've learned from websites, you just worry about yourself if someone is not willing to receive help. But I can't. She might end up homeless if she spirals down the path. I feel like I have to do better in order to survive. Without her, I feel like I can't survive. I can get a job, who on earth is going to take care of her? There's a possibility that I can't get a job. Or won't make enough money. My father is exhausted, and cannot pay for her hospital bills if she gets admitted into one. And since I am an undergraduate from a college, I can't pay for our living expenses and her expenses.

But she recovered this July. We went to a different doctor and she took different pills such as Risperidone and Depakote.

But I loathe the memories of going through the park in winter, seeing dead plants and lifelessness. Add that with no people. Worrying about whether she would commit suicide, or commit harm. If that happens, my family would reject me and lose financial support. It's hard to get a job in South Korea. Although I'm an American, I came to South Korea for family support on finances and affordable healthcare. The taxes and healthcare costs are too high in US. So I'm stuck... 

I tried to listen to music. Nothing cheers me up. But there's one particular piece of music that led me to more misery and longing. 

I suffered from her for 10 years. It can fuck a person up. :panic: And after a few months later, his tracks bring me only pain. I have no criticism towards his music though.



When I looked at this track that Lakey Inspired released this July, it depicted him sitting in a flower field. This remembered the Spring of this year, walking alone in the park, flowers blooming, and enjoying none of it due to my pain. I was terrified. I suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. And looking after my mother without assistance fro 6 months (I had help in the past) can terrify anyone without the money to treat the person. I don't have enough money to hospitalize her. The doctors gave up on me (Thankfully, one of the doctors from the best hospitals helped us eventually). So I didn't know what would I do. I did make some wrong choices (such as going to a crazy pastor- I left her months ago) to get help.

But what pains me worse is, February was worse. I walked through the park with dead plants and no people- worrying about lots of things. Just loneliness and terror. It is the most torturous thing that I went through.



I tried to listen to variety of music (such as this weird Sailor Moon Orchestra). But they become torture to listen due to their triggers. Now I have not much to listen to. Plus, my future is uncertain. Although my father will take care of my mother after two years, but I cannot move away from them because there are no job opportunities. I major in Computer science, and it doesn't mean shit. Jobs are competitive in US, and it sucks. And here in South Korea, it sucks even worse! Don't know what to do..."
139,"So I have ptsd from a natural disaster, where I lost everything, was technically homeless, put on the news against my will, just a horrible time I never for-saw myself going through. Though I've had mental illness passed down to me it was mostly manageable and I lived quite an easy life.

It's been 7 months and I remember an object I lost every day still. I have ocd so I hoarded quite a bit as a teen so physical items were very important to me to say the least. Not only did I lose all of that but photos/videos as well. I feel like my childhood memories are slipping away from me. Whenever I think about that I feel like I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown and that I'm only delaying the inevitable by holding it in. My childhood was the best time, I've had issues being stuck there in my mind like I never should've gotten older. I used to age regress a bit as a teen, so basically those times are really important to me.

I've gotten a little delusional as well thinking this wasn't how my life was supposed to go, that I'll wake up and be in my old home. That I made too many wrong decisions that took me to an alternate universe and I want to go back.

I feel like I now have the symptoms of numerous other illnesses when before it was only social anxiety and ocd. Now I disassociate, I'm impatient and impulsive, will break into a sob out of the blue and surprise myself, how is this supposed to end when every day I'm reminded of it.

Idk what I'm asking for, I just don't want to go through a nervous breakdown like my family members have but I feel like its inevitable since I pushed down any emotions when it first happened. But idk if that's truly how it works."
140,"Hi, not sure if I have a problem but since having had major surgery and 5 day stay in hospital I often replay moments of it all in my head and it makes me feel scared thinking about what happened and that I never want it to happen again. I was scared stiff and had white coat syndrome to start with and never ever thought I would have to go to hospital, then aged 49 I had no choice. All went well, I had full hysterectomy and removal of massive tumour which turned out to be non cancerous thankfully. I have had no real pain and it was not a bad experience in hospital but one that I don't ever want to go through again. I can remember everything from getting up morning of operation through to when I fell asleep and then all from when I woke up after op. It makes me shiver at the thought of what happened. I have a long scar low as possible up past my belly button. I imagine myself laying on operating table and how it would of looked etc etc and it horrified me. I tell myself to shut up stop thinking of it. I am fine, it's all over and now I can carry on. Sometimes my scar freaks me out. If I think too much about it all it freaks me out. My bf tries to help by telling me it's all over and I am fine. He is fine with my scar. It was in October when had op. I was offered post op therapy by macmillan as they had treated diagnosis as probably cancerous, even though it turned out as not, but they still offered help. I panicked when they rang and offered help, I said but I didn't have cancer, I'm fine, I have my family to help. My first thought was oh god I got it wrong, I have got cancer and they offering help. I panicked. When I am not thinking about what I went through, everything is fine, I am happy, love my house and garden, loving bf and two cats, great family...... But then I go cold and scared when I think about hospital and my op. 
Do I have a problem or will I eventually let it go and not worry anymore??"
141,"Hello,
I had an online date with a guy who seemed very nice. at first. We started chatting and then he proposed to add me on Skype for a video call.
The conversation took a turn and became very sexual… At the end, he told me that he recorded me and if I didn't do everything he asked he would post the video on the internet.
I never showed him ma full face, but sometimes when I moved, we could see my face. He sent me screen shots after I hung up and I am recognizable…
He doesn't have my real name though.
He kept asking me to call him back after I hung up to finish ""pleasing him"". I got scared and I deleted my skype account (that I made with a fake name)
I am sick to my stomach, I am very scared that the video will leak.
He said he was in the US but he could be anywhere. I don't have his real name either, and I am not able to find him if the video ever leaks to press charges.
I am so scared… Am I in danger even if he doesn't have my real name? 
This is driving crazy, I can't sleep, I can't eat and I am so scared..."
142,"My psychiatrist has told me I have multiple traumas but I haven’t even spoken about them. It’s the first thing he said when I sat down in front of him. He diagnosed me with mixed states bipolar disorder and said once we have treated that he will treat me for ptsd. He wants to treat me with EMDR. 
I’ve had 40 rTMS treatments and my mixed states has gone, complete gone. Negative  emotions just slide off me.
Has anyone been told they have PTSD if they are unaware of it?"
143,"Hi to you reading this.

I'm seeking some help, and to try and find out if there are any techniques I can access to try and help me in my current situation. I better give some background as to why I am here.

In 2010 I met my partner, we had a very close immediate bond and he, very early on into the relationship, began to open up to me about his past and the years of abuse he had suffered as a child. Now, I had not lived a totally sheltered life up to this point, but some of the graphic details he has disclosed over the years are enough to turn the stomachs of the most hardened individuals. So, to hear it from someone that I love, especially 10 years ago when I was much younger, it was difficult to process. I have managed to over the years process any and all information released in his disclosures and it is not them that really effect me most. 
Over the 10 years we have now been together, he has taken numerous attempts on his life, through overdoses and self harming, consequently leading to many trips to hospital and 2 residential stays in a mental health unit, a few years apart. His PTSD diagnosis was given before we even met but the Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder was only given in 2018."
144,"Hi, I'm Michelle. I'm involved in three different support groups to get any help, advice, tips, knowledge, and ways to overcome mental/emotional trauma in my life. I don't struggle with PTSD, but do have trauma in general. I've struggled with this since I was a teenager and more so in my adult years. To me, trauma is trauma, no matter how big or small.

A lot of people say time heals all wounds, but I don't think that's been the case in my life. I think it just teaches us to live with the pain and acknowledge that it's real. I feel we just have to learn to cope with it. I already am doing certain things now, which includes journaling, reading positive & self-help books, as well as other positive things.

I tend to have several flashbacks from the emotional trauma and abuse I had dealt with for so long with toxic people. Now, I'm trying to work on myself as well as have somewhat of a normal relationship with someone more positive. But it seems everything's a trigger. He doesn't know what to say or do that isn't going to trigger a negative and automatic response, due to previous toxic and negative abuse. I still have a guard up and getting to know him little by little, and really taking things slow for myself. But, I tend to think anytime he says anything, it automatically makes me think of the trauma I had experienced and fear that I'm going to go through it all over again, and not sure how to stop thinking so negatively as if I'm living in the past. Not everyone's out to hurt me, and can't seem to think that no matter who I'm with, if that feeling will ever fade and accept that this guy is totally different, and learn to trust that there are good people out there. I'm so conditioned to the abuse and trauma that I'm used to. It's like the minute he does or says something a normal or positive way, I've heard it and felt it in a very toxic and negative way, and I automatically am on the defensive side.

So, how does one heal from trauma and toxicity, to feel normal and learn to trust that not everyone has a motive and out to hurt me? Will those negative thoughts ever go away? If so, how do you work on healing on the trauma and abuse, so I can feel normal and okay again?

Thank you."
145,"About 18months ago I started CBT to process childhood trauma. It helped alot with nightmares and to identify and cope with triggers. During the therapy I learned alot of my behaviours are due to the trauma. As to be honest, I never even considered it a trauma as such because it wasn't to the extent other people have suffered. Some of the behaviours I realized I developed as a way to cope, are things that ive always put forward as the best thing about me. Things that I've been proud of and now it feels like the best of me came from that person. And feels like I'd be nothing if not for him and it makes me feel physically sick."
146,"Five years ago, I studied abroad in Paris. I was 20. Months before I left for Paris I had an “almost relationship” with a guy who I thought would be my first boyfriend. I had never kissed a guy and was a virgin when I met him. I was hoping he would at least kiss me but during our six or so months of hanging out on and off (he frequently traveled for sports) we decided to stop hanging out for good after he got a contract abroad and I told him about my plans to leave for Paris. I was so devastated with how things went with him and how I got my hopes up that he would be the one to give me my “firsts”. This was summer time and my cousin went to visit me and my family, so I had to keep appearances that I was super happy when I wasn’t. I was depressed that whole summer and lashed out at family and just truly hated myself. My self esteem went down hill after that “breakup”. Determined to forget about him and prove to myself that I was going to get “experiences” in Paris despite my terrible self esteem, I gave my first kiss to strangers. I kissed a lot of people that night and regretted it but not as much as my first time having sex.

It was around the middle of the semester and I went out with my roommates to have drinks. We met these two guys and they said they were going to a certain club. A club that we have been to but we weren’t going to. So we went to a different club found it incredibly dull and decided to go the the before mentioned club that those two guys were at. My judgment was hazy and I found myself making out with one of the guys that we had met. I asked him how old he was he hesitated and said 28 which I realize now is a lie. We went to the hotel that him and his friend were staying at. This guys wanted to have sex with me. But I didn’t want to. So my roommate, who was with the other guys friend, and I booked it out of the room and they chased us and they sweet talked me back to their room and before I knew it, I was in the hotel room bathroom with this guy  and my roommate was in the bedroom. I didn’t want this guy to know that I was a virgin and I when he asked if this is my first time I said no. But it was. He had sex with me in the bathroom Post-sex which was awful, I bled my roommate had me get this guys digits, I got it, and I could tell it was fake. but I also wasn’t sure.

I left the hotel room with my roommate and I texted the guy later that week. He never replied.

Months went by and I didn’t think anything of losing my virginity to a stranger but when I think back at it, I hated my judgment and I can’t help but hate those guys. I keep replaying the moment in my mind and I want to cry. I was so determined to get rid of my “firsts” that I degraded myself."
147,"Hi!

For me it's taken over 25 years to finally discover my Complex-PTSD. A lot of hit had to do with me invalidating my own experiences and emotions - has anyone dealt with this too?

Growing up I had many medical hurdles which resulted in bullying causing my self-esteem to plummet. Then during my entire adolescence my parents' marriage deteriorated. I saw my mother being mentally and emotionally abused by my father and I had to step in and carry her through the separation process. Between all of this I was battling a lot of internal queerphobia which only got recently resolved too. (This is a very quick summary.) I feel like a lot of my childhood got robbed, especially my pre-teen/adolescent years.

But the thing about C-/PTSD... I still find myself comparing my experiences with other's. C-/PTSD is often associated with physical or sexual trauma, and in those fields I haven't experienced a lot - in other words, my trauma doesn't really stem from either of those. So I've always felt that my trauma is much 'lighter' than those who have had it worse because it wasn't overly physical...

Not sure if I'm making any sense but has anyone else experienced this?
Have you ever felt guilty about your trauma not being traumatic enough, therefore not seeking help?"
148,Can someone tell me their experiences with flashbacks because I've had a couple but this is only my 4th. I need someone to keep me pre occupied
149,"Hi, im new here and wondering what it is thats causing me issues at the moment. 

I had a really tough year last year. My brother unexpectedly passed away - we spent a week at his bedside whilst he was in an induced coma- but we never got to properly say goodbye. On top of that, i had my first child (amazing but also lifechanging and some very low moments) and my parents announced their separation after many years together. I feel like the whole fabric of my life has changed.

6 months later and im finding it hard to concentrate, im irritable and feel quite depressed most of the time.  But the thing that worries me most is ive become really preoccupied and sensitive to news stories about child abuse. Whilst i could just put stories like that to one side before, it now completely traumatises me and i spent hours awake in bed trying not to think about it and failing. I watched a Stacey Dooley programme a few nights ago where something like this was mentioned and i cried for hours afterwards. It makes my entire body tense, makes me feel sick and sometimes like i cant move.

Its now at the point where sometimes i look at my own child and horrible situations come to mind. I obviously dont want to think about it but i cant stop them and its really distressing.  

Whats wrong with me? Is it the trauma of last year? I dont have flashbacks about that and whilst i find it desperately sad i can stand to think about it rationally. Is it possible i have ptsd?"
150,"I was sexually abused by two members of my family over several years. I kept it quiet for ages, but when I spoke up I was called a liar by both of my parents and was blamed for anything that happened. I received no support from my parents, and still don't. My mother is definitely suffering from some mental health issues but they are not spoken about in the family. My father has been cheating on my mother, and created a new life for himself despite still living at home with us. They argue constantly, physically fighting a lot of the time. This has been the case for as long as I can remember. They have been neglectful parents in some situations but not awful parents. 

I used to have occasional nightmares about the abuse, but nothing like it has been recently. From the beginning of January until about mid March, I had severe nightmares every night, not always about the abuse, but always extremely vivid and frightening. Since then, they have not been as constant, but the fear of sleep still remains. Especially since I woke up one night paralysed, with someone staring into my room. A light was turned on outside my room a few minutes later to reveal no one was there, but it still terrified me. 

Just before coronavirus got really bad I had booked myself an appointment at the doctors regarding my mental health, and psyched myself up for it on the day, but it got cancelled as the doctors had to close as the virus worsened. I broke down at that point as it has taken me 4 years since my last doctors appointment to finally get the courage to speak about my MH again. I have moved back home from uni as well, and I can feel myself getting worse each day. 

I have constant thoughts about killing myself, not that I will, but I want to. I won't kill myself because I have a very supportive partner who has been helping me through this as much as he can, and when this lockdown is over I will be with him, instead of here. But I just want to stop feeling the way I do. I often think about breaking up with him in a horrible way so that he hates me, so then I can kill myself and no one else will be properly affected. 

As the weather has been warm recently, I've been wearing less clothes to sit outside in, and I've felt so uncomfortable. When I was 15/16 I was constantly told that was I was wearing round the house was inappropriate, I was usually in shorts and a t shirt. So now I feel like everyone in my family is staring at me. I feel so uncomfortable in my own home. I feel like everything I have been wearing is inappropriate, and that my previously abusive family members are perhaps enjoying me wearing less. It makes me feel sick.

I don't have anyone I can talk to properly about this, no one I know actually understands how much all the abuse from my family affects me every single day. 

I struggle massively with sex. I didn't used to, but I've worsened so much over the past year. Every time my partner touches me, I'm imagining my abuse family members. And I don't want to think of them when I'm trying to be intimate with the one person who believes me and cares for me. I freeze up a lot of the time and have to ask him to stop. Or let him continue but hate it the whole time. And I hate it because he deserves better than this. We're both so young, and he could be with someone with so much less baggage. This is another reason I give myself for why I should break up with him. So he can be with someone new, who can love him better. 

I just want to heal and move on. I wish I could forget, but I know that won't happen. I know people say that the first step is forgiving, but I can't forgive people who have caused this much harm to me, who still deny it happened, who carry on with their normal lives whilst I have to stay strong and try to stop my mind from thinking of ways to kill myself. I can't forgive family for doing this to me. It's ruined my trust and my outlook on all relationships. 

I'm terrified of my future, I'm scared to bring children into this world one day as they will share the same genes as my horrible family. I'm scared I will turn into my mother, in the ways she has not been supportive and has been emotionally abusive. I'm scared they will hate me for not letting them have contact with any of my family. Worst of all I'm scared they'll experience something like what I've experienced. 

Truth is with my mother is she is not at all awful, she was abused as well when she was younger, and she hasn't dealt with it, which is why she is the way she is. I don't mean to make her out to be bad, she's just struggling like me. 

I just need this lockdown to be over so I can go to the doctors like I had planned, so I can leave this house for good. 

Sorry if this all is a bit long, I am not one to go to my friends for help with things like this as I am the strong friend they come to with all their problems. I just want to heal from my childhood so I can finally begin my adulthood."
151,"Hello. So lately i’ve had to deal with frequent flashbacks of my abuse taking place. It’s become difficult for me to feel comfortable with even myself. And lately the smallest of things trigger a breakdown or panic. I find it difficult for men, such as my moms friends or even the AC repair guy, to be in my home some days because I feel fear of ‘what may happen’ I feel so lost, and I’m not sure who to lean on because i’m tired of feeling like a burden to the ones i love and it’s gotten to the point where i’d rather not talk to anyone than have them deal with my issues. I just want to feel comfortable with myself again, I’m tired of hating myself for something I know wasn’t my fault but I don’t know what to do. I guess i’m just asking for any advice, at all. How to deal with flashbacks, make them less frequent, or make me feel less panicked and afraid when they do happen. What had worked for you guys when it comes to handling these memories?"
152,"Has anyone here ever succesfully taken their childhood abusers to court? How did it turn out? I checked the legislation where I am from and there is no statute of limitations in cases of child abuse. So I could do it, I could try and get justice.

I just wanted to see if anyone else has been through this and ask what advice you could give going forward?"
153,"Came here to kind of connect and vent. Going a little stir crazy with covid19 stuff, anxiety very high. So far have read a lot here, responded here and there. Not really thinking about my ""issues"" (which is great). Ok, thinking and writing about the ""need a better job"". Anyway I have this very specific memory, I think we all have some. For some reason I have this recurring memory. We had been to the zoo, I was maybe 4? We weren't a family that went a lot of places, never to kids places, my mom would take me to movies she wanted to see.  Anyway, the zoo, we got home, I had this little stuffed bear, but not a teddy bear, like a bear on all fours, like a real bear. Dark brown, on strings with a little rod, like a marionette. We got home, like I said, I don't remember the zoo part, I remember the bear and knowing I got him at the zoo. There memory is always me with this bear standing on the sidewalk, down from the house and a short distance around a corner. This corner that was not developed, a little chunk of woods in this subdivision. Standing looking and trying to play with the bear, super focused on the bear. This just comes to me at times, but today, for some reason, I was THERE, I was the little girl, standing on the sidewalk across the street and just around the corner. I could still see my house, the Lutheran church was behind, me the bear, the bear, concentrating on the bear, and suddenly today, reliving that moment so vividly, being there, being that little girl, I now know what I was doing. The awful thing had happened again. I was not to complain, I was never to show emotion, I knew that at that age, I was trying so hard to be happy because I had the bear, they got me the bear, it's wrong to not be happy when someone gets you something like that, and DAMN my heart broke today for that little girl, like never before when remember the hard things that happened. Oh my god."
154,"hi all,

i want to understand from others how EMDR may impact you negatively.
I think its helped me a lot but concerned its now a barrier to my recovery given it keeps the brain churning memories and ""processing""

what are peoples thoughts and experiences?

I've been in recovery for six years (ACOA) and it's helped so very much in so many ways. I am seeing a lot of change in my relationship with students and colleagues, and even with my family. Where it hasn't had as much of an effect is with friendships, and after a painful breakup, I lost quite a few of my friends.

I now find myself alone quite a bit of the time, and I began to do some research into PTSD - and began to realize that this was me! Now that I have few friends and am now isolated due to Covid-19, I am experiencing more anxiety and flashbacks of old, unbundled emotions.

Any thoughts or help that someone could give would be greatly appreciated. I believe I'm a great person, but I'm so worried that I'm going to be all alone for the rest of my life...."
156,"I've been struggling to consistently take showers lately because the shower is mainly where my abuse took place and it is a really bad trigger for me. Somedays I am terrified to get in the shower because it brings me back to when I was abused. I specifically remember getting hair on my feet during the abuse so now whenever I get hair on my feet in the shower I get badly triggered. Obviously I need to shower but I am just so scared I never know when a flashback will hit. 

Any advice on how to overcome this?"
157,"Hi,
First post. Been married 8 years. Have two boys under 9. Wife suffered from a false positive ovarian cancer scare which caused months of scanning, probing, screening etc. She was a medical pin cushion.  During that time we had our hands full with family issues (her mother’s side), work and kids. A rough patch.  I noticed our sex life was dead and over a few months of counseling the therapist says she has trauma induced sexual aversion from this fiasco. 
So here I am. Led to believe she still loves me and wants to be married to me but she can’t even hold my hand.  I haven’t hugged my wife in 2 years yet we get along great. We love the same movies and music and have fun together.  But I’m dying for physical intimacy.  When this is brought up in therapy she becomes tense, frustrated and confused almost like “why are you pushing me for this, I don’t want to touch you and we don’t need to touch to be happily married”.  The therapist does a good dance of trying to walk the line between us.  
Regardless, I feel lost, alone, miserable and starved for affection. Figured id post to see if anyone has thoughts or similar experiences. One of my biggest rabbit holes I go down is the obvious: she simply doesn’t love me anymore and has no desire for me. We’ve now technically classified this as “trauma”. I don’t know if that’s me just being depressed but it seems like it might be the case, unless this touch/sex aversion is real. I’m lost.

158,"Hi everyone, so last year I was diagnosed with PTSD after memories of my dad sexually abusing resurfaced. It happened after my parents got divorced and I had sex for the first time. My therapist told me that my brain felt it was safe to release those memories because I was finally separated from my abuser and that my having sex trigged those memories/flashbacks. I had begun EDMR therapy but only was able to get through 2 sessions because I felt like it was a lot to deal with at the time (my school is very rigorous and stressful and I wanted to focus on my studies). At the same time I stopped the EDMR I met and began dating my ex-boyfriend. At first we really clicked and I thought that we were really falling in love. But then after about a month of dating, he started to show his true colors. He forced me to have sex with him multiple times, slapped and punched me, choked me, and belittled me any chance he could get. Experiencing this triggered my PTSD and I began experiencing more flashbacks especially in the instances when my ex would abuse me. After 3 months I finally broke up with him because my friends started noticing that something was off and that I wasn't myself anymore.  

I still am finding it hard to cope with the abuse from my father and my ex and often times I get flashbacks to both events. Just as I felt I was getting over the hump I was made a victim once again. I keep trying to get over the abuse from my ex but even just being in my room where the abuse happened is a trigger for me. I have nightmares of him hitting me and choking me.

Has anyone experienced something like this before? If so how did you deal with being abused again?"
159,"I realize I have been triggered by this whole coronavirus thing.

When I was a little girl,my Dad caught a virus and I was the only other person in the household that got it. My mom was pissed,was insinuating that my dad and I were having an ""affair"" and that's how I caught it.

I don't know of any other mother that would even think of something going on between a father and daughter as an ""affair"".I was a little girl!

It's really messed up. And although this whole caronavirus is scary and stressful, I realize it's this memory that's adding to my anxiety.

Just venting I guess..."
160,"I suffer from a lot of trauma stemming from intense childhood abuse. Due to my trauma, I not only hated my abusers but was indifferent to most people.

I've been practising mindfulness meditation for a year or so now using the Waking Up app. I started practising loving-kindness meditation (Metta) last night using the same app, and I think it does make one more compassionate. I also found research that this practice can decrease PTSD:

162,"I have dealt with a lot of death since 2017 and it has been really difficult for me to bare. I don't really want to go into the specifics right now. However, I had an unexpected death of my cat on April 1st ( I wish it was some sick twisted joke but it's not). He got cancer and had to be put down. It tears me up so much. I am absolutely crushed right now. I don't know how to deal with it except distracting myself with movies, reading, or video games. I just got a new therapist the same day and I feel really weird going into depth about it. it's nothing against her I just don't fully trust her. I don't know her. I am feeling completely out of my body and have had many anxiety attacks. my body physically hurts. I have just been sleeping, eating, distracting myself, crying...and the cycle continues. It is really embarrassing but I am really struggling with my hygiene right now. I haven't showered since march 29th. ( however, I have soaked in the bath but nothing else). A big reason I stop in the middle of soaking is that I start baling my eyes out or have a horrible anxiety attack.  I feel overly exhausted but I want to sleep all the time. I just want to curl up in a ball and escape. is anyone going through anything similar? any suggestions on how I can motivate myself?"
163,"Hey everyone!

I will tell you where it all started,,
I went to study abroad.
during the first day in uni i immediately started noticing weird stares and glaring from random students who don't even know me. However, some of my colleagues were really nice to me so i just ignored the crazy ones.
I was a very nice person when i first started medicine I wasn't judgmental, arrogant, or mean. Funny despite being a medical student I'm not even competitive and I don't care about being in the spot light like many med students.
So I wasn't quiet sure what made so many students here despise me before i even got a chance to open my mouth. maybe they were suspicious of me due to my foreign looks.

anyways, during orientation week i got lost and asked random students about the way.they didn't even care to hear the name of building i was asking about they just turned me away so rudely and glared at me.
almost everyday in this uni I was harassed, glared at, even bullied in some instances. I kept ignoring it everyday and tried to focus on the good things and the good people in my life. but year after year as i grew stronger so did the harassment.
I tried my best to keep a positive attitude until I couldn't anymore I reached a breaking point specially after breaking up with my boyfriend. I struggled with concentration and studying I scored so bad in most exams, i was too afraid to go to uni or leave my home cause i also get harassed very often in the streets. I was working so hard and doing the best i could but unfortunately i failed one subject, the test was oral and the doctor was so rude and told me i was a bad student. when i told students about the questions i got and my answers, they all said he doesn't like the country i come from and many students tried to complain about him in the past.
after this incident things kept getting worse, there was this one student who said things about me that weren't true to one of my classmate then she and her friends turned against me, it really hurt my feelings because i really liked my classmates i was confused at first i didn't know why they behaved like that, but then i realized that dumb student heard a story about the crazy girls who gave me troubles in elementary school and through gossiping my classmate thought i was talking about her WTF!
i tried to put all this behind me and start new and fresh in the new academic year but my mental health is still the same, although i don't cry almost everyday as in the past but now I cannot trust or love anybody in this uni, i lost faith in my colleagues and doctors, I'm constantly waiting for who is gonna do the next move to hurt me, I have crazy thoughts my future teachers which I didn't meat yet will fail me just because they're not gonna like me, and I have no motivation to study anymore.I will be senior next year and I'm so stressed and anxious, I lost hope. after regular harrassment i feel so ashamed of myself and I don't want anyone to see me, I wish i could cover my face or go invisible, I can't stand being in a classroom with my colleagues i constantly feel they're judging me and want to see me miserable.
I'm so worried I want to start believing in myself again.

I also used to have so many flashbacks about all the harassment I went through. could it be PTSD?? I'm not sure what is it I'm going through.
When I first arrived into this country I couldn't speak the language well But I could undertstand few words.
Most of the Harassments I experiences were:
 
- Verbal threats (yelling at me to leave their country and I'm not welcomed there)
- insults and racist jokes (they will often look me down and laugh loudly at me and try to make me feel little, just like in TV shows -_-)
- there was one incident a woman randomly pushed me and glared at me
- one time I took public transport and everyone on the bus glared at me I though I was gonna be attacked but good thing I was leaving the next stop
- many times people will skip me on purpose in lines
- people ask me rudely to move on if i didn't notice them and blocked their way
- people always made me feel like I'm polluting their country, they look at me as if I were the devil :(
- one time there was this creepy man who was talking nonsense and touched my hand in the bus I felt uncomfortable and tried to move away and I noticed some girls in the bus looked at me like I was a s*** (I'm against shaming women and using such words but I couldn't find a better way to describe the look in their eyes)
- one time a man randomly yelled ""Wh***"" at me 
- some teachers in school often treat me differently than my colleagues 

and all that just due to the fact I'm a foreigner here.

I wonder if this is something many people experience when they are abroad or is it something wrong with that place I'm in. 
I know I'm not perfect but I strongly believe there is nothing noticeably wrong with me either, I manage to make friends with good people, I'm not rude to anyone, I try to keep a straight face in public and don't stare at people for no reason.

I just want to know how to cope with such a thing, it's insane!!!!


sorry I didn't mean to make it too long"
164,"Hi everyone,
I just joined this forum.  Its so hard for me right now with all the isolation.  2 of my really good friends have let me down which leaves me totally solo.  My PTSD really flares up in times like this and i'm so frightened of being alone."
165,"it's been awhile since i've posted on this website but i've found myself here again. i am 21 years old dealing with depression, anxiety, ptsd, and borderline personality disorder. i'm also a trans guy. my ptsd is the main mental illness that interferes with my life and bpd is second.
basically ive been sexually assaulted more times than i can even understand.
i feel embarrassed and ashamed almost because i cant sit through a lot of movies due to their violence. i feel bad that i can't handle anything more than a part time job right now.
i mean im managing okay. all i do is sit in my parent's basement smoking weed, working a little and making enough to get by.
i guess im just feeling like it's hard to make connections. i have friends but im constantly searching for something more. 
it's always been hard for me to feel passionate and focussed on one thing. i want to find my purpose in life but i don't know where to search.
i feel like i'm losing my mind sometimes because i can dive so deep into my trauma exposing myself to triggering material and self harming and aaah i dont know
a close friend of mine talked about running off from society and joining a commune. and hell, i wouldn't mind that. it'd be nice to get away and have an experience like that for like 6 months. given i can leave when i want haha. 
i guess i just want to know if anyone's out there who relates or wants to chat. i could use some virtual company"
166,"I am trying so hard to be positive and productive and to start over but this person was abusive to me because they didn't like my message of love and compassion for some reason and I am triggered and spiralling downwards because of this (reminded me of abusive ex boyfriend) and I feel like people just want to drag me down into their own hell but I am going to find a way to rise about them and their bullshit.

I feel used and abandoned and like my worst nightmares are coming true but I also know this is just in my head and it's just PTSD from abuse and neglect earlier in life...

I have been trying to spread positivity but I feel like I am doing all the heavy lifting in relationships.

It feels like crabs in a bucket where the crabs try to pull each other down instead of helping each other up."
167,"Hi everyone, I hope you are all well and feel comfortable to talk about things during the current situation! Here if anyone needs to talk.

I wanted to start this forum to see if anyone has felt like me. I was sexually abused from the age of 5 until around 8 years old. I have not disclosed it to loved ones and I began counselling in October to begin the very much solo journey of processing my past.

Before counselling, I was fully aware that I have no sense of self-achievement. Gaining a degree, was just something I did and so was learning to drive. But I have now come to realise that I am so disconnected from my life, that I am emotionless. Without being aware, I built up a coping strategy of shutting down. I now have a strong habit of shutting down feelings, emotions and opinions. I am a people pleaser and I go with whatever in fear of rocking the boat.

How do I break this habit? How do I begin to 'feel' again?

Thank you!"
168,"Hi all, my mom passed away very unexpectedly when I was 16 (I’m just 21 now) I have agoraphobia, ptsd and bpd. I haven’t left my house since January Ha been on a downfall, and now everything is happening with the pandemic I am not doing good. My dad who has COPD and I’ve non stop been anxious about him falling ill since my mom passed, he has been having violent nose bleeds for 3 days and this morning I woke and saw a jug of blood next to him and bloody tissues, he looked weak, I completely freaked out and went back to the time I saw my mom lifeless on the floor, I had hours long episodes of throwing up, flashbacks and diareha, instead of being able to help and comfort him. He called 111 and they said probably just head cold and not to worry as it’s not coronavirus!  however I can not help but think the worse, I know it’s probably not corona but it could be anything as he is in his 60s and has diseases, drinks and smokes alot. The doctor came out to my mom 3 days before she passed and told us she would be fine.  How can I ease this for me and him? Any help or support  would be amazing as my family live far away and we barely speak. I don’t have a clue what I would do. Thank you for reading 💜"

170,"New recent flashbacks of sexual abuse. Not sure how to process these as it kept coming back. Hours trying to calm down to no avail oftentimes. Extremely intense. My adoptive grandfather and his wife. Yes I have a female body and even females did molested me and not just males.

I was a little child and innocent. He would fondle my flat breasts and rape me daily. The woman, his wife would tell me she’s teaching me sexual knowledge and that I need her and to rely on her all the time. She told me I have no sexual knowledge  so she would teach me how to overcome my trauma of sexual abuse. She said I’m so deeply wounded by the abuse that only a re-enactment would help. They lusted at my traumatised positions and innocence. He was stroking my heart and said he liked my beautiful innocent heart. I kept having fragmented memories but these are the main ones kept popping out these days.

So this adoptive grandfather was raping me daily with the other adoptive father over me. Gang rape me. They did it daily for at least 2 decades of my life. Even as an adult I regress as a little child. As adult I regress as a teen sometimes. The trauma caused me to be a child at age 24 currently."
171,"Does anyone feel similair when it comes to trusting people who are very close?
I have a ""paranoia"" part in me which never trusts anyone, who analyses people and who spots inconsistenties, untruthfulness and disloyalty. When it does I completely shut myself off for these people and I believe that these are genuine thoughts..... It's very toxic but I am not sure if this is the right thing to do, it's obviously protecting me. 
On the other side there's a part who has good friends and believes them to be loyal, useful and genuine towards me, but this part is so weak that it mostly loses to the paranoia. 

This makes me feel both very sad that I push my friends away and they don't deserve it, but also good because I have the feeling that the paranoia is making the right decision to protect me.  
I am completely clueless in what to do, I cannot explain this because they will not understand and I will be ashamed. 

On the other hand I have done quite bad things for this paranoia like stalking, analysing and manipulation to see if people were loyal and how these people worked. I can also get severe panic attacks when friends contact me or message me.

I am still not sure what's causing this all and my therapist says I should just use medication...

I have the feeling that I am not made for friends and am worthless in that effort, I don't know what's going on and don't know what to do. Can anyone relate or have a similair situation?


all the best <3"
172,"I am a 24 year old homebound agoraphobic. I am unable to leave my home and I live with my parents. Most of the time my parents are gone for work all day so it isn't much of a big deal. however, since the whole COVID-19 pandemic they have been forced to stay home. My teenage years were really chaotic, abusive, and toxic. I ran away when I was 18 and returned when I was 19 to get out of an abusive relationship. Right now I am just trying to manage my agoraphobia. My parents do not make me pay rent but they are toxic. My dad has a really bad anger problem.

Anyway, I have two old cats that have IBS. They have a lot of bathroom issues. It'sad. I am working on getting the right treatment for them. They tend to make a lot of messes. They wear diapers but sometimes they chew them off. One of mine chewed his off this morning and my dad tried to put the diaper him. However, he got really mad ( because he has really bad arthritis in his legs) and he bit him. I heard him screaming and shouting and I woke up. He was yelling at me saying "" You never do anything"" and he was also yelling at my mom. There was a mess on the carpet and it was difficult to see because our carpet is brown. I told him that and he gave me a death glare saying "" DON'T TALK TO ME!"". After that He threw my two older cats in the garage. I was fine with that for 5 minutes or so. After that my dad had to get something from the garage and one of the cats was trying to get in the house and he kicked him really hard in the face with his foot. I got really pissed off and ran over to him to say "" DO NOT EVER KICK MY CAT!"" then I preceded to pick up my cat and go downstairs. My dad ran downstairs and blocked me saying "" No he will go in the garage. This is my house!"" then he grabbed my cat out of my hand and put him back in the garage. I told him firmly ""DO NOT KICK MY F**** CAT! THAT IS NEVER OKAY!"" Then he started to gaslight me by saying/screaming at me "" YOU'RE A LIAR!"" ""YOU'RE CRAZY!"" ""YOU'RE A NUTJOB!"" ""YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE D**** HOUSE!"" ""YOU'RE A MENTAL CASE"" ""YOU'RE RETARTED!"" those are exact words he used and was screaming them at me and yelling at my face getting spit on me. He looked like he was going to punch me in the face. My mom actually grabbed him and told him he can't say those things.  Normally, I would cry but I feel so numb at this point I am not even able to cry. It just hurts. I wish he wasn't like that. I love me dad but I will never forget the words he uses. I really wish he was at work most of the day. I don't know how I am going to get through this. Is anyone else going through a similar issue? I am not scared of him because I am used to it. He has not been violent to me since I was under 18 because I have threatened him with the cops if he did. However,  I will be keeping the cats in my room with their food because I don't trust him. I am severely agoraphobic and trapped by quarantine. I'm stuck."
173,"I have C-PTSD and have two of my abusers in my life still. Both family members. Both were emotional abusive with aggressive outbursts. Both have been physical with me before. 

One is still extremely angry and when they're angry they want everyone to know. Their body language alone when they're like this sends me spiralling. 
Their anger doesnt even need to be directed at me. 

I dont live with either of them but do need to be around them from time to time. The angry one more than the other. 
How do I deal with this? Because I'm at the point where I want to vanish to avoid it all."
174,"I recently realized that I have c-ptsd...and my therapist confirmed.

I have always disassociated when reminded of my trauma and somehow thought it was normal but now I am realizing that it's happening because multiple assaults and abusive situations were too much to handle for me.

I guess I am going to have to learn to feel my feelings? It's a scary thing...

Anyone else become overly intellectual? unable to enjoy physical intimacy? stuck in the mind?"
175,"I'm madly in love, don't get me wrong

But I feel so broken from being raped, from the sex abuse, from all the times I was taken advantage of. He knows I've gone through all this, we've had situations where I've started crying because of my fears and memories. I want to have sex with him, I know I want to have sex, but why am I so scared?

In fantasies in my head or while we just talk (currently LDR), I'm relatively fine and I can do just about everything; but the second I try to put reality into the mix I get scared. I don't want to seem broken, I don't want to make a mistake and I don't want to disappoint my partner.

He's so patient with me and he knows it will take time, but I don't want to cause a problem because I'm broken, I don't know anymore, I've just been feeling guilty as of late."
176,"Hi,

Sorry if this turns into a long post.

I have just started seeing a new therapist.  I have four sessions so far including the introductory visit.  I have previously been diagnosed with depression as a teenager and with GAD in my 30s (I am now 40). 

However, recently I had been reading a lot of literature around trauma as a I feel all my mental health problems stem from traumatic events in my life.  When I was 14 I was raped.  During my 20s I was in an abusive relationship with a man who abused me physically, emotionally and sexually.

I had explained all this to the therapist during the initial visit and said that I thought perhaps I had a form of ptsd and was mainly concerned about episodes I have been having in which something will trigger me and I will literally ""fly off the handle"".  An example is recently me and my (extremely nice and supportive) hubby were having a disagreement and something in his face just turned him into my abusive ex.  I ran into the kitchen and started smashing all the plates and hurting my hand.  Ended up on the kitchen floor balling my eyes out.  During these episodes I get a very weird sensation of watching myself from the outside and thinking how stupidly I am behaving but I can't stop myself from acting.  I hope this makes some kind of sense?

Anyway at my last session my therapist asked me to explain what I meant by a flashback.  I told her the above and she proceeded to tell me that what I am experiencing is only a memory and not a flashback.  She said something about just because I am being triggered to remember it doesn't make it a flashback.  She also said if it was a flashback then it would be a fragmented memory.  Basically she has told me that my problem is ""just"" anxiety and not PTSD because if I don't have flashbacks I don't have PTSD.

I have already had treatment for anxiety in the form of CBT and I feel like I've probably got all the coping mechanisms for it I'm ever going to get.  It is the episodes (which I thought were flashbacks) which I really need to address because I feel so out of control and I feel like I might really hurt myself or someone else and even worse my children have seen me behave like this!  If they really are just ""memories"" and there is no way of adapting my behavior then what is the point of going to therapy at all?

I'm just feeling a bit downhearted as I was feeling at least a bit positive about going back to therapy but now I feel as though my problems have been minimized.  Especially with her calling it ""just"" anxiety.  Anxiety is pretty crippling anyway without having these out of control episodes.

Anyway sorry to ramble on.  ANy advice would be greatly appreciated."
177,"Just a shout out as many here can relate I'm sure. 

I have been triggered for the last 10 days relating to hopelessness about the future and previous family neglect. I've had EMDR around 18 months ago and remember being taught a safety place and sign but never had to use in in reality. 

Its taken me by surprise and has lasted for days. Cry for hours. Lots of very nasty intrusive thoughts both about my past actions and how this relates to future. Up all night with thoughts, can't enjoy watching TV shows I like. 

Ringing duty team 5 times in the last fortnight. Hate that, they think (I think) its because of the sessions ending but actually its being triggered so badly so hard. Its not just another BPD person calling (thankfully don't have that as an diagnosis). The triggering is very much like a physical illness, with tummy ache, dioreha, insomnia. Went to aldi to buy chicken and peppers which I did get, but no toilet roll due to panic buying. The supermarket felt busy and chaotic whereas usually I could go without batting an eye. I'm irritable and it feels like my nerves are frayed. 

Finally went to the GP today and got some quetiapine to take at night 75mg. Have taken it with a shot of vodka and finally can feel my head slowing down. Did well to do that as the GP surgery closes on Monday due to coronavirus. It is helping but I feel guilty for taking it as it affects the processing. 10 days was a long time to sit with being triggered and I was tired and fed up.

The shame just flooded my mind thinking about the past and I noted how quickly my thinking got muddled

I'm supposed to be getting better at mentalising and I tried, but don't always feel I really understand what it is

If anyone says they are having a rough time because they got triggered, I get it, I really do. Never did I truly understand it before"
178,"my ptsd is something  i am reminded of the trauma
everyday 
it affects how i communication with family
if a family  is moody  in any way 
i immediately  put my defensive up when being confronted 
ptsd is something  i suffered
i vomited and passed out at the  trauma site during  that time 
i am now in 40sish and the ptsd is something  i see that trauma being keep repeatedly 
I get  angry in act of preservation realizing its wrong for me to get mad 
that is why  i get sick when I am  forced to see such aggressive and whining and complaining by the family member everyday 
ptsd is part of anything  that is distrubing
I also  see ptsd everyday at my daily communte bus where i see homeless throw their  bad temper
i get scared.
not happy"
179,"My PTSD is a long story that I don't feel like getting super in depth with right now. 
I've been having severe flashbacks to the point of self harm and self esteem issues. I hate myself and everything is my fault. I screw up everything. 
My ex was very abusive. He would say things like I'm useless or that he's only dating me because no one else will. And you know what? I full heartily believe that. He said it so many times that it's actually drilled in my brain. 
I am dating someone else now but I bet he feels the same way. 
I just want the pain and suffering to end. I need help. The medicine kind of works, the therapy helps but not when I can only see them once a month, the grounding techniques work to an extent. I'm just so lost right now."
180,"I was involved with abuser A for 40 days straight in 2008 from July to August. He was being nice to me, by giving me wealth and possessions, when another part of me took over and I discovered he was making a deal with me. 

His deal was subtle. His words were tender. He told me he loved me. Another part of me took over, was when he raped and molested me.

I graduated from a bachelor degree in architecture back in 2017, May 24-25. That was another part of me.

I was 21 years old. I believe the victim will be esteemed soon. I had nothing left in my life, but that is when I will have everything back.

It was the same date May 24-25, 2015 when I have traveled to 4 different places without him finally. I was having a bit of relief on my own.

3 days before that time, I was being molested by groups of abusers. I was video recorded of being raped and they were accessing those records for their own sexual gratification. 

I have DID alters. The actual time should have fitted 3 days ago, despite 3 days after. My alters do remember things in time warped manner.

3 years ago from 2020 was 2017. That was going backwards when before I was first hospitalised in the psychiatric ward. My parts look backward and I’m forward looking.

Back in 2017, the groups of abusers were travelling from Egypt to Israel.

I was sacrificed of blood, being ritualistically abused by them and now I understand what’s going on."
181,"Hi there, I have just found the forum after trying to find a solution to my hypervigilance for several years.

It first developed when I got told my mother was dying and I was also going through a house purchase at the same time. I started having panic attacks whilst driving to the point where I stopped driving completely after a few months for fear of injuring myself or someone else. 

Although they told me my mum was dying, it turned out that they had misdiagnosed her and she was just 'seriously ill'. However I then lost by best friend to cancer in less than a month and then 9 months later my mum did pass away.

This is when even being a passenger in a car became traumatising, literally at every side road or junction I'm convinced that a car is going to plough into us, that the other driver hasn't seen us etc. I'm constantly on the look out for potential hazards coming up. I was on a train going on a viaduct (that I'd been out several hundred times) but suddenly looked down and realised how high it was to the motorway below and so now that train journey is out.

I really want to get back to driving but it scares the wits out of me. I've tried hypnotism, speaking therapy, one session of EMDR but nothing is really touching the sides. Has anyone tried with success to overcome them hypervigilance? I feel like it's a button I've switched on in my brain but I can't switch off. Even in a taxi I jump at everything to the point where one driver told me I was mentally ill and was going to cause an action. It's making my world become very small. I get a lift to and from work off my husband, but I'm still a hot mess on a daily basis."
182,"Okay so when I was younger I was sexually abused by my older sister. We aren't very far in age and it was before I realized that it was not normal. I almost did the same thing to my younger sister as well. I won't go too deep into detail. Has anyone gone through something similar? If anyone has been through something similar, I'd like to know how you have dealt or are dealing with it?"
183,"I had my assessment for CMHT therapy today. Major achievement in that she proposed that my diagnosis should be Post Traumatic Stress Disorder rather than the Borderline Personality Disorder.

I don't know if this will be made official, but I have to say AT LAST. This is like the first time properly that someone in the NHS has actually listened deeply enough to recognise what has been the case all along.

You are welcome to share my relief and joy at this.

I mean, I know PTSD is tough, and I don't 'want' it, but I've always wanted to have things correctly identified and treated accordingly."
184,"My abusers have killed me and I have survived, during early childhood. They have used the overclocking method, via mind control programming, of one of the modes. It was a physical death and not psychological dead alters, associated with dissociative identity disorder, which is different. I have died once, had NDE, which is near death experience.

I was being inflicted of extreme physical ritual abuse by my abusers mercilessly, in multitude of ways. They derived great pleasure through my suffering without a cause, as I did nothing wrong to them. I termed it “extreme”, because most of what was inflicted upon me was life-threatening. I was deeply moaning in pain."
185,"I have had it up to here with people who want you to always be happy and positive because they are deadly allergic to being authentic, which means sometimes feeling a way that seems ugly.

The background: I was raised in violence, partnered for safety and got more violence, pursued a career I didn't like and wasn't my calling but I needed for me and my daughter to be safe from abusers. We had a car accident that totaled our just paid off car, then a catastrophic one a year later that nearly totaled us. Both not our fault.  I coded twice and my daughter spent her senior year alone waiting to hear that her mother was finally dead.

She has deep and complex trauma from a lifetime of pain and abuse and I have many broken bones (healed crooked), damaged or discarded organs, scars everywhere, and a traumatic brain injury. We lost most of our friends, our finances, our future, my plan to finally get the master's that would put my on the career path of my calling and nearly our home.

It got so bad I attempted to kill myself, which destroyed her even more. To my defense, the brain injury caused significant impulsivity and personality change. I am now properly medicated after having admitted myself 2 times for severe depression with everyone fully aware of my brain injury and the gold standard treatment for it: lithium.

I have made remarkable recovery and I appear as if there is nothing wrong with me. I was a writer, dancer, fitness pro, artist and more. After the crash I had to learn how to speak and swallow again, not to mention everything else. Feeding tube, colostomy, tracheostomy, splenectomy, ostomy reversal which may have been the most excruciating thing because of the 2 hours of scar tissue removal they had to do before the surgery started.

But early on, I won a human spirit award from my rehab facility and people have said I'm the poster child for strength and inspiration. They rely on me to be crushing it all the time because they need that role model because they feel better being among exceptional people.

My friend texted me to see what I was up to today and I told her I stayed in because I was uncomfortable and said other things to let her know I was unavailable. She asked why I was uncomfortable so I told her I have pain every single day but I don't tell people because it won't help me or them to know or harp on it. 

She wrote back ""way to keep positive and not focus on that and keep moving forward"". And that's all I got, despite the ""role model"" and ""inspiration"" that she says I am.

She doesn't let me say more than a sentence or two of the things that trouble me as a disabled, pained, brain injured single mother and head of household. But she goes on endlessly about her need for a boyfriend and ""why not me?"" talk when comparing herself to siblings who are all married.

She is supportive enough so I remain in friendship. But when I get pollyanna advice that doesn't acknowledge the enormous burdens I still carry while listening to her troubles with compassion, I want to end the friendship. I am dealing with multiple lawsuits, a PTSD violent kid, my own emotion dysregulation, Medicaid, disability, and an attempt to work which makes disability a complicated mess, I just started driving again after two years, and I'm grieving about my brain-injury-driven dysregulated behavior I am now beginning to remember that I conducted. I spent my whole life (45 years) doing the right thing, dedicated to keeping my chin up, and blah, blah, blah. I was literally broken open, have no help, have significantly more difficulty than most people and am actively abused by an adult daughter and it's not her fault. It's trauma and she has no one else.

I am afraid all the time. I'm angry a lot, and I am a lot less able to keep a lid on it now.

I want to say to my friend: don't even suggest we are the same in any way. That I lived, alone, floored everyone. That I'm forcing myself to recover my brain, body, and personality is probably divinely guided.

She can put her happy happy joy joy where the sun doesn't shine."
186,"I'm having EMDR and would like to know other peoples experience. I really don't think it is for me. I don't know if it is the actual treatment that's not working or whether it's my psychologist not doing it properly. ( I always feel she is cutting corners but that could be just me) 
I couldn't get on with following her finger so use buzzzers. I just don't see how this helps do anything. I felt nothing but numb the first session of processing and the following session I did feel but holding rhe buzzers didn't help in any way to relieve anything. I know this treatment is my last change to get better, particularly as this is on the nhs and I know I wont be offered any other treatment."
187,Hi all I look after my daughter who has PTSD after being abused from the age of 6 to 8 she is on vensir and serquel but is drinking very heavily since Christmas she is now 19.  I am very worried about her she says she is drinking due to very disturbing nightmares and wishes she was dead all the time drunk or sober.  She has been getting mental health treatment since she was 14 but I think she is having a nervous breakdown.   She has agreed not to drink going forward but I don't know how to help her she is suffering terribly I had to persuade her to take serquel today as she is getting no sleep and also stashing beer in her room.  She is not an alcoholic as I have seen her drink moderately in the past.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
188,"In 2000 I lost a leg due to motorcycle accident. My boyfriend at the time didn't have major injuriues. He was driving motorcycle. My femur was also broken in half. This was 20 years ago and I am still angry. I am angry that my boyfriend went on to have this fabulous life after we broke up and I sunk into severe drug addiction. I had my son who saved my life. But I used to mountain climb, kickbox, etc and my life literally got ruined. I feel like half a person, broken, defective, ugly, and useless. I am overweight because of menopause but cant exercise easily. I just feel so helpless and hopeless. My body is mutilated and that will never change."
189,"Hi all,
I'm looking for support and to know if this is normal or not. I am a female living in New York. I went yesterday for my first ever full body massage. I am going through a lot right now and I carry all my stress in my back so I wanted to de-stress. I chose to do a 60 minute full body massage. I got fully undressed including my underwear as I thought that is the way it is done. I waited 10 minutes for the masseuse to come in. She came in and covered me in a blanket and began the massage. After a half hour she began massaging my thighs and then mumbled something, went out of the room and before I knew what was happening the blanket came off and she asked me to turn over. I did so and she put a warm wet cloth by my vaginal area and then began giving me a vaginal massage, massaging my clitoris and making me orgasm. She also caressed my breasts and nipples. I didn't know what was happening and was so uncomfortable but didn't know how to say no this isn't what I want. When she began doing this I totally dissociated. I feel so violated.  Maybe I gave off the wrong vibes that this is what I wanted? Did anyone ever experience something like this? Did they think I wanted a happy ending? I'm so confused as to what happened... Love and support appreciated..."
190,"I left him about a month ago.  I've been having a lot of flashbacks and nightmares.  
I see a therapist and a psychiatrist.  I'm being treated for CPTSD, major depression and panic disorder.   I'm on meds for depression and anxiety.
He was physically, mentally, sexually abusive.
I'm terrified of him.  He said (lots of times) if I left, he would find me.  He made all kinds of terrible threats.  I'm scared to leave my home."
191,"Hi there, 

I just wondered if anyone had an experience of trying to recall a trauma in childhood. 

I am now in my 20's and have recently started getting flashbacks about an event when I would've been around 4-5 however the memory is not complete and therefore I feel really confused. Is this a true memory? something has always been there but its like my mind is now trying to give me hints. I feel like I cant trust myself... have I made this up in my head as others have been suggesting. 

I have a complex history of mental health and have diagnosed depression, anxiety, BPD and PTSD for a separate event (or so I thought). 

Its really started effecting me recently, when I manage to grab some sleep I have dreams and some are so bad I end up wetting myself which is embarrassing to admit. During the event in question I have a clear memory of a particular children's film being on in the background and when this has come on in my adult life it brings on a panic attack or makes me vomit and I cannot even stomach seeing it or the characters in it. 

I just feel very confused, I have been put on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist and told I will likely be put on a waiting list for EDMR and its and the list is 8-12 months long. 

If anyone has any information I wondered if they could reply or message me, its very complex and I don't know if I can trust my own brain anymore!

Thanks
C"
192,"Hi everyone so I don't know if that really belongs here but I'll just get started. If there are any grammatical mistakes I apologise but I really need someone to talk about it. This might TRIGGER so please be aware of that..

I've never experienced real love. When I was young my mother abused me and my siblings physically, she beat us kicked us while we were crying and begging her to stop. This went on for almost 7 years until we stood up against her and it actually helped but the trust was broken forever. Another significant experience for me was when my older brother abused me sexual. I was horrified that he would do it again and told my mother about it, but she did NOTHING. Even worse, when I started acting distant and cold towards that brother, she told me I was ruining the family with that behaviour. I had to live with that man for almost 5 years until he finally moved out. In those years I felt like I didn't matter at all. I even questioned myself, wondering if I was wrong, even tho I KNEW I didn't do anything at all. When he moved out it was a relief but I was still threatened by him, because he visited almost every weekend. By now, I fortunately live far from my home country and don't have any contact with my brother and really rare contact with my parents.

With all those experiences it was really hard for me to find any friends or even boyfriends. I was afraid of being touched by strangers, I didn't want to be close to anyone because I feared that they might wanna hurt me like my family did. It took me years to open up to those who are now my closest friends and even today I sometimes feel unworthy of their friendship.

Anyway let me tell you something about my ex boyfriend. He was the first man I fell in love with after all that happened. I showed him my deepest fears, I told him my darkest secrets and I thought this was real love, this was how it's supposed to be. But I got triggered really hard by small things, I got anxious, jealous, angry and desperate, I cried and yelled at him, thought that he would cheat on me with someone better than me. I turned into a massive asshole, but I couldn't control myself at that state of mind. The relationship lasted for 2 years and most of the time I was completely sane and aware of my behaviour, but every now and than I had those episodes where I'd forget who I was.
The relationship ended because I found out that he was texting other girls for almost a year, and it wasn't the normal kind of flirtatious text: first of all he texted 12 year old girls (at that point he was 23), and he got very vert intimate with them like... He sent pictures of him yerking off to pictures of those girls. And I was really triggered my that, because of what happened to me when I was young. Obviously I broke up immediately, but I wanted to save everyone, the girls, but also my ex boyfriend because I thought he had troubles he couldn't deal alone with. After two month where I still had contact with my ex I realised I couldn't do anything. I couldn't save the girls, I couldn't make my ex go to therapy, I was no one with no impact. It ripped me apart. I started harming myself, I felt guilty for not being able to do anything, even tho I did everything I could by telling people close to my ex about what happened, but I always felt like I should have done more. For more than a year those thoughts haunted me every second, every night.

Then a year ago I met a boy who is now my boyfriend. On first sight we had a deep connection and miraculously I didn't feel any mistrust or anxiety. We started dating and soon became a couple. The first 4 month passed without any troubles, we didn't fight, nor did I have any episodes. However after we moved together it slowly started. I started having those episodes, I started yelling at him, calling him out for things he never did, thought he would cheat on me, got jealous of other women... Just like the episodes I had in my other relationship. And I still can't control myself..

I don't want to ruin this relationship. I know I can trust him. But what I said in those episodes hurt him so much. I don't want to hurt him. I don't want to lose him. But I can't figure out how to control myself. I even started therapy but it always feels like the therapist wants to help me but doesn't understand my struggle.

If someone knows my struggle or knows how to control myself, please help me.."
193,"Hello to everyone willing to hear me out. I go by Renfri here, and I’m 19 years old at the moment. This December will mark 5 years since I nearly choked to death on medicine, and I still very vividly remember everything I felt in that moment, and my life hasn’t been the same ever since. I couldn’t breathe or cough or do anything except stand there and suffocate and be completely overwhelmed with panic. I’d fully accepted the fact that I would die, then, so much that I even started to wonder what my parents would do after I was gone and whether life after death was an actual thing that I was about to experience, until my Mom managed to save me, somehow. I started suffocating in my sleep every single night for months after that, and then one time in June of 2016 I couldn’t breathe properly, eat or drink the entire day, I was terrified and dizzy and thought I’d for sure die then. It was awful and scary. My Mom and I went to a number of doctors, I had my heart monitored by a holter for 24 hours, my lungs checked and X-rayed, I wrote to online psychologists and no one could tell for sure what it was until someone said I could be having panic attacks. I still to this day have to take sedatives for periods of time every few months because it gets hard to breathe almost every single day at some point, I’ve often had trouble swallowing—especially pills, but also so much as simple water—ever since, and I get extremely triggered by people struggling to breathe in movies/on TV and still suffocate in my sleep sometimes even after over 4 years. I was diagnosed with neurosis a few months after the accident by a cardiologist, and I never got to talk to a therapist about it because my Mom is against me going to therapy, but my friends at the time pointed me into the direction of PTSD, which I dismissed at first because I didn’t have flashbacks and I thought that was a necessary requirement for sufferers of PTSD—but now, years down the line, I’m pretty sure it was indeed PTSD, and although I don’t completely meet the criteria anymore, I still struggle with remnants of it and probably will for the rest of my life. I’m interested to hear if anyone’s had similar experiences and hopefully an input on if I got it right and whether or not that sounds like PTSD, because I really need to know if I can ever fully get over this. Thank you."
194,Anyone suffer from PTSD and find relief with medical cannabis. I suffer from severe nightmares and flashbacks. Do every therapy imaginable weekly and tried SSRI (antidepressants) but do not like side effects and did not help. Also do like using a medication for depression and I’m not depressed in any way.
195,"How can you move past nasty things bullies did in the past?

For example at school there was a gang of other kids who used to come after me, two boys was the ringleaders and i remember one time i wanted to be left alone and they got a huge group of others to help them chase me and corner me, which means i cannot deal with feeling trapped, plus i felt trapped with abusive ex which has cemented my fear of being trapped by anyone  :sorry: 

and one of the bullies came up to me after school one day and decided to hit and shove me and i remmeber he kicked me as well and i had done exactly nothing :cry:

i've been ostracised in my school years, had people promise to be there for me friends forever kinda thing then as soon as i come to bullies attention they disappeared so as not to have the bullies after them as well :sorry:"
196,"Hey, 
I try not to think about it in my everyday life but I experienced a fair share of physical violence in my childhood. 
I have issues feeling safe. I just don't. No matter what I do I always feel I will get attacked for it and I get very passive because it lessens the anxiety. In the long term, obviously I need to be active and live with the anxiety. 
I started dating a guy. To begin with, I liked him because he had balls. I just never wanted to be with someone who would ever allow my childhood trauma to repeat. 
An unwanted side effect is that I think I am dating him because he lessens my anxiety about being physically harmed. 
I kind of want to break up but I'm scared to be alone. He would never hurt me but I just can't bear being alone. 
I wonder if I might just choose physical safety over love but also I wonder if I can even love anyone because all I seem to revolve around are my own fears."
197,I've been isolating myself.  Feeling like I don't belong here or anywhere.  I'm having vivid flashbacks and body memories.  I'm feeling very depressed.
198,"I have a only a few select memories of my childhood & i'm now wanting to know why? I have always been mistrusting and fearful of men. I am going to have some counselling and they said there are ways to help me remember that aren't guaranteed. Many of you may ask, do I really want to know? but this has been affecting my life, still to this day. I have children and I don't want them to ever pick up on any issues, that I have with men. I want them to have healthy relationships. There's a lot that has lead me here, it isn't just that I have no memory for a young age. Can anyone relate/help?"
199,"I'm having nightmares hit me again after so long a reprieve of them not haunting me at night

It might be because I'm sick but the horrid putrid feeling of being friends with my abuser, even in my dreams, makes me feel disgusting and I've been in a deep depression and just sour mood all day, nothing makes me feel better, nothing makes me feel ANYTHING, 

I'm so just....it feels like I've been violated all over again."
200,"So this is all started in about August. I had smoked some weed at my sister's house. 
 I've only smoked about four or five times in my entire life because it basically gives me a panic attack. Idk why I tried it again. Anyways so I smoked and apparently my sister asked if I was alright and I went into a full blown attack. I assume it was a panic attack but I'm not sure. Everything started repeating. My sister was saying the same things over and over. It was like deja Vu that was repeating on a loop. I was screaming to call 911 because it was so scary. I was thrashing on the floor and unable to comprehend what was going on. It was like my whole body was consumed by terror. 
 The next thing I know I woke up in bed the next morning. My sister said it lasted around 15 minutes and then they got me in bed and I went to sleep. But the thing is is the terror is still there. I was paranoid. I felt like it was a glitch in the matrix. Like somehow the simulation I was in glitched while I was high. I saw everything as it really was. Nothing is real, we're living in a simulation. I somehow got out of mine for little bit and felt true terror. That's why everything was repeating itself. Something was wrong with my simulation. 

As the days went on I stopped being so scared and felt more normal. But it happened again. I didn't even smoke! That's the scary part. I was drunk though. So the panic set in and everything was repeating itself again. This time I was home with my husband and he called 911. As soon as the ambulance got here I started to calm down. I felt that if something really was happening they could help me. They brought me to the hospital but after waiting a few hours we went home. 

Now I only get the feeling when I have deja Vu. Everything floods back in, i get so scared. And I question reality. It only lasts about thirty seconds though. 

I did end up seeing my primary care doctor. She said it's PTSD from my childhood. I will admit I had a horrific childhood full of trauma. I've experienced other signs of PTSD but nothing like this. I don't like some smells or sounds. And I get very uncomfortable when anything reminds me of my dad.

Idk guys, maybe I just needed to write this out. I think it's something more than PTSD and I'm scared. I've talked with my family about it but it's hard to explain true terror. My husband has been amazing and has been supporting me. He helps me do the five questions when I'm having deja Vu. Ya know five things I can see, feel, hear, smell, taste. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this with there PTSD."
201,"Hi 👋 

after watching a problem on bbc one this morning about ptsd and military personnel I just want to say thank you for your service. You are not weak you are so strong and it’s ok to not be ok. If you ever want to speak freely about how you feel or just want to speak to someone to take your mind off things I’m always here to talk. If you’re too scared to speak to your family at fear of hurting them I promise I will listen without judgement no matter what. You don’t have to do through this alone. Please the help is there I will help you get it. Thank you and take care of yourselves. Much love💓"
202,"How do you overcome this? I’ve tore myself apart, while everyone watched on the sidelines. Told myself that everyone else was more important than what I was going through. Physical hurt myself for the last couple of years. My mother, husband and family left me to deal with it myself. I couldn’t help myself or even take care of myself.  Didn’t want to take medication and listened to people I should not have. My life will never be the same. I find it difficult to go on and can’t see a life worth living now. Sorry, just needed to get this off my chest. Finding therapists is not easy when I can’t leave the house and I am also dealing with my child’s MI. My husband just doesn’t seem to care. He works, comes home and plays on the computer all the time. It’s been this way our whole marriage. I don’t think he even pays attention to what is going on. I’m stuck on what to do."
203,"My five-year relationship ended and shattered my heart.

I was sexually abused from the age of 5 by a family member. I remember 5 incidents. I never told anyone until 3 months ago, 20 years after it stopped. The lid of my secret was slowly being lifted a year ago and I slipped into darkness. My boyfriend had no idea how to support me, he had no inkling that something serious had happened. At the same time, he was slipping into his own darkness with a sudden fear of death, stemming from the near death of his Dad. We both became lost and drifted apart. I told him the truth, so he could understand why I changed. Now we are fighting our own battles separately, but all I want to do is be in his arms and support him.

My abuser has taken my adulthood, not my childhood. I am surrounded by a family who has no idea, an ex-boyfriend who is overwhelmed and I am alone to sort out my mess.

I lost the one because someone broke my trust and I have protected myself and my loved ones ever since."
204,"Every time I hear my abuser's name, I have a total panic attack. It's like I'm reliving the experience all over again. The only difference is that I know I'm not. I just feel the anxiety that I felt when it happened. I'm totally aware of my surroundings and where I'm at. It doesn't stop the extreme panicky feeling I get. I sometimes even have dreams about the experience, but not that often. Does this sound like PTSD?"
205,"I was wondering if anyone else experiences loss of rationale or fuzziness accompanied by psychotic behaviors for a period of time before a memory replays itself? I noticed a few moments ago, I came back to my senses right after I remembered something from my childhood. Prior to this moment my day was fuzzy with only parts of it coming to mind. I couldn't tell you details if I wanted to just moments. This happens a lot but I just noticed it today."
206,"I finally told someone I was raped I used the term sexual assault because I told my sister and didn't want to upset her too much 
But I feel like a weight has been lifted I haven't told anyone in the five years since it happend. 
I just wanted to say that I think I finally got the courage because of the support I have received from the few posts I have made on here ❤️☺️
You're all amazing people who deserve to be happy. 
I know this is only a small step but at least it's a step"
207,"Hi all, a bit of background:

So I first experienced child abuse when I was 15. I won't go into too much detail however I will say that it wasn't until I was 17 the extent of what happened sank in and as well as this only my husband of 2 years knows about every detail as it has affected things around intimacy.

I was also assaulted again by a client in his home when I was 30, employer at the time wasn't very understanding and I felt like I was being blamed for it. In a sad twist of fate I lost my granddad, who was my surrogate father, to a sudden and unexpected illness in hospital a month later.

I began having issues around about 2008. We'd moved to a new town and I felt as though other people were staring at me and giving me dirty looks. My emotions were very up and down at work, too, not only because of this but also because getting to and from work was very tiring, meaning I spent 2 hours in total commuting and going home. Luckily, we only lived there for a year.

Things calmed down until 2011 when I had to undergo an operation and suffered an infection. I was diagnosed with another physical illness at the end of that year, this particular one is not responding to treatment very well.

My friends and family at work suspect that someone I know (I don't want to go into specifics because there is only so much information I want to give at this moment) is giving me a little bit more attention than they really should. They are single, live alone and a few years older than me. Occurrences that have taken place seem too much, to me, to be coincidences and it makes me feel almost paranoid. I am happy to share these privately, as I greatly fear a risk of coming across as disturbed.

What I will say, is that my friends have told me this person has been talking about me. They also made, what others have said, sexual advances towards me - one very overtly during a chat with them, two other times at separate parties held by our company.

Over the Christmas period just gone, an unknown social media follower of mine began sending me messages asking how I am and ""liking"" my holiday photos (none of them were of me) before deciding to call my mobile five minutes later - twice. One friend said it sounded like the follower has a fake account and was in that area at that time. I had never given out my number to the follower or this person (though they had asked for my mobile number via direct message 3 years ago)

Oddly enough, I'd spotted a car that had driven by me, my husband and my in-laws a few days before all of this (23 December) when we were going out late Christmas shopping, this car belonged to the person who has been giving me all this attention and they'd only owned it for 6/7 months from what I have learnt. Same make, model, colour and vehicle registration plate. They'd told others at work they were going abroad for the holidays - out quite far, too.

I feel like I am seeing things, but part of me is considering taking measures to defend myself. Maybe invest in a personal alarm or seek help to deal with these problems? I don't know, I'm just debating so many different things at present, but one thing I am absolutely sure of is that I no longer feel safe or comfortable being at work for fear of being cornered or encountered upon by this person in a one-on-one setting. I am constantly having to look over my shoulder to ensure no one I recognise is following me, and surely at work I shouldn't have to feel that way?

Thanks for any advice."
208,"Posted by Alexandra Shimo 27 March 2019

Suppose, for the sake of a thought experiment, that a new psychological disorder was discovered. It is supported by dozens of studies and recognized by some of the world’s leading psychiatrists and psychologists, but not by the North American psychiatric establishment. And let’s say the refusal to accept this new disorder had devastating consequences for #MeToo survivors.

That claim is asserted by a growing number of sexual abuse victims, psychiatrists and psychologists worldwide.


Are sexual abuse victims being diagnosed with a mental disorder they don't have?  


This sounds as though it's quite a serious issue."
209,"Obviously I won't go into detail but I went through trauma years ago 
It still messes with me and I haven't had any form of a romantic relationship since, I'm 22 and I don't want to be alone forever, but I'm also so untrusting of men, , getting close to them, everything 
So I guess my question is, have any of you overcome this fear or am I stuck?"
210,"I'm not diagnosed with ptsd I'm not really sure if I have it  this is the closest forum I could find I'm sorry
but I did go through a horrible assault a few years ago.
I never tod anyone for a few reasons, embarrassment, fear, dissapointed in myself ect
But it's making my life hard I already had an eating disorder and depression but this really spiked my anxiety
I'm scared of men
I really can't leave the house without a sister, my mum or a close friend I'm too scared.
Im in anxiety management therapy but I don't think I'm going to get better without talking about this
But I can't tell my parents or sister they have wayyy to much to deal with already
Same with a friend
My other closest friend it sounds awful but i really think she'd tell my mum.
I don't know what to do it happened 4 years ago but I still cry myself to sleep thinking about it 3/4 times a week"
211,i sure Ebony's ptsd and health conditions was my fault and i could of saved her :cry:
212,"For those who had trauma, 
Something that we don't talk often about:

Do you fantasise often about killing your abuser? I do. I want to stop this and focus on other things but I can't. I also have such an intense focus on it and high energy. I have many others plans for revenge so I won't feel guilty for killing another human being or to not feel I'm like them. 
Just want these fantasies of revenge out of my mind, it doesn't worth my time thinking about them, but it feels out of my control. 

I had rape, kindnape, someone tryed to kill me and also to much narcissistic abuse. I know some disagree about this last one as a cause of trauma but belive me, when they re always angry and screaming saying they are going to kill you, punish you for things that you have not done, calling you the worst names in the world etc etc (I don't remember everything) this can lead to trauma. And you re alone isolated I forgot. They don't allow you to eat, to sleep and to bath.."
213,keep replaying it from when i was 19 she said i led him on i'm a hoe and i not talking gardening :cry:
214,"I was divorced 13 years ago and haven’t been with anyone or even dated.  My ex husband was an abusive liar who has continues to mentally abuse me through “co-parenting” This I realize has taken a massive toll on me.  I don’t even know how to function normally as a woman, lover, anymore.  I kept my self & kids pretty close & isolated because I was so injured and at times afraid for my life.  I don’t feel like a normal person and I am not capable of normal relationships or romantic ones.  Externally, I am accomplished successful and look damn good for my age but inside I am a wreck."
215,"I knew this would knock me out 
my addict brother had pneumonia and nearly died 
today I went to visit with my stepmother 

my stepmother was very impressive actually 
so that the damage is less than usual 
but I'm very traumatised when I see him 
he is paper thin and looks like a skeleton  

I also forgot to take my afternoon meds 
so at times we were sitting there in silence 
both of us feeling overwhelmed 

he has difficulty breathing 

my aunt and my dad want to not go there 
and get the news from me  
which I dont feel I can do this time 

and on top of a boiler breakdown and flooding ! 

war zone for me at the moment 

any tips on dealing with this kind of shock ?"
216,"I'm having a lot of flashbacks.  I'm feeling very overwhelmed and depressed.  I have CPTSD and DID 
I guess I need a safe place to talk.  I'm afraid whatever I say will be stupid or wrong.  
I stopped going to a support group.  I was being judged and criticized for expressing my feelings."
217,"I dont understand why i can't keep friends. Female in particular (im also female). 
I try my best to be a good friend but my therapists say i end up in controlling or emotionally abusive friendships. 
I thought i had gotten out of this when i went to university but it appears not. I am just so so tired of being hated when i try to say no to someone. And having my name dragged through the mud and isolated as punishment. I want to understand what im doing wrong because honestly its killing me. I feel like it will never end and theres no hope for me."

Lyrics
Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence
Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence
Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence
Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence
Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence
No need to listen to yourself
Maybe this one will pass you by
Or to anybody else
No need to listen to yourself
Or to anybody else
No need to listen to yourself
Or to anybody else
Hold, hold your tongue now
And let them all listen to your silence"
220,Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing emdr is used for a few things but they are recommending it to me to retreave tramatic memories so what i would whant to no is if anyone else has had this for that and how it worked for them
221,I am trying to quit drinking and take my medications as prescribed but sometimes I am overwhelmed by the bad feelings and I just want to feel wasted all day and drink and watch funny youtube videos. I don't bother anyone. Why is it such a bad thing? Can't I have rest for a few hours from my torment?
222,I am tapering off two powerful meds right now and use alcohol to help with the withdraw effects. I force alcohol down me and feel awful for doing it. I start drinking early in the morning and drink all day due to the fear of side effects from withdraw of meds. It has been 4 months now. I decided to go off some of my meds due to terrible side effects taking them for a long period. Like developing Parkinson or Tardive Dynasia. Also my psychosis started coming back after reducing meds. Alcohol seems to kill everything but now worried about drinking to much. I definitely do not want to go back on those medications. I hate having mental illness.
223,"I'm finding it really difficult right now to deal with certain types of flashbacks from my traumas from childhood. 
Trigger warning, sexual abuse. Also, very long.. TLDR: I want to be able to enjoy being touched again. Help? 
So some things happened to me in my past, some of which I remember and some I don't really. It definitely shaped the person I am and detrimentally affected my emotional development and mental health, but it doesn't hugely affect my day to day life now. That is to say, most days I am largely asymptomatic. Sure I get actually triggered occasionally, and I have the dreams often, but most days I am ok and can put it all out of my mind. 
The biggest and most persistent exception to this is in the soft, romantic and intimate interactions with my boyfriend. We have a wonderful and supportive relationship and he really is my rock. Most of the time when I am with him I can think of nothing but happiness. But sometimes when he touches me something he does suddenly triggers a flashback. 
For example; tonight we were cuddling with him kind of sitting up and me in between his legs and leaning back on him. He kissed the back of my neck, holding his lips against my skin and kind of rubbing them along my neck and back. I felt his chin hairs, lips and breath all tickling me. Honestly it's those intimate moments that I cherish. But suddenly I remembered how one of my abusers used to do that to me. I was 7 or 8 ( I've blocked out a lot of memory from childhood and now have issues placing them chronologically when I do remember them) and he was a friend of my step brother. He lived with us for a short time. I remember playing a game on the computer in my bedroom. He came upstairs for a while to watch me play, which I think he did often. I remember him sitting or kneeling behind me while I sat on the chair. We were talking about the game (a lion king game from a cereal box, I forget what it was called but I loved it) and he was kind of watching over my shoulder. He was very close to me, and had his hands around my waist. He started rubbing his face/ lip area on my back and neck, tickling me with his stubble. I was immediately uncomfortable, but only commented that it tickled. He kept doing it, and started kind of kissing my neck as well. I was frozen. That lasted for a little while, then his hands started moving around my body, and he told me that if we went to the bed he could tickle me in other places too. I told him that I was hungry, and went downstairs to eat. I stayed downstairs for a while, and eventually he left my room. That wasn't the first time he had touched me inappropriately, or the last. But it was the first time that I had a sense that what he was doing was wrong. My naive little kid brain always assumed innocence in his interactions I guess. But not that time. That time it got through, and I was terrified. I mean I was so scared and shocked and lost and I just didn't know what I was supposed to do so I just let it happen. I'm glad I smartened up and went downstairs when I did because I'm sure that if I hadn't snapped out of it and had stayed frozen, he would have done much worse to me that day. I never told anyone about that day. He lived with us for a short time yet after that, and I always tried to avoid being alone with him. A while later I told my older sister he made me uncomfortable. We already had experience with sexual abuse at that point, so I'm pretty sure she understood without me saying. And then he left and I never saw him again. 
Anyways, yea. So a lovely intimate cuddling moment with the man I love so very much, and that came back into my head. I tried not to let it ruin our moment, but it was difficult. That happens pretty often. I have issues being touched. It sucks because I love it, I love when my boyfriend runs his hand along my back, etc. But it reminds some part of my mind about another hand that did that, and I shiver away. I have an actual physical response, like tickling kinda but unpleasant. I just want to be able to enjoy those pure and innocent moments of intimacy with the man I'm gunna spend my life with. I don't want to shrink away from his touch anymore. 
Does anyone have any advice on how to be less bothered by these types of flashbacks and the touch aversion?"
224,I was seeing a counselor for a little while and she diagnosed me with chronic PTSD and major depressive disorder. But I really have no idea what triggered the ptsd diagnosis. Are there certain things that you need to have?
225,"I was sexually assaulted when I was 15 at a party. I asked for help and the people looked away from me and did not help me. My mother who was a cruel lady told me when I told her what happened that I “should not have been there”. And did not take me to the hospital or treatment. I was horrified because my identity was a “good girl”.  Who am I now?

I went thought Cognitive Processing Therapy with my therapist about my sexual assault. It was many weeks of many sessions of intense, intense talking, writing, and going over my story, my thoughts and feelings and having my therapist help me make sense of it all. Sometimes I would sit and wail and my therapist would sit there and look at the ceiling.

 I had a lot of “stuck points” as they call them. They are incorrect views about a topic that keep you “stuck” in these defense mechanisms.

It was my fault. It was because I……  ( My therapist would say: “but others say the EXACT opposite”)

If only I………  I should have figured out what would happen!! (My therapist would say: “If you could do that, would you have gone there?”)

The big part of the therapy was that, there is not REASON for my attacker to have attacked me. THERE IS NO REASON. I will not know or understand the REASON. I am not like my attacker and I will not understand. (My therapist: If could be he set out to attack someone and you were the first one he saw). I will never understand. That’s ok.

 I had severe downs in this time and I was suicidal, which is why they make you come so often to CPT therapy but I am glad I lived through it. It was just words and THAT was hard.

I never talked to anyone in depth about my assault and my feelings. I was in denial for a long time that I was affected to greatly because I had to keep trudging forward in order to survive. I had to work, I had to go to school, and take care of everyone in my life before I would face issues that I had.  

After two bad marriages I was blessed with a really kind, loving fiancé. He did not go through all this abuse and trauma that I have. He is a confident person with strong bonds to his loving parents. He has never had issues like I have. He was never abused. He sets goals and attains them. He will tell people NO. His perspective is really amazing to me. I have been triggered by something on TV or something someone said or did and I felt that I should explain to him. He said I didn’t have to tell him anything but I thought he should know what had happened. I told him what happened and the effect of it on me. I told him my issues from it and how I modify my life so that this attack doesn’t happen again. He looked surprised at my reasoning. He said, ""It had nothing to do with you, do you know that?""   It sort of shocked me because a healthy, happy, confident person can see all these truths right away, without psychology training. It wasn’t your fault. We make our own choices.

It wasn’t YOUR fault. It had nothing to do with you, do you know that? 

All the best with much love, 
Tulip

226,"Hi,
I’m really struggling. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 8 months. My dad was abusive and so was my 2 previous relationships. How do I trust him? I’m trying so hard, he appears to be the most genuine and kind hearted man. However I didn’t even realise how abusive my previous partner was until I was out of it. I now struggle to trust my own judgement. He’s amazing at reassuring me. I’m just so scared, I really don’t have it in me to be hurt again.
The flashbacks and nightmares are really vivid. I’ve just started EMDR therapy.
It’s like I’m waiting for it to go wrong. I shut off at any minor trigger and it can take me weeks to open back up again.
I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old who have been the sole reason I have survived so far. 
My new partner makes me feel whole again. I just don’t know how to let him in, how can I when there is so much at stake? What if my children get attached and then he leaves or turns into a crazy person like my previous? 
Also my ex left me for my best friend when my youngest was 7 weeks old so there is a lot of unhealed trauma Still. My children’s dad has no contact with them because of drug and alcohol issues. I just overthink everything. I’m waiting for the first hit. 
please help me :("
227,"It is so profound about the decades of children living in refugee camps in Syria.  Can you just imagine what these children are going through?  Most of the children do not have their fathers. It is just the mother with them. The families live desperately below the poverty line. Education and medical care is almost non existence for the refugees hosted in the camps by other countries and humanitarian aid. 

I am just having a difficult time thinking about the refugees. I have severe mental health issues but it was not caused by war and hate. Gosh maybe it was everyone always seems to be at war with each other. 

So what do you think will happen to the children who are refugees? Love and hugs Jules"
228,"A few years ago I disclosed to someone that I have PTSD from my childhood. I wish I hadn't now because it seems every time I talk to her she is trying to come up with reasons she has it too.Some of the things she considers ""trauma"" are ridiculous. She told me once she's pretty sure she has it because she saw a dead bird on the road when she was riding in the car with her parents as a child.Just a few days ago she said she knows she has it because she has anxiety and because she has a hard time trusting people.

I have tried so many times to explain to her that it takes pretty significant,severe trauma to cause it.She tries to argue that with me saying her symptoms match.

I get so annoyed and irritated when I'm around her.I feel insulted that she thinks the things she says would get her the diagnosis.

I'm not sure why it bothers me so much.Why should I care that she seems to want the diagnosis so bad?Maybe it bothers me so much because the terms ""trauma"" and ""PTSD"" are taken so lightly by those that haven't experienced the type of trauma it takes to receive the diagnosis?That some people think that because something feels traumatic it must indeed be severe trauma?Maybe because after going through 17 years of sexual abuse she's claiming seeing a dead bird is at the same level?

I don't know but I need to find a way to deal with her without getting so upset.She doesn't know what caused mine other than me saying I had a ""bad childhood ""(and I'm not about to tell her either).I do have to see her sometimes so I need to figure something out.Any suggestions?

Also...I guess it's not just her that makes me feel that way.When I hear anyone trying to say they have it from things that seem not very traumatic I start feeling shaky and get anxiety and feel irritated.And I don't want to react this way."
229,"I have never had an anxiety problem my whole life, but as soon as my wife gave birth to our first child(traumatic experience), it triggered an immediate state of crippling anxiety that is still plaguing my life almost 3 years on.

I have been on antidepressants which are helping massively, but since I've never been diagnosed by any doctor, could this be PTSD or general anxiety disorder or what do people think?"
230,"Im sure most with PTSD understand the depression that goes along with it,especially when symptomatic. But how do you know when it's just due to being symptomatic or when it becomes something that might warrant a separate/added diagnosis?"
231,"I'm not drinking anything because my alters and I agree this is the fastest way to end up in hospital, which we see as the only safe space. The worst part about this is that no one else on the entire internet seems to have this issue. I feel very alone.

It's messed up, I know. Does anyone else have/had issues with drinking fluid or feeling like they ""need"" to go to hopsital, and are there any alternatives to harming myself?

I'd literally do anything to end up there again...I've already been twice, one of which was overnight

(Not sure where to post this, therapist thinks I'm traumatised and I know that feeling unsafe is linked to trauma, figured here is where someone might be most likely to have an answer)"
232,I’m hoping for some perspective from people that may have gone through therapy if that’s ok. A couple of weeks ago my therapist said ‘he’d been getting some of my intrusive images’. We did some exposure therapy regarding a certain situation I don’t want to go into for fear of triggering anyone. I feel like I’ve affected him and now i can’t imagine talking about other difficult experiences. I don’t know if this is something I can get past or whether I should just end the sessions now.
233,"My parents were abusive. My father molested me and beat my mother in front of me. He died in front of me of a heart attack when I was ten. My mother was always mean to me and said she wished I had not been born. I had trouble making friends because I didn't know how to socialize. My first party I was sexually assaulted in front of a crowd of people who did not help me. I was afraid of men after this.

I ended up getting married for the first time when I was 24. He was really sweet until our wedding night where he tried to choke me during the act. He said some women like that. I said never do that again but he would still do it for a few seconds because he thought my reaction was ""funny"". Anyway he would scream in my ears and hit me in the back of the head. He said he would never divorce me and would rather be a widower than a divorced man. He went off on me once in front of our co-workers and everyone was shocked. He told them I was crazy. Then I asked for a divorce again and he was happy to divorce me now because I was ""more trouble than I was worth"".

A few years later I met a guy at work. His ambition was to smoke weed all day and pop pills, not work and have me support him and his two daughters (4yr and 6yr). Short story: he stole money from me, sold my things for more drugs, I left him and he attempted suicide. He injected himself with something and planned to have his daughters(!!) discover his dead body with a letter blaming me. His mother found him and brought him to the hospital  He wrote me jibberish emails after that claiming ""I"" destroyed his brain.

Next relationship was with an alcoholic. I was also an alcoholic by this point. Short story: he would be very mean and drag me around by my arm. He would break up with me and then beg for me back. I would come back because I felt like such a loser no one else could love me. One time he broke up with me after we were drinking heavy and he dragged me to my car and told me to go. I said let me sleep off the alcohol and he said no. He pushed me into the drivers seat and told me to go or he would call the police. I drove drunk and crying home. I had it with him. He did try to beg for me back but I realized it would be better to be single.

So now on to my second marriage. I met him on a religious dating site. I thought because he was a religious guy he would be good and kind, but no.  He lied about having a degree, his weight, and the fact he had $12,000(not a typo)  in traffic violations. Turns out he was only religious for appearances. He scammed people for money all the time. He wanted to buy social security numbers from disabled children so he could build a fake business. Seriously. I have so many stories about him. He was a narcissist to a T. He was violent and smashed a wine bottle at my feet and threw all the glass dishes on the floor. He chased me around screaming. He blamed me for this. He said I threw an object at him which triggered him. I did not. We went to marital therapy and he was writing emails to the therapist about me. She totally took his side and acted so charmed by him. They were emailing each other behind my back. I ran away from him while he was at work. I ended up at a homeless shelter because I had nowhere to go. That was last year.

I am engaged again. He is 17 years older than me. He is sweet and caring. I have a separate apartment but I spend most of my time living at his. He knows my problems and wants to be supportive. He is a lawyer and loves to work.

I am afraid to get married again. He is not violent. He does not drink. He has a good relationship with his parents. We started dating when I was at the homeless shelter. In fact would pick me up for dates outside the shelter 🙂

Some days though, I just want to be alone. I am afraid to be tied to him. I am afraid of his age too. When I am 60 he will be 77. But really I want to be alone. I'm tired of relationships. They are exhausting. 

I have been having nightmares about ex husband #2. I am afraid he will crash my wedding and shoot me. He has illegal guns. He threatened to shoot me before. He would ""practice"" holding his gun, pointing it at me. Sigh.... I have been having anxiety every day. I have been drinking to cope.  I have a therapist and will see her next week."
234,I live in America way out in the woods. Their are Rednecks and Rebels all around me as I live in the South. The Civil War here is still alive here. It is so ironic we are one nation yet people in the South still want to be separated in America. Down here in the South people still want freedom from politics. I kinda of like it though as seeing all the propaganda it would be much simpler to live without it. What do you think?
235,"I posted about this roughly in my intro, but kind of had a thought, what do you do when your family is the source of your flashbacks, and you're stuck with said family because the country's economy is shit... I don't know if it's just me.. but I have the hardest time making and keeping relationships, especially when I have a bad episode of anger when I sit there and yell at them, whenever it ends it makes me feel like absolute crap, I did this once with my S.O when he came over from across the ocean, and looking back on it and every time I got upset at for something so small and something I really should have enjoyed it hurts.. I talked to him about it and he says it's fine.. but no one in my life has ever really come clean when they're upset with me, unless it's in the most barbaric of ways.."
236,"Hi everyone this is my first post here not in introductions. I have severe problems with anger, ""caused"" by other people and it seems to just be getting worse. I can't do the things I used to enjoy or even hold down a job now because I can't cope with being in public now. It started off being defensive anger, like fight or flight I guess, but now as I try to better myself with DBT, traditional therapy, ect. I'ts turned into anxiety of my symptoms, and anger about the way the I feel. For example I used to go to the grocery store, get mad at something stupid that someone probably didn't intend, and physically hurt myself or inanimate objects so that I don't hurt anyone else. Now I would say in general I'm doing better controlling myself and rationalizing situations. But now I get angry at myself for the way I feel. ""A normal person wouldn't get upset by this."" Now it has gotten so bad that I'm scared of going out in public, i'm scared of losing control and really hurting myself. 

Sorry if this is confusing I guess i'm just looking for other people similar experiences or things that have helped you guys. 

Thanks"
237,I am so hungry right now. I take Mirazapine and boy oh boy I am hungry all the time. My Gp suggested this medication as I was not eating. Life sure has changed for me. Not gaining weight though which is good.

239,"Hello everyone, 

I am diagnosed with ptsd. 
But I think there are more issues regarding my mental health. 
I hear voices. I hallucinate. I hear things. 
I have anger issues. I don't trust anyone including family. I see shadows. I have a feeling someone is always following/spying on me. 
I think I also have schizophrenia. But my psychologist says those symptoms are also seen in cases with severe ptsd. 
Is this true? Does anyone else have these symptoms?"
240,"No idea if this is the right forum to post in, but since things shifted after I experienced a traumatic event then I guess it might be the most appropriate.  I'm not sure anything is real.  I can't connect with anything... my feelings, other people, my surroundings.  It feels less solid than a dream; things look bizarre and fuzzy most of the time.  In fact when I dream it's far more vivid and realistic than when I'm apparently awake.  I'm almost entirely convinced I'm not actually awake, and I get a multitude of signs telling me that I'm not in the 'real' world and I need to wake up.  Like I'm being held against my will in some sort of sedated state, or an induced coma.  Or a state of catatonia I receded into in order to escape.  I know this sounds ridiculous and I'm capable of rationalising these thoughts as potentially delusional, but nothing looks or sounds or feels real... and I realise the folly of posting this at all if in fact the whole thing is a mental construction as everything in it including this forum would be in my mind.  I used to be sharp and witty and coherent and now I struggle to string sentences together.  As an artist I used to be inspired and full of life and in touch with this profound creativity that flowed from me effortlessly and now I'm in this insipid mire and everything is without colour.  

A few years ago I was gang raped at an outdoor rave by three men and a woman.  For reference I'm male.  I was 19 at the time.  I'd taken speed and was a bit overwhelmed by my emotions and the woman suggested I go on a walk with her which led us away from the bulk of the crowd.  After it happened I went and sat in a tent and swinging in and out of a panic attack except I was panicking about having done something wrong, getting really upset for some reason about how I'd done something wrong and I couldn't figure out what I'd done, and whenever I went quiet I could hear people talking about me and taking the piss out of me and saying they should have shoved me off one of the cliffs, so I was convinced they were going to do something to hurt me.  I've never felt so confused and embarrassed and scared.  

Following that night I couldn't think about anything else for months.  Not out of choice, it just kept repeating in my mind, over and over and I'd get intensely frustrated and upset.  Everyone from that scene actively shunned me.  They were a toxic group of drug users with a strange hierarchy that functioned in a clique, and in some ways I guess it's a blessing that it happened, because it forced me to extract myself from unhealthy people whose lives revolved around using drugs, but I was suffocated for years by this guilt and feeling like I'd somehow prompted the attack.  I didn't fight back when it happened.  I didn't know what to do.  I felt like I should have noticed warnings signs and removed myself from that scene before it happened.  The woman once said to me 'if you were older we'd have f*cked you.'  We being her and her husband.  They were maybe 15/20 years older than me.  All four of them were supposed to be my friends.  I spent time at their houses.  Why at the rave?  

And then it's faded into this absence.  I'm not really here.  I once walked down the canal path and on the floor was spray painted 'wake up'.  A few days later it wasn't there.  I hear voices at night and experience sleep paralysis and then enter dreams that are so lifelike and vivid and colossal I can't believe that those are meant to be the dream and this strange blank fuzzy non-life is the waking world.  I can't feel or care about anything to the point I wonder if it's possible to develop a kind of psuedo sociopathy.  I imagine people will suggest therapy.  I've been in therapy.  CBT.  DBT.  Dissociative coping strategies.  Well, that doesn't turn the colour back on.  I just want to wake up."
241,"I just lost all my flock of chickens including a rooster Herman who would attack me every morning. Some kind of animal breached the chicken coop. I have one left and from what I read she will be depressed and die too. 

I hate how animals and humans are defenseless. we think and run around having all this power but yet we are nothing. I am so sorry for my chickens I am crying my eyes out first time I cried in years. I know that God takes care of all of his creatures after death. 

I just can not cope with how defenseless my little chickens were against the predator. I have a whole arsenal of weapons for self defense after I was robbed. My chickens had no weapons for defense I am just sick about it.  Love and hugs Jule"
242,They put me on Mirtazapine and I am starving all the time. Can not stand it anymore. My weight is okay so far-but just having to eat all the time bothers me. I like the Mirtazapine as I have gotten my best night sleep. I ue to be up at 1 am wide awake now this has stopped due to the meds. So I guess I am in a catch two situation. Sleep or eat. Lots of love and hugs Jules
243,My son will not go to school and when I take away his privileges he will start to go and then call me from the nurses office to come get him. I took him to the doctor and we are having all kinds of test run on him but he tried to get off the bus today to come home walk home. The bus driver would not let him. I am at a total loss on what to do.   Like I told the doctor I think it is all in his head BUT either way there is something wrong.  I have severe mental health issues and maybe it is wearing off on him. I told the doctor. The doctor says he wants to ran test and then have him go to a Specialist. I am like he may be faking all this to get out of doing homework. A mothers intuition is usually right. But I will go through the process so I will not get arrested for not Having him in school. Mental health definitely effects our children Wow what a bummer.
244,"From the outside my life looks pretty boring. I am a shut in. I keep to myself. I complete puzzle books and watch reality shows and there's not a lot of drama here. No kids, no relationship, no pets. Drama free is what I strive to be.

But inside I am never, ever calm. I didn't even know this about myself until recently. I am always heartbroken, I am always nervous, and it's just shocking. 

I deliberately avoid drama of every sort. I don't express any other emotion except for happiness around other people. (I think emotions are contagious and I have a guilt complex about it).

But I am very nearly always suicidal (probably a decade or more of that), chronically lonely and unable to trust other people. At all. 

CPTSD is why I'm like this and I wouldn't wish this on anybody. There's never a calm moment inside my head.

At least I'm aware, I guess."
245,"How inspirational is this woman!!! 

Chimpanzee attack leaves woman without a face.

The video mainly showcases her upbeat disposition. She makes her focus the people around her, and never has a negative thing to say, about anything.

It's stories like this that make me feel like I take my own situation too seriously. I love this woman. I wish her all the best. Beautiful soul."
246,"when I was 17 my mother took her life 
after 18 attempts at overdose 
I was not living with her 
I had gone to live with Dad 
because I couldn't cope with her MH episodes 

my brother remained living with her 
and he found her doing the last attempt in her bedroom, 
she pleaded with him not to call anyone 
which caused him to hesitate 

then he phoned an ambulance 
when he realised she was not moving  

he obviously ' carries guilt ' from the delay 
while I carry guilt from not being there with him 

both of us would have had ptsd at the time 
which went untreated 
and to this day I still dont know how ptsd is treated 

I had an anorexic phase , a bad relationship and my MH started to slide 
while my brother fell into drink and drugs 

now the family expect me to be the chief carer for him 
as they are all ' busy working '

247,"After I was assaulted at 15 years old, I dropped out of school and stayed in my house for over a year. I was terrified to go outside. I wouldn't even go get the mail. I took baby steps and eventually was able to get a job, finish school, even travel on my own.  I regretted this year that I felt I lost because the assault had full control over my life. 

I have a friend now who invites me to dinner on Fridays as well as a lot of other people. One guy who started coming is super creepy. He is always looking at me and my body. He winks at me. He is married and his wife is there but he will try to tease me in front of her. The dinner is really the only social interaction I have outside of school and my fiancee. 

It was really nice while it lasted but now I am afraid to go. I talked to my friend about him and she said she will seat him away from me but just being in the room is too much for me. I wish she would just disinvite him. He is her neighbor though. I am afraid he will try to touch me or attack me in her house. 

I feel like I am failing by not just sticking it out and going. I am afraid of getting worse. I have worked hard to confront my symptoms. Not going will make me feel like a failure and that I am falling back wards. I regretted letting fear control me before but now it is again ☹️"
248,"While watching a movie a sporadic thought out of the blue hit me like a brick.

""I'm really scared; scared of going back into a workplace""

I'm 60 and have intellectualized pseudo courage and conviction. Now, the prospect of going back is as real as it gets; scary f'n shit.

Loved one's who've never had MH problems say; ""Hey, you'll be fine! You need money. Bite the bullet and get back to work ok""

When the feeling hit, suicidal thoughts rushed my body and mind. Tears of helplessness poured down my cheeks. I haven't cried like that in a while. Remnants are still there.

I know what the problem is, I just don't know how to fix it. Complex PTSD was the result of my last workplace; 7 yrs in the making. I've done well to block memories out, but the subconscious remembers, so does my poor body. I was a broken woman sitting on the edge of a razor blade.

Feelings like that don't just disappear into oblivion. I need to do this slowly if at all. Desensitization techniques will maybe help, but explaining this to employers is a huge risk.

Feeling trapped between a rock and a hard place."
249,"I don’t think I can work with children anymore. I don’t know if I can work in any sort of service industry. 

Children, their growth, development, and happiness are my passion. I love working with them and I thought that doing so was a no brainer. I’m 22k in debt from my education to work with them and now that I’ve been in the field for no more than six months it’s becoming clear to me that my trauma is not nearly as well handled as I thought. 

I had such a shitty childhood, and I work so hard to not have that colour everything I do but every time I interact with a kid all I can see is potential signs of their suffering. I am consumed with the fear of their pain. Struggling with different emotions and social situations is just a part of life, but it is literally tearing me apart that I can’t know to what extent these kids are suffering and that I can’t make it better. Every time a kid gets upset about something I am frozen in fear that I’m looking at a symptom of some deeper trauma or mental illness and just missing the signs. It’s completely crippling.  

But it’s not even just children. It’s so much worse with kids, but every person that I interact with there is this inescapable black hole in my head and my chest filling me with the knowledge that every person is suffering and there is nothing that I, or anyone else, can do to stop it. 

I was so mental ill in my childhood and my home environment that was incredibly damaging. I needed someone, anyone, to take note. But no one ever seemed to notice or if they did they didn’t care that I was a foot from the edge at any given moment. I thought that I had dealt with that enough to not let it get to me, but every time I do much as meet eyes with a stranger on the street my head is racing with all the ways that person might need help and we’re all just too blind to see the signs. 

I don’t know what to do. My job is killing me slowly and my mental health feels worse than it’s been in a while. But I can’t think of anything I can do that won’t run me up against this same problem. We live in a world that is so incredibly hurtful and damaging to everyone in it. We all suffer, and we are all powerless against it. And I can’t stop myself from feeling responsible to do something about it. 

I can’t work in an environment where I’m supposed to be helping people. But I don’t know what else there IS to do. I just want to find a job that isn’t immensely triggering. But what doesn’t trigger me? 

I have no idea what direction to take my life in."
250,"one of my most embarrassing problems ! 
people are talking to me and my mind wanders off somewhere 
then I have to pretend that I have been listening 
or they will think I was not interested and being rude 

usually its not that I'm not interested 
its just what they are saying makes me think of something myself 

and ive been like this since my mothers suicide 35 years ago 
and subsequently getting into a violent relationship 
with someone with a mental illness 

my head is always full of issues that I'm trying to figure out

252,"i feel so alone -- i am scared that when people know about my abuse they will hate me or think that i am dirty and tarnished. i know it wasnt my fault but i feel such a strong sense of self loathing and just want to scrub and scub at myself
i can never feel clean enough"
253,"I made a super long post but don't see it on the board. Maybe it was too long. Anyway, I have only been in relationships with abusive men. I was married to two of them. The last one ended last year and I ended up in a homeless shelter. My parents were abusive. My father molested me and so did an uncle. 

I havenever had a good relationship with a man until now. He is 54 and I am 36. He is very loving and sweet. He is not violent. He doesn't drink or do drugs. He is a stable man with a good job. He likes to work. But as the  day gets closer I have been having worse anxiety than normal. I have been having nightmares especially about ex #2. I am worried he will crash the wedding and shoot me. He has guns and threatened me with them before. Sometimes I just want to be alone and never be in a relationship again. I have a therapist and will see her next week. I have been drinking to cope."
254,I am a true mess with alcohol. Willing to go to jail to get more. Something has to give I can not live like this anymore. What is going on with me I was sober for 7 years plus. Just need to stop drinking.

257,I can not believe I have been awarded benefits. I can agree with this as my teenage son just became violent with me and I threw a skillet at him. Hit the dog. I can not understand the teenage years right now. My son is hungry after going to school I am to buzzed to care right now. I am fucked up. I need to cook but can not. I just feel so lost. What is wrong with me. I drink alcohol which is not good especially after knowing I have been accepted in the USA for Social Security benefits. Need to slow down and apoligise to my son. Thank goodness I did not hurt the dog. Or my son just a little crazy right now
258,I feel like crap. I am withdrawing from some of my medications-and I am drinking beer to help feel worst about myself. Not sure what else to say. I have PTSD with Psychosis. I am withdrawing from my antipsychotic. Plus valium. Feel terrible with withdraw. Not working right now which is havoc. Wish I knew a better way. Something has to change. My antipsychotic med made me feel nothing no crying no anything. All my emotions controlled by meds and without them who knows. Thank you for listening.

261,"im so tired of having to wait for a new song to start playing in the background everytime im about to start a meal at a restaurant/food place just in case ""the song"" comes on, the one that instantly makes me think of him and ignites my fight or flight response and brings instant panicky tears, because im sure as hell not gonna be caught in the middle of eating with that song starting, and me having to run out of the place with my food half done, completely embarrassing myself. god forbid it finally be taken off of mainstream rotation, right? after over 5 years? im tired of having moments still soured when i hear a different song but from the same band, though im just thankful it was this and not ""the song"".

but even thinking about the smallest amount out of any of that, i see his face in my head and i am just so tired of it. it hurts. it damages me more and more everytime. im not healing. you shouldnt be out there openly living your life. you ruined so many things for me. why? practically anywhere music plays, im constantly at risk of hearing ""the song"". the car, swimming pools, amusement parks, the store, the mall. all of the places i love, the places i depend on to heal, everywhere. sometimes i can avoid it managing to cross my mind, other times i cannot, and that is often.

and im definitely not safe on the internet either. ive had a trace of the song sent to me directly by a friend before, though they had no idea about my trauma, and i dissociated for who knows how long just from that. they were completely apologetic and understanding when i explained it to them, but still it adds to the fact that no matter what i do, i can still never seem to completely escape it. even typing this i find ""the song"" popping into my head and i physically wince. please just stop. please stop. stop. im so so so so tired."

Plain truth is; I don't sleep well, to start with. Once I get out, I tend to wake, following a horrible phase of unhappily dreaming. Then, I'll lay there, maybe for Hours, dreading some nebulous thing, which I can only really describe as Life!

I'm sure plenty of us need no further explanation of That shit?!


Well, last night, I'm drifting around Youtube. God knows how I came up with  Ten Hours of  fucking Thunder Storm?! But, I did.

  Clicked it. Listened to a moment, or two, of rolling thunder, and pissing rain. It just sounded Right! So right, in fact, that I made the mad decision, there and then, to play it All Night!

Got on the futon. Cuddled my Cuddle Pup. Blissfully listened to rolling thunder and pissing rain.

Woke up, eight hours later. Snap! Fully alert. Languishing in the beautiful sound of thunder and rain. Allowed myself a few seconds more of it. Told the Dogs it was time we rock and rolled. Got up, ready to face the world....!


Interestingly; Even since starting this post, I've been on mike to my friend in NZ. She too has PTSD. I linked her to the thunder.

She's like; "" Oh .....yeah! ..... Oh! God, Yeah!!! "" :D

And, it seems like there's Loads of this sort of shit, out there? Dig In, people! Try some!


TL;DR?"

Questions asked were about my daily living-what do I do all day. Why I go through jobs and what my work history was. Also about my psychotic episodes and how often they happened.

277,"When it hits the fan, and we find ourselves in a situation where our minds are in potential overload, shock and eventual shutdown. Not to mention suicide through creative means and an interesting way of destruction. An obvious eye opener and no doubt draw interest from the masses.
Do you know what its like to have the world recognise this? Like mother nature has your back, understands you and will protect you from further harm? Do you know what this does to a labrat?
Well i can tell you, i went super soft, i still feel special, i would have been better recognising however that i am not, at the time. But i needed empathy, no one will understand how many needles they poked me with, from angles that hurt me on so many levels. This is why i became obsessed with the abstract ideas because nothing was concrete, i was trying to make sense of it.
No one will ever take responsibility for your fuck ups, and even when they do. Its you who is left with the guilt and no self worth. Thats why i want to fight because i am ashamed of what my family thinks of me, my dads funeral will require alot of str.ength but i will stand up and be counted.
 Where they are from a human gets reduced to an animal if they are irresponsible. A dog. Im not a fucking dog. Im a fucking legend, you see the mentally? Its good vs evil to the extreme. And everyone is now a friend or foe, black and white, dark and light, i obsess over it. I make enemies out of ordinary folks, because what else am I? Someone who gets put in thier place constantly since birth, not a chance.
Things change us for better or worse. I recognise i am a serious problem, but i am conditioned, i must take responsibility for my actions though. Even if i have been reduced to this, there is still pride left and the motivation to change."

Any thoughts?"
280,"I was officially diagnosed with PTSD within the last year from an abusive relationship I was in almost two years ago now. I was in the relationship for 5 years which included manipulation, emotional, paychological, financial, sexual and threat of physical abuse.

I started noticing my depression worsening around the same time of year, I become sensitive, irritable, have worse flashbacks and nightmares than rest of the year, self harm, suicidal ideation, and just general fatigue. I am on medication that had worked fantastically up until now. I was improving.

My trauma was in the end of June, but it is a build up getting worse and worse starting a month before. I had experienced similar trauma throughout the relationship but this one experience was very traumatizing as I was immobilized and incapable of being able to say or do anything to even attempt to stop it. 

I have been having a lot of trouble being alone, to the point where almost the second I am away from my friends/boyfriend I begin to have creeping suicidal thoughts and have to distract myself. As it gets closer I have been unable to distract myself. I have been self-harming, and that typically has kept me ""satiated"" for a few days as I'm embarrassed because my boyfriend gets upset (he doesn't get angry at me just gets upset that I didn't reach out) but I don't want to smother him with all my problems or chase him away because I'm fixated on this past event. He has a psych background and is amazing and helps me so much but he also deals with a lot of his own depression and anxiety and I feel awful just dumping my crap on top of his. 

I don't know what to do. I'm see a psychiatrist but the meds have more side effects the higher the dosage and its only worse during this time.  How do you all cope with anniversaries? 

I'm trying to not stay drunk or sleeping, I have the means to do so, but I don't want to lose two months of my life because I can't cope..."
281,"I'm trying to piece together a lot of my health. The NHS who are useless and incompetent haven't really touched on it, even though it's a problem they are aware of (but I've said about them in another post).

What it is, is when my main family members were alive, they were unwell with degenerative illnesses. Their illnesses resulted in them having regular falls. I could be downstairs and one could go upstairs to sort out some bits in their room. Suddenly a loud bang or crash was heard, often followed by screaming. I'd go up and there they were, on the floor. Sometimes injured, other times in tears.

This was a regular thing with the family members for about 15 years until they passed away.

For quite some time now I think it adds to my anxiety and stuff. If I'm out and about and I hear a loud noise, the same feelings come back as I experienced when my family would have those falls. Feeling upset, on edge, shook up.


It's the same with coughing/retching sounds. My family had all sorts of different nasty types of meds. Often the side effects were extreme with vomiting/dry retching being a regular thing. It was horrendous to see. Mum was terrified, mostly crying out loud while it was happening and having it block up her throat so she couldn't breathe. 

Out and about now I get very on edge and have that upset feeling when hearing someone coughing (As that's how these puking episodes started, a few coughs, into retching and so on). 


Is that PTSD?"
282,"I'm in my mid 30s and have finally accepted that my mother is never going to change and for me to be able to have a happy and healthy life I need to completely remove her from the equation. 
I won't go into details but she allowed a lot of horrific things happen to me as a child because she was a drug addict and didn't have the capacity to care. I missed a lot of school as she kept me home to look after her and look after my younger siblings. 
I've been in therapy for a few weeks and it's brought to light just how much she still hurts me even though I'm an adult now and she is no longer drug dependent plus she lives in a different country! 
Without throwing accusations or being angry, I emailed her and told her that I was upset about something she had recently said to me and it wasn't the first time so I needed a break in contact. 
Her reply made it clear to me that she's never going to change or ever attempt to fight for me. She said 'I'm clearly a huge source of anguish to you and if you need space then fine. Take care of yourself'
This really made me angry, and for myself I replied and went into detail of past and current trauma she has put me through and that I'm done allowing her to hurt me. 
I have no intention of any further communication with her but I have a notification on my phone that she has replied again. I don't know if I should even read her response or just delete my email and block her. Or should I read it because I might always wonder what she said? Help!"
283,"I will state the facts as directly as I can for this event.

Many years ago my friend and I were in our early teenage years when we witnessed a friend of ours getting assaulted. The young girl was not simply assaulted but I do not want to go into specific detail. The experience affected us greatly. 

More recently the friend with whom I witnessed this event sadly took her own life. Again I won't go into explicit detail on this simply out of respect.

My friend and I used to lean on each other for support when times got tough and we were overcome with confusion and anger. Now that my support from her is gone I am experiencing significant bouts and anger, paranoia and hearing voices. I have not told anyone else about my feelings regarding this incident because of the inadequacy I feel about myself of not being able to cope. I appreciate it may sound silly coming to an internet forum first, but I feel so lost and hopeless."
284,"My 21yr old son joined the military a couple years ago & about a year ago he asked me if I would be his girlfriend (after just breaking up with his girlfriend) & I was in total shock. He then asked me if I would have sex with him!! I was so freaked out,I went to see a therapist to find out what was wrong w/my son. She basically said that she had never seen or heard of anything like this & that he should seek therapy. He did see a therapist a couple times, but obviously nothing ever came of it. Im sure it was a military therapist. Now that he has deployed, im seeing more & more problems. He asked me if he could take pictures of me in my underwear, when he comes home on vacation..He said because I have a beautiful body. Im just totally disgusted & don't know what to do. Now before you jump to conclusions & assume he has ptsd or that he's stressed because he's at war, all of these thoughts & feelings were apparent even before deployment & quite possibly before even joining the military. I only became aware of his thoughts after he joined. Im so worried about him. So many times he also asks me if he can wear his underwear around the house when he comes home. The other day he sent me a text message to a porn sight. He just doesn't seem to understand that thing's you share with your girlfriend, are thing's you don't share w/your mom! He can't seem to diferentiate between the two relationship's. Awhile back he told me he wanted to go camping w/me when he comes home & that he wanted me to sleep in the tent w/him. I told him that wasn't going to happen. He also said that since he's deployed, he's having a lot of problems where he will have ejaculation at times when he's not even thinking about sex, just through the course of the day. He did see a Dr for this problem & he wears ""special underwear"" & had his prostate checked, but im not sure what they told him the problem was. he always gets upset when I tell him these are not normal thoughts or behaviors. He says he just wants to be close to me & I try to explain to him that a mother & son dont sleep together & that we can still sit by the fire & chat, but we dont need to actually sleep together. Im just so sick about this, so please don't respond by telling me my son is a freak &/or a sicko. That's not the kind of help im looking for. I have two questions: first of all, has anyone ever heard of this problem..and how do you classify it? And secondly, what can be done about it? He obviously needs a lot of help, but if he's 21 & out of the household, what can I possibly do? Please help, my son & I always had a good relationship & nothing weird. His father passed away when he was 11 & i know that's been difficult, to say the least, but he seems to have greaved in the normal way & he really is a wonderful, caring person. Please help"
285,"No, I'm not a ""good listener"" actually, I used to be, but that was before everything caught up with me, when I could care, be patient, try to help and even-wanted to. 
When you, who I barely know, accost me in the street, in order to offload your troubles, at length, I do feel sad and concerned. But I cannot usefully advise, I cannot change anything, I cannot fix it all. I don't think I even care that much, as awful as that sounds. You knew me in a previous life, when I was a worker, someone it would be appropriate to seek help from. Even then, I was crap at it, but I could hide it better. I had patience and I could perform a role. 

Now, I just feel used, drained, broken. Convenient. Ugh. I've been convenient to a few in my life. It is no achievement. 

Maybe the exterior appears calm, kind... , it even smiles sometimes. But I am not, I am consumed by stuff that would make you run. I am overwhelmed by so much stuff that feels unspeakable.  Not that I had chance to speak. I am vessel. I am fighting and numbing in turn, to avoid triggers that break my cover. I am glad that you could offload. I do hope it helped in some way. But you didn't find a ""good listener"", you found a broken vessel who cannot hold anymore."
286,"Just read Purple Daffodils' thread, Here. And I got the craziest idea ~ 'crazy', because I'm the last person on earth to go on about crystals, faith healing, homeopathy or voodoo ~ But, I wonder if there are any state registered, recommended and employed by the health services, bona fide and proven Hypnotists out there?

Just thought, maybe they could 'wipe' PD's preoccupation with this, given, time of year.

But, then; If that was the case? Surely, none of us would be living with PTSD anyway? 'Bad day at the office'? Straight round to the local, registered, watch swinger. Whole event wiped from ye mind. Go in peace.

287,"That I am living in a building with a cult. They are not a traditional religious cult - but they are like the cult from the ""Rosemary's Baby"" film. Minus the serious crimes. They look for any opportunity to try and hurt myself or my mother. Or anyone who is not a member of their cult. I need someone to help me. My stepbrother won't help. Other neighbors steer clear of the cult. But I am stuck right next to them. They are all around me. One of them was just rolled into an ambulance yesterday screaming in fear or pain. And covering her eyes. I'm hoping that wherever the paramedics took her, she's never coming back. But she probably will. That is the horror that is my daily life. They are all around me. Everyday. Everything is business as usual in the cult leader's absence. That's the worst part."
288,"I was in a very bad domestic violence relationship where I was almost killed. My son and I moved in to live with family.... Unfortunately this situation was not much better. I had to move in with my bipolar narcissistic grandmother. She was really mentally abusive and made me feel very uneasy. She was constantly playing head games and doing things that were effecting my emotional well being. She was very intrusive and nosey. Going through my room, mail, and anything of mine. She made many lies and some being about family. I cut her out and my entire family out. No reason, no cause, no explanation for my other family. I did this because of things she said.... (that most likely were not true) and because of how violated and hurt I felt by her. I wanted nothing to do with her what so ever. I guess what made sense in my head at the time was cutting the entire family out. After going through therapy for the last 11 months I felt ready to reach out to one of my cousins. I was not met with such a nice reply and I am very hurt. I understand why he was upset but I just wish he would listen as to why I did what I did. Has anyone else went through this. I have PTSD, ADD, and anxiety."
289,"I am keen to get other peoples opinions on a current dilemna i am facing. 

I left my job under the advice of my wife in December as physical symptoms and behaviours associated with my cPTSD were getting worse.  My wife's words ""you were not in a good way"".  Now i have used the time since to do some intensive EMDR (3 hours a week) and i have been resting and managing the weight of that.  

I feel i am in a better place now, and have started to look for work now, as my buffer fund is running out.  

Now, my old boss who is narcissist / aggresive, who i dont like, and i think used my good nature to achieve her own personal goals (i dont know how to be assertive at work generally and particularly with her), she wants to hire me back.  The job pays well, and anything else i have been applying for doesnt pay as much (big gap), the recruitment market is brutal at the moment for my skills and experience.  i also want to change careers and feel that by doing this i can save some to allow that to happen, i feel if i have some more direction i can handle it better.  However, there is this latent issue of going backwards, of not moving forwards, after taking such a big step and movement.

my wife says, if i do go back, i need to have a plan, and methods to how to deal with it better, and look to change it slightly.  For me, i feel its more, take the money, use it as a base to then start looking for work, as from a CV point of view, it will look ok as i am returning to the same company, and i can then start looking into the careers i want to shift into.  

So i say all that, with the fact that i have former colleagues who have been out of work for 6 months to two years, and some have had to move abroad given the changing nature of our work.  So it feels like, its logical to take it.

Anyway, i am a bit allover the place, but wanted some guidance and thoughts please
thank you kindly"

291,"So, as a new member,  my introduction posts along with this one have been written during my Easter Sunday in accident and emergency.

I suffer from PTSD with anxiety and depression.

The reason I am in A&E?
Suspected withdrawal symptoms after stopping taking my medication. Althoughit could be a neurological disorder caused by my medication.....

Either way, I am refusing to take any more of the meds. Despite being in some kind of semi painful, insomnia induced fog, I can still think clearer than at any point in the last 20 years. And yesterday I  laughed....
Genuine laugh..... I have not done that for 20 years"
292,"Hi, I hope I'm in the right place. I was diagnosed with PTSD around 4 years ago and have had really bad problems since with my mental health but over the past 1 year I have been getting different symptoms and my doctor says it's down to my mental health but I don't see how. 

Every other week I am coming down with flu-like symptoms, coughing up phlegm with black dots in it, night sweats are really bad, a constant whooshing in my head, diarrhea and just feeling generally unwell. It comes in waves, I am ok for a week then it hits me again and can be there for up to a month. I have been to my doctor on many separate occasions but they say there's nothing and puts it down to my mental health but how can this be? 

needless to say, it is doing my mental health no good and keeps dragging me back into a hole, any advice of info would be greatly received.

Thank you"
293,I went to Doctor and they diagnosed me with PTSD with psychosis. I have not had a psychotic break for a few months so in my mind I am okay. I easily I forget that this disorder does not disappear.  Thta is what confusings me. I will be alright for a time and then boom I am out of control-hardly remember what caused the breakdown just know that I extremely overreacted to situation. Does anyone else have these experiences?  Love to hear anything that might make sense whay this happens.
294,"i am emotionless in an environment where everyone else is fine. i am alone, panicking inside, scared, wanting to escape inside of my head... and no one ever asks if i am ok because i look fine on the outside. i hide my issues well enough for people not know that i am not well at all."
295,"Okay. Librium down the neck. Think I'll grab a beer. Then, sitting as comfortably as I seem able, lately? I'll begin. God knows where it'll lead us.

Each day, I fire up this machine and begin my day. Time was, I'd have half a dozen, usually quite long, emails, from friends. Then, I'd wade into the fora and would try to answer as many posts, directed at or otherwise fascinating me, as I could. Until my day ended in exhaustion, and stuff left till tomorrow.

Then, I became blessed with chronic PTSD. I developed this amazing ability to go from 0 to 60, before a Ferrari even saw me move. I developed the persona of a Honey Badger, crossed with a Pit Bull, on steroids, with a fucking tooth ache. And That, it seems made me a walking, talking target for every prick on every forum out there. Especially those pricks who'd be slung a Mod badge, by the site owner who couldn't give a fuck.

Or; Maybe I've just become a walking liability, with a super enhanced ability to upset the shit out of 90% of people who come across what I type? Maybe my response, to my own condition, has moulded me into some sort of Marvel Comics "" Mega Prick "" character?

 I remember my old dear actually,  and literally, lamenting the fact that she could no longer recognise what her own son had become. And, she's been dead well over a decade. God alone knows how I've mutated since?

But, I Do Know I'm in a shit ton world of fucking pain! I can't help it. They couldn't help it. You can't help it. And, I'm frankly fucking terrified. Because, when I fired up this machine today? THIS was the only place left, on the known (to me) internet where I can post! I'm Banned From The Fucking Internet!!!

I can read shit. Sure. There are fora where the great unwashed can sit and stare at what Members are posting. But, I'm like a ghost. The invisible, muted man. "" Great post, mate! "". "" In my experience? The cause might well be ..... "".  "" Oh, ye can get that from here ... "". Nothing. None of that. It's like I'm in a state of 'Virtual' Cata fucking Tonia! I can see it. Hear it. Can't move a muscle to respond to it.

 Am I just loosing the fucking plot? Is this some weird response, of my own, to my condition? Has anyone else ~ not banned from Here, yet! "" LOL! "" ~ experienced this 'syndrome'?

For the record; I'm as 110% Certified a sufferer of Chronic PTSD as it gets. Rafts of Consultant Psychiatrists, over the span of Years have All agreed. I'm a fucking head wreck. Complete scrap heap material. Beyond hope.

That you? I'd Love to compare notes! Forgive me; Not interested in the "" My Daddy smacked my legs forty years ago. Now, I'm self diagnosed as Schizoid Bi Polar with PTSD and a cardboard box fetish thrown in, for shits and giggles. "" crew.

  I'm putting this shout out to the genuine, hard core, no two ways about it veterans of this Vile and life destroying fucking condition. Because, I've had it about twenty years now. Nothing's getting the least bit better. And I'm Seriously feeling on the fucking edge!

Anyone ....?


Please?!?"
296,"Thought I'd kick this one off, amongst my fellow PTSD sufferers. I'm sure many conditions may cause varying degrees of social isolation, for what ever reasons. But, I haven't got many conditions. I've got chronic PTSD. And, it's pretty much directly attributable to my secondary condition; That of practically the high ninety's  percent  of complete social isolation.

Looking back, I guess I can sort of see how all started. As soon as the incident had occurred, my own mother began lamenting that she didn't recognise me any more. She always said that in a deeply sad and regretting way. I never once thought to ask her to sit down and explain to me how I'd changed.

Then, I was called in for one of their 'chuck you off the sick' assessments. This bloke was actually perfectly friendly. And, as it was my first ever, I hadn't yet learned what absolute bastards that lot were to become. But, his demeanor made me relaxed and I remember explaining to him, perfectly honestly and openly, how I was surprised and puzzled to have realised I now lived in a triangle.

  That's to say, I'd get on my bike, every day, and ride to work.That was one line of my triangle. Then, I might cross the short distance to my old dears flat. Second line. From there, back home. My triangle. I barely ever deviated any more. That was my comfort zone and I'd start losing my shit if I tried to leave it. Then, I started losing my shit at work .....

I won't bore you with the rest of my life story. Just suffice to say that Rabies is also known as the Running Disease. Because an afflicted animal, not having any concept of what the hell's going on, will try to run away from the shit in its head. I did that too. I left my home town, practically on a moments whim. Very easy, emotionally, as I'd long since detached from everyone around me.

Then, I hunkered down in my new place and only went out, to shop, on my trusty push bike. That kept me safely isolated from the real people bustling along the pavements. My only 'social life' was on line. Emailing and chatting on fora and in chat rooms.

  Finally, even the fact that fucking people kept knocking my door ~ the sort of constant traffic one experiences in an poorer urban setting. Would I be interested in double glazing? Why didn't I have a TV license? Would I like to see this catalogue of gadg ..... "" Fuuuck Offf!!!!! "", sadly, became my normal response. To this day, if even I accidentally make a knocking sound? My hackles rise!

  And now, the Running has led me here. Smack bang middle of nowhere. My nearest neighbours dotted about in the far distance. No one comes near me. I go no where. When I die? God knows how, or when they'll ever find out. Cest la vie. Suits me.

But, here's the kicker: I'm also now banned from practically 99% of the fucking internet! This place is one of only Two fora that haven't banned me ~ yet! And, the other one Has banned me from their fucking Chat Room!

Okay, it's not as if I've made a lifes work of running around, upsetting the mod's on every forum I could find. It's extremely difficult to find a forum, these days. Everything's gone over to fb.

Maybe this place is here because the owners have the fucking sense to realise we're not about to talk about ourselves, publicly, using our real fucking names! "" My name's John Smith. And I'm a fucking lunatic. "" may not be the wisest thing to come out with on fb!

But, I did join it, once. Using a 'Handle' ~ genuinely not realising ye mean't to provide ye real name, address, phone number and bank details. Mate of mine got me invited onto half a dozen 'private' Groups. Inside of two weeks, I'd got myself banned from every fucking one of them. He's never spoken to me since!

So, yeah; Social Isolation. I'm an absolute Passed fucking Master of it. Don't know why. Don't know what I do so wrong. Never asked my old dear, and she's long dead now.

But, I used to have mates. I'd go places with them. I had hobbies and interests I'd fervently discuss, on fora. My email was murder to keep up with. So many people wanting to chat with me. I was Normal!

Now? Spiraled so fucking far down, I'm practically Robinson fucking Crusoe! And even Friday's fucked off on me!

Anyone ....?


Tldr? Do You talk to any fucker, any more?"
297,"How do you deal with the memory of traumatic events if it's not actual ptsd? :cry:

298,"Hi I am new to this forum, I found out about it after my PTSD-Suffering girlfriend ended our relationship a couple of weeks ago. Since then, I have been reading more about the condition to try and gain a better understanding of how it feels and what to do etc.

We were together for 1year and 6months, from the first day we met we clicked and had a strong, loving and caring relationship throughout. We had our disagreements at times, but always managed to talk through them and move on together as a couple.
We made a lot of memories together, none of which I will ever forget or regret for the rest of my life. Including trying new activities we never thought we would and attending music festivals.

Everything seemed to be running smoothly for us, I felt we both loved eachother dearly and had become a major part of eachothers lives. I knew from the start that she suffered with PTSD from her childhood, but this didn't change anything between us I loved her for her and I tried my best to understand what she was going through (although i can only imagine what it really feels like for her), she always knew I was here for her no matter what it was that she needed.
A couple of months ago, things got tough for her, she was hospitalised having started to feel extremely suicidal, but still I loved her more than ever and stood by her side through it all. She pulled through and we enjoyed another couple of months together it what seemed to be a solid and relationship. 
However, a couple of weeks ago this all changed, she became cold in her messages and our contact became less frequent. My girlfriend suggested we go on a break while she takes time to focus on herself. But after a week, I messaged to check up on her we had a good chat, but then suddenly she ended our relationship, saying that she doesn't want to hurt me anymore and have to make me deal with what she is going through too. She said she needs time to focus on herself and rebuild from the bottom and to do this she needs to start afresh and go on alone.

As much as I am trying to understand why this all happened so suddenly and the way that she feels, I can't help but blame myself for the situation. I'd do anything for this girl, as I loved her dearly throughout our relationship, and I will continue to do so. We agreed to stay friends, so I am still there for her in the capacity of a friend when she needs it, but I feel like the relationship had so much more to offer for the both of us. Do you think there's any chance she may get back with me, or do I just have to accept the situation and move on knowing I've lost something that was a big part of my life.
Sorry if I sound a little stupid in writing this, I just need some advice or to talk to someone that has been through a similar scenario themselves?"
299,"That's probably what my neighbors think of me,that I am just this crazy lady that they hear letting out a loud scream at random times throughout the week.

I have moved into a new town,in an apartment surrounded by other apartments.The walls are not paper thin to where you can hear everything people are saying and doing but they are thin enough that I hear muffled voices and other noises they make.I definitely know I would hear if someone screamed very loud.

I know they can hear me loud and clear when I get startled.And I feel humiliated about it.Nobody has said anything to me,nobody has banged on my door to see if I am ok but I know they hear.I don't share with other people that I have PTSD really but I kinda feel like maybe I should casually mention it during small talk I have with neighbors when I am outside.Casually mention that my symptoms have been so outrageous lately that sometimes I am startled by my own shadow or just by walking by a mirror and catching a glimpse of myself out of the corner of my eyes and it makes me scream automatically.

I don't know though.Some people hear PTSD and think that a person with it will be violent or go postal on them or something.I don't want them to judge me or be afraid of me.Or maybe that's just my own fear and paranoia thinking the worst,I don't know.

I really like where I am living.Everyone is so friendly.I don't want to screw things up for myself.

I'm not sure whether to let it go and wait and see if anyone says something to me or say something now.I really don't want to be thought of as the crazy lady that moved in."

301,"Bit of foul language here. And some of you will not understand this. I apologize for that.

I was listening to Arnold Schwarzenegger giving his speech about ""working your ass off"". About how he had little money and he had to work in construction overtime to make ends meet, and working himself out to the brink of exhaustion.
That's how he succeeded.

This was getting old to me. I was grown up in an environment exactly like he went through. I detest his bullshit.

Work your ass off. No excuses. Push harder and you'll succeed. Mantras that I've heard every day when I was young. Not just in workouts. But in academics and all kinds of performance.

I was exhausted in this. Very tired. But I pushed further. And I mentally snapped, had a breakdown, and got into heaps of trouble. I brought harm and danger.

I got into trouble by law enforcement and was almost sent to jail (I will not share about my crime). All because I wanted to push further. All because I wanted to perform perfectly. I only earned a severe nervous breakdown and got busted.

And yet I pushed on until, I realized that I needed to relax and find comfort. Then I found peace.

The trauma gets me every time these hard-headed motivational speakers tell me to push hard. The cops. The flashbacks of jail (although I didn't go to one- I only watched shows of it when I was a teen). The traumatic memories come back to me.

In addition with the trauma, this pisses me off. Arnold said about most Americans aren't satisfied about their job, and blamed on the audience that it's their lack of effort to find their passions.

This gave me the ass. I was grown up in a society that you have to give up your passions. Work your ass off to survive.
There were plenty of people told me to be successful to survive. Some urged me to do this to the brink of death! But if you swap this to aim your passion, it's alright. Right? Fuck this.

You can't just grind your desires to the brink of exhaustion. You can't just work off. Especially if you snap and let your anger go out of control."
302,"Hi,

I have had a lot happen to me in my 23 years. I lost my mom to lung cancer at the age of 5. I am the only child my birth parents had.My dad started dating my step mom when I was 8. Neither his parents or my real moms parents really approved of the relationship or her so there  was constant fighting all throughout my childhood. They broke up and got back together twice before they got married. Through this I gained a step sister who was 8 years older so she was not majorly involved in my life but still a positive influence. During this time my dads parents, my real moms parents, and my step mom we’re always fighting. My step mom has yelled and threatened to divorce and leave my dad so many time I lost count. I have a younger half sister from the two of them who I have pretty much raised. I always felt that I was just someone to watch their child for free instead of a daughter. I got pushed to the middle and they didn’t pay much mind to me at all. Recently they found out I have credit card debt that I accumulated from putting work into a broken down car over and over again, buying books for college and paying to take teacher certification exams. When they found out they forced me to drain my savings to pay it down. They also gave me a down payment towards a new car which they surprised me with at time of purchase and said “ I stole money from them” bc I didn’t tell them about the debt that I was trying to manage on my own. They charge me $500 per month to live in my own home and that has made saving money difficult. I put a deposit down on an apartment bc they told me I had till May 1st to move out and when I told them the move in date would be sooner they got pissed and said that I could not take the car (the loan is in my name) with me. They told me if I tried to take it anyway then they would write me out of the will and write me off forever. My stepmom also has put me down my whole life and says things like that all the time and then retracts it the next day like everything is all peachy keen. For example, the other day we went out to brunch and we couldn’t even make it through a 45 minute breakfast without her making me cry. All she talked about was how my real moms family treated her so awfully and how I will probably have difficulty having kids some day bc my real mom had trouble having children. I just feel so scared and afraid my dad and I barely have any sort of relationship. We haven’t for years. My step mom obviously isn’t someone who I can confide in. My older sister trys to be there but doesn’t really follow through. My grandparents are the only ones who have never really let me down but they are too old to be dealing with this. I do have friends that are amazing and a boyfriend but our relationship is newer so I’m just starting to open up to him about this. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like when I try to move forward and fix things I just end up taking steps backwards. What can I do to improve this situation? I have been putting up with this for some many years. I just want to live my life and be happy."
303,"It's 3:30 in the morning. Couldn't sleep. Got myself my chamomile tea with sweetener and milk, and some ramen, because I'm too tired to fix myself anything else.

I'm going to tell you the brief version of my story.

I was a victim of emotional abuse as a child. My mother put me under an intense amount of pressure to be academic and the ""smart child"", and when I was diagnosed with depression at age 12, I was blamed for it. I was called a drama queen, attention-seeker, making things up, etc. because I was first depressed, and then anxious three or four years later. I never realized any of this at the time - and then at nineteen, looking through my journals from when I was young, I realized the truth. As I started putting the pieces together, I started remembering more of what was wrong - more injustices against the child who I was. I guess over the last three years, I just developed my PTSD, though I don't have any major flashbacks, and I'm not psychotic. I just get triggered without being sure why something was triggering, and it takes me time to realize that it was connected to how my mom treated me. I disassociated myself from her a little more than a year ago, and am only connecting with my dad in very short time.

Recently the stress of my job - which was manipulative and abusive to its employees in a different way - started affecting me, and I began displaying symptoms that my doctor nearly called manic. It was supposed to be fine; I was moving onto another job anyway, and I was taking the semester off to reevaluate my schooling. What's happened since then is the quitting from the first job, the loss of the new job, retreating onto disability, and looking at no new work until the new year. I wasn't sure what it was at first, but tonight it finally hit me. I'm a writer, and I'd been saddling my character with some pretty typical PTSD symptoms - and I realized that's what had been acting up. My PTSD.

When I realized, I was upset. I was mad at myself for not realizing it sooner, mad at my doctor for refusing to recognize what it was even after two sources have me down as with the disorder - I got so frustrated I had to resist breaking one of my two plates (I'm a bachelor, really) and had a crying fit because I was so frustrated I wanted to throw my phone across the room. I've felt isolated, abandoned, exhausted, and more in the past few months, and now recognizing that it's the PTSD that is getting worse is frustrating and terrifying. What's worse is that the medication that we've used to ease some of the previous symptoms is an antipsychotic -- so for me, it feels like there's very little wiggle room for this to stay at this juncture versus getting worse.

I just can't shake the feeling like I could've prevented this.

I know it's illogical, that this isn't my fault, but I don't know what to do. My counselor's trying to convince me to get into more social situations and events, but I don't want to - I'm scared to. I'm not very good socially, and I'm always scared of screwing up. And my finances are a wreck, too. I see my psychiatrist later this month, but now that I know what he's going to tell me, it feels like a waste. More medication, and then I'll really feel stupid for feeling so sick.

Even so, I don't know what to do with this, and I don't know what I can expect anymore. There's intense anxiety, a restless mind, bouts of depression, an urge to self-harm - and that's only two days. Just when I feel like I can escape it, it gets worse again. Today was supposed to be a GREAT day - and instead I had a meltdown.

So I guess my question is . . . what do I do now? Now that I've realized that this is the point my trauma has left me? I don't know enough about my own disorder to cope, and I certainly don't know how to take myself from on disability to onto my own two feet. And I can only hope that people here have advice - my friend, who referred me, said as much, and I want to believe in him and the people here. I have to believe in something.

If you got this far, thank you for reading. If you have advice . . . I could use anything right now."
304,"I was recently reading Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker, and it resulted in some breakthroughs with realizing things about myself.  I find the best way to communicate my emotions is through writing, so I wrote a short story that hopefully will help someone else in feeling not so alone.



When I was roughly 7 years of age I experienced the first instance that I can recall of fearing abandonment and having an emotional response to it. My mother was ill-prepared for the responsibilities of having two children by the age of twenty-three, and given the tumultuous relationship with my older brother, we were by no means easy to digest. For as long as I can remember, it was explained to me that my father abandoned our family as a result of not wanting another child when my mom became pregnant with me. As I am the youngest of two boys, this explanation also led my older brother to assume it as such. It was explained to me that my brother’s rage towards me, that oftentimes was excessively physical, was just his misplaced anger as a result of me symbolizing our family not being whole. I came along and dad left; it’s simple to work out that perception to a young child, but there were years and years of it being explained to both of us that put the symbology in concrete.

In all actuality, my biological father had become addicted to drugs, and he left our family because he had found another woman, one that supported his drug habit.  This was explained simultaneously once I was old enough to know what drug addiction was, but it didn’t resonate quite as deeply as being able to blame myself like I had been learning for years, so my childhood brain worked out the equation that I was the root cause, and a supplemental fact was that my father had an issue with drugs; it was not the other way around.

Going back to the dynamic with my brother, I can explain the conflict better with an anecdote: We’re 7 and 10 years old, and a small argument over what to watch after school escalated to my brother hitting me in the head with the handle of a rake by hurling it at me as I ran across the street with the TV remote in my hand. The blow to my head knocked me down, he ran over, grabbed the remote that had fallen out of my hand, and then went back inside. I got up after a few minutes and walked to the playground across the street to swing, but the motion of the swing made me dizzy, so I just sat in the mulch until I saw my mom’s car pull into the driveway a few hours later. I don’t recall ever telling anyone about this, but there is a cathartic feeling to write it down. I have a small scar on the back of my head as a result. Coincidentally enough, I have a scar above my right eyebrow that is from another altercation with my brother in my youth, but perhaps another time.

I only explain the relationship with my brother as a means of hopefully painting a picture as to what a single mother of two had to deal with on top of the rest of life’s stressors. I find myself contemplating this a lot. At my age, my mother had an 11 year old and an 8 year old that were complete hellraisers in her eyes, an unfulfilling job, and a ton of resentment towards her first husband. It goes without saying that she must have been stressed, and as she never sought guidance or help, it was a fairly toxic environment all around at most points.

One day during the summer, and I don’t remember what triggered my mother to do this; I imagine that me and my brother must have had another fight, but my mother calmly set on the front porch, completely silent, and then got up, started gathering her belongings from her room, and then told me that she couldn’t do any of it anymore, so she packed up car with her clothes and essential items she needed daily, and then left. My brother gravitated towards his room at the back of the house a lot, and I don’t recall him being present when my mother was leaving. All I can remember feeling is that the air was taken away from me, and that I needed to figure out a way to get by without the only parent I had. I stood there for a while, watching the door and crying, silently panicking that I didn’t have the skills needed to survive yet, and then worrying about my mother not having me because I felt that she needed me, and I felt that without me to take care of her, she wouldn’t  be strong enough on her own. I know I had a tendency to embarrass her, and that me and my brother stressed her out, but I could fix all of that if she would just come back.

While I waited for nothing to happen, I replayed instances in my mind about what I did to stress my mom to the point that she felt the only thing to do was leave. I recalled one time, a few months before she left for the first time, Pizza Hut had just come out with Stuffed Crust Pizza, and we were visiting her friends at a local clothing store that had ordered one. I got extremely excited because the commercials made it look delicious. They offered me a piece of pizza because I had told them how excited I was to try it one day, and I took it. It was awesome, and everything I hoped it would be. I thought of my brother back at home and asked if I could take a piece to him, for him to see how cheesy it was. They cut me a small piece to take home, and I remember being very thankful that they were so kind! I told them I would let them know how my brother responded to the cheesiness. We left shortly afterwards, and I was filled with excitement to share this with my brother. When we got in the car, my mom grabbed the back of my hair and started jerking me back and forth, slamming my head into the dashboard and screaming at me for embarrassing her. She felt that me asking for another slice of pizza made it look like she wasn’t feeding us at home. Once she let go of me, I just remember putting my face against passenger window, and not wanting to let her see me cry. I had dropped the slice of pizza for my brother in the floorboard, and I remember being disappointed that I wouldn’t get to share it with him, and then I felt sorry for him. We had an upcoming trip planned to SeaWorld through my aunt’s work, and my mom started yelling as she drove us both home that she wouldn’t be taking us on it. I turned around and started crying, thinking that if my brother found out why we weren’t going on the trip, that he would take it out on me.

I know that is probably hard to read; it was hard to write, and I cried while doing so. I am not simply trying to gain sympathy from people, but I hope that by sharing my experience, that maybe someone else will not feel the need to keep themselves shut off from personal connections like I have.

While I waited for nothing to happen, I remember being seven years old and creating the emotional response and safeguards that I still use today at thirty-one. Slowly, as I replayed instances where I was a disappointment and burden to others, I started to paint a picture that I still struggle with: That people are better off without me, and that my presence is more of a nuisance than it is welcomed.

Home videos from this time frame are uncomfortable because I have the sense now to understand what I was trying to do. In one video, I am 6 years old and sitting at the end of our street under a stop sign. I had packed a sandwich to take with me, and my mother was recording me on her camera from our porch. The hours ticked by, and my mother is swinging back and forth, recording me sitting there under the sign. She’s pointing out that it’s been so long, and I’m just playing in the dirt instead of running away like I intended to. Eventually I make my way back to the porch, and my mother sarcastically asks, “Why didn’t you run away? That’s what you were trying to do, wasn’t it?” My response made her laugh because I said, “Well I’m not allowed to cross the street.”

While I waited for nothing, I completely tore myself down and laid the groundwork for a life consisting of poor personal connections, and to grasp at overworking myself to feel like I have an impact on something positive. It’s human nature to gravitate towards where we are most successful, and I have never been successful with maintaining close relationships, so I gravitate towards work.

Eventually, after a few hours of being away, my mother returned. She had gone to the grocery store at some point during her outing, that she was supposedly not returning from, as she had her favorite snack foods like Swiss Cake Rolls, Oatmeal Pies, and Cheese Curls. I remember being excited that she was back, not relieved. She walked up on the porch and I hugged her, and then I thanked her for coming back."
305,"Hello everyone
I’m a 21 year old guy, and i had a bit of a rough upbringing. I noticed something in the past couple of years and it’s been sitting on my mind if it’s real or it’s just in my head. It has to do with my voice,and my hearing.

I have a voice that is so distinct, i remember one highschool teacher caught me talking to my friend, and said “i always know if it’s you talking, you have a distinct voice”.

I always thought my voice is really powerful, so i always felt the need to tone it down, but nowadays when i’m often told to repeat my sentences i dont think thats the case anymore. I’m starting to this this is just the effects of being silenced for so long.

If i were to describe my voice, it’s really ghastly, monotonous and easy on the ears. One thing it isnt is being sharp/high pitched. It’s low pitch and not deep. My ears are too sensitive to noise so that doesnt help in being able to talk loudly. 

I dont know what to do and its starting to become a real inconvinience. Im starting to talk from the diaphragm, and thats making my noise sharper, but i never know what’s the right volume. 

I’d like to know if this is a possible outcome of being silenced, and if there’s ways to fix it. 
Cheers, A."
306,"Hello Everyone, 

I'm new here, for 12 years I've been battling with my Ex'es friends and supporters, they claim that what he did was not rape and that he is the victim.  I have passed their lie detector test with the following account.
I would like to take the time to summarise the events that I have given account concerning HIM having sex with me without my consent.

I would like to once again also remind you all of the UK Rape Laws concerning Non Consent to sex .

Consent refers to whether permission or agreement has been given by one person to another. If two people intend to engage in a sexual act, consent must be established clearly beforehand to ensure that both parties are aware, comfortable and in agreeance. If consent is not established, any sexual acts that follow may not be recognised as lawful.
There are a number of reasons why consent may not be given, not simply because a person did not want to. The law recognises non-consensual sex as having occurred in any of the following situations:
If any of the parties were under the age of 13
If sex occurred under threat of violence or violent behaviour had taken place
If the victim was being threatened with violence against their loved ones
ME - If the victim was unconscious, asleep, too drunk to consent or drugged.
 
Fact: When intoxicated, an individual cannot legally consent to sexual activity. Forcing sex on someone who is too drunk to give consent is still Criminal Sexual Conduct in the Third Degree. Rape is a serious offense, and people who commit crimes while under the influence of alcohol or drugs are not considered free from guilt.

I ADVISED ALL THAT I HAD NEARLY 1LTR OF ALCHOHOL MIXED WITH ZOPICLONE SLEPPING TABLETS.
I COULD NOT AND WAS NOT IN ANY STATE TO PARTICIPATE OR CONSENT TO SEX.

I ADVISED ALL THAT I SAID ''NO'' TO HIM'

I DID NOT CONSENT TO UNPROTECTED SEX OR SEX. I HAD NEARLY 1TRE OF ALCOHOL MIXED WITH ZOPICLONE TABLETS.

HE PRETENDED TO SLEEP IN THE MORNING AND EVEN WENT SO FAR TO LIE WHEN I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD SEX WITH ME THAT NIGHT.
HE LIED BECAUSE HE KNEW HE HAD DONE WRONG. HE IS THE GUILTY ONE, NOT THE VICTIM.

It is important that you are all aware that I no longer have any fight left inside of me; I am mentally exhausted, in disbelief and broken. I feel akin to a china porcelain doll.

I would like to share with you the words that I finally passed the Lie Detector test with.

‘’That night I consumed nearly 1tr of Alcohol mixed with Zopiclone Sleeping Tablets. I remember saying ‘Is this for real or is this a Dream’  HE was having un-protected un-consensual sex with me without a condom. HE had reneged on my rule of always wearing a condom, due to his participation in Porn movies using un-protected sex.

He was to always wear a condom to protect me from any sexual diseases. And yes, at the time it felt pleasurable, but I was very drunk and had taken over the prescribed amount of Zopiclone Sleeping Tablets.

In essence HE was taking advantage of my drunken stupor.

It was when I opened my eyes that I saw HIM making demonic evil monster faces on top of me. I could feel that he was having un-protected sex with me without my consent. Therefore I knew that he was having sex with me.
 
I muttered something about a condom and I said NO. 
 
I do not remember anything after that.
 
When I woke up HE was pretending to sleep, I could tell that he was not sleeping. I called him 2-3 times, but he did not respond, he carried on pretending to sleep. I said, I know your not sleeping. Did you have Sex with me last night?’ HE said ‘NO’. I asked him again, I said ‘’You didn’t have sex with me last night?’ HE said ‘’NO.’’ HE Lied.
 
HE knew what he had done to me was wrong. I climbed out of my bed and saw something on my floor. I went over to pick it up; to my surprise it was a used condom. I turned around and said to HIM ‘’You lied! You did have sex with me last night!’’ I stormed out of my bedroom into the living room. I stayed there for quite some time staring out of the window, not knowing what to do. Eventually I came back into my bedroom and found HIM at the end of my bed with his head hanging down. He knew he did wrong. I then put my arms around HIM and said ‘Don’t worry, we’ll get through this’’
 
It was my intention for us to get checked for STD’s and seek counselling.

I spoke to a Rape Counsellor tonight who confirmed that what HE did to me was Rape. But he's friends state that because I knew he was having sex with me then it was not rape.  Their motto is ''SHE KNEW''

Thank you, your thoughts are gently needed please.x"
307,"There's a weird switch in my brain. The minute that I feel like I'm about to socialize, a different me takes over. I really never noticed that until just now, as I was about to share with you all the troubles I have.

As soon as I set out to type, BAM! There's a sunny, comedic me that comes out. I guess that's the thing I've always called 'disassociation'. But I really don't know what it is. Multiple personality?

Diagnosing myself isn't one of my strong suits; nevermind.

Okay, ya'll. Here's what I set to type:

I can't connect to other people. I really, really can't. And when I say connect, I mean; I can't bond with other people. Love and feel loved by. I Can love other people. I can do that thing that's not quite love, where you adore their every word and you idolize and coddle and care of another person, like in a dysfunctional codependent kinda way. I just never ever feel loved. I'm 32.

And of course, it stems from my up-bringing. But this is a serious problem. I think it's the root of every suicidal action and thought I've ever had.

Connection. I crave it, can't create it, and I don't know if I've ever honestly had it.

Thoughts?"
308,"I was wrongly diagnosed with PTSD 6 years ago. A psychiatrist recently diagnosed me with BPD. 

My ex and father of my eldest son has just been diagnosed with PTSD. I am concerned he has been diagnosed wrong also. In the past me has suffered with psychotic episodes, imagining scenarios that aren't true and believing he could hear people's thoughts for 2 examples. He has been hospitalised at one point. 

He has had a drug problem in the past which I am told is under some level of control now, he still smokes cannabis. In the past his behaviour suggested to me that he was suffering from drug psychosis. 

Anyway I wanted to know if anyone else with a diagnosis of PTSD suffers with these episodes? 

TIA"
309,"I finally bought a weighted blanket today,it's 15 lbs,in the hopes that it will help with the difficulties I have with sleep/nightmares,as well as night time anxiety.

I have read online that they're helpful for those with PTSD.

Has anyone tried one and did you find it helpful?"
310,"Afternoon all,. I'd like some help if possible and whilst this sounds a little conflicted I need to know some answers and coping mechanisms.     To give you all some context, I had a  heart attack 2 years ago.......I was 36.     Now whilst all that happened is a bit of a blur and the 4 days in hopital and operation I had wasn't the scariest time of my life,. Now living with a chronic condition has changed my life.   Whilst many things are good,. I've become scared of my own body.    If I get back or arm pain, Not chest pain ironically, I absolutely melt and melt bad.   I hyperventilate, enter into fight / flight mode and it's got so bad that it takes days to come out the other side.  I feel physically and mentally drained.   
Now I've never been diagnosed, don't take any medication other than for my heart and have seen a phycologist but living with my new participant in my life is actually got me scared because the power of this is crippling.   Therefore I'd like some help, assistance and guidance.   Also feel free to ask what you like......"
311,"For some ungodly reason incest has become a hot button debate in this decade of our lord and savior Jesus Christ. I don’t know how we stepped into a dimension where people confidently argue publicly that incest and pedophilia are something less that heinous but here we are. Twenty nine-fucking-teen and we have people ready to die on this hill. Half of our media has incest plot lines, we have TedXtalks arguing that pedophilia is “natural”, hundreds of people draw siblings kissing and argue with people online that there is nothing wrong with that. 

I hate complaining about people on the internet. I hate telling people what they can and can not do. But if I have to spend one more minute dissociating and having flashbacks because some twenty seven year old on tumblr thinks that incest isn’t bad I’m going to lose my mind. More than I already have in my personal hell of therapy, medication, mental illness, and all of the life destroying shit that’s been thrown at me as a result. 

I don’t care how innocent a person thinks that incest shipping can be. I don’t care if they think that being adopted or step-siblings makes it better. It doesn’t. Consensual incest is almost guaranteed to be the product of neglect/abuse/etc. and non-consensual incest, I mean, fuck! shouldn’t even need to have to say something more than “non-consensual”. 

I know the world is not my “safe space”, but why should the internet be more of a safe space for someone who has a fetish for sibling fucking than the person who sometimes can’t be touched in passing without proceeding to have a melt down because sibling fucking ruined their god damn life before they were old enough to really understand what made the situation feel so wrong? 

I’ve seen this shot on Facebook, on reddit, on tumblr, on google images, on tv, in comics, in every place that I god damn look. And it’s not just triggering me all the fucking time but it’s starting to make it difficult for my past to not be outed. There’s only so many panic attacks you can have before people start to look at you and each other funny. 

I don’t deserve this. Other survivors don’t deserve this. And our culture should not be promoting these heinous and life ruining crimes as fetishes to be defended in front of the whole world. They shouldn’t even really be defended. Don’t feed your fucking demons. 

I’m sorry. This is mostly just an angry rant. But no one knows about my history and my therapist was sick today. This is the only safe space I have to just be angry when I need to."
312,"Growing up I truly didn’t realize how fucked up my life was. It’s only in recent years that I’ve realized it and noticed just how much of PTSD is oppressive silence. There was so much that I was instructed to never tell. There was so much fear of telling. Pressure from others, from myself. I forced myself to stop considering my own feelings for years because my life had no room for them. 

Ever since I left home and started to learn how not normal my experiences were and realize that I was finally free, for the first time in my life, to feel and process what I needed I have begun to compulsively share all of my feelings and some of the more low key abusive and neglectful experiences of mine. Even meeting people for the first time, it’s like I have the internal geyser that explodes from me when I start to think of my past. 

I guess it makes sense that finally feeling like I can feel, and share, and process my brain just wants to jump at every opportunity but it’s gotten to the point that I can’t stop myself. Inside I’m screaming to stop but I just have too much inside to hold it back. What do I do to stop? How do I process in a healthy way? I thought it would go away by now. Has anyone else ever had this experience?"
313,"Hello,
I am interested to communicate with someone who has went through Prolonged exposure therapy.  I started this therapy in January and I am finding it tough going.
I understand it is difficult, but would like to learn about other peoples experience of it .... does it really work?"
314,"I’ve been mentally most of my life. My first breakdown was at 14 and was hospitalised for 6weeks. Finally 15 years ago I dx schitzoaffective after a lifetime of meditation. I had a very traumatic childhood with a very abusive mother who was extremely violent , beatings were regular but she also tried to smother both me and my sister. I won’t go into all she did just to say it was awful and it’s making me shake just writing this and thinking what’s she put us thru. It wasnt the normal clip on the head or smack on the backside but proper beatingwith what’re was in her had be it dog chain or spade.  My gp even told me to leave home as he realised there was something amiss about my mum.

I then that got married and went straight into a marriage that was doomed. I even told my mum the night before the wedding I didn’t want to go thru with it. I thought the drinking would stop once we’re married. But she was adamant I must. My dad had died just one month before and she said she couldn’t cope with any more upset. Well he turned into a violent alcoholic and kept me emotionally and financially stuck to him. I tried to leave but that was not possible. Some may understand why I couldn’t leave. I was hospitalised on a few occasions suffering broken nose, ribs , fractured jaw and umpteen black eyes and split lips and once  he locked me in a dirty shed overnight, hence my fear of the dark. However eventually he met someone else and left me. Thank god.

But evn now 50 years after the beatings form my mum 25 years afte my ex left I’m still having regular nightmares and wake up screaming several times a week , surely  this should all be long gone from me I’m 65 and frightened to go to sleep. I once mentioned it to my pdoc and she realised I’ve a very poor memory of childhood with lots of blanks. I was sent for psychotherapy but found it too distressing so stopped.

I’m wondering now if this dx of schitzoaffective could have been wrong . Is also suffer depression GAD and social anxiety. I’m don’t know whether to get in touch with my CPN , I’ve always been able to talk to her. Is it possible I’ve been miss diagnosed all this time."

317,Do people with PTSD always talk about their traumas? I do it a lot.. And I wonder where it comes from..
318,I have changed so much brakeing under the pressure of the society  I'm submerged in the conflict with it and my  need to belong I have lost my self witch the only sense of self I just came to know was defined by my noted and undeniable difference now I'm even more of a confused and already fucked up mess lost changed to much to go back to who I was but not enough to fit in to feel expected  just lost and angry with my self I just want to run ripping the flesh from my face run in to the heat of the sun tell it burns all the flesh from my body leaving just the bones this form the very last  trace of identity  pushing on tell they Crackel weakening under the  unforgiving heat of the sun sizeling and splintering tell the marrow runs dry and they are nothing but ash  freeing myself of all identity being free of it and its pressures to conform the struggle with the change to be who i am not  witch is simply the act of not wanting be alone and to matter why is being different such a bad thing why dose the world want me to change
319,"Hi there. 
Hope all of you lovely people are well. 

I suffered child sexual abuse. Grew up in a house with domestic violence and drug use. I suffered a deep bereavement before my teens and had my first psychotic episode at 14. 

I don’t know if I have ptsd. 
I know I hate myself. Everything I do I feel is wrong. 
I don’t know how to authentically be myself and struggle to make long lasting connection to people no matter how much I try. 
I feel as if I live in a time warp and nothing really makes sense. I don’t know what’s real and what’s not.

I know I need to speak about this. I’ve taken quite a lot of drugs in my 23 years, psychedelics included, I know there’s way to be set free, I feel so frightened to do so. The pain hurts too deep to open. 

Does this make sense? 

Peace

320,Twice in the past 4 months I have been effectively kidnapped by some other girls if I went into the details this post would be way too long but I have had many symptoms huge anxiety sudden mood or emotional changes I have nightmares almost every night I wake up sweating screaming I get incredibly tense hearing specific sounds and I have a odd fear of rain at night but the most unusual this morning i walked into the bathroom looked at the mirror and saw myself covered in cuts and bruises then I collapsed on the floor and fainted for about 2 hours is there anything I can do to lessen this

My situation is that I was raped, 6 months on and the flashbacks are getting too much and I am starting to lose grip of myself a bit

323,Can PTSD provoke a feeling of being spied and analyzed by someone inside the wall and a feeling of people able to read mind?
324,"David called last night.  Acting like everything was fine.  I got off the phone quick as I could.  But,  I started having flashbacks and a bad panic attack.  Feel a little steadier.  Im sorry hope all ate not disappointed in me.:("
325,"I've recently been diagnosed with PTSD (October) and whilst going through some counselling through work had convinced myself that I was a lot stronger than I really was. I just about held it together for two weeks on the return to work program (two hours a night) and a sudden upset in my relationship with my partner had me running out the door in a state. The argument centred around both my condition and her own emotional difficulties, which creates obvious issues in our home life and has worsened over the past 6 months.

I ended up at the local A+E and was assessed by a duty psychiatrist, who sent me to a mental health recovery unit. I was there for a few days until I started to find my feet again (they were brilliant by the way). But on my return to our home I walked straight back into the kind of anger and upset that I was hoping to avoid. For my part, I absolutely accept my condition is difficult to deal with for those close to me and was in the process of arranging home visits to alleviate the pressure on those I love. My partner has had a very emotionally unstable upbringing and finds communication difficult, and disagreements can often provoke anger. I would love her to get help as I have done, but she tends to push people away. It's absolutely heartbreaking at times. So many people see our best side as a happy loving couple, but are unaware of the struggles we both face.

I called my helpline (who are part of the care team) and they told me to leave the house and get somewhere safe. So I'm now at my parent's house feeling shattered. Stability seems to elude me. I'm middle aged, with PTSD, losing my home, looking down the barrel of another ruined relationship. I'm lucky to have an employer that supports me, along with my folks and a handful of friends (they have been pure gold to me). Though right now I feel on my knees."
326,"Does anyone else have PTSD or PTSD symptoms after an abusive relationship with a psychopath or narcissist?

I left an abusive relationship last year with a man who I suddenly, with sickening horror, realised was most likely a psychopath. I realised it when he threatened to hurt me with a raised hand and a look of pure glee in his eyes after he'd shouted at me for two hours just because I asked to look into his eyes to be affectionate.

When I met him he seemed to be this absolutely great guy - I thought he was kind, sweet, intelligent, caring, educated, domesticated, a good listener, open minded. He said he was interested in vegetarian cooking and liked country walks and being in nature like me.

Fast forward to the end of the relationship he is this violent misogynist. He was rough with my body and bruised me and said 'you must bruise easily.' Once in bed he put his hands around my neck. I feel like at the time I blanked out because at the time I don't remember it happening but I have flashbacks of it where it's like I'm on the ceiling looking down at myself underneath him with his hands on my neck? When I later asked him not to do it again he got really angry and said he hadn't put his hands on my neck and I found myself apologising feeling extremely confused.

He gaslighted me a lot, breaking something in my house for example then saying he hadn't been in the room it was in. He would suddenly get very angry and defensive about the tiniest thing meaning I was constantly apologising. I was also often apologising for something he had done. He never took responsibility for anything and everything always had to be my fault otherwise he's sulk or be aggressive. I found evidence of cheating like something under his bed that clearly belonged to a woman (he said it was his mum's) and once I heard a woman laugh down his phone in a sexual way once when I rang him and he said he was at work. He made a lot of inappropriate jokes such as about 'dogging' and also about how his 'male friends used to have sex with each other' and I have a sick feeling that he was cheating on me with multiple people, both men and women. (I got tested for everything afterwards and am so thankful I got a clean bill of health). 

Like all abusers he really knew how to put on the charm and act like 'the perfect boyfriend' which kept me very confused and trapped until I could see through what was happening. He seemed to quickly work out all the ways my previous boyfriends had disappointed me and made sure he did them - just simple things like agreeing to go to places I liked and making us nice breakfasts (I have a track record of very disappointing boyfriends so the standard was low). When he was 'being nice' he was like my ideal boyfriend so I had to do a lot of mourning over losing this fake person that never existed and even to this day sometimes struggle with missing the fake persona.

He basically created a mask to hook me and it totally worked. It's over a year now since I left him but I'm still struggling with the after effects. I did two PTSD tests with therapists and scored as having PTSD on both of them. It's nowhere near as bad now as it was but I have images of him and incidents that happened every single day playing out in my mind. I get sort of flashbacks when I see or hear something that reminds me of him, such as I was looking for a cafe on google maps and it was near his house so suddenly I remembered all the journeys I'd made to his house and how in the early days I felt so excited and happy and lucky to have met this 'wonderful new man.' I also feel constantly on alert. Sometimes I fear he'll turn up although the fear reduces the more time passes (he wouldn't leave me alone after I left and the police issued him with a warning so he's not allowed to contact me now, thank goodness).

Anyway it would be interesting to hear if anyone can relate. I've read some good books about this like 'Psychopath Free' which have helped. The author says it takes 18 months to get over a psychopath and so far that seems to be true. I haven't dated since and am scared to in case I meet another abuser. They are extremely good at fooling people and seems to have this incredible ability to work out the kind of partner you're looking for. I also struggle daily with depression, anxiety and panic attacks which I had before I met him but he made it all a lot worse. The trauma of the deceit seems to be the worst part of it, it still shocks me and makes me feel sick to this day that he duped me so convincingly and that there are people out there like this who appear so normal but are so evil. I wish there was some consequence for his behaviour but he will definitely be out there dating doing this to multiple other women (and maybe men too) causing the same sort of trauma for these people."
327,"Hi,

I'm new to this forum.    Someone who is very close to me experienced a major psychological and physical trauma created by her own family around 8 months back for no mistake from her side.    Once after the incident happened, she din't sleep for few weeks, with panic on one side and cries, confusion and depression on the other side wondering why it happened.   She was taken to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her for PTSD and anxiety, prescribed medications.

However, in the last few months, she started hallucinating, saying she is seeing visions about family coming again to threaten and traumatize her, and hearing voices.   Last week, her confusion went on peak, and the doctors diagnosed saying it is acute psychosis, and hospitalized her.    Now she is back to normal.

Can PTSD trigger psychosis and delusions for normal people?  Or is this completely a different diagnosis?    Also, she stopped one of the medications last month prescribed several months pack for the PTSD and anxiety.   Can the withdrawal symptoms cause similar to psychosis and delusions?

Thanks."
328,"Hi Everyone. New member here.

After some difficult times I've been diagnosed with PTSD and agoraphobia. I have local mental health care where I get six months of free treatment and then I wait six months. I'm in the wait time now.

I've left an abusive ex with problems. I think of him as a Narcissist after reading online forums but his only diagnosis is for Depression and he scammed that.

I'm frustrated and angry at the way therapy goes. CBT doesn't seem to do anything for me. I have aural flashbacks and anxiety attacks at least three days a week. No change after 2 years of this therapy plan.

My therapist told me I won't get better until I face my fears and problems. He was right when he said I wasn't. So I took it on the chin and he gave me a list of tasks. ""Report the abusive ex to the police for domestic violence. Don't be afraid they won't help you."" I did this and the police told me there was nothing they could do. When I went back to my therapist he said ""The next one will work. Go to the low income legal service and ask them for legal help. Don't be afraid they won't help you."" The legal service told me their funding is low and my legal problems are too expensive and complex for them. My therapist said ""The next one will work. Walk around well-lit busy streets after dark. Don't be afraid you'll be harassed or insulted just because you're a woman."" I walked along a busy street every night for a week around 9/10 PM. Drunk guys cat-called me and one pulled down his pants as I was walking by. I was tripped and shoved and someone stole my phone. I was walking with a loose shoelace, stepped on it, and face-planted on the sidewalk. I smashed my nose and chipped a tooth.

I'm messed up and broken feeling. I'm not good with people. I'm homely and a little fat. I lived with my birth mom until I was ten and then I was raised in a foster care group home. It wasn't a nice group home. I was raped when I was sixteen and I kept the baby, so I have a grown-up son. For the middle part of my life things were looking up. I got a real job in a big company and I paid for a cheap house. My house was the smallest and shabbiest house in the neighborhood but it had a good school district. Son was doing good in school and had friends. Then my ex showed up and showered me with fake love and affection for two weeks, then did a 180 and started treating me like trash. I married my ex because I was so excited anyone at all wanted me that I put up with anything.

I lost my job and my ex made me sell my house and took the money. We were together 20 years. After 20 years you think you can put up with anything but he started choking me and threatening to kill me. No matter how broken I am I don't want to die. My ex has a sweet six-figure job because of course the charming narcissist can convince people to give him chances. He pays a lawyer to fend off having to make alimony payments.

I live alone in public housing and I'm on welfare. Son visits me sometimes for dinner. He's a little safe company. I'm happy for him to visit but I also feel resentful. He won't come unless I feed him and give him my extra money for things he wants to buy. He gets a welfare payment too. I think it's fair to feed him if he's going to be here for a few hours but it gets expensive and he doesn't pay anything to me for food. The using isn't all on his side. I also use him. I need him when I have to leave my place in case I have an anxiety attack. He takes me to my meetings and therapy sessions. We both like and love each other but we're both broken people and we don't know how to have a relationship that isn't a series of transactions.

I'm a statistic. I'm a former foster child battered woman on welfare with mental health problems perpetuating a cycle of poverty. If you made an after school special about my life people would complain it was too on the nose to be realistic.

I have a cat. Cat is great. Other than being alone my life isn't bad. It's quiet and dull until it becomes overwhelming but it's more good than bad. I'm alive. Cat is alive. Son is alive. I have half my health. I have a safe place to live with a strong deadbolt lock and three meals a day. 

I'm tired and angry because people keep telling me that I'm only failing because I don't try hard enough. It's hard and I don't have the fortitude to fight. If I could fight, I wouldn't have slid down this far."
329,"Trigger Warning: I do speak about the causes of my complex PTSD.

I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself prior. But I guess you will need some background to this if you are to give me any feedback on the current situation.

I'm a thirty two year old female child sexual abuse survivor. My parents use to lock me in a bedroom with strange men. I get to learn what happened in that bedroom through frightening flashbacks. I'm not entirely sure what my parents got out of it. The abuse quit around age twelve.

Because my parents had far more children than they were capable of taking care of, I am not the only one with these type of issues. I love my siblings deeply, but my mother takes a perverse pleasure in dramatic situations between all of us.

When I first had flashbacks, I reported them to police. I quit seeing my parents. I told everyone I thought could handle and/or benefit from the information. I am doing alright. I have good days. I have bad days. I do have complex PTSD with agoraphobia.

Also, I think I should mention that it's not getting the best of me. The PTSD, that is. I have genuine peace and serenity. I contribute that to the twelve steps of AA and NA, and God. I love God.

Anyways, the thing that I'm not sure how to deal with. At age 25, I have these horrendous flashbacks. Me being abused, siblings being abused, sensory flashbacks, the works. It's left me unable to work, sometimes unable to leave my house. 

So I call the police on my parents. Can't have them doing this to anybody else. There's nothing the police can do. Here it is, seven years later, and my mom shows up at my door with my little sister. I love my sister. So I totally can handle my mom, in small doses, and be calm and peaceful about it, but it's entirely inappropriate. I was so happy to see my sister. She's my parent's neighbor. Also an abuse survivor. It doesn't seem to affect her as negatively as it does me. But there was so much happiness in seeing her. As for my mom, she knows she can't show up at my house alone. She denies the abuse and gaslights me, because I did confront her. 

So that's what I don't now how to handle right now. My mother, either some type of sociopath or at the very least a pedophile, deciding to randomly drop in on victims of her abuse, just as a how-do-you-do. How do I create an appropriate boundary in this situation? Can I get a restraining order? We were quite civil. I'm really not sure how to respond to this.

Any positive feedback would be great. Thank you so much!"
330,"Hi,

I am in college and am currently taking a class on anthropology of public health, and it's made me start to question whether I have PTSD. I was severely emotionally bullied from ages 9-18, and now that I'm 20 and have been able to distance myself from the people who were hurting me, I am realizing the major impact the experience had on my life. For example, I am still having regular nightmares about the events - I probably dream about it at least once every week. I also leave almost every social situation feeling like crap, focusing on little things that I feel I should have done differently in order to not seem like a freak. This could be as small as feeling like I left too big of a pause in between conversations, or that my hair was out of place. Not only will these haunt me for weeks, but random things even years later can remind me of what I did ""wrong"".

But my purpose here is to talk about dissociation. I can't seem to find anything online describing it any better than just an ""out-of-body experience"", and I was wondering if something I occasionally feel could be classified as such. Every once in a while, I'll have a period of several hours where I almost feel drugged - I might go an entire day feeling sort of trapped in my mind. I can't escape my thoughts and everything going on around me feels like a movie, and if people try to hold any conversation with me that's more than small talk, I get extremely anxious and snap at them until they leave me alone. However, I can sometimes ""snap out"" of the feeling by forcing myself to be around friends (which is hit-or-miss because it can also make me feel considerably worse) or by watching fun YouTube videos. I think YouTube helps because if I watch unscripted videos, it kind of feels like an intermediary between the ""screen world"" I'm feeling around me (where it feels as if everyone is an actor) and the ""real world"" that I'm normally a part of (where, like the videos, social interactions occur without planning).

I know that PTSD can't be diagnosed without a psychiatrist. I'm just here to be able to anonymously receive some opinions on my suspicions before talking to someone in person.

Thank you so much for reading this long post!

331,"Hey everyone,

So... i'm finally pregnant with my second baby. i'll be 14 weeks in just a couple days and in light of my loss this past spring you'd think i'd be overjoyed and i keep trying to be but the last two weeks have been hell.

When i had my son, i was with someone that, the day i told him about he baby, decided to start beating me on a daily. Before it was random and mostly mental and verbal abuse and why i stayed i still can't tell anyone.. i was so deep in, i can't look back without feeling ashamed i didn't have enough sense to just get up and leave when i saw the positive and never tell him a thing... but the past is the past... or at least thats what i thought.

I've had almost 6 years to cope with everything that has happened, not only during that part of my life but before and i've gotten through so so so much. I'm on antidepressants and i'm taking better care of myself and i'm happy. I thought i had finally gotten past everything but i guess my brain is stuck or something.

a couple weeks ago i started having nightmares... you see my mom lives like four blocks from where he lives and i know he's walking by her house on a regular and in these dreams, we are visiting my mom and he comes up and kills me, hurts me in front of my babies or tries to take my son or tries to kill my baby.... 

normally i would look for triggers..but the only one i can land on is simply that.. i'm pregnant.. and although the nightmares are starting to stop, i find myself having near panic attacks watching house or a movie that has any kind of confrontational antagonist.worse yet if a little kid gets hurt. 

now i asked my doctor about this and she said it sounded like the pregnancy hormones and my ptsd are to blame.. considering the hell i went through when i was pregnant with my son. All she said was she recommends counseling.. but i can't drive in larger cities without having panic attacks while driving.. so i can't.. because all of the therapists near me are in a really big city and i'll end up killing someone else or myself trying to get there...

normally i try to talk to my husband about these things but he has depressive issues too and so when i say anything about being down or feeling anxious or having these issues, he basically takes it like there is something more he could be doing and it causes him to crash just a bit... so i tend to keep it to myself now.. or try to get online and vent and hope someone has an answer.

i've had enough therapy to know what outlets i have, and i try my best to use them but so far they work for the day but at night.. it honestly kicks my butt.. and i've lost so much sleep because of it i can barely stand to get up to take my son to school..

idk if anyone can help in here but i know talking helps and i don't know if i can fix something that i have no control over... it sucks."
332,"5 years ago I was diagnosed with complex PTSD. Complex meaning I not only have flashbacks but disassociate on a regular basis for a few hours at a time in which I have no idea what I do. Sometimes i come home with injuries that I can't explain.  They have been known to last for up to 6hours and although I'd like to say that I am abstinent I have no idea what I have done in this period of time. I had an incident a few weeks ago where I was told I refused to come into the house and was scared of everything around me. It's got to the point where everyone around me doesn't want me around and I am really falling apart. I would really like to hear from people in the same situation. I have lots of skills but they don't always work.

333,"I have suffered from ptsd manifesting in anxiety depression and hysterical episodes - it’s multiple childhood traumas and has always been present. My problem is that as a result I have always been a massive fantasist I want everything to be perfect to make
Up for lost time and also because my younger sibling died and I feel like I have to go extra at my life for her. I’ve achieved a lot and it’s never enough - I live in a world where I need it to be like a movie and it’ll all turn out right and when it doesn’t I fall apart and it triggers my sense of helplessness that comes from my ptsd experiences. 
At the moment my biggest issue is if someone is even a small amount unpleasant or I feel attacked in any way esp at work -where it is all women and I’ve recently joined -it makes me feel that it’s all ruined and I need to start again. I can’t keep starting again and people disliking me is fine it’s the showing it .. I am so upbeat and helpful at work to avoid any reason to be mean but they find them. I need to know if anyone else has this perfection issue and how to ignore these (what others would see as minor) interactions. I had a big melt down and two days in bed last week because I Was late for training because of a bus and my boss was nice but firm about it. The idea that her image of me is not perfect broke me - and the face she said to me after how glad she is to have me and how great I am means nothing :(

334,"Hi, I find myself in London, been here 23 years yet I do not have a single friend. When my life went wrong, my life went wrong, I lost those 'friends'.  Now I am being forced out of my family due to my mental health.  Yes, I have done things wrong and I have done my time.  But throwing away the protective link for me is creating more harm and risk.  

Now, I am alone and without a friend.  I am lost in this world of despair and pain.  Shuddering with flashbacks from the rapes as a child.  I suddenly duck because I had a flashback that I was being beaten.  I struggle with the emotions of a 38-year-old survivor.  I am Irish.  

On the 8th of October, when I was told I had to divorce I tried to take my own life, sadly it did not work.  I took a very large quantity of pills.  I normally do not touch alcohol as I can't stand the memories it brings up for me.  But I took a lot of alcohol.

Dam someone found me and got an ambulance, I begged them to leave me, leave me where I was.  I no longer want to battle the feelings of being a survivor, a survivor of incest abuse, sexual abuse in the care system in Ireland.  I am lost in a world of pain and confusion.  I struggle with being the feelings of hopelessness.  :low::panic::faint:"

339,"Hi all

I wanna thank everyone that responds to this message in advance. I need advice and I have a mildy graphic story, I apologise in advance to anyone if my story and circumstances are not as bad as yours I just want help, insight and understanding.

7 days ago in short summary the person living in the apartment next door was found dead. For about a week i could smell something bad in different ways I tried to pinpoint it but I couldnt, I did think what if that man is dead and i was denial hoping that maybe he was with hes family for christmas or fine. Without greater detail what has been bothering me is the decayed flesh or dark red gelly the forensics team left outside my door which has to be by accident. Im not here to bash on people who do this kind of job if any i have great respect for them. Me and another neighbor had to clean it. Then the sound of them dragging hes body and all that seperated me was the wall behind me including the fact he was found maybe 6-7 meters from where im sitting in hes apartment. He was a drug addict, i saw this coming as a he was lonely old man who I would tolerate listening to for 30mins avg each time he saw me because he was talented at attacking other neighbors and hard to understand from been high.

At first i blocked it out then i read online this is bad so I allowed my mind to see it again and again. Im going through waves of emotions one moment im stuck in limbo with pain which was getting easier to deal with until i came home today after running away to my parents place to escape this then all of sudden im having panic attacks. The fear of been here at home is kind of gone, its of what comes next the counsellor on the phone said im experiencing ptsd. I was really hoping this was not true I want this and whatever i go through next gone asap. 

The day after it happened I went into panic mode I realised because of my anxiety. For the last 5yrs i shut out my family and friends and many chances to have a girlfriend/partner in my life. Because of my anxiety so i realised i could die like that old man with no one to find me for weeks or more. So i put aside the issues with my family and went and stayed with them because i realised it was not worth it. However reconnecting with friends I ignored and showed a lack of interest for that has been hard. My best friend is overseas and might not return. So im alone, I dont wanna go into detail on how I plan to change things but hopefully where i go to study in 4 weeks ill make new friends. I had these goals and others before this happened but this experience has really given me a inner fire to push harder and not be weak because of my anxiety. And so far its working running everyday and getting out of the house amongest other things.

Final note my neighbor said he saw them take him out in garbage bags I feel like it might be spite for me refusing to enter the apartment with him and the police. Given he was dead for about 2weeks at most from what  police think might of happened. That neighbor later said he was let down I didnt go in with them. Could this be true? Only thing i saw was a strecher the one time i looked out my door.

A few questions I have is whether this really is a form of ptsd and what are my chances of having it not effect me in the future? And has anyone gone through something similar and if so how long did it take them to recover. How long will the smell from the apartment last? What if i never recover, this scares I dont wanna have my life ruined over this?

My minds all over the place i really hope i havent forgotten anything and thanks for the help and advice. I do have a support team thats gonna help my see a psychologist. But Im hoping this is like the wild emotions you go through during a break up until you finally get over it, dont know what else to compare it too.

Kinds regards

340,"I'm new here. So far this year my marriage of 19 years almost fell apart, I had to reconsider my career and not only change jobs but change sectors completely for my mental health. My moodiness got so bad I considered suicide for a short time. I wake up every day feeling inadequate. I feel like I'm failing my family. My husband is trying to be supportive as of lately. I hid from my family for 4 years because I was so miserable. I didn't want to spread the miserable around. I often feel like I'm an insignificant piece of crap. The only thing that helps is my husband being nice to me. I know he can't be my everything and codependency is unhealthy. That's why I'm on here. 
I can't be trusted to make friends irl. I have wounded bird syndrome. I attract the most wretched and broken people and then befriend them. These people have no boundaries and insert themselves into my most intimate relationships like my marriage and children. At least on line you control how deep the friendship can go. No one knows where you live. They can't just drop in when you'd rather they go away.
I'm trying therapy for the first time this year. We're trying marriage counseling for the first time as well. He's going to try therapy as well. We've bonded over our mutual sickness our entire marriage so now we're going to spice it up with getting wellish. I say wellish because you can feel better but you'll never be okay. It always lurks. Like a storm cloud in the distance."
341,"Hi everyone,
A little over 2.5 years ago, my girlfriend was physically assaulted by her boss at work. Afterwards she was diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depression. This is on top of an existing diagnosis of ADHD.

I have been trying my best to provide care and support, while also trying to keep my own mental well-being in check, but I'm having a very hard time right now. 

Some details:

When she has a panic attack, she will stay in bed for between three days to a week. She will have insomnia, and if she does fall asleep, has night terrors. She will also not eat unless food is put in front of her (and sometimes not even then). A few times, she has become catatonic. 

Her main fear is that she will encounter someone she used to work with and she will lash out physically and cause them harm. This causes her to have panic attacks most shifts she works (2-3 times a week) and prevents her from going outside (except for work and therapy).

I have not experienced her lashing out physically or violently towards a person.

During her panic attacks, she will sometimes tell me that I am useless, a failure, how I don't love her enough, never loved her, how I'm a monster, or the cause of all her pain. 

Days later she will often say that these things are not true, that she is projecting, and that she only says these things because she feels like a failure herself. 

If, in the moment, I ask if what she's saying is projection, she gets upset and says that I'm dismissing her or accuses me of gaslighting. If I tell her that these things are hurtful to me, she says that she cannot control how she feels, should be able to feel in her own way, and that these things should not bother me because they are just projection. So, to support her, I listen.

I have read several articles on supporting a partner through depression and PTSD, and a lot say to not take the negative things personally. Logically, I know that these things are not true and that she is projecting, but it's really hard to not internalize these things.

When we go to couples therapy, she usually denies that she ever said these things, that I'm misinterpreting, or being too sensitive. I often feel like I'm going crazy. 

I have tried to set boundaries. A big one I set was that I couldn't be the only person she talks to. This does not mean that I will not listen to her or be there for her. It just means she should have a therapist, friend, or family member to talk to in addition to me. 

She perceived this as rejection, and rejection is a major PTSD trigger for her as well, so she'll bring this up occasionally as something I did that was triggering. 

Over the past several months she has been drinking heavily in response to being triggered at work. 

Most nights, when she drinks, she will wake me up in the middle of the night, either because she had a nightmare that her old boss was breaking into the house, she wants sex, or she will want to tell me that I'm a bad person. 

If I tell her that it's 3am on a weeknight, I don't want to have sex, there's no one breaking in, or that a conversation where she's drunk and I'm tired will not be a productive one, she feels rejected and becomes triggered. 

Sometimes she'll fall, drop plates, or lay on the floor catatonic. She doesn't remember any of this the next day.

The only thing that stops her from drinking is me being around. If I have to stay late at work or want to go out with friends, I will come home to her more drunk than I normally would if I came home right after work.

I really make an effort to see my friends and make time for myself, because I need it, but it's hard to relax knowing that the longer I'm away, the worse the situation I will come home to will be.

I have a great friend who makes time for me whenever he can. He recently said that many of my other friends are no longer inviting me to parties/events because they don't want my girlfriend there. 

My girlfriend is a really good person! She's loving, kind, generous, and fun, but since the assault, she's just been spiraling and getting worse. These last several months in particular have been a bit of a nadir.

Since a lot of the ways her PTSD manifests is hurtful to me, I can't help but pull away a bit. With rejection being a major trigger for her, I know this is making things worse. 

I really feel that if I was stronger and less sensitive, I wouldn't let her words and actions affect me as much. If I had some more armor, I could be a much better partner. 

How can I be more resilient? Any advice on how to provide better support will be helpful.

Thank you!

P.S. We are both seeing therapists individually as well."
342,"Hi all, I'm asking the question here, as I feel like if I go to my GP, I might be wasting their valuable time. I've always connected PTSD with people who have much more terrifying experiences than I ever have, soldiers and victims of horrific car crashes for example, but I'm beginning to wonder if I also have a form of it. I feel that I'm being over dramatic just saying it, but I'm was in an abusive relationship for 10 years (aged 16 - 26.) I tried to leave the relationship for a very long time, but also felt trapped there. 
I got out of it 7 years ago, but almost every night I have a reoccuring nightmare that I'm trying to flee the relationship but feel trapped somehow. This has been going on for the whole 7 years since I left. 
I wake up feeling exhausted and emotional. 
Im Remarried now and my husband is amazing, but I don't want to tell him about this as every time I've mentioned it to someone else, they seem to jump to the conclusion that this means I still have feelings for my ex. I find this a ridiculous concept but I would hate this to come between my husband and I."
343,I was abused by my brother and syestepdad.  My exhusband was ababusive too.  I have CPTSD.  I've been I panic attacks.  Awful flashbacks.  It's really hard to share about these things.  Sorry.
344,"My past is complicated, but I'm not going to get into all the details right now in this post.  I basically was bullied a fair amount as a kid all the way into adolescence and teen years.  I was made fun of a lot and was made fun of in college and even after college.  In addition, I was very misunderstood by nearly everyone due to my autism spectrum disorder.  All of this cumulative suffering has lead to PTSD.  I feel shut off as if my body and brain shut down because of how I was mistreated by so many people.  I basically feel numb to a certain degree.  I think the body and brain does this naturally to protect itself when it feels it is in danger.  I also suffer from chronic insomnia - I do sleep but it is a very light sleep and I never feel refreshed come morning.  I'm not sure what to do to solve this problem.

Has anyone here heard of the polyvagal theory?  It basically is that after trauma, the vagal nerve does not work properly.  It essentially goes back to its less sophisticated reptilian origins.  The vagal nerve helps communicate messages from your body to your brain and vice versa.  But trauma can damage it.  The problem is I don't know exactly how I can heal from it."
345,"Sup,

I've come to talk about sexual abuse, what happened to me three years ago. I think I need to talk about this, since I nver open up, especially on this. Only my girlfriend and someone that I don't see anymore know about this and I think I'd like to explain it to other people, and get your opinion or support or anything, but it's quite hard to talk about this.

So. My name's goblin, we're in early july 2015, I've finished middle high school and just turned 15 when I and a 14 y.o. friend met a group of people from a drawing forum and more specifically someone, a 18 y.o. guy, at a manga con. It was okay, I didn't particularily like him, we split up after a while. My friend was anxious about having been rude during the day, so she asks me to give her the phone number of someone from that group to apologize if she did anything rude and stuff. she ask them the phone number of the 18 y.o. to apologize to him too, and he's being friendly so he continues the chat and he continues to texts the next day and so on so after a week or my friend gives me his number because i wanted to take part in this, as they seemed to get along well. anyway we three end up being ""friends"", we talk a lot during the summer. In fact, we talk way too much. The guy wants to video chat on skype everyday and we end up wanting to, too. I'm always on the computer to chat and call even though im on vacation in a foreign country for two months. My friends also chats all the time with us even though she's on vacation with her family, too. the guy's alwayyyyyyys saying compliments, that he loves us and stuff, that we're cool and mature and clever. He also says that we help him a lot and stuff. Since we're 14-15 y.o, very shy and impressionable, we're so happy to have found such a cool friend, especially during such difficult times (we both had new issues that were related and not related to him at the time). The thing is, he talked to us about weird stuff that weren't really of our age. For example, in a conversation between him and me, he explained out of the blue how when he went at his first girlfriend's house, he was always using eight condoms with her, that the first time he came home her mom froze when he told her that he used the eight condoms in two days, that it kinda always went like that, etc. He told me about how he slept with her even though the broke up and she had a boyfriend because they stilll loved eachother, that everything was so really hard for him because of emotional dependancy, that he was so loving and caring, that he was polyamorous so his feelings were always so complicated to understand. 
He knew i had body issues so he told people in video chats ""oh, it's true that goblin has  such wide hips"" even though it was a real problem for me but also that it's false. He asked a lot for our support, he told me that before he met us he had depression but since then he was feeling better (meaning he totally got over his depression in a month. god i wish that were me.). We were always talking/calling him, all day and a little late at night (but not in the morning since he always woke up at 3, 4 p.m.). He's always sending hug emoticons and saying that he truly loves us etc. He's making a lot of jokes about being secretly in love with the both of us, at which we respond friendly, while reassuring him that of course we know it's a joke.
These days, I've been thinking about this a lot more and ended up searching through my laptop to find our chats. I noticed that for example, when i helped my friend, she used to thank the both of us and vice et versa. He really did just. Inserted himself between us for a lot of things. 

We decide to meet at my friend's house on the first weekend of september (even if it was difficult for him because when he told his mother he was going to see two friends, she understood it as ""going to see two people in a sexual way"" and he said that she was right to think that he would-but not with us!).  I was supposed to sleep with my friend, and the guy was supposed to sleep in another bedroom. we all ended up falling asleep in my friend's bed, cuddling.
A few days after this meeting, he announces us that he might like us as more than friends, but not like a lover.he tells us about how complicated it is to sort his feelings, that it kind of was like being in love with us but not sexually of course, blah, blah, blah... We all agree that we have the same feelings for eachother (i.e. that we love eachother as more than friends, but not love-love). He then says that from now on, no matter what we would say, for him we woudl all be in a three-way relationship. I reminded at some point of the conversation that i was not in love with them, to which he replied that it was cold of me the way i said it. Anyway later , at the end of september, he tells us that he loves us in a romantic way,  we all agree(i mean, i had a crush on my friend since the end of middle high school, but i thought i got over it during summer(i was too afraid of asking her out because she was way out of my league)), blah blah blah, and we're supposed to meet in the middle of october, all of us for a week at my place and at my friend's mother's place, and then only him and my friend a few days, at my friend's father's place, because i couldn't come.

Now that is the part i absolutely cannot bring myself to talk about ahah. It was. Terrible. He forced the both of us to do things and like. When we were at my place, he did sleep in another bedroom, and i slept with my secret now-girlfriend. At my friend's place,  he was still supposed to sleep in another bedroom but decided that it wasnt relevant since we would fall asleep together again and it was so cute and pure and stuff because last time when i was sleeping, i apparently leaned toward him in my sleep uwu . I dunno if it was on the first or second night but since we both hugged him during sleep time, he was getting very hot between us, so he asked if he could sleep without his shirt on (and thus he had only boxer briefs). We were okay with it, i mean he only needed to cool off? but from now on he would directly strip to sleep in boxer briefs every night. 
During the day we were with my secret girlfriend's family, helping because her mother works in her equestrian center. So all day we would be in front of her mother, her step-father, her grandparents, her sister, and adults and children customers. He and my friend would kiss in front of everyone, he and myself would kiss in front of everyone. (hint : we didnt want to but he conviced us that it was normal, and that it would be fun if we were to puzzle anyone, and who were we to know better about this? He was almost 19 y.o., had plenty of relationships, and it was my very first). He very soon started to lick our teeth when we kissed. To make us open our mouth and to make us discover about french kiss. In public and in private. But later, when I tried to initiate a french kiss with him, he would then tell me to stop, laughing, because i was ""cheating"". Because he would automatically have a boner when i did. And he would grab my butt by putting his hand in the back pocket of my jeans while we were hugging (still during the day at the equestrian center) to press my crotch against his rock-hard erection. He would also put his hands under my shirt and stroke my chest, still in public, while maintaining eye contact, it was something he did a lot. We had to maintain eye contact a lot xhen kissing in public and when he stroke my chest, we should not break it because it was sort of like a challenge? He woudl do the same with my griflriend. Like. Stroke her chest under her shirt and bras when her grandfather could potentially see us because we were in public and a lot of people were close. we would kiss his neck while sitting on his lap in front of everyone, too. My friend and I were very often shiver very hard. We thought we were cold but he told us that it was because our bodies were excited and we liked what he was doing or wanted him to do what he would usually do. I remembered one time, still in public, that he was hugging me in my back and slipped and hand in my trousers. I froze as i felted his hands just under the elastic of my boxer briefs and the beginning of his fingers on my hairs. I told him to stop as he was continually asking me if he could go on, and i kept telling him no, we're in public, that he finally let go of me. One time when we were alone he told me about how he was amazed that i never was in a relationship before, because i kissed amazingly well and better than my friend. He also told me another time that ""we had his consent (to engage in sexual activity with him)"" . I was weirded out and treated it like a joke.

But at night, he was reaaaally clingy. Kissing, french kissing, strokings were still here but. He also. Started to lick both my and my girlfriend's chests.  It was dark and we shiverd a lot, and personally i did not really understand what he was doing, i was just whining as he licked my chest  and nipples. He asked ""can i go on?"" and i would answer ""i don't know"" and he would reply ""then i'll go on!"", he tried to get my t-shirt off but i wouldn't move my arms. He insisted to put his hands under my bottom pajamas and boxer briefs but i was always findings excuses and he replied that he didn't mind those, he still wanted to, but i kept refusing and strangely he didn't? He would do the same (licking, asking to stick his hands in bad places) with my girlfriend, she reacted a bit like me but  it made her very dizzy and she often feigned sleeping so that he would leave her alone. She also had panick attakcsand stuff. He was always challenging us to ""make him embarassed""(i.e.  making him erecting by kissing him and stuff). He wanted us to kiss him both at the same time. One of my worst memories was when i saw my girlfriend kissing his neck while i was on top of him and probably french kissing him and he had erecting bad so he told me ""im so sorry goblin for what you're gonna feel(i.e. his erection)"" and i was so embarassed that i was like ""what are you talking about..? I don't notice anything..?"" and he replied that i was so innocent or something. 

at the end of the first week he was kicked out by my girlfriend's family and instead of going at her father's she went at my place again so that we could support each other. It was awful, we were lagging a lot, we cried at almost everything, from watching any video to hearing about cakes or hats or anything and my mother scolded me because she said that i was very bad, that i was frowning all the time and being a drama queen. So i sucked it up and replied, on the verge of tears, "" yes mom, (ill do my best)"". And so. She yelled at me for all that comedy, for acting like i was innocent. in the evening i told her that we were together romantically. And that he touched my chest and that he was bad. she told me that no, he wasn't a pedophile because i was almost an adult and that yea he would say yes to anything i stated to touch me but at the same time it was no big deal and to her eyes, i never was sexually assaulted. She even made a joke about referring to him once.

Anyway this guy sucked, he told me that we was in a relationship with a 13 y.o. for six month once and seeing how he acted with us, if this girl really exists, she was probably. In a situation worse than me .. but yeee i had so much nightmares about him and flashbacks and panick attacks and it used to be very hard as i couldn't sleep all night because if i was left with my thought even five minutes i would relive it but now it's gotten. way better? but lately i've been having nightmares again, and been thinking about it a lot. AS in, i tried t find ways to hack his email and tumblr account, i went through the files on my laptop to find a picture of him, i also installed several softwares to retrieve my chats with him and spent 7 hours or so reading them a few days ago at night.. i found out that he talked to someone my age and seemed to date him so i warned that person and got to talk a little bit about how dangerous he was but hopefully they didn't talk for two years and this person is safe and sound and his relationship with the guy didnt last long and this relationship doesnt affect him very much."
346,"Im a 32 year old male and I've been battling this for years. Why does it seem my flight or fight response is taking longer and longer to subside. Ive been having panic attacks and depression for years, I know all about the biology behind it with hormones and nervous systems. I seem to be having spells more frequently and longer lasting with very bizarre physical symptoms as well as waves of panic and hopelessness. Ive been experiencing Brain zaps, like a surge of panic starting from the back of my head that seems to travel down my back to my toes, flush red hot face, eyes feel burning when closed, sore upper neck, jumping at random sounds when I try to relax and constant ringing in my ears, throat feels weird like I just got done swimming in a lake for hours, its hard to describe that one, muscle spasms, insomnia that only allows me to sleep for a couple hours at a time, sometimes when Im finally about to pass out I suddenly twitch and jerk and jump up awake and then can't fall asleep again for hours. I have random acute spells of irritability and extreme emotion that seems to be overreactive, for example watching a movie where it is slightly sad for a minute I will actually tear up, and then I realize I can't fight that feeling and know im over actively perceiving it. I have made significant changes to my diet and I know about what to eat and what to avoid, Ive been under unbearable stress for years with many different life choices and situations as a factor, I do believe I'm at a vulnerable disposition to inherit the genetic side of the susceptibility. My real question is why does it seem to be taking weeks for these symptoms to subside, and also bizarre that they seem to get extremely worse after working out at the gym with weight training. how long is this going to last and is there possible physical underlying issues?"
347,"A few years ago I came to this site to talk about my life. How I suffered from PTSD as a result of my experiences with aversion therapy as a boy at school in the UK in 1972. I have recently published my memoir: Is it about that boy? The Shocking Trauma of Aversion Therapy.  It is available via Amazon, with reviews, as a paperback and an Ebook at: 

Is it About That Boy?: The Shocking Trauma of Aversion Therapy: Amazon.co.uk: Jeremy Gavins: 9781999681906: Books

In the book I talk about how EMDR helped me recover. I also speak about how Dissociation, Body Memories and Cognive Dissonance all played a part in my PTSD.

I recovered, it took 40 years but I did get there in the end. 

All I can say is I hope you all find a way out of your pain."
348,"I sometimes get flashbacks of traumatic events. I know what the triggers are. However, I sometimes get taken by surprise. This can be in any place. At home or out and about. When this happens it takes over my mind and leaves me unable to continue. I should of put this in my ESA50 form that I just sent off, but I forgot to.:low:"
349,"Why do some people with PTSD actively seek recovery (get therapy and meds, do research about PTSD, try new strategies for recovery, write about it, etc.) but others seem unable or resistant to make even small steps toward recovery?

(I have PTSD and am in recovery. I'm working with some individuals who say they want to get better. One person takes steps to get better; another won't even listen to information about PTSD let alone suggestions for healing)"
350,"I saw my GP today, he is referring me to a specialist to get a diagnosis; I can't go in to why I think I've got it because it would take too long & I have very little energy & am always tired (I've already been diagnosed with aspergers & anxiety & I've been on anti-depressants for 27 years ie since I was 19), I would need a lot of energy to type out why I think I've got PTSD as it's not due to one single incident but a build-up of many different incidents taking place through childhood - it has continued to a certain extent in adulthood but I think the damage was done in childhood."
351,"Hi! I'm 23 and I have PTSD from childhood abuse when I was 4 (physical and sexual) and last week out of nowhere I began to have another flash back but surprisingly it actually had nothing to do with the abuse (I think - because 1 thought at the time of trauma is definitely being blocked out and I think it was the reason I believed it was happening - like ""maybe this happened because he did ??? to me once""?). It's awkward but I kind of have to go into detail because I'm confused about the timing... It was where I was around 5-8(?) and out of absolutely nowhere, I had an unwanted spontaneous orgasm which absoutely terrified me at the time. But the thing is, since 2016 I've had a very big phobia of a condition called Persistent genital arousal disorder which causes spontaneous orgasms. This phobia has seriously consumed my life and I even get psychsomatic symptoms of it a lot. (I think I see now why I have such an obsessive fear of it since this happened to me as a kid and left me traumatised)

So what I'm really confused about is why only now have I gotten this flash back and not back in 2016 when I learnt about the condition? Surly learning about this condition would have triggered this memory/flashback? (Of cause I'm also confused about why I even had a spontaneous orgasm but I'm sure that might come to me one day.)

The only reason I can think of as to why I had the flashback now and not 2016 is because I'm talking about my PTSD with a psychologist for the first time ever and this flash back happened the next day of my first appointment. But I'm very worried because if there's no reason for it to have suddenly happened now, I'm wondering what other flash backs I'm going to have out of absolutely nowhere either. :cry: Also the smell of the air at the time came first before it faded into a flashback and now ever since, every day this week the smell keeps coming to me again and then the atmosphere and I have to do everything to stop it from fading into a full-on flashback again. I'm scared that if I have the flashback again, more memories like the thoughts will be unblocked and I really just don't want to know anymore and I definitely don't want to find out the link to it and my abuse (if there is one). Sorry if any of this is confusing. I really don't even know much about PTSD except what I go through with it but I've never talked to anyone about it so it's kind of hard to communicate. 
Thanks to anyone who reads this <3"
352,"Hi, so I've recently started therapy for depression and anxiety.
I was raped a few years ago at a party and never told anyone for a number of reasons but recently I feel the need to get it off my chest as it's been affecting me more and more. 
But, I've never said the words out loud and even thinking about it makes me cry. 
So my question is how do I go about telling her without having a complete breakdown."

Feel quitte alone with this :("

356,"Hi I have a question about counsellors who report sexual assaults.
I visited my counsellor today I revealed I was sexually assaulted 14 years ago  I proceeded to give names, details about the incident and the place it happened and she went on to say she was going to have to report this. This has now given me extreme anxiety over what will happen when she does report it, I asked her but she said she doesn’t know. I just don’t need all this and what if I have to give a statement of what happened it’s just not knowing what will happen is causing me anxiety."
357,"Hi everybody, this is my very first time posting on a forum but I thought I'd see if it helps. I had an assessment last week with my local community mental health team and have been diagnosed with PTSD. This isn't a big surprise as GPs have mentioned this a few times in the past but I've always recovered quickly from an episode and have seemed perfectly well on the surface so I've never had any treatment or formal diagnosis. An episode a few weeks ago was the longest and hardest to deal with though and for the first time Pandora's box really opened with no way of shutting it again. I took 3 weeks off work for the first time as I couldn't stop the crying, couldn't think of anything at all - I was completely numb. 

I experienced 3 traumas in 4 years over 10 years ago now. Whilst I don't feel the first two traumas have had a big longterm effect on me, the third trauma, being raped, has shaped my life. Whilst I have told a few people, this has only ever been in a detached way and I have never spoken about what actually happened or really expressed any emotion. My coping mechanism has always been to work hard, do well in my career and keep going - I suppose I have worn a mask to the world. Many people think I am the most together and controlled person they have met. But there is a whole part of me that I hide from everybody. I feel like my life stopped 10 years ago. Consequently I'm not really close to anybody, have never had a relationship since the rape and have isolated myself from the world. I have done everything I possibly can to avoid reminders (which I know is not healthy) but with #metoo, daily news headlines, tv story lines etc there's no escaping it now. I have also just started trauma focused CBT and for the first time am having to confront what happened. I can't really remember large parts as I've blocked it out as a way of coping but the thought of even trying to recall memories i'm finding overwhelming. I am tearful everyday - today on the train, in work, writing this. I don't however have flashbacks as other people seem to. I'm not sure if its because everything is so suppressed that silent crying is the only way of releasing any emotion at the moment. I guess I'll find out now I've started this journey. Thanks for reading - it's been good to put something in words."
358,"Just saw this lady on tv talk about ptsd and this book is about her life and what she has learned after trauma. Maybe try it, i have not read it yet."
359,"Hi, I am new here, so I hope that this is the right forum for my strange question.

Some years ago I fell in love for the first time in my life, and after some dates he invited me to his house. The atmosphere turned romantic at some point, and that is when I started shaking. I froze the moment he started fondling me and when he tried to kiss me, I just couldn't open my mouth. Still, I insisted that everything was okay and that he should go on. 

I felt a very strong desire to get home after that evening. I self harmed that night. The next couple of days I had flashbacks, I was staring at the wall of my room for hours and was too afraid of going out, because I thought the people would read on my face that I had had sex. 

Since this day, I have been feeling really anxious and on edge and I have become much more impatient, I get angry easily. I also can't seem to stop thinking about this incident, or about sex in general, I often use innuendi. For some reason, I reacted traumatized, and that's why I want to ask:

Is it normal that I reacted this way? I haven't had a past of abuse, so is there another explanation for my strong reaction? Does this happen to other people, too? I was 22 back then. 

I hope you can help, this story is so persistent in my mind, it asks for answers and doesn't go away.

Thank you very much!"
360,"It actually feels strange to be posting anything about this.  

I've had several bomb shells drop that finally triggered dissociation about a week ago.  No lost time, just completely empty of all emotion.  Usually it's a pleasant relief from high levels of anxiety, flashbacks etc... Enables me to actually function.  

My mother is scheduled for surgery on Wednesday (17th) for colon cancer - 3rd time.  My traumas have been largely hospital related and my best guess is that news of her diagnosis and impending surgery is what caused me to finally dissociate.  I was already on overload, and that was just the final ""bang"" that I couldn't handle anymore.  

I have 3 big anniversary dates within the next 10 days.  One involves the loss of a child.  Her birthday should have been Oct. 16th.  I don't know why her death has been so fresh in my mind this year as opposed to last, but grief is huge and overwhelming.  It's not a celebration or special day I wish to honor this time, instead, I have empty arms.  I need to grieve.  I need to cry and feel.  I think my inner self needs to work through this.  Unfortunately, since the dissociation happened, I no longer have any feelings.  I'm completely void of anything.  Makes the days doable, but I actually want to break out of this for the first time.

I've tried various things, read articles, looked and held other items that have always connected me to her in the past.  So far, nothing.  I'm a creative person and so am working with a rock that I brought home the last time I visited her grave.  I am painting various things on it that to me are all symbolic.  It will appear to be a beautiful creation to anyone else, but every image or scene on it means something.  Says something.  I wanted to make this ""Rock of Remembrance"" (as I'm calling it) with passion and pour my heart into it.  I'm sad that I can't do it.  I refuse to look at any actual photos of my baby because I don't want to ever hold them or look at her and not feel anything for her.

Even though I know that it means so much pain will come flooding in at the same time, I want to find a way to break my mind out of this freeze.  I really believe that as I go through this next week or so and pass through significant dates, that each one needs to be worked through.  Painful memories for sure, nightmares and all the rest.  But I'm finding at this moment in time, it would be better to even feel pain than nothing at all.

Can anyone relate or help?"
361,"Does anyone understand how it feels when inside you are screaming for someone to listen but you can literally not open your mouth to explain how much fear and pain you are in?  This is me at the moment.  I was coping so well with my PTSD triggers and flashbacks but have somehow unravelled into the mess I now am.  The problem is on the outside I appear perfectly normal.  People come to me for help which I really don't mind but at times like this I wish they could physically see the scars that have cut me deep on the inside.

A little background on me is this, I was sexually abused as a very young child repeatedly. 
My mother mentally, emotionally and physically abused me for as long as I can remember. And even though I know I am now an adult, I cannot get that mother out of my heead.

I was kicked out of my house when I was 18 after they stopped getting money for me and went to the only place I thought safe.  I moved in with a man who spent the next 9 years sexually abusing me and nearly killed me on several occasions.

I am now safe and with someone whom I adore.
So why do I feel this way? So alone?  Does anyone else feel like this?"

363,"Hi there

I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and have suffered on and off with anxiety and depression over the years. The past two years have been extremely difficult as my ex partner stalked me and has been jailed 3 times due to this. There was articles in the national newspaper about it. He got out of jail and I had to move away due to the continued harassment. I thought by moving away, it would help me. I did initially, but then BOOM!! I feel like a completely different person and cannot function in daily life. I’ve went through 3 jobs in 3 months, am drinking excessively, sleeping about, horrible to those close to me. It was my friends and family that begged me to get help as they can see that I am not behaving normally. I went to the hospital and seen a psych. I’m going for trauma counselling but no idea when I’ll get an appointment. I’m not drinking and going to go to an AA class tonight. As I believe I use alcohol as a crutch. Has anyone got any other advice of what works for them? I don’t want to let this ruin my life. I feel I’ve lost everything but want it back. TIA 😊"
364,Don't you just find it so unfair that after abit of an episode (for me caused by insomnia)or people find out you have a mental health illness all of a sudden everything you say gets made out to be bat shit crazy even if what your sayings true and your back to full health and mental clarity.

I'm sorry I've just joined this forum in the hope of being able to talk safely in the knowledge that nobody knows me."
367,"Hello Beautiful People.

I'll make this brief.x

I was Raped by my ex boyfriend.  He found out that I had spoken to the police about it but I did not follow through with pressing charges.

I trusted the wrong people who subsequently reported this back to him. The following then happened to me.

He used to work at the same company I worked at, he was also physically abusive to me.

He fabricated stories about me to my work colleagues. I was then bullied by management and my team.  I mentally broke down, I was trying to cope with the Rape and a whole lot of emotions surrounding our break up.

To cut a long story short ; Both he and his friends broke into my apartment, they placed a camera above my bed and watched me doing things we all do when were alone in our beds.

They then broke in again to remove the camera and made a dvd of me in my bed, this was then passed around throughout the entire building and the surrounding shops to people who knew me personally.

One night I heard my neighbours celebrating next door, with the walls being thin I heard their conversations.  They were giving a running commentary about me whilst watching the dvd of me (doing things most of do when we're alone) in bed.

Although I had changed the locks, they continued to break in.  My clothes were stolen and some were ripped up.  

Whilst this was happening I was viciously harassed at work, one of my colleagues told me brazenly no matter how many times you sow up your clothes we're gonna keep on tearing them up. Rumours were then cascaded throughout the Company that I was a Pedo, that I had slept and abused kids whilst I was a teacher. I found out that I was working with his WIFE! She threatened me, you name it she did it. They found it pleasurable to harass me and bragged about being in my home.

They would sing We Are The Champions when I broke down and cried at work.

The end result was; I ran.  I left my job, my ex told me that he would strip me of everything, my home, my name, my reputation, my job, nothing was left untouched.

I was violently and eloquently Gangstalked by people in the community who had believed that I was in fact a Pedo.

I found another apartment far away from them.  Unfortunately I was spotted and followed home.  Yes, all the above started again.  This time when they broke in they placed hidden cameras in my home, in my bathroom, in my bedroom, in my lounge, in my kitchen.

I recall waking up early one morning and saw a frightful sight!  My ex was leaving through my gates, he was leaving my building.

You may be wondering why I didn't report this?  I did. But I had no proof.

I won't continue to bore you with the details, but lets just say I ended up in a Mental Institution, I spent around three days there and was then discharged.  I was declared sane!

I am now living with my Parents in the home that I was sexually abused and violently beaten.

I have forgiven my Dad for his transgressions.  I have found God again too.  I am currently seeking PTSD therapy, perhaps EDMR as well group therapy, trauma therapy and rape therapy.  Inside I'm screaming but outside I am calm.

I am QuietStorm."
368,"My name is Silver Shadow and I haven't been active here for quite a while.  I'm still trying to find my way around I guess.  

I also hide when things go wrong.  Right now, everything is wrong.  I'm sinking fast and need to try and reach out instead of hide.  Not something that comes naturally to me.

I have had ptsd for 6 years now.  A complicated story.  Experienced a head-on collision in October 2017.  As a result, a secondary ptsd developed.  Since I've been seeing a therapist for 5 years, at least I had a head start on the second trauma - mostly hospital related.

Right now, I've just begun physio therapy, and it seems to have brought up so much buried emotion that I'm drowning.  All of my dreams are related to the 1st trauma, I'm in so much physical pain that the car accident flashbacks are fast and continuous.  I'm tired of charting through it all.  I have a lot of tools to use, but I just can't right now.  I'm in over my head and need others who get it to support me.

I'm sorry to be so negative.  I'm not usually like this, but I'm desperate.  Please, would someone please respond?"

370,"I usually don't.I do tell some of my story when sharing here at MHF and in real life but I have never shared all of it with anyone except for my therapist.Even my husband doesn't know all of it and I will never tell him.

It's not because of shame.It's because it's such a horrible story that I know people won't really know how to react to it.It's not something you usually read about or even hear about.There's the occasional TV show,movie or news headlines but that's about it.So if/when I do share any of my story,it's just the parts that I feel other people may be able to relate to,which is not even half of it.

Part of it too is because my therapist once said to me ""I have been doing this for 30+ years and I have never heard anything like that before""I'm sure he meant no harm and was just taken aback by what I was telling him,but still,it really impacted my willingness to share with anyone else.

Do you share yours?If not,what are your reasons?"
371,"I wanted to share some of my PTSD triggers because I was wondering if others were as strange as mine :p .  Some of the words that trigger me are:  Uncle, Jason, silly (said in a certain way), mints, anything about the army, people who fix computers, anything about rape, sexual assault, or molestation, and Joe’s Crab Shack.  They sound strange but they all have a meaning.  (Also, it’s hard to write this, I’m getting triggered :cry: ). Also when people reach for me or when someone starts talking about chests.

373,"On the 13th November 2015, the Bataclan, and various other parts of Paris were attacked by terrorists.

My wife is French, from Paris, knows the area well, and has an ex-boyfriend who was wounded in the attacks, and ended up in a coma.

We both have a history of drug use, and as a result of what happened, my wife bought, snorted and subsequently overdosed on heroin and diazepam.

She passed out for hours, crushing her leg, causing rhabdomyolysis, kidney failure, sepsis and finally 4 strokes, all in the brainstem.

She was unconscious for 10 days in the ICU - but it was the bit they take you where they think you’re probably going to die. Her heart rate was at both 217 and 18, within 6 hours on the same day.

Amazingly, remarkably, she recovered. Confounded the doctors by learning to walk, see, and speak within 2 weeks.

amazing right? 🙂

Not for me. Having seen her at various stages of close-to-death, and especially seeing her heart rate at 18, with her blood pressure dropping precipitously, and her alpha/beta and gamma brain waves flatlining, I was numb.

I’ve been numb ever since really. Apart from when I dream of her falling to her death, but not dying until she gets to the ICU and her heart stops.

Apart from when I’m just looking at her, and she’ll fade away before my eyes. Literally I’ll hear the heart slow, the doctor call the specialists, and I’ll see her dying in front of me. But actually dying. And then going through Rigor Mortis etc.

Then suddenly I’m awake, drenched in sweat. And it’s 3 hours later and I’ve been screaming non-stop.

I don’t know how to stop it. SSRIs, tricyclics, z-drugs, clonidine, seroquel, prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, lorazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam, midazolam, secobarbital, and, most scarily, chloral hydrate.

I’m in debt and lying to my wife.

I’ve totally lost control

Please help"
374,"Hi, I’m new here and wanted some advice please.

Over the course of my life (I’m 26), I’ve suffered every kind of abuse you can imagine, and sadly I’m not exaggerating.
Parents, ‘friends’, ex boyfriends, teachers, bullies in and out of school and even in adult life, former employers and colleagues...

I’ve never got over any of it, and have developed PTSD as a result of it all.
Everything that’s happened has made me terrified to leave the house since 2012 - what really put the nail in that coffin, was this:

In 2010, I had a group of friends whom I cared about a lot. We were close friends. A group of best friends. We always had fun, quite literally never argued, they were lovely girls.
I had been bullied all my life, and was thrilled to finally have real friends.
One day, that all changed completely out of the blue.
I was falsely accused of something I didn’t do (and could prove it. I did prove it.), however, the friendships one by one ended, and I was completely pushed out of the group. I was uninvited from a wedding entirely, where I was supposed to be a bridesmaid, at the request of two of the other girls. (“We’re not going if X (me) is going!”) so I was dropped.
Then further smear campaigns followed, I was horrifically bullied by people I called my friends. Everyone in the area was alienated against me, and I lost everyone but one friend. They did it at a time when I’d just found out my mum had cancer, and my case against the person who raped me, had been dropped despite evidence. I was already in a low place. This went on for 2 years!
As a result, I became afraid to go out. I have been severely agoraphobic ever since.

My one remaining friend has seen the damage these girls did to me - the abuse, the bullying, the smear campaigns. Yet she refused to take sides.
I could understand if it had been a silly squabble, but they destroyed my life,
And my trust in ANYONE. She knew what they’d done.
She calls them her best friends, and recently invited them to her wedding...
I was not invited.
Again.
They purposely tagged me in photos to rub my face in it, and I feel so betrayed all over again. She was supposed to be one of my oldest and best friends.
I can’t pretend I’m okay with her being their friend too. It’s unacceptable to me.
I decided to let her go.
Now I have only my boyfriend left...Nobody else.
This has all triggered my symptoms again; I feel so numb. 
I FEEL the sadness and the hurt and the betrayal, but I can’t get it out. I can’t seem to process it properly. I just feel so void...?
I can never get over this, and I can’t forgive them. I tried so hard, but I can’t."
375,"Hi. This is my first post here. I found this forum because I have no one irl who understands. I guess some background - 18 months ago my apartment building caught fire due to my neighbour's carelessness with a space heater and I was trapped in my top floor flat. I was unharmed physically but the experience left me with PTSD. To this day any smell of burning, dark corridors, fire engines triggers me and I have panic attacks. 

Anyway, I'm here more because after the anxiety passes I am left feeling so so angry that I have to deal with this. It's so freaking unfair I feel like I want to smash things and scream and shout and I don't know how I'm supposed to cope really.

I'm glad this forum exists :)"
376,"My mother died when I was 14, I'm now 25. When it happened I immediately gained a sense of sort of living a ""new life"" as a different person. It didn't really feel like me.

For some months after I became unusually extroverted almost manic. Then started to crash and became more and more anxious. I became obsessed with trying to think about what ""old me"" would do and trying to emulate that.

Eventually I would hyperventilate from fear just to go to school and couldn't go into class sometimes because of the fear. Felt like a constant lump in my throat. Anxiety built up and even started to feel like life wasn't real for a short while.

I recovered a fair bit from these symptoms by retreating from life completely although I still have anxiety. Very uncomfortable socially unless drunk etc. I don't like to meet new people.

Anyway... One time I took MDMA at a rave by accident. It was really weird though because when it hit me I immediately felt like I was living my ""first life"" again, rather than my ""new life"". I finally regained the sensation that I was living life as me, and sort of reunited with myself. This lasted throughout the high.

It's hard to explain because I sort of forgot what ""being me"" felt like. Being ""new me"" is normal now, but the extreme contrast felt literally like I was waking up from a coma as myself after being ""dead"" since the day my mom died until the MDMA hit my brain. It wasn't just feeling happy or my personality or behavior... It's literally that we all have a sensation of ""living life as us"" that's always with us but we don't realize it, that's what I lost when my mom died and that's what the drug brought back to me. A ""waking up from a dream"" type sensation.

Because it happened directly at the point of an event in my life that I found extremely traumatic I wondered if this might possibly be related to PTSD?

P.S. When I'm awake I don't really feel much when I think about her death. But in dreams sometimes I dream she's alive again and I'm panicking trying to keep her safe. Or she keeps dying and in the dream I'll start screaming or crying or yelling while continuously reviving her. I don't get it as much now but still occasionally."
377,"I don't know where to even start here... Hmm.. Let's see.. there is just so much to say. I guess I can't write it all here. In a nutshell, I grew up with very critical parents, sometimes quite cruel. Though I must say we had a lot of good times and laughter in between the bad times. My family, although dysfunctional was somehow close. 
My mom was abused horribly as a child, by her stepmom. My dad is an angry alcoholic with various addiction issues. I have a brother and a sister.. were all three very unconfident people. My parents are highly critical, and don't have much self esteem themselves. 
I always felt like I was the odd one out, like I never quite fit in with my family. It felt like I was the scapegoat many times.. and I'd say so and I'd be told I'm too sensitive. 
I ended up in a very abusive relationship for 13 years. I married him. Finally when he'd threatened to murder me for the 100th time... I finally decided to leave him. I actually moved back in with my parents to get away from him, because he'd been breaking into my apartment. I was terrified. They promised things would be better because I told them I didn't want to live with them, because they were too cruel at times. I moved in with them... My husband stalked me for around a year. I had many issues from PTSD, anxiety and depression. Along with absolutely crippling insomnia. My parents were sorta nice at first. Seemed to feel bad about my husband... Then slowly things got more back to normal.. with them being more critical and cruel. Don't get me wrong they could be very nice at times in between... But it seemed like as time went on my entire family began to resent me more and more. I could never sleep. I was so depressed, I tried to go to them for help and it seemed like no one really cared as much anymore. Sometimes I thought I was just imagining it because I was feeling so low. I'd told my mom I'd been contemplating suicide. She told the rest of my family and they made rude remarks.. acted as if I was only saying so to manipulate them in some way. 
One day no one was home except my dad. I don't know if he was drunk or took pills.. no idea. But he basically tried to call my bluff and was almost egging me on to kill myself. I finally just said 'fuck you' and went to walk away. Then he punched me in the back of my head as I was walking away. He didn't do it as hard as he could, but hard enough to make me lose my footing and give me a headache. I was so angry. I told him if he wanted to punch me to do it to.my face instead of being a pussy from behind. 
At that moment I decided I'd move out. Even if I was going to be homeless. I was not going to let anyone hit me anymore, period. I'd left my husband for safety to live with my parents... And my dad punches me. 
When I tell my mom I'm moving out, she gets very angry. She asks me if I can show her bruises if he punched me...like she didn't believe it. My brother and sister don't seem to believe it either...even tho every one of them has seen him be violent in the past and knows he has alcohol and addiction problems. 
I felt so alone. I had to make a GoFundMe account so I could make sure to have enough money to be able to live. It was humilating but it felt like I had no other options. I had been sick from all of the stress I think, of what was going on at the time and was on the verge of losing my job, had missed several days of work already at that time. 
My family found out about the GoFundMe and got very angry that I'd stated that I'd been abused on it. I never named any names, but they felt that I publicly embarrassed them, I think. 
My parents tried to get my car towed away before I could. Just to get it impounded to hurt me. All this as I'm moving out. They stuffed all my Belongings in the car along with trash... Rotting trash. Who does that? I still can't believe it. 
After I leave, my brother tells me that I'm projecting..and acts like none of what I told him about what happened was real... I feel like I'm going crazy at this point.
My sister tells me she never wants to talk to me again. My sister and my brother tell me I can not talk to my niece and nephews any longer, that it's not healthy for them to be around me. I'm devastated at this. So confused. 
My parents had also said they didn't want me in their lives any longer. At the time I didn't mind that much because I was so angry with them both. But I never thought my brother and sister would leave me too.
They need my mother, she watches their kids for them. She probably would have made their lives hell if they went against her.
But now it's been 2 years and they still don't want anything to do with me. I don't understand why. 
But my parents talk to me here and there. I found out my dad lied to everyone and said he didn't put punch me but that he slapped me. Everyone is apparently believing him and also are okay with him slapping me... Even thouvh that should not be ok.
My parents only talk to me every couple months or so. It's so half assed. It's nice we have been cordial but nothing has ever really been discussed because all they do is blame me and basically call me a liar. 
My mom has been reaching out a bit more here and there. even when she's nice it triggers me and I have horrible anxiety and I cry and cry. I can't sleep sometimes for 3 days straight. I feel like I've never dealt with this abandonment. I don't know what to do. I feel so heart broken and confused. I don't know why they don't want me around. The only thing that makes sense to me is that I called attantion to what my dad did. In my family everything was always swept under the rug but I moved and made a big deal and stood up for myself. 
Anyway. This is just blabbering I'm sorry.. there is more to the story too but it's too much to type all out I think. 
Anyway. I'm really struggling with my PTSD anxiety and depression and insomnia. I'm desperately seeking relief. I think I need to face this whole thing and make a choice. 
Part of me just wants my family back and to be loved. 
Part of me knows they aren't really healthy for me. They've caused me so much grief. I can't believe they'd abandon me this way. And especially for reasons that don't make sense. 
I'm a kind person, I feel like they've always preyed on that in me. Idk what to say. Or do.
My mom tries to contact me.. should I just cut all ties completely and stop answering her? 
I believe she likes to hurt me.. because she was abused. But she's my mom and I love her. I feel so torn and hopeless."
378,"Hello

I have been out on Abilify recently and was wondering if anyone else had been on them and how they felt. I am a student so am finding it really hard to concentrate on work and am shaking a lot. I also get mad bursts of energy and cannot stop moving or get comfortable. 

:) Many Thanks if you can help me out :)"
379,"I recently came to terms with my PTSD, that is, accepting that I have it, after having flashbacks from some medication and getting hospitalized for 3 days. Now I feel worse than before, like the memories have all surfaced. Anyone else experience this? Is it normal? Any advice? I am avoiding medication at this point because I was over medicated for a while and then the medication they switched me to gave me bad reactions like hives, breathing trouble, etc."
380,"Hi all,   :hi:
   
First post on this forum so please be gentle.... :)

I'm supporting a friend who is suffering (My very amateur diagnosis) from Complex PTSD. There is mush to her story and there are many aspects of her life now that she is struggling with, I'd like a little help and to be able to bounce off experienced folk on this forum, as I try to help her. I'll try to bullet point the situation as briefly as I can below, or this will become a war and peace post, not good for a first visit!

Talking about ""P""...



She was heavily sexually abused as a child from 8 through to 16
A parent was involved and several of their adult 'friends'
This was a long time ago (circa 20 years)
She has grown up to be an amazing lady and was until recently very happy indeed
she now has gone massively downhill and is suffering from the following...

Flashbacks
Eating disorder, weight loss, etc
Lack of sleep
Drinking and some prescription meds
Self blame
Fear
Being sick
Etc



P has tried professional help and ""won't go there again"" as it drove her to considering taking her own life. She felt that they dug up her past and then were not around to help her deal with the aftermath.

She has talked to many friends in the last 12 months, most cannot cope with her story and either break down or back away, this is only the very basic stuff too.

She has started talking to me after my wife was one of those that could not cope, I don't know why but I feel like we are getting somewhere and she is sharing with me quite a bit. There is a lot of detail we simply have not got to, some things she tells me ""I can't even think about, let alone talk about"".



I'm looking after me and thus far I'm coping fine.
I've started reading a couple of books after a chat with someone at NAPAC.


There are three things that she mentions time and time again...



Talking to her aggressors to get answers.
Making contact with an adopted child from the abuse period.
Getting herself able to get her ""Suit of Armour"" back on.


From my perspective, I'm concerned with helping her but I'm unsure of how to prioritise...



The eating is very bad and will soon become her main and possibly only problem.
Getting P to a place where she can cope better and hopefully move on with her life.
Contacting the adopted I have big reservations about, I've gathered the facts for her but nothing more.
Contacting the aggressors I feel is a very bad idea, I doubt anything good will come from that, I don't know though?




Appreciate this is a lot, any help, advice, thoughts etc would be greatly appreciated.

kind regards
Simon"
381,"I just submitted my first University essay (for a take home exam) since I survived my suicide attempt.
I wanted to tell someone about how much it feels like I have accomplished something, but I know at this point my friends are sick of hearing it and they cannot really understand.
The effort it took and the immense fear. I don't always know what my triggers are but anything that makes me highly stressed is a no go. I am also seeing a psychiatrist and my essay was on Psychiatry and its limitations so it was somewhat triggery considering.
But I did it, and it feels like I have not accomplished anything in so so long.
I know its just an essay but it feels like I pushed back against my illness and won this round. Even if I lose tomorrow, this makes me feel OK, and I have not felt OK in a long time. :):):)"
382,I used smelling salts in the past to manage dissociation. Only thing that worked as long as could catch self. I need to find them again so can try control. but chemists don't seem to stock them anymore in UK... Does anyone know anywhere that sells Mackenzie's smelling salts in UK please? I may have to resort to buying products that are for body builders (not sure if these same thing) but would rather get product I know. Thank you.
383,"So I've been stressed and somewhat overwhelmed, lately.  Having to fly back Up North to deal with my late father's estate and bury him has brought up a lot of the old abuse memories, and that, along with other things has had the PTSD kicking up and hitting levels that I haven't experienced in years.  I've been mostly dealing with it, and the accompanying spike in suicidal ideation (no I'm not in danger, currently, thanks,) but today has been...rough.

I don't go into fight mode, generally.  I just...don't let myself.  I get scary in fight mode, and people get scared, and things get broken, and...well, it's just not a good thing.  So I don't allow myself to do it.  I've pretty much gotten down the knack of setting myself into flight mode, instead.  I'd far rather have people think I'm a coward (I'm not, and know I'm not,) than wind-up taking a chance on hurting someone who doesn't deserve it.  But today started out with my getting overwhelmed and punching the keyboard, while it was sitting on my lap, then snapping it in half and throwing it.  Not good.

Good news?  My girlfriend, who has a history of being abused by past exes, didn't even flinch.  She says she knew she was never in danger from me, and it didn't even scare her.  She merely remarked, amused, that she'd never actually seen anyone fold a keyboard in half, before, and didn't know anyone could do that.  Then she helped me clean up the scattered keys, and found the spare one we had about the house, while I sat and WTFF'ed at the fact that I'd lost control.  Bless her for that.  It helped.  I'd never've forgiven myself, if I'd've scared her.  She's been through more than enough of that, in her life, already.  Also good?  It was a keyboard, not the television, or one of the windows, or a hole in the wall, or my computer monitor, or the computer itself, or....  So, nothing too expensive, and easily replaced.

Later, we had to drive over to Leesburg, where they're having their annual BikeFest this weekend.  That...wasn't such a good idea.  My girlfriend wanted me to go with her, as she had business in Leesburg, and didn't really feel safe (last she was there during BikeFest, she nearly wound-up in the middle of two guys getting into a fight in the doorway of the Taco Bell, there.)  So I drove, but all of the Outlaw-Biker wannabees, cosplaying on their Harleys with loud pipes and over-testosteroned pseudo-macho sh*thead aggressive attitude were really making me edgy as all hell.  At more than one point, I was shaking, and not from fear.  I kept having to massively resist the urge to just up and punch one of them in the face, and if one of them had gotten in my face a bit worse, I don't know whether I'd've been able to stop myself....  And under normal circumstances, I'm about the least violent person you'll ever meet.  I'll walk out of a room before I'll get into a fight, unless I have to defend myself, or someone else.  I lived, when I was a boy, in an environment where I was constantly being attacked and constantly had to fight, and I promised myself when I got out on my own that I'd never live that way again.

But today?  Oh, man, did I come close.  And I didn't like it at all.  I generally don't have much problem with bikes and loud pipes.  (I think they're obnoxious and the whole 'loud pipes save lives' is nonsense and simply an excuse to keep people from complaining about them being obnoxious, but I can handle them.)  Today, every dammed time another one of those things roared past me, it just ratcheted me farther up the scale.  And I know it was just a bunch of sh*theaded macho-idiot-wannabees out for a weekend of what was essentially cosplaying fun at the town's expense.  But gods, did it set me off....

Any road, we're back home, now, so that's done and over with.  And tomorrow it's Daytona, not Leesburg, so I won't have to deal with all those a**holes again.  And Monday it's back to work, and the next time we drive to Leesburg, it hopefully won't be during BikeFest.

I'll still probably have to take pills, to put myself to sleep, tonight.  Luckily, I've a prescription for that.  It would help, if I could stop glancing at the front door, every few seconds.  I mean: It's bolted, and it's not as if anyone's going to burst in through it.  It's just the hypervigilance kicking-in, of course.  At least it's not doing that with all the windows as well.  Granted, I'm jumpy as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking-chairs, but that's to be expected when I'm racheted-up like this....

I really, really hate having PTSD.  Gods, I hope I don't get nightmares, tonight.  I don't need those back, as well...."
384,"Well. For starters. I have ptsd, chronic depression, & I'm manic bipolar. 
I also have major panic/anxiety attacks throughout the day that are becoming crippling. 
I had a doctor that let me become seriously addicted to klonopin. I crave everyday in hopes of the release it gave me. (Ive been off of it since january 2016) 


I started using CBD but I'm currently out. (It has worked tremendously with my insomnia & night terrors. Seriously recommend it.)

Anyways. 
I feel completely fucking trapped in my body. I feEl I was bred to live a life similar as a dairy cow. I was bred into existence to be tortured, used, & killed. 
If you know anything about the dairy industry. It is fucked. 
But it's so similar. 
My mom told me all the time that she never.wanted me & took out everything she hated about herself & my dad on me. She fucked me up emotionally. 
She didn't even care that her boyfriend was showing me his dick either. She made him apologize but sent me to another state a month after I finally opened up. She seriously hates me & considers me inconvenient. 
I have grown this entire life feeling worthless & I fucking hate myself. 
Now I'm on some road to psychological recovery. 
I've been in therapy for 2 years. 
I'm constantly trying to convince myself I'm worth something. 
I can even take my emotions out of things & look at them from a logical perspective. 
So why the fuck do I look in the mirror & want to rip my skin off? I'm disgusted by my flaws. 
I'm fixated that my boyfriend is going to cheat on me with this girl at work too. 
He always says he isn't talking to anyone but then I hear him tell stories of what these chicks tell him at work. 
I don't fucking get it. 
I'm intimidating & I can be very analytical.
But even with that I have voiced my expectations of honesty because lying to me really fucks me up.
I can't seem to trust this person. Even tho they stick by me through all of my shit. I just can't seem to fathom this person is not going to rip my fucking guts out. 
I also can't shut the fuck up about myself. I'm constantly crying/upset about something. They keep telling me I'm wrong & I'm overanalyzing things. 
But hell. For some reason I can't help but feel fucked up about it. 
I went to his work because he forgot his lunch to bring him mine & he was ""working"" in the back with her. (Idk what he considers work & what he considers bullshitting) 


I'm soooooo comfortable with chaos it's sick. 
Some words of wisdo would be really appreciated."
385,"Hi guys!

I have PTSD, but I also have chronic depression, anxiety, and a mood disorder all tied together with chronic pain. I also suffer from post concussive disorder from previously having a traumatic brain injury. So, ya, a big ball of mess right here.

Anyways, I was hoping to get some advice on getting and staying asleep. I have insomnia from the PTSD but I also have a very hard time not mixing my days and nights up. Honestly it's a daily struggle. I can be awake for over 24 hours and as soon as night comes I'm wide awake again like I drank an entire case of redbull. If I do get to sleep, I have a hard time staying asleep because of flashbacks. I have absolutely horrible nightmares and will wake up in a full on sweat with my heart feeling like it's beating out of my chest. This happens multiple times per night. I was on Klonopin, but I had to stop using it and since then it's been so much worse. I have tried meditation and white noise but that's not seeming to help at all. I'm taking 10 mg of melatonin at bedtime. Anyone have any other ideas that work for you or someone you know?"
386,"I have really been struggling in my marriage lately,trying to decide whether I want to divorce my husband or not.I feel like I hate him most of the time....

I realized though that sometimes when I look at my husband I am not seeing him,I am seeing my dad.I didn't grasp that fact before until I was thinking about it,thinking about why I stayed away from,and didn't talk to my husband the entire day yesterday.I couldn't even stand to be in the same room he was in.He didn't do or say anything to upset me,I just couldn't be around him.At all.

So I am really confused to how much of these problems in my marriage are really my husband and how much are due to my PTSD.

Just throwing this out there hoping someone can understand."
387,"I've had a lot of abuse: mental, physical, and sexual.

Sometimes interaction with my mother will trigger me and everything comes rushing back. I always thought I was crazy and wonder why she doesn't care or understand and I get angry that people make assumptions that I have a great life. Because my sister and my brother blab about their abuse so loudly and I'm very quiet.


I think I'll be broken forever. Financial situation is putting me in my mothers house and she sits in the living room which is attached to the kitchen and always wants to talk but more so ask me for things when I'm getting water or food. 

So much has happened in my life but I was laying in bed and realized my mother triggers me and I get flashbacks and I feel just like I'm 20 again. I push my bf away and blurt out inappropriate things to my mom. I wish she cared about me but she never did when I was emotional she always shut down and when I would hurt myself she said I was too old for stupid things like that but she didn't know my (ex)bf at the time was physically abusing me. And when I told her at 14 that I wanted to kill myself she didn't say one word and walked outside.

I think that my mom is cold and heartless. She blamed me for being raped and my dad made fun of me for it.

I'm not sure how to handle living here anymore and it drives me so crazy. But when I didn't live with her I was ok, have a healthy relationship with my boyfriend and have begun to make healthy friendships.

I guess I wish I could change my mom but she just doesn't care about the abuse I went through. But my sister was beaten by her ex and everyone cared for her. Actually my siblings got all the care and I got none. I always had to clean up the pieces because my mother is sick. I think she wants me to live with her forever and doesn't want me to be able to care for myself. 

I can never talk to friends because they don't understand and I'm afraid of revealing too much about my past. I guess I feel alone and misunderstood and angry and sad because I wanted to do so much with my life and I gave it all to my mother and now I resent her."
388,"Just curious,there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of activity here."
389,"Of all the PTSD symptoms I struggle with,my extreme startle response and being easily angered are the 2 I hate most.

People usually laugh when I am startled, which is so embarrassing for me.I laugh about it too when they do because I don't want them to know I feel embarrassed or that their laughing hurts me.

I am ashamed of my explosive anger,sometimes the slightest things can really set me off.I apologize afterwards but it doesn't ease the shame I feel.

What about you?Are you ever embarrassed/ashamed over any of your symptoms?"
390,"Hi
I wander if someone could advise. 
16 years ago I had a massive breakdown. Medication pulled me out of it. I had episodes of depression for years which became more and more mild. Four years ago my depression fizzled out and a few months later anxiety kicked in. It comes and goes. I become terrified that I'm going back to that place of 16 years ago. Im struggling badly just now as my sleep problems of that time have returned and I can't separate them from all the horrible stuff. Also I'm scared the sleep problem will make me depressed. 

My doctor tells me I have GAD with a bit of PTSD and a sleep phobia. I feel it all stems from my first episode and has left me traumatised. 

Any advice would be much appreciated"
391,"It's been a while since I posted here. I am now a 27 year old veteran who has now well adjusted into a new career in academia. I spent 8 years in total with the military and I've been through some tough times as a child, and dealt with some nasty things while in the army. I was medically discharged officially last year for physical impairment due to injuries suffered from the army.

In the earlier stages of my PTSD, I resorted to alcohol, and a lot of night time problems, sometimes waking up to destroying things near my bed, reacting to dreams. Stress rashes. It has calmed down very much since about 6 years ago, when I left the ""combat"" out of my trade.

Recently, I am with a wonderful lady, and I feel that she completes me and I thought my PTSD was well within control, but... I had a stressful day, and had a bad dream while she was in my arms when we were sleeping.

I woke up to her scream, when I punched her in my sleep. She tells me she is okay, and fine and etc. but I want to make sure that this doesn't happen again.

Any suggestions from sufferers and their spouse/partners?"
392,I have been experiencing horrid dreams of past trauma and feeling physical pain during the dream and when I wake up. This have been getting worse since I have been doing EMDR. Do other people experience this? I feel very alone with this.
393,"I had treatment for my  PTSD just over 12 months ago and the flashbacks and anxiety completely resolved at the time.  About a month ago I started to get anxious, but there were good reasons for the anxiety and it didn't seem out of proportion or irrational to the situation.  A couple of weeks ago my boss told me she was worried about me and I hadn't been myself and encouraged me to reduce my workload for a bit to reduce my stress levels.  Then even with this and with restarting going to the gym and mindful meditation I'm finding my anxiety rising and it's now in the irrational and disproportionate stage.

I don't know if this is something separate 'just ' stress and anxiety or if it is a hangover from the PTSD.  A lot of my recent stress has been somewhat linked to my husband's illness which was what caused to PTSD in the first place.  It feels like I felt before when I started getting ill with the PTSD and that time I went to all my go to strategies that I have used for depression in the past, exercise, meditation, mindfulness, counceĺing and antidepressants but none of them stopped things getting worse.  So that is scary.  I've got an appointment with my GP this afternoon and I'm waiting for the private therapist I saw for the PTSD to get back to me with an appointment.  I'm still seeing my councillor though not for another month and I've tried bringing that appointment forward but she is fully booked.  I've left a message with my family liaison CPN for an appointment but not yet got a reply.  I'm doing all the right things again, but that didn't stop me getting so Ill before  :cry2:"
394,"Hi All,

I would like to get some support / information for the issues I am currently going through, I will start with a short potted history for context.

In 2016 I was knocked off my cycle from behind by a driver going 50mph, luckly I wasn't badly injured physically, but quite deeply mentally, I couldn't even get on a static bike, at which point I seeked medical help, and in early 2017 was diagnosed with PTSD.

I then had a course of CBT in Oct 17 at which point my issues worsened, they decided to curtail my CBT treatment and instead get a course of EMDR.

In Oct 17 I saw my GP about the issues I was having, who prescribed me Mitazipane,  after a month I saw the GP again, and we discussed the medication, we decided that due to the amount of weight I was putting on with Mitazipane we would try Fluxotene, a week into taking Fluxotine I had a very bad reaction to it, when led to me stopping the Fluxotine (on doctors orders) and having to take 2 weeks off work and be put on Diazapam.

About a week after that, I returned back to Mitazipine and things settled down, until I saw my GP again in Jan, when again we were worried about the weight gain (for context, I lost 10 stone in weight in 2006-2008, which 'cured' my type 2 diabetes, so weight gain is a concern), so decided to try Duloxotine.

Fast forward to now, I am now a week into Duloxotine, and getting bad side affects again, not as bad as the Fluxotine, but bad enough to be concerned.

To add another layer of complications to it, I also suffer with Tinnitus, which is made much worse due to stress, which the side effects give me, so that is a bit of an issue too.

I guess my questions are, has anyone been through anything similar?, I am considering coming off medication completely, because although the issues I was having before the meds are bad enough, they are nothing in comparison to the side effects I get on meds.

Or do I push through the side effects?, will things improve?, if I can't take Duloxotine does that effectively rule out meds that work like this?, the GP said about the Fluxotine that any med in that family would have the same issues.

Thanks in advance."
395,"Hello people, I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD and am seeing a therapist to help with it, (doing CBT). She claims that once the traumatic memory is processed then there can be no relapse to the symptoms. She also says that once it's cured then it's cured, it's one of the only mental health issues that they can fully cure.

But my query is this, from all the extensive reading I've done on the internet every source says that there is no cure for PTSD, only help managing the symptoms.

Can anyone elaborate on this? Thanks and good day."

This is a  graphic narrative you have to click on image to view  in slide show  ."
397,"My brain is telling me it's stupid, shameful and weird to have this problem, so talking about it is so hard. I feel so pathetic and humiliated. But I need to talk to someone about it... so that's why I'm posting here. It's still extremely difficult, even though it's anonymous. But... I need help thinking about it and dealing with it, and I can't talk to anyone in person about it yet.
As a young child, I was abused when being disciplined. (For the record, it was not in any way sexual.) I'm going to go into some detail because I feel like it will help explain the issues I'm having. It might be triggering, so skip this next paragraph if you don't want the specifics.
My (already intimidating) dad would work himself into a rage (not that I knew that at the time, I obviously thought I caused it) to spank me severely (not to the point of injury, just repeatedly and with obvious rage in his voice). There was never any warning or clear explanation for why he did it, I guess it was supposed to be obvious (maybe he'd say something like ""never do that again"" or something, I don't remember). But there would be a moment I knew it was coming by his face and body language, so I often tried to run crying and screaming and he'd chase me down and grab me off my feet and throw me on his knee. 

So, skip ahead a few decades (I'm about to be 29) and I'm still dealing with C-PTSD (not diagnosed yet, but I can't see how it would be anything else) in the form of minor ""flashbacks"" (technically they're overwhelming intrusive thoughts/memories, not full flashbacks since I'm still aware of reality around me) to the abuse. The specific issue I'm addressing is one of the many images and emotions that accompany the intrusive memories. It's specifically a preoccupation with my butt. It's like, when I'm triggered, I'm suddenly very aware of it and have a powerful urge to hide and protect it, along with feelings of shame and fear (the anticipation of punishment). But one result of this is also feeling like there's something inherently wrong with my butt and and that I should feel shameful about it. 
I'm not sure how directly related to it this is, but along with that I also end up feeling pathetic and gross, and that I deserve to be spanked now, which is horribly humiliating and... dehumanizing, I guess? Or like I don't have any inherent dignity or respect as an adult or as a woman.

For the record: Yes I am seeing a therapist and we're dealing with the abuse and intrusive memories, but I have not had the courage to mention the preoccupation with my butt or how it makes me feel. Like I said, I feel overwhelmingly shameful and humiliated about it.
Also, the abuse was mostly as a younger child. My dad realized at some point (I think my mom helped) that he was going too far. As an adult, I've discussed it with him and he was very defensive about it for a while but finally accepted that it was a mistake and acknowledged that he damaged me very deeply (which was never his intention) and he has apologized sincerely and shown remorse. Though seeing or hearing him get angry or impatient at one of my younger siblings is still very triggering to the intrusive memories, even though he is no longer abusive at all.
Finally, one reason I feel the need to address this now is that I'm being forced to live with my parents again (due to an inability to be financially independent), so I'm afraid that will just amplify all my issues (which I have discussed with my therapist, but honestly he hasn't said anything super helpful about it).

So... I don't know what specifically I'm looking for thoughts/advice about... I partly just needed to get that all out and to tell someone who's sympathetic who won't judge me, even if it's a stranger. But I guess the main thing I don't know what to do about is the preoccupation. I try to ignore it and distract myself, but the feelings don't go away for a long time once I'm triggered. The whole thing just makes me hate myself."

399,"Hi guys, I'm new to the group but I'm hoping maybe a few of you will read and comment. 

I have had PTSD for years now. I also have anxiety depression and a mood disorder, so PTSD is not the only culprit for me. I am wanting to know if you guys have problems associating with other people. I literally have no, not even one, friend. The only people I talk to are my two year old, my five year old, and husband when he isn't at work. I'm terribly lonely, but I'm not comfortable outside my home (I actually struggle with paranoia in my home), so meeting people out is out of the question. Because of my physical limitations I don't work, so friends from work is also out. 

Not only do I struggle with friendship problems but I have been having problems with connecting with family as well. I try very hard to connect withy siblings parents and extended family but every conversation seems to end in some weird dead end where I'm left looking like an outsider and the person I'm trying to connect with is wondering who is sitting on their couch. My parents are an entirely different battle in themselves because that don't believe in my problems. They don't think that I have PTSD because I was not held hostage for 3 months or blown up by an IED in Afghanistan. They think that the rest of my problems are because I am lazy and need a job even though I have documentation from multiple doctors stating multiple reasons I can't work. I just had a kidney infection that was so bad that my doctor said she had perscribed the heaviest medication possible and that if I hadn't improved in five days I had to go to the hospital because my kidney function was already reduced and they would end up shutting down. My dad gave me two day from the day that I went to the doctor and wanted to know if I was all better. They just don't believe me and I don't understand why. But again I restate, an entirely different battle.

Does anyone else have or have had problems like this? If you use to, how did you change things? I'm really looking for some help with this one. I've made a lot of positive changes but this is something that I have not figured out yet. 

Thanks to all!"
400,"Hello. Recently I was diagnosed with a chronic illness that leaves me in pain, emotionally imbalanced and with insomnia - at only 38 too! I also had a year from hell with a ton of trauma, including 3 surgeries, which has given me PTSD. I use to be a happy go lucky/ active person, so this is a blow to my self esteem and mental state... I just can't get back into my life bc it will never be the same. I often think dying would be a better state bc Im so depressed and don't want a this type of quality of life bc I mourn for my old one. People talk to me and Im not even present anymore, Im a shell of myself. I think of people who have had their lives taken (like in terrorist attacks or some type of killing) and think ""that should be me - those people want to live"". I just feel so dissociated from the world right now and just want to either go back to how things were (which obviously can't happen) or I fantasize of dying (not suicidal tho) bc I just want all the pain to be over and to finally rest in peace. Has anyone else felt this way?"
401,"I guess starting at the beginning would help.

I was three years old when my father was murdered.  My mother was an overbearing controlling jealous woman.  My childhood was riddled with religion, beatings, verbal and emotional abuse.   molested at the age of nine for over a year by my uncle and raped at 17 by my step-father.  When I tried to tell my mother she blamed me and sent me away my senior year to a boarding school (not once did she come see me or come get me for the holidays.. I was the only student left at the school.)  she never let my dads family around us because of all the dirt they had on her which I found out later after finding my dads family.  
That was my childhood in a nutshell.  I left home after graduation with just the clothes on my back.. I ran... I do mean ran to college where I was raped by three men (my fault for trusting and putting myself in the situation).  I ran again and ended up meeting the man I married (30 years ago now)  I want to say I was 22 when I helped take care of my husband's aunt and held her hand as she passed away. The first 13 years of marriage we tried to have children (lots of damage from being beaten so much as a child) I had a lot of health issues and finally got pregnant with my oldest daughter then six years later had our youngest daughter.  my marriage hasn't been bad but he can be a very selfish man and well romance is not in his vocabulary and he is quite rough around the edges.. not as supportive as I would like.  I have spent the majority of my adult life helping others.. moving them in my house or giving more than I have.  In January 2017 a friend of mine for over 15 years needed a place to stay (a truly long story which I won't go into).  I ended up fixing up her home which took over three months to clean and paint which I did for nothing.   We moved her home and for the last eight months or more I was her daily caregiver {taking her to doctors, doing her shopping and anything else she needed}.. on December 18th, 2017,  I got a call that there was a fire at her house.  I went racing over and could see the fire from a half mile away, I get there and the house is gone she is dead.  Ptsd is killing me, I can see it, hear it, smell it and feel that night.  there is so much more I could tell you, years of pain and hurt that is unexplainable.  No one can understand how lost I am.. not even a month yet and people act like they don't want to hear about what I am feeling and living through.   I can't sleep. I don't want to function and I need an outlet.  I know therapy right??  I'm currently without a car and money and hope.
I could tell you so much more like my husband is addicted to porn and my needs are never met etc  I think we will leave that for another discussion. 
Thank you so much for letting me vent."

Hello I’m really struggling. I watched my uncle die 3 yrs ago and stayed with his body 3 hours. I wondered what a body would look like in chapel of rest as I wasn’t sure if to go see him so I googled it but wish I hadn’t it’s ruined my life. The body was decayed now it’s all I see when I close my eyes. I’m having suicidal thoughts and intrusive thoughts too.  I also seen a man come off his bike and die. And saw my bf grandad die too. Recently is worse I’ve been dreaming of random dead bodies but I’ve been waking up and smelling death and then being sick. Then I go back to sleep and the dream carry’s on. I can’t google any images incase a body or anything to do with death. I can’t watch movies unless someone know if theres anything hat triggers me. I sleep with the light on. I have ptsd and all of these triggers make me disassociate more. No one around me gets it they say it’s all in my head. 3 weeks ago ide had enough and tried to kill myself I failed and I’m scared because I’m scared to goto sleep because I can’t control the dreams. I’m waiting for a psychology referral but that will take 2 yrs. what can I do. Thanks"

407,"Hi all 
I am new to this board. Here is a quick background. I do have BPD and this year has been very traumatic. I have a form of Hypermobility and 14 years on (I'm 28) I am still waiting for an official diagnosis. This year there have been major physical changes I've jumped from having 1 dislocation a year to 12 both hips, shoulders and thumb. I may also have cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, proprioceptive dysfunction, agrophobia and kiniesophia (fear of pain) bladder issues difficulty emptying which leads to nasty infections which cause voices and gastro issues. My stomach just completely gives up digesting food so I end up throwing up. Plus chronic pain and insomnia. I have a high resistance to pain relief so things like morphine no longer work 😭 which completely sucks. I have completely disassociated from the world and to top it all I have fibromyalgia. In January I had an accident at work I was simply standing talking to my colleague suddenly dislocated my hip fall on the floor and dislocated my shoulder. With all these events I believe I suppressed all my emotions and they have exploded out of know where I started self harming which lead to an admission to a psychiatric hospital which to me was a horrendous experience soon discharged myself. Then my boyfriend dumps me and because of my physical support he has given me was taken away over night. I've had to stay at my dad's I am so traumatised by this just the thought ok if sucks me In to an emotional vortex. I am not entitled to help from the NHS. Would anyone know if a diagnosis of PTSD make a difference? Is there a different type of treatment? The flashbacks are horrendous. I'm so confused!!! I'm sorry for rambling but as my family are not supportive I have no one else to turn to for advice. Thanks again."
408,"Hi everyone. 
My boyfriend has been diagnosed with PTSD.
He often says he feels numb, emotionless, deattached, no purpose, feels bored of life, is flat in emotions. He went through something extremely traumatic some time ago..

He has told me that he struggles to feel love for me (although previously in our 6 yr relationship he used to love me and always express this).

Has anyone else experienced that they struggle to feel love for their partner? I love him dearly and I feel broken hearted, I just want to understand what’s happening.."
409,I have been seeing a therapist and physicist for couple of months for my depression and suicidal thoughts and intrusive thoughts. I had a very hostile childhood and witnessed a lot of domestic abuse. I saved my mother's life on a few occasions. I am now 31 and don't think much about my childhood as it dissent bother me much but my therapist thinks I have suppressed memories and as a coping mechanism I emotionally numb and depression has manifested from this ? I don't know ! I'm kinda sceptical. How can this be effecting me now ?
410,"A family member of mine (my guardian) has PTSD after a severe accident almost 30 years ago. He claims that my symptoms of social stress, strange sleeping patterns, chronic depression, irritability and nervousness match his, and despite never being diagnosed with it, he strongly believes I have PTSD as well. This is because he knows I was physically abused and neglected by my parents.

The thing is, all the abuse happened before I was taken from their home at the age of six months. I do not have flashbacks, obviously, because I don't even remember what happened. All I know is the sparse details I've gleaned from others in the family, who are naturally reluctant to talk about it. I do know that my father was charged with assault but deemed unfit to stand trial because of his Bipolar 1. Until I was 18 I was never allowed to be alone with either or both of my parents; my guardians had to be present. They describe how in the first months when I went to live with them, they'd often see me sit silent and trembling in my high chair, staring vacantly into space.

So anyway. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 which isn't much of a surprise as bipolar often runs in families. But I do feel like there's more to it than that. I have strong attachment issues and an underlying chronic depression besides the wilder mood swings of bipolar. Is it possible to have PTSD from such a young age? Or could the abuse have affected my development in some way?"
411,"So this might run a little long but I would greatly appreciate help.

I was very severely emotionally abused and physically abused as a child. I had gotten a therapist and eventually found out through a court document that he believed I have PTSD. I didn't think to much about it, I was more focused on recovering from all the other stuff. 

So recently I have been thinking about that diagnosis more, I just feel confused. I've done research and many people talk about flashbacks and experiencing episodes, but I don't have that. I experience things like if I see someone of similar body build to my abuser I have a panic attack. Or if I see shoes that remind me of his shoes I get weirded out. A lot of my abuse revolved around softball so now I really hate talking about or seeing sports at all. I do experience intrusive thoughts, sometimes I physically have to shake my head to try and get rid of them. But I don't know if that counts... I just feel like it's so mild it doesn't count and I'm just being a baby. I just feel lost and confused, I want to know if I'm just making this all up and I just need to move one and get over it."
412,"I used to date someone who was an alcoholic. When he drank, he got very angry, mean and verbally abusive. He eventually cheated on me and I left him. Now, about 5 years later, I'm engaged to a wonderful guy who barely drinks, only on special occasions and vacations. But...whenever he does have even just one drink I feel my anxiety go through the roof like something bad is going to happen. At first, we argued about it because he didn't understand. I eventually told him about my ex and he now understands, but I still have the same time anytime he even just has one drink. Is there such a thing as having PTSD from an ex who was an alcoholic? Has anyone else experienced this? And if so, any ideas on how I can get over this?"
413,"Hello, I am new to the forum, but I was wondering if some could way in on a mater that seems to continually pop up in regards to living with others. I have non-combat related PTSD as well as attachment issues stemming from childhood. Most of my communication issues lie with tone and misunderstandings when talking to others. I can come off as talking down to others or sarcastic when answering questions, an often find it hard to find words (especially nouns) when I feel put on the spot so to say. I honestly don't recognize when I make a communication error, and when I try to explain my actions or that I am not being disrespectful, I am accused of making an excuse. In verbal communication I understand that intention is not easily conveyed and quite often the person whom I have offended is already on the defense because my intention was misunderstood. Yes, I understand once a message is put out I am no longer responsible for how the other person interprets it, and if it weren't an ongoing thing with almost everyone I live with or am in a relationship with I would say that I didn't have a hand in the issue. Is there anything I can do to be more aware on my part other than offering yet another ""excuse""?"

Last session was the assesment for EMDR therapy. I found it so hard to be honest about my present experiences, (amount of avoidance, flashbacks etc) I have a tendency to miminalise everything. I feel angry with myself for not being honest and know I should been more open. Should I tell her that my responses weren't accurate or will it just make her angry?

419,"Tetris for PTSD: behavioural intervention unlikely to vaccinate against intrusions

Written by Ioana Cristea


Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly debilitating condition. Since traumatic events themselves are difficult to prevent, there is heightened interest in preventing the onset or symptoms of PTSD after the event has already occurred. Both pharmacological and behavioural interventions have been proposed as potential candidates, with insofar scarce results.

However, in a recent trial published in Molecular Psychiatry, Iyadurai and colleagues claim to have identified a potentially effective behaviour intervention for preventing post-trauma intrusions (Iyadurai et al, 2017).

My mom was just diagnosed with PTSD and psychosis, we'd been going to neurologists and a psychoneurologist trying to figure out what she had, her capacity to do normal everyday things decreased, her way of speaking got weird, and she wouldn't stop crying. Her father raped her continuously as a child and apparently that is what triggered her PTSD, I am not sure why it got so bad now that we hadn't noticed (she's 50 now) but she's going to a psychiatrist now and getting help. However, it's hard to deal with her symptoms for me as her caretaker, she keeps accusing me of stealing things from her as well as others, she also binges if I'm not constantly watching her (I work full time but I got the chance to work from home to keep an eye on her), what can I do to help her more and see that she can trust us ?"

426,"My social worker seems to think I am suffering with PTSD however I don't know how to bring it up with the Doctor. 

In 2009 my ex and I split up, I took my son with me and she wanted me to take her 2nd youngest who wasn't biologically mine however he didn't have a relationship with her and I had raised him since he was 6 months old. We split up in October of that year and about 2 weeks later social services visited her and took her 2 girls away and placed them with a paternal grandparents.

About 2 weeks later my ex decided that she no longer wanted either child with me. However because I had parental responsibility for my son he could stay however Ben (non biological son) was taken away by social services despite me being in the process of a residency claim. He was placed in temporary foster care. Social turned up out of the blue and the first I knew about it was when they took him. 

I was distraught to me he is and always will be my son but my hands were tied. I continued fighting until social decided that although I had attended every course they placed me on and there was no concerns that they would not support me if I continued fighting for residency for both children, and if I did I could lose both. If I gave up my residency claim for Ben they would support me in having it for my son. 

Since then I suffered with depression. However just before residency was granted Ben's foster carer went to the police with an accusation. I was arrested (Kieran was placed into police protectice custody) and interviewed and released on bail before they had interviewed Ben. Once they interviewed him i was told by social services who sat in on interview that it was all a complete misunderstanding and what was being said was actually toilet training. (I still to this day don't know what was said) Kieran was returned after protective custody ended and all charges were dropped 4 weeks later as the arresting Officer went on holiday. 

Since then I've suffered with nightmares of the day Ben was taken and my son was taken. I have had 12 weeks of Talking Therapies in 2015 however the issues are still there. I have had recurring nightmares and with my anxiety and depression worsening I react to things even the doorbell ringing causes me to panic and I get nervous and shake and think it's someone coming to take my son. 

I can't go into crowded areas as I think people are watching me and talking about me. I avoid going out for that reason. I have difficulty sleeping because I don't want to have nightmare as it's always those occasions. I wake up and my partner tells me.sometimes I'm dripping with sweat or wake up screaming things like ""No"" or ""Go away"" 

Thankfully I'm not in the same house now as we had to move but I still can't go passed the road and will make sure I avoid it.

I just don't know how to bring it up with my doctor, I've started CBT for social anxiety but haven't mentioned the extent of things to them as it's through Talking Therapies."

nightmares, stress, anxiety and me
Hello. I have bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, Complex PTSD, major depression recurrent, and am in distress. I started taking wellbutrin 300 XR(extended release) in the mornings, and I noticed an increase in nightmares, specifically about trauma, violence and conflict in relationships. I suffer from nightmares in general and take 4 mg prazosin for my PTSD, but lately its not helping. I do have external stessers, and relationship problems with my children and my sister. My loving, supportive fiance is my rock on this planet, and I believe in Jesus as my Savior. With all that being said, my post is to ask a question of readers: Anything you know of besides anxiety medicine that might help reduce the nightmares in frequency and or severity? I also take abilify for mood stabilization and other meds for nonmental issues. Coming off paxil while I just increased dose of wellbutrin recently under doctors care. Journaling is helping a bit, but I try not to remember the bad dreams: I try to let them go but they do affect my mood most of the night and sometimes into the rest of the day. My sister has disowned me and so has my two sons. I am blessed with a caring and understanding and supportive daughter, but lately she has distanced herself emotionally as well. My kids are adults and I am 51 years old and was sexually abused at 13 by an adult male not in my family. I have suffered major traumas over my lifetime, and I feel I am doing fairly well in the waking hours, but it seems all my anxiety and stress spill into my nocturnal time. Its so bad I am almost afraid to sleep and I don't like being in bed much, even to snuggle with the man i love and trust. 

Seeking personal messages as well as replies to this thread. Anything supportive or helpful would be appreciated. I hope no one was triggered by anything I said. Oh, one more thing, my worst complex trauma was when my daughter almost died as a newborn but thank God He sent a miracle healing since the doctors said there was nothing they could do.....

I greet you all with a hearty ""NICE TO MEET YOU"". oh one last thing, I believe I am on the autism spectrum although I have never been tested. My father seemed to have Aspergers as well as one of my children (son).

Please add me as a friend if there is such a thing and you would like to help/be supportive. I am brand new here and I dont know if there is a way to be on a friends/buddy list. THanks so much for reading this far: I appreciate it!!!!!!!

428,"Hello everyone. I'm posting this because this is something I've been needing to get off my chest for a very very long time and it seems this is my best place to seek advice on said subject. I have been a musician for 8 years now, and a CNA for 4. My life dream has been to be a professional musician since I was a child, and I was striving to be a nurse on the side while pursuing that dream. I have played in multiple bands throughout my life but everyone I have been in band with is now basically the most despised people in my life. They had abused our friendship, and what was like a family bond, and completely gutted it, and never looked back. This scarring, burned bridges and the fact of not having reliable income led me to be a CNA and had me to seek out looking into nursing. however, after being burned out completely as a CNA and seeing just how the medical field is now and seeing as it's not worth the tuition nor time, (this is just my personal opinion) I decided against nursing, completely. I'm now working 9 hours almost everyday, very labor heavy work, unable to even make eye contact with Co workers for fear they may do me the same way my old best friends/band mates did me eventually, also making me very hostile, still living with parents, not married or have children and not bringing nearly enough money to even live on my own off of. Please help me. I feel as if everything I try to pursue or have a passion for is dying or dead, and in the end I'm alone with these dead passions."

A new study finds that adults with post-traumatic stress disorder are much more likely to experience sleep disorders, gastrointestinal problems, cardiovascular diseases, and numerous other health conditions. As such, researchers say that post-traumatic stress disorder should be considered a systemic disorder, as opposed to just a psychological condition.

PTSD 'should be viewed as a systemic disorder' - Medical News Today

The closest I came to a PTSD experience was in relation to a train journey taking a child my wife and I were looking after back to her mother. When we got to the end station it was hard to open the carriage door  I was in the process of  getting us  out as the door opened   when the train started to move. I literally had to hurl us onto the platform. It was a scary experience which still sends a cold shiver down me when the memory resurfaces every now and then even 25 years or more later."
430,"I have no explanation as to why this is happening to me and I wanted your opinion on this before I tell my therapist. I mean, I'm not expecting you to tell me exactly what is going on with me, just what you think may be the cause.

I've noticed when friends hug me, I feel really uncomfortable. I get physically tense, and I even tend avoid hugs and the like.

When my parents or relatives hug me, sometimes they also kiss me on the cheek, or other parts of my face, and they hug me from different ""angles"", I don't know how to explain but it's way more intimate hugs/physical contact. So of course, this is much, much worse! It literally brings me to tears. I feel.. dirty even, in some way, for some unknown reason, and my mind goes ""what the heck"". 
Even today, my mom was hugging me, tears were rolling down my cheeks, she thought I was sad because of something else but really I was just feeling so fricking uncomfortable. 
Sometimes I feel completely repulsed by physical contact of this kind. 

I thought it only happened because of teenager mood swings or whatever (I'm 18) but this is getting to a point where it's almost unbearable. 

I mean, I've never been a fan of people kissing and hugging me as a child either, and I've felt in a similar way even as a young girl. It's always made me anxious and uncomfortable. My granddad, uncle and aunts had this habit of doing it a lot though. :(

Sometimes I need a hug and I ask my mother to hug me; but if it lasts more than like, 30 seconds, and if it's too intimate / if she kisses me on the cheek or forehead or neck (not in a sexual way of course), I want her to stop immediately. Even her caressing me used to be calming, and now it only makes me feel like I want to puke!

What bugs me is: there's no reason why! :confused:
I absolutely don't remember anyone abusing me. I've read something about repressed memories, but I know nearly nothing... do you think it could be? I feel so guilty of being repulsed by my own mother's touch... it's been going on for years.  And it's strange to me... I was in a romantic relationship and barely had any problem regarding this specific thing... so I'm confused! 

So yeah. Any thoughts? Should I tell my therapist? 



A bit of background: I was a bit hypersexual at 9-10... I would watch explicit videos and think, do, and say inappropriate things for my age. My first (now ex) boyfriend was 17 and I was 12, so pretty early.

I broke up with my emotionally abusive boyfriend 1 year ago. With him, I had almost no problem when it came to physical contact, except on some occasions where I would feel repulsed too. Maybe a bit less than with others (perhaps because I trusted him fully). It happened twice, max thrice. However I didn't think any of it, as it was long distance and didn't happen often - we only met once, and for 2 weeks - and brushed it off as a weird one-time feeling.


TL;DR: I feel repulsed by physical contact. Especially if it lasts for more than a minute or so, especially with my family members. No memories of abuse. With ex boyfriend I rarely had problems of this kind."
431,"I went to Walmart this evening after going for a walk by the river, and right by the front doors a mom was screaming at her daughter.  It brought me back emotionally to when I was a girl and my mom used to scream at me.  I went into the store, and I could still hear her, and I thought she had come inside.  I didn't want to be one of many people walking by helplessly doing nothing, so in my anger I stormed back to her and told her it was unacceptable to yell at her daughter like that.  I don't know what I was thinking.  It was a stupid thing to do, because it just escalated her even more, and she threatened to kill me.  She just came right up in my face and told me if I didn't walk away from her she would end me.  I kind of wish I'd have said, ""Oh, so you're threatening to kill me?  I'm getting my phone out right now and calling 911 to tell them someone is threatening to kill me."""

433,"I suffer from Complex PTSD, it's just like PTSD but with extras... lol :grin:

Have been fortuned to get a really good psychiatrist the past few years and have learnt so much about PTSD. Am currently well on my way through recovery. :) I'm sure there are more of you out there that have a lot of short (and long) advice to offer to fellow survivors. The rest, maybe wishes to hear whatever you have to offer.

So, what's your best advice that you've learnt as a sufferer from PTSD? 

My absolutely best advice was when my psychiatrist told me that my constant feeling of fears (that was triggered when I was reminded of the traumatic things that have happened to me) actually wasn't fears. I actually felt overwhelmed by sadness... She told me that it was common that my PTSD-brain muddled my feelings up and replaced sadness with an overpowering sense of fear. She taught me that the key for me to recover from PTSD, was to know this and to dare to cry whenever I feel sad/scared. To fully heal, I needed to allow myself to mourn my past and the childhood I never had. I've done a lot of crying since I learnt this, and I still do. But instead of making me feel depressed, I actually feel better each time I allow myself to cry. I also don't need to cry as often as I did before. It gets better. Thanks to knowing this (and working through this together with my psychiatrist) I'm almost never afraid. I used to be afraid almost all the time before and couldn't live a normal life. I have now been able to go back to school and I'm doing very well. I don't know if my advice will help you, but this knowledge was life changing to me. Worth telling if it would help anyone else.

What's the best advice you've learnt? :)"

435,"Hello, 

This is my first post and i'll be honest i am very scared.  A lot has happened to me growing up and i don't remember all of it but, what i do is damning. 

I've been abused by both of my parents both physically and emotionally for as long i can remember until i left. My mother primarily abused me emotionally and did everything she could to reduce me to a quivering mess.... nothing i ever did was good enough and we often had stranger's brought home who she took better care of than ne. I had to take care of my younger three siblings for risk of being thrown out or beaten on ensuring that i never had much of a child hood. My dad physically and emotionally abused me and tried to make me a man in his eyes. If i wasn't the best at everything then i was an embarrassment to him and his family would be perfect! 

If i cried then he only beat me harder and the psychological abuse he rained down on me made me fearful that it would never end. He was a drunk and a gambler with a 6'5 frame and militarily.  He scared me when i was little and sometimes when i feel threatened im right back there again. I feel like im only six and everyone is a threat.  

The worst part of all this is while i spent a lot of my life as a victim in the past 8 years ive become slowly more like him. I've lived in abusive relationships as both victim and abuser. 

Now i am married and have a beautiful daughter. Ive been abusive to my wife emotionally and last night when we were talking she looked like she was going to hit me in the face. I flashed back and she hit me lightly in the arm. I hit her back in the arm but not lightly. There was no bruise or red mark even but something in my face scared her... as scared as i felt and she told me i abused her. Shes right and we are both scared now that wrestling with my daughter i could be triggered amd see her as a threat. 

Im scared about this and i am seeking counscilling.  Ive been in counselling for a long time and im on medication but only now seeing someone for complex post traumatic stress disorder. 

I need to post on here and ask anyone out there who has been abusive what they've done to change. How they were helped. 

Any clue no matter how small. I am not a bad person but i do need help and i need to feel like i have some control over my own life. My wife and saughter are too important for me to hurt again. 

To note. I have never once touched my daughter in anger. This is only a fear. 

Can anyone help me please?"

I am experiencing some things that are disrupting my daily life and need to know if I should be seeking help. When I was 9 my parents were imprisoned and I was moved between three households over the course of a year before being placed with my conservative, overly religious grandparents. My grandfather is verbally abusive and as a child I struggled a lot with him. I have noticed over the years that I have forgotten the majority of the 3 years after my major life change, had anxiety starting in high school and now panic attacks in college. I have pretty regular emotional nightmares about loved ones ignoring me or leaving me, most of which leave me struggling throughout the day to stay focused and positive. One minute I will be totally fine and the next I am close to hyperventilating and thinking of suicide. I am not used to being out of control and cannot afford to have panic attacks while taking difficult college classes. Is it possible that I might be developing PTSD, or could it just be the stress of college and life in general?"

450,"Hi,

A few months ago my husband had a psychotic episode.  At the time it was very scary and traumatic for both of us.  He believed that he had been chosen to rid the world of paedophiles and told me that if I tried to stand in his way he would ""make me disapear""  He went on to describe in graphic details  methods of torture and killing and told me a range of ways he could dispose of my body.  We were in a public place at the time and the police were called and he was detained under the mental health act for assessment.  Due to his agitation and aggression the hospital would not accept him and he was detained in police custody until assessment.  One of the police officers called me and told me that due to his aggressive behaviour and anger towards me she didnt feel that it would be safe for me to be on my own with him.  A few hours later the mental health team called me to say he was not being sectioned and that they wanted me to go and pick him up.  I asked for someone from the team to be there when I got there so I could assess if I felt safe.  He told me that that was not posible but advised me to meet him in the police station where there were people arround.  When I arrived I discovered there was no public access to the police station snd I had to collect him from the car park.  When I collected him he was angry with me for my part in his detention but I managed to calm him down and get him home.  His own CPN then picked things up and over the last few months things have been improving.

At the time of the crisis I was stressed but dealt with everything, and I seemed to be coping ok.  Then the last few weeks I've bern very anxious and having panic attacks.  I've also been having persistant urges to self harm (which I am resisting).  I'm struggling to concentrate at work, and am snappy at home.  I've seen my GP who has started antidepressants, I've seen the CPN from my husbands team who is alocated for carer support, I'm keeping up regular exercise and meditation and I'm waiting to see a councellor.  But things seem to be getting worse rather than better and these thoughts are so tiring.  My chest is also tight most of the time.

I know no one here can diagnose.  I've done some online checklists both of which say high risk of PTSD.  I'm wondering if anyone recognises how I'm feeling.  I'm seeing my GP on Friday and wondering if to mention this to her or just leave it to see what she says.  Or am I being silly and blowing things out of proportion?"
451,"I have just finished 18 months of EMDR

I can definitely say it was very hard work, and at one time was not sure where it was going, but I stuck with it. I have learnt so much over the last 18 months. I have no idea how EMDR works but it does. It seems to bring out into the open things that happened in my past traumas that my mind hid from me. Connections were made in my brain which helped me understand the past. 

I disowned my 18 year old self because (I thought) that the events that happened were his fault. I evened changed my name and tried to hide him away. I now think differently about the events of 1972. The boy who was my younger self had absolutely no chance of stopping what happened to him. People who were supposed to care for this boy didn't. They just ganged up together using their religion to denounce him. To send him into the hands of religious psychiatrists to brainwash him into believing he was a sinful diseased boy. Then they treated him with hellish torture to change his behaviour. The therapy they inflicted upon him didn't work. They already knew it didn't work but they just had to do what their religious leaders told them to do. 

I have now taken back ownership of my 18 year old self. I now feel whole again. I have changed my name back. I have written a book about my experiences. The book has taken nearly 5 years to write. It is now being edited which will probably take up another year. I sent it to a professional reader for assessment and she gave me a very good report. Writing the book was a form of therapy. But I am glad I have waited until after the EMDR had done its work before I edited it. I know so much more about my hidden past now. 

If you suffer from PTSD and get the chance to do get EMDR then grasp it with both hands and stick with it."

I went into a shop and they asked me to pay for my cups I had and I told him you can clearly see I walked in with them and he would not redeem my scratchcard so I walked into the back and told them to ring the police and the manager came out and said just go to the till but I left the shop then.

The Psych doctors said they was impressed I deal with all of this for years without medication they said that because of all the trauma in my life as a result I have a short fuse and I think my ADHD amplifies this as I always have to drink coffee smoke tabacco and weed or I am unstable.

455,"It seems the hormone oxytocin helps regulate a lot of the responses in PTSD, and perhaps could be used to reshape the response to past stressful stimuli. Worth keeping an eye on, although it will probably be years before this research is developed into a medication. 

Although caution is warranted, our findings tentatively suggest that OT has the potential to diminish anxiety and fear expression of the amygdala in PTSD, either via increased control of the vmPFC over the CeM (males) or via decreased salience processing of the dACC and BLA (females). Our findings add to accumulating evidence that OT administration could potentially enhance treatment response in PTSD.

456,"Childhood trauma and abuse affect brain physiology

Impact on the cortex and limbic system

Research shows that children and adults with histories of child abuse often respond excessively to minor triggers. Traumatised children (and adult survivors) become increasingly responsive to relatively minor stimuli as a result of decreased frontal lobe functioning (learning and problem solving) and increased limbic system (amygdala) sensitivity (impulsiveness) (Streeck-Fischer & van der Kolk, 2000).


I have become interested in the changes which take place in the brain and body after stress. I haven't read much on this blueknot page yet but it came up when i searched for verbal abuse, hormone changes, stress. I am interested in whether or not and how my verbal abuse experiences and prolonged stress during adulthood caused my depression. This is still ongoing and so i am finding myself unable to find my way through to a life. 

Hormones are a big factor in depression and there appears to be a link between verbal abuse, prolonged stress and depression."

461,Hi I witnessed a murder in 1992 after years of seeing a hospital psychiatrist without any proper diagnosis apart from alcohol issues and depression i was diagnosed with ptsd in 2014 I'm currently on quetiapine 100mg 1 per night and Mitzapine 30mg one at night but I feel as if I need more help in my house as I live alone and often feel isolated and depressed and suicidal I was asked by a person if I had a cpn to help me cope with things but I'm unsure on how to ask for one the doctor isn't much help and i was told seeing a psychiatrist wouldn't help me as I see an addictions psychiatrist every 3 months but I know i need more help any help is appreciated thanks :low:
462,"Hi, I'd really like some help please. 2 years ago my sister was rushed to a&e and was dying in front of me. I had a brain hemorage (can't spell) there in a&e due to my blood pressure rocketing & was taken to a specialist hospital for a week. So I was unable to be with my sister at the end. From this experience I am unable to revisit this hospital & intense medical situations. Unfortunately my mother keeps going in after falling and historically she is an attention seeker & I have a very complicated relationship with her & have rushed many times to her bedside prior to the events 2 years ago (only for her to be very disappointed that nothing was wrong). She's in again today after falling. I live 100 miles away & my nephew has gone instead & I will go tomorrow (to the hospital ward if she isn't discharged). My problem is that my family think I am just lazy and shirking. I can't tell them i have ptsd as they will laugh. I know I must come over as a horrible selfish person."
463,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in January and went off the rails a bit, I breached my companies rules on social media by having a video of myself singing a football song at a private stag party, I didn't post it on facebook and had it removed within 5 mins of being posted but I still received a final written warning (harsh as in 10 years I had nothing) I explained I wasn't in a good place. I had to see occupational health who agreed I was fit to return to work as long as I took my medication. Due to my PTSD my family disowned me and my marriage broke down, I stupidly said I had a brain tumour so my family would feel sorry for me and bring me back into the fold I did this as I thought they would understand a physical illness rather than a mental one, they didn't care but my ex-wife did and although we didn't get back together she supported me which felt good she however told my company as she was worried about my workload so had to go along with the ruse in work, I also agreed to attend the company's counselling service for my ptsd which I am now paying £45 per hour for. 2 weeks ago I was on annual leave and got a phone call saying I was suspended due to material being found on my company laptop which was in breach of their electronics policy, what it was is that I had a memory stick which was full of my old phone data and I needed the stick for work stuff so stupidly I transferred all the data across to my laptop, this data included my photos from my phone which I admit had some pornographic images which were sent between friends on group chats as lads do, I explained that due to my ptsd I was not thinking straight and I definitley didn't download them from the net which they accepted, upshot is during my disciplinary they told me they would need to get a medical report from my doctor stating that my ptsd and my brain tumour doesn't affect my role at work, problem being I don't have a brain tumour. My anxiety levels are going through the roof regarding this, I took the steps of telling my 2 closest friends and my ex-wife that I didn't have a brain tumour, all 3 of them were very supportive with my ex saying I did this because I was mentally ill and it was a cry for help. I am planning on asking for a meeting with my boss on Wednesday and my ex will come with me for support and I will tell my boss the truth. I feel because of this disciplinary I am slipping back the way after feeling slightly better over the last 2 months, they have told me there is mitigating circumstances that they cant sack me but I feel with the lying over the brain tumour I will lose it. I feel so much better for telling my mates and my ex the truth though...can someone please give me some advice I would be so grateful.....
Update: my doctor is going to do a letter for me stating i need work to keep me focussed and help me recover, he said the reason i lied about brain tumour was because PTSD makes me do irrational things, hopefully this works..."

465,"I am crying and in so much pain.  I was severely emotionally abused by my sadistic ex boyfriend basically in a tortuous way.  I cannot stop thinking about all of the cruel things he has said and done to me.  He practically annihilated me but I have at least one ounce of fight in me.

I hate him.  I can't believe I allowed it to go on and on.  I finally broke up with him in March but stayed in contact with him until about a week ago.  The abuse continued.  I know it was self destructive for me to do that.  Have been dissociating, severely depressed, anxious and agoraphobic.  Why can't I stop thinking these thoughts and feeling ENRAGED?  I have never been in this state of being.  I have been depressed but none of the other things. 

My therapist said she didn't want us to talk about it anymore.  My friend, who is a retired therapist, told me to get a new therapist, that I have to talk about this to heal.  I have an appointment with a new therapist on Thursday.  I pray to God he can help me because I'm barely hanging on by a thread here.  I desperately want to heal from this.  I hope this guy knows what he's doing.

Thanks for reading.  My situation perhaps pales in comparison to what some of you have been through, but the experience has effected me dramatically.  That's all I can say for now."
466,"Too sensitive. I struggle everyday to get out of bed. My trauma happened 20 years ago but my husband leaving me for his lesbian coworker did me in. To make matters worse, his newly converted whore set her son up with my 18 yr old pregnant daughter. Now i really have no role in their lives except to be the unpaid babysitter. I cant. I cant. Im disabled for a reason. My daughter sees me as insane yet capable of watching my grandbaby for free. 

Im done. The pain of seeing their newly created family dynamic is too hard for me. His family was all i had for 18 years of marriage. Now they drop me for his alcoholic lesbian convert. 

I have no one. I want to die. Or kill. Kill them for leaving me."
467,"Hey all, I was researching a lot the other day and I came across a form of therapy called Dialectical Behavior Therapy.  I was looking for my wife and the symptoms it treats as well as the manner it is conducted and other things about it seem ideal for her (based on what I know about her and what I have experienced). I would like to know if anyone has gone through this therapy for PTSD and if it helped. 
I would also like to know if the way it is set up helped with people that do not come back to therapy or quit before it gets far in. 
Thanks a lot and good luck to you all in your endeavors"
468,"2 weeks ago I was diagnosed with PTSD
It made sense
it was nice to finally have some kind of answer
i hate that i have it
i hate that that's what they did to me
that i had a friend ask yesterday
one i was very proud in actually talking to
she asked me 'what did they do to you'
when i'm not ready to talk about it

i'm doing better though
i'm coming to accept the fact
that they abused me
they psychologically and emotionally abused me
they rejected me
they manipulated me
i was consistently seeking their approval
to never get it
i have cut everyone off from there
except this one girl
who sent me a friend request on facebook
i'm not saying they didn't do good with me
i'm saying that it wasnt what i expected
where they simply spit out robots
and i refused to conform
i was different
i am no longer ashamed of my difference
because i'm where my difference is embraced and loved
that i'm not used or manipulated
i am loved and appreciated for who i am
but this hit hard
and i cant even tell my parents
because they think it was all peaches and roses
i'm thankful for my church though
they have been really supportive
but i find it hard to trust
that i'll get too much for them
that its easier to trust strangers...
i've already lost an 8 year long friendship because they dont understand mental illness

i dont know what to do from here..."
469,"It's been a while since I have posted on the forum.
I know in my heart I have been abused I just can't seem to accept it. 
I don't seem to listen or absorb the things people who care about and love me tell me and say. I can't seem to get back to or remember who I was before the abuse.

I continually go back to the abuser for answers or relief and the cycle continues."
470,"For the last few weeks I have been sensitive to high pitch noises. This is anything from the noise of plates clanging together when being put away to power tools. My counsellor says I have being disassociating for a while, before this period and did not really know this could happen. How long will this last or is there anything I can do to sort it?"
471,"Hello :)
To understand my current situation it is needed to  take a look at the past. I had anxiety, depression & bipolar ups and downs. I remember being in school running around in pure terror, not being able to talk to someone or just stand in the near of somebody else. I remember being highly enthusiastic just an hour later, making jokes and feeling happy, thinking ,,now its all over"", only to be again depressed an anxious another hour later. So my whole world was very insecure, it all could change in a sudden. I couldn't rely on my friends, not in the way that they changed, but my world was in a constant change and so I could be open and communicative in the morning and hiding from them in fear in the evening.

Alright, I know the following part propably may sound whimpy... I will write it down anyways;)

I always loved to be hugged and to cuddle... well, I should better say would have loved. When I went to school it never happened that someone just.. you know... came to me and hugged me, when I was out for hugging I always had to search and to do the first step and go after the people. So there were times when there was me hiding in the basement cause anxiety but also wanting to be hugged and be with someone else, but when I went up and there were people it was whole terror and pain, pain in my stomach I could not breathe I could not walk. Also there was this girl in those days, she was the first and only person that I completely trusted, but then there was this incident in the holidays (I told her I loved her but she only thought of me as a regular buddy) and when I came back to school (two weeks later than normal, depression) she just ignored me. She just acted as if she would not know me, as if I even did not existed.

I have flashbacks from these times, I see it I feel it I hear it and the terror becomes real again.

Today I have tried to close that chapter. I am not able to hug anymore, it appears as a painful and very hurting experience to me. But not only hugging, there are times when my whole skin just hurts in pain, when I touch it it hurts when I lay on the side on my chest it hurts and I can not breathe, I can not sleep when my legs or arms touch, they must be sperate without contact.

I would appreciate all kinds of comment about this, what do you think?"
472,"Hi everyone. I never imagined myself writing this on a public forum but I'm just going to do it, because a) I want to hear from those of you who may relate and who can tell me that it is possible to get through it and b) I just need to tell someone. I have sought help from medics and family/friends etc but no one really understands a word I say. Thank you in advance for those who read and respond to my story with positive words.

Events that led to this place (don't wade through if you can't be bothered, it's long!)

Picture this: I was a successful, happy, bright young woman with everything to live for. I had a successful little business bringing in money for holidays, a home in the country with horses, a wonderful family, a loving 5 year relationship and plans of a future together, and I was away at university studying a degree I loved. I had attained first class marks in every module to date and was filling my LinkedIn with every award and opportunity you can imagine.

However, it was stressful. Most of the time, I was just working for the future, waiting for the moment where I was going to start living. I kept putting off date nights with my boyfriend telling him 'not long now and I'm all yours'. In February, that moment was within sight- just a mere 3 months away and I was would be there, living the plans penciled in my diary.

But I started becoming anxious. I was scared of everything. I kept thinking I was being poisoned. I became obsessive, cleaning the fridge and washing everything over and over just in case. I had feelings of dread and doom. I kept thinking something was going to come along and take my dreams from me and my loved ones.

In February, I had a minor accident in the lab where I splashed a chemical in my eye and even after having it checked out and told there was no damage, I couldn't bear the minor inconvenience of the pain while it healed. I went back to the doctors hoping they could give me some drops or something to take away the pain. But while I was there, the doctor informed me that I had an eye disease and needed an MRI scan.

I felt anxious about the scan, and the night before, whilst I was relaxing in bed looking up festival dates and putting them in my diary, a voice came into my head and it said: ""If you have the scan tomorrow, you'll never do those things"". The feeling I was going to die was so strong that I tidied the flat and paired my socks thinking 'my mum will be pleased I was a tidy person'. But I told myself to stop being so morbid. It was a routine MRI, what could possibly go wrong?

What could possibly go wrong... well, everything. During the scan I experienced shocking in time with the noises. I realised I had my hands crossed, which I'd read was a no-no. I pressed the button and this time, moved my hands to my belly. I managed to think about other things to get through to the end.

When I sat up, I could feel a strange 'pulling' sensation on my head. My head had swollen slightly. I shrugged it off as I felt in a bit of a daze, and was glad I was still alive.

My dad asked if I was okay because I had gone quiet. I felt odd, but I couldn't describe why. When he dropped me home and left, I cried that he was gone. I guess I just missed him.

That evening though, my body began to change. I felt very itchy, and when I scratched, huge red lines and welts appeared. Then my ears started to feel hot inside. The burning feeling grew stronger, until it was all over my face, then scalp. The next morning my skin was super sensitive, and my chest, arms and back were burning, like a kind of nerve pain. I went red like I'd been in a sun bed too long. I came over with a sudden flu-like fever, but according to the doctor I went to, I had no temperature.

I began vomiting constantly. I couldn't eat a thing. I likened it to how I imagined severe radiation sickness would be. I knew the scan had done something to me, but I didn't know what. Within days, I'd lost a stone and was wasting away. I was so tired I could barely walk or talk. I had to crawl to my bed and hope the pain would go away. 

It didn't. I would have to use menthol cream or wet towels to allow me to sleep. I was living alone, and I was terrified. No doctor could tell me what had happened to me. I searched online looking for answers. The scan uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce images. Was this a microwave burn? How could the scan do this to me? Then I came across something: Electrohypersensitivity.

At last I had an answer. I joined a support group on Facebook. But it was not what I wanted to hear. People with EHS never get better. They live a life of isolation. ""Get away from the city asap!"" they advised. ""You're bound to be grieving for the life you lost"" they consoled. ""I can no longer go to shops or restaurants or leave my home, but you get used to it"" one assured.

My health deteriorated. By this point, not only was I sick, my mind was damaged by what I had seen. I was forced to quit university just weeks before the end. I watched as my friends posted pictures of their completed dissertations online. I saw pictures of the end of year ball on Facebook. I looked on as they posted 'It's done, time to party!'.

All the while, I am in constant pain, looking at the broken dreams around me. A new suitcase, bought for the holiday we cancelled. High heel shoes, a bottle of champagne saved especially for graduation.

Now here is the part I need help with.

Four months since that fateful day have passed, and I am in the worst place imaginable. All I see when I look back over these last few months is darkness. I am in the deepest depression, resigned to a life of isolation and misery and yet not brave enough to end it.

This is not a suicide threat. I am not going to end my life, but I feel as though every day I live is just a pointless day because soon I will not be able to take any more and will leave this world. I need to clarify, that is a feeling, not a threat or cry for help regarding that.

I feel as though my body has been taken, that Belinda did die in the scan, and that I am no longer me. I feel as though life has such a big shadow over it that life used to just be life, but now it is a shadow. It is hard to describe. I used to wake up and think 'Ah, what to do today'. When I was having a bad day I'd wake up and think 'Oh no, I can't face that that/person/problem/challenge'. This is different. I feel that those thoughts have gone. I am just damaged, and life does not exist in it's pre-scan form.

I feel traumatized by what I've seen happen to me and can't believe or accept that it has really happened. I feel as though I am a character in a horror movie like The Fly, except it is real. It's like one long nightmare I can't wake up from.

No one understands and I'm not getting the help I need. Perhaps no one can help. But I think someone here might relate. I hope so, because at the moment I am so incredible alone and frightened.

Why have you posted this in PTSD? You may ask. Perhaps I have depression? Perhaps anxiety? Perhaps none of those things. I don't get flash backs to the scan or a specific moment, but rather, I get flashbacks to any moment in that time, in that flat, rotting, by myself, burning, literally, in hell. The feeling of fear and doom never leaves me, but when things ram it home some more, like the word MRI written somewhere, or my old uni books, I turn, and act aggressively, or start repeating myself. I sometimes beat myself up, this horrible body I am left with. Then I cry and say sorry to my body (it is not my body's fault I put it in that machine).

Some of the phrases that keep coming out when I 'flip' are ""safer than an ultrasound"" (something the radiologist said to me as she helped me get in the scan); ""life was just life""; ""everything was good, everything was fine, everything was good, everything was fine"". It's like I am on repeat, and I can't get over that 'lip'. I am stuck, my head not able to come to grips with what has happened.

Not only this, but I am wrought with guilt. I didn't want the scan, I had a bad feeling about it. After doing my research, I found out that the eye disease I didn't have was self-limiting. I ask why I didn't look that up before and prevent my life being ruined.

Even now, I can't describe it properly. But I feel like I can't ever get back on the tracks. I was heading towards my goals and dreams so fast and free, then I was derailed, and it's like I am lost and can't find my way back to Belinda. She has gone.

Is is possible to get through?

That's what I want to know. I have no idea if the burning pain will ever stop, or if I will ever be able to use my phone etc without pain again. I doubt I will ever go anywhere without fearing wifi, or remembering I'm 'different', or being haunted by 'knowing what I now know'. But will I be able to find Belinda again? Will I be able to get back on the tracks and start to see life as life, not some long, dark, never-ending nightmare?

Possibly you can't answer this, but if you have ever got through something major and began to feel 'you' again, I would love to read your story."
473,"hi so im not diagnosed yet but i was seen by a cpn about a couple months back and she said my symptoms such as hallucinations and depression are down to trauma.
i am going to see a different cpn this week with the secoundry mental health care.
my memories are of childhood sexual abuse and i have only been getting memories of it over the past couple of years. 
i was wondering if anyone else as had help with repressed memories? 
or therepy for trauma and did it help? 
thanks"
474,"I just found out about a week ago that I have PTSD. It wasn't necessarily a shock because I've heard from my first Counselor and my new counselor that EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN'T DIAGNOSE, they'd probably say that my diagnosis is PTSD. And Lo and behold.. I can tell  (now looking back) that I've been an anxious person since I was very very young. I've had nightmares my entire life. But the crippling anxiety and panic attacks didn't start Until mid-2013. So I began counseling. And the anxiety and depression have only gotten so so much worse. I'm drained. I'm tired all of the time. I can't handle most social situations. I leave work a lot. I feel sad. And crazy. And desperate. I have suicidal thought almost every day and I am truly afraid that I will do something stupid in an act of desperation during an episode. I have 2 kids that I have been lucky enough not to effect so far. And my wife is so so so supportive. And I start to see a psychiatrist next week. But I feel afraid. Seriously afraid. And so....hopeless."

 In my work with clients repetitively traumatized in childhood, I am continuously struck by how frequently the various thought processes of the inner critic trigger them into overwhelming emotional flashbacks. This is because the PTSD-derived inner critic weds shame and self-hate about imperfection to fear of abandonment, and mercilessly drive the psyche with the entwined serpents of perfectionism and endangerment. Recovering individuals must learn to recognize, confront and disidentify from the many inner critic processes that tumble them back in emotional time to the awful feelings of overwhelming fear, self-hate, hopelessness and self-disgust that were part and parcel of their original childhood abandonment.

Psychogenesis of the PTSD Critic A flashback-inducing critic is typically spawned in a danger-laden childhood home. When parents do not provide safe enough bonding and attachment, the child flounders in abandonment fear and depression. Many children appear to be hard-wired to adapt to this endangering abandonment with perfectionism. This is true for both the passive abandonment of neglect and the active abandonment of abuse. A prevailing climate of danger forces the maturing superego to cultivate the various psychodynamics of perfectionism and endangerment listed at the end of this article. When anxious perfectionist efforting, however, fails over and over to render the parents safe and loving, the inner critic becomes increasingly hypervigilant and hostile in its striving to ferret out the shortcomings that seemingly alienate the parents. Like the soldier overlong in combat, PTSD sets in and locks the child into hypervigilance and excessive sympathetic nervous system arousal. Desperate to relieve the anxiety and depression of abandonment, the critic-driven child searches the present, and the future, for all the ways he is too much or not enough. The child’s nascent ego finds no room to develop and her identity virtually becomes the superego. In the process, the critic often becomes virulent and eventually switches to the first person when goading the child: “I’m such a loser. I’m so pathetic… bad... ugly…worthless…stupid...defective”. One of my clients grief-fully remembered the constant refrains of his childhood: “If only I wasn’t so needy and selfish…if only my freckles would fade...if only I could pitch a perfect game...if only I could stop gagging on the canned peas during dinner...if only I could pray all the time to get mom’s arthritis cured - then maybe she’d stop picking on me, and then maybe dad would play catch with me”.

Thoughts As Triggers In extremely rejecting families, the child eventually comes to believe that even her normal needs, preferences, feelings and boundaries are dangerous imperfections – justifiable reasons for punishment and/or abandonment. In the worst case scenarios - where parents use children’s words as ammunition against them - the mere impulse to speak sometimes triggers intense feelings of panic. How could anything the child says not reveal his stupidity and worthlessness...not get him deeper into trouble and rejection? As ongoing neglect and abuse repetitively strengthen the critic, even the most innocuous, self-interested thought or musing can trigger a five alarm fire of intense emotional flashback. To maintain the illusive hope of someday winning parental approval, the child’s anxious striving escalates, and may even become a perfectionism that is truly obsessive/compulsive.

More on Perfectionism Perfectionism is the unparalleled defense for emotionally abandoned children. The existential unattainability of perfection saves the child from giving up, unless or until, scant success forces him to retreat into the depression of a dissociative disorder, or launches him hyperactively into an incipient conduct disorder. Perfectionism also provides a sense of meaning and direction for the powerless and unsupported child. In the guise of self-control, striving to be perfect offers a simulacrum of a sense of control. Self-control is also safer to pursue because abandoning parents typically reserve their severest punishment for children who are vocal about their negligence.

As the quest for perfection fails over and over, and as sustaining attachment remains elusive, imperfection becomes synonymous with shame and fear. Perceived imperfection triggers fear of abandonment, which triggers self-hate for imperfection, which expands abandonment into self-abandonment, which amps fear up even further, which in turn intensifies self-disgust...on and on it goes in a downward spiral of fear and shame encrusted abandonment. It can go on for hours and days…weeks in environmentally exacerbating conditions…and for those with severe PTSD, can become their standard mode of being.

More on Endangerment The importance and magnitude of the critic’s endangerment dynamic cannot be overstated. I have in fact worked with numerous “well-therapized” individuals who were relatively free of perfectionism, but still seriously afflicted with the drasticizing processes of the critic. Moreover, I have seen many individuals challenge and eliminate most of the blatant perfectionist, self-attacking cognitions of the critic without effectively addressing its habit of flooding the psyche with thoughts, images and feelings of fear. I learned to disidentify from perfectionism long before I learned to stop perseverating my critic’s harrowing snapshots of danger into feature long films about my immanent demise into total abandonment, public humiliation, lethal illness, penniless homelessness, etc. One of my clients eventually identified the critic’s endangerment process as: “Critic as Horror Movie Producer”. I sometimes also think of it as: “Critic as Terrorist”.

Using Anger to Shrink The Inner Critic : Traumatizing parents customarily use intimidation and disgust to thwart the instinctive fight responses of their children. Recovering the anger of the fight response is essential in healing Complex PTSD. I routinely encourage clients to use their anger to stop the critic in its tracks, and to help them move through the various self-attack dynamics that the critic uses to emotionally enforce perfectionism. Invoking the fight response is an irreplaceable tool for thought-stopping the critic’s outdated fear- and shame- based cognitions. Accordingly, I encourage clients to use phrases like “I’m not afraid of you anymore, mom and dad...critic. I’m in an adult body now and I won’t let you hurt me”. Additionally I share Erik Eriksen’s emotional math: “Shame is blame turned against the self”, adding that it is also the parents disgust turned into self-hate. Typically I embellish this with: “You can externalize the anger of the critic’s self-blaming messages out and away from you onto the installers of the critic, or sideways onto the critic itself. You can give shame back by allowing yourself to feel disgusted at the image of your parent bullying you and overwhelming you with shame when you were so defenseless”.

An inner critic that has dominated since childhood, however, does not give up its hegemony of the psyche easily. It obdurately refuses to accept the updated information that adulthood now offers the possibility of increasing safety and healthy attachment. It is as if the critic has worn a flashback-inducing groove in the brain the size of the Grand Canyon, and any of the thinking patterns listed below now hair-trigger an amygdala hijacking into abandonment fear and depression. The work of reminding clients that progress in critic-shrinking is often infinitesimally slow and indiscernible at first and can seem as interminable to the therapist as the client. The client’s habituation to only noticing what is wrong and what is dangerous, requires lifelong management. In the early work, I encourage the client to challenge the critic’s monocular negative focus over and over with all the ferocity she can muster. Eventually I ask her if she can find a part of herself that is mad about how grossly unfair her parents’ bullying and indifference was. Is there any part of her that is outraged that she was indoctrinated and inculcated into self-abandonment and self-bullying when she was too young to protest or even know what was happening to her? Is she willing now to gradually build her ability to say “No!” and “Shut up!” whenever she catches the critic, the proxy of her parent, attacking her?

With much encouragement and practice, the client gradually learns to reject her conditioning to self-abuse and self-abandonment. Her sense of healthy self-protection begins to emerge and over time grows into a fierce willingness to stop unfair criticism - internal or external. Psychodynamically, this is part of the process of working through repetition compulsion. It aids the client to repudiate the parents’ awful legacy of teaching her that love means numbly accepting abuse and neglect.

Embracing the Critic In my experience, until the fight response is substantially restored, the average complex PTSD client benefits little from the more refined and rational techniques of embracing, dialoguing with, and integrating the valuable parts of the sufficiently shrunken critic – an important part of later recovery work well described in the excellent books: Embracing The Inner Critic, by Stone and Stone and Soul Without Shame, by Brown. Once again however, these left-brained, objective approaches are often of very limited use until they are backed up by a subjective, right brain stance of aggressive self-protection. Perhaps this is because the inner critic appears to align with the extreme right brain dominance of flashbacks (as shown in MRI’s); perhaps inner critic processes are so emotionally charged and dominant that unremediated efforts to resist them rationally and dispassionately fail effetely.

Thought substitution is another essential tool for empowering the work of thought-stopping the critic. I sensed many years ago that my critic became as tough as a bodybuilder’s bicep through myriad repetitions. I guessed that if I similarly exercised the type of positive self-talk I describe below, I would create some new and more helpful “muscle” that my thinking process would exercise automatically at times of being triggered. I believe I am not exaggerating when I say that hundreds of thousands of positive thought-substitution have rewarded me with a psyche that is fairly consistently user-friendly.

Accordingly, I encourage clients to immediately confront the critic’s negative messages and processes with positive ones, for even one such thought can act like a single virus and rage infectiously out of control into a flu-like mélange of shame, fear and self-abandonment. Moving quickly into thought-stopping and -substitution often obviates a headlong tumble into the downward spiral of a flashback, just as immediate prophylactic measures can thwart the first hint of a cold. Additionally, I often ask the client to write out a list of his positive qualities and accomplishments to recite when he finds himself lost and drowning in self-hate. This is especially important as flashbacks often create a temporary amnesia about one’s essential worthiness and goodness. [Flashbacks seem to involve a temporary loss of access to more current left-brain learning. MRI’s show greatly reduced left brain activity in activated and unremediated PTSD individuals]. Memorizing the list enhances one’s capacity to dissolve that amnesia. Reciting part or all of the list over and over like a mantra also helps during those times when the critic is particularly severe and unsilenceable. If the client has little or nothing for the list, I supplement it with my own observations about her qualities, and I also ask her to seek her friends’ input. Additionally I remind her that qualities do not have to be perfect or ever-present to qualify as qualities. If it is true of them most of the time then, it is a quality.

Positive imaging is a powerful adjunct to thought-substitution. Clients can learn to short-circuit the perfectionist and fear-mongering processes of the inner critic by invoking images of past successes and accomplishments, as well as pictures of safe and loving places and friends. The therapist can also use guided meditations to demonstrate and reinforce the use of positive imagery-substitution.

Grieving helps shrink the critic I repeatedly point out to clients how the work of grieving their childhood losses helps them to release the painful feelings (especially fear, shame and depression) that fuel the assaults of the critic.(This is step # 9 in the aforementioned “flashback management” article. This article is an elaboration of Step #8). Over and over, I help the client notice how the critic’s intensity typically ebbs dramatically following egosyntonic grieving. With ongoing practice we also begin to notice the spontaneous self-compassion that can come to arise in its place when the critic is not allowed to spoil it.

Here is a list of 14 common inner critic attacks divided into the key categories of perfectionism and endangerment. Each is paired with a healthier (and typically more accurate) thought-substitution response.

    PERFECTIONISM ATTACKS
    Perfectionism My perfectionism arose as an attempt to gain safety and support in my dangerous family. Perfection is a self-persecutory myth. I do not have to be perfect to be safe or loved in the present. I am letting go of relationships that require perfection. I have a right to make mistakes. Mistakes do not make me a mistake. Every mistake or mishap is an opportunity to practice loving myself in the places I have never been loved.
    All-or-None & Black-and-White Thinking I reject extreme or overgeneralized descriptions, judgments or criticisms. One negative happenstance does not mean I am stuck in a never-ending pattern of defeat. Statements that describe me as “always” or “never” this or that, are typically grossly inaccurate.
    Self-Hate, Self-Disgust & Toxic Shame I commit to myself. I am on my side. I am a good enough person. I refuse to trash myself. I turn shame back into blame and disgust, and externalize it to anyone who shames my normal feelings and foibles. As long as I am not hurting anyone, I refuse to be shamed for normal emotional responses like anger, sadness, fear and depression. I especially refuse to attack myself for how hard it is to completely eliminate the self-hate habit.
    Micromanagement/Worrying/Obsessing/
    Looping/ Over-Futurizing I will not repetitively examine details over and over. I will not jump to negative conclusions. I will not endlessly second-guess myself. I cannot change the past. I forgive all my past mistakes. I cannot make the future perfectly safe. I will stop hunting for what could go wrong. I will not try to control the uncontrollable. I will not micromanage myself or others. I work in a way that is “good enough”, and I accept the existential fact that my efforts sometimes bring desired results and sometimes they do not. “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference” - The Serenity Prayer
    Unfair/Devaluing Comparisons To others or to one’s most perfect moments. I refuse to compare myself unfavorably to others. I will not compare “my insides to their outsides”. I will not judge myself for not being at peak performance all the time. In a society that pressure us into acting happy all the time, I will not get down on myself for feeling bad.
    Guilt Feeling guilty does not mean I am guilty. I refuse to make my decisions and choices from guilt; sometimes I need to feel the guilt and do it anyway. In the inevitable instance when I inadvertently hurt someone, I will apologize, make amends, and let go of my guilt. I will not apologize over and over. I am no longer a victim. I will not accept unfair blame. Guilt is sometimes camouflaged fear. – “I am afraid, but I am not guilty or in danger”.
    ""Shoulding”I will substitute the words “want to” for “should” and only follow this imperative if it feels like I want to, unless I am under legal, ethical or moral obligation.
    Overproductivity/Workaholism/Busyholism I am a human being not a human doing. I will not choose to be perpetually productive. I am more productive in the long run, when I balance work with play and relaxation. I will not try to perform at 100% all the time. I subscribe to the normalcy of vacillating along a continuum of efficiency.
    Harsh Judgments of Self & Others/Name-Calling I will not let the bullies and critics of my early life win by joining and agreeing with them. I refuse to attack myself or abuse others. I will not displace the criticism and blame that rightfully belongs to them onto myself or current people in my life. “I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself”. - Jane Eyre

    ENDANGERMENT ATTACKS
    Drasticizing/Catastrophizing/Hypochondrisizing I feel afraid but I am not in danger. I am not “in trouble” with my parents. I will not blow things out of proportion. I refuse to scare myself with thoughts and pictures of my life deteriorating. No more home-made horror movies and disaster flicks.
    Negative focus I renounce over-noticing & dwelling on what might be wrong with me or life around me. I will not minimize or discount my attributes. Right now, I notice, visualize and enumerate my accomplishments, talents and qualities, as well as the many gifts Life offers me, e.g., friends, nature, music, film, food, beauty, color, pets, etc.
    Time Urgency I am not in danger. I do not need to rush. I will not hurry unless it is a true emergency. I am learning to enjoy doing my daily activities at a relaxed pace.
    Disabling Performance Anxiety I reduce procrastination by reminding myself that I will not accept unfair criticism or perfectionist expectations from anyone. Even when afraid, I will defend myself from unfair criticism. I won’t let fear make my decisions.
    Perseverating About Being Attacked Unless there are clear signs of danger, I will thought-stop my projection of past bully/critics onto others. The vast majority of my fellow human beings are peaceful people. I have legal authorities to aid in my protection if threatened by the few who aren’t. I invoke thoughts and images of my friends’ love and support."

479,"Hey guys.
Without further ado...
It's been almost ten years since our breakup. I betrayed her. I showed cowardice. I couldn't stand up to the force when it was absolutely necessary, and my life has been Hell ever since. Five years I've been waning off my guilt with alcohol and illegal drugs (up to opiates). Then it was psychotherapy, various antidepressants, such as Mirtazapine, Venlafaxine, Amitriptyline. I'm now a 2nd year in remission, but alas, psychotherapy does not help. Even with everything my doctor's prescribed me and taught me, it's not enough.  How do I live with such a profound sense of guilt? Every day I fall asleep and wake up with a sense of fear, panic and anxiety. My palms are sweaty, and my heart beats 120bpm.  She herself says that ""it's long been forgiven"", but it doesn't get any easier. What should I do? I'm thinking about restarting opiates. In any case, I used to feel comfortably numb with them. 
What do I do? I'm desperate and I'm thinking of suicide, because it would be a permanent solution.

483,"Veterans with ptsd may face increased risk of heart attacks and strokes

This really made me wonder about other sufferers of ptsd, it seems reasonable that non-veterans who have been through conditions stressful enough to cause PTSD may also suffer

Veterans with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may also have damaged blood vessels that increase their risk for heart attacks and strokes, a U.S. study suggests.
In a test, researchers found that the blood vessels of vets with PTSD dilated less when they should have, compared to the vessels of vets without the mental health condition.
That indicates their blood vessels also may not be able to expand when necessary to increase blood flow in response to activities like intense exercise or to maintain circulation when fatty deposits and other debris clog artery walls. When blood flow is restricted, they would be more susceptible to heart attacks or strokes, particularly if they also have other risk factors like high cholesterol, hypertension or diabetes, researchers say.
Scientists aren’t exactly sure how PTSD might affect the flexibility of blood vessels. But it’s possible stress harms the inner lining of the vessels through changes in hormones or inflammation, said lead study author Dr. Marlene Grenon of the University of California, San Francisco.
“It is very likely that this would also happen in non-veterans who suffer from PTSD or chronic stress,” Grenon said by email.
To explore the connection between PTSD and blood vessel health, Grenon and colleagues tested how well veterans’ arteries relaxed and expanded when a blood pressure cuff tightened on their arms.
The experiment included 67 veterans with PTSD and 147 veterans without the condition. Most of the participants were men, and they were around 69 years old on average.
With PTSD, veterans’ blood vessels expanded 5.8 percent on average in response to the tightening blood pressure cuff, compared with 7.5 percent without the condition. This indicates a less healthy response in the blood vessel lining with PTSD.
Aside from PTSD, veterans also experienced less blood vessel expansion if they were older or had high blood pressure or impaired kidney function, which might be related to diabetes.

Whether I can find a publisher or not, if I want to sell my book I will have to advertise it.

At this point I will either have to leave this forum, or continue as an 'out' person. I do not think I am fearing this process, though no doubt lots of people may say I shouldn't do it, but if I am to advertise it I will have to be open.

487,"Hi all! I just joined this evening because I have had some things happening lately that lead me to believe there is something going on with me mentally. I am posting in this forum because I was told a few years ago that I was suffering from PTSD. I don't know for sure if that is really the case. I don't know if I have buried childhood memories or not. I am wondering if I can just describe what is happening and see if anyone else can relate? I feel like I am losing my mind. I get these flashes. They are so fast, a split second, that as soon as they are gone there is no putting in to words what it was. It's like a split second of a dream I had once, or a movie I saw once, and much like a dream, it is gone as soon as it is over. In those fleeting moments though, it is SO familiar, almost like a de ja vu feeling. Almost, but not quite. They aren't flashes of anything traumatic or bad at all. But it wears on me. It has been happening off and on for years and years now. It goes away for long periods of time but then it comes back again. It was REALLY often, so bad that I truly thought I was going to break down by the end of the day, 2 days ago. It lessened yesterday and only happened a few times today. It coincides this time with my chronic nightmares. Airplanes crashing all around me, (I'm always on the ground, never in the planes) public restrooms with toilets overflowing with every kind of nastiness one could find in a bathroom, and spiders are my most commonly repetitive nightmares. Does any of this sound familiar to anyone? I hope I described it well. No one else seems to understand what I am saying about the flashes. It is very frustrating. Thanks in advance for any help!"

Mam denying about waking me up by smashing plates on my head and walked out without saying one word. telling my son I made it all up. I nearly killed her once and to be honest I wish I did. The narcistic bitch that she was,it was always about her. I hated her just passing her in a room got the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. She was incapable of love. I was craving love so much as a child I used to cling to her friend and cry my eyes out when she left. I turned to eating raw sugar sounds silly but at least I used to feel something. The Rage left me when she died never cried because I never felt a thing for her. leaving my Dad to bully me severely. She new he had a reputation for bullying young boys from his first marriage and yet stood by whilst he destroyed my confidence .Even when I told her I was being molested by my school teacher nothing was done. I am now a loner a hermit with nobody. So stressed so broken so Damaged. My life in ruins because I have hurt so many people physically and mentally. I should of killed when I was in my young teens perhaps I would of gotten the help I so desperately needed. The help I get now is way to late , damage done and my son has suffered as a consequence which hurts me so much knowing my son seen me crack up frightening him so much he now suffers mentally.

    Both my sisters are doing well as they never had my Dads wrath.

How cold she was when I was a baby. I have a very bad name for being violent but not through being angry its the stress the worrying gets so much I crack and lash out at anyone . The last straw kind of thing and bang off I go hurting people I love. Thankfully I am  heavily medicated now . Being hurt nearly everyday and being called names being run down for years will do that. That's why I don't judge anyone because you don't know what people have gone through and when the Docs tell you violence is a choice I say rubbish you beat a dog enough it will bite you in the end and that's what we all are in the end Animals animals that has learnt to be kind to get on in life. A few hundred years ago violence was the norm beatings the belt the stick in school and by parents was the norm 30 years ago. Broken people can hurt others and I know its prison you go or a mental health facility if your to far gone.
      There got it off my chest................ For now. Sorry to anyone that this offends but the reality is broken people can get violent specially if you have learnt to bottle feelings up and I had to learn to do that taught again by my Dad but that's another sleepless bout  . :mad:"
490,"Hi everyone,

I am seeking help as a husband with a wife who has suffered with anxiety for a few years. I am writing with the hope that someone can offer me guidance on how to help. She has seen a psychologist only once for this issue, and it was quite helpful, but we could never afford to go back. Also due to that, I don't have a lot to go off of in the form of any clinical diagnosis, so I'll attempt to describe our situation here.

The psychologist did help by identifying that my wife has PTSD from two sources; the sudden, violent death (hit by a train. She was the last to see him) of a friend when she was 18, and rape when she was 19 (she is 24 now). Since then she has been able to keep things together about 1/3 of the time, but the other half is often spent in crippling anxiety.

When we got married, I had to check in with her every time I went to or from anywhere. If I didn't, she would often go into a full scale panic attack with uncontrollable sobbing and difficulty breathing. In every situation, her mind immediately jumped to the worst possible outcome. Even worse was that she knew it was irrational but could not control it. Since then she has gradually improved, to the point where if I forgot to text her, her first thought was not that I was dead, but that I had simply forgotten. Intimacy was difficult at first, but over time we managed to (most of the time) enjoy being intimate without activating any of her triggers.

Now, things have changed again. We had beautiful baby girl last Saturday. The nurses were especially sensitive to her being a rape survivor and she had a minimally traumatic birth experience (nothing more than the ordinary). However, her anxiety has (understandably) heightened with the arrival of our daughter. A few nights ago, I fed our daughter about 15 minutes past when she was supposed to eat, and my wife went into a tailspin, with a full scale panic attack. Each day she grapples with thinking the baby has stopped breathing, that my mother or her sister are going to drop her, or that she's not gaining enough weight. Our daughter is in fact perfectly healthy and happy. It kills me to see see my wife like this, because she can barely function. She's on the verge of dropping out of her part time vet tech program (where she is the top student) because when she can't have her eyes on the baby because she worries so much that her mind can't focus. When her mother is taking care of the baby she rests easy, but her mother has to go back to work eventually and cannot be a permanent caretaker for us. She knows we will need a caretaker for the baby but the idea of this also sent her into a full scale anxiety attack.

How can I best help? Should I suggest she see a psychologist? A psychiatrist? And how can I bring this up with her without damaging our relationship?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
491,"Since I have kept myself to myself I feel better much better. I think I am a natural Loner I was always so nervous so stressed around people. That why I became a alcoholic just to relax around people specially in crowded rooms I have always been socially awkward.
      As a child I went through awful abuse physically Mentally and sexually and it  ruined my life. I ended up being a bully and got bullied because I thought I was hard but it wasn't being hard it was being Angry Afraid depressed.
    I was sexually abused by my school teacher and when I told my mother a few months into the abuse all that happened was moved into next class and boy did the new teacher treat me like if it was my fault he even gave me a sum I couldn't do he called me out in front of the class and smack my bum screaming at me to figure out this sum. I still carry the humiliation with me today.
       I know people where I live think I am headshot , I feel like saying to them "" Guess what happens to kids when they get abused "" ? THEY GROW UP ! I even thought of buying a white t shirt and write on front and back Mad not bad because I snapped a few times and hurt myself and others around me after I had a breakdown.   My old man used me as a punching bag calling me simpleton and look at him with his mouth open or he would beat me and my mother would say what was that for / HE's breathing. I was sssso stressed when I was 13 on a paper round I had I self harmed badly in a stressed way. I am scarred I am Damaged but so would anyone I did lash out had lots of fights in school and had the stick for it but I became a vile horrible person not through wanting to be but through nerves and stress and anger the anger was because I was feeling pain 24/7.
       Mam was violent even though she was a nurse. One day coming home from work she woke me up by smashing plates on my head and after that just walked out not one word did she utter. She cut me with a knife she stabbed my sister in the bum check with a potato knife . I could go on and on. I endeded up in Borstal and I loved it it was more like the army needless to say I went back far a second term fresh wack 6 months to 2 years . The day before I left Borstal I could feel the stress coming back knowing my Dad was still in the house and soon would take his anger out on me never my sisters who both are doing well now. Not all people who do bad things are nasty or Horrible some are just plain confused not knowing how to cope.
        Now the system keeps me Heavily medicated and must see a mental health nurse every few weeks which I am grateful for because I think I would be doing life or worse in a mental health facility. I have a terrible name some people look at me and roll their eyes when I pass some I think understand but I have peace and don't worry so much about what people think thanks to meditation. I cant say why people think I am insane because its so out there anyone reading this would know instantly who I am. Lets just say I am grateful  this isn't like America where Guns are a common place because I and others would be Dead now. I can relate to some of those in America who shoot people then themselves. I hope you lot understand I do feel terrible guilt for my violent out bursts but at the time I was begging for help but because I was using alcohol they didn't take me serious. I am glad in a way I have achalasia because I cant drink booze because my esophagus is now acting like my stomach and booze would eat away at my esophagus and the pain would be unbearable. Well folks I got that off my chest , for now. Take care and please try and understand not all people who become violent are evil some are just plain Broken.:cry2:

494,"What if scientists were able to implant or erase memories for someone like those suffering from PTSD, this could be life changing, or do you think this is scientific innovation gone too far?

Living in Greece during the refugee crisis, here is how answering that question unfolded…

A flurry of arms, legs, grubby cheeks, whoops and giggles from three playful refugee children welcomed me as I emerged from the underground at Victoria square in Athens, Greece.

Exceptionally crowded, Victoria square has become one of the many parts of the city where a mere fraction of the thousands of refugees that arrive in Greece every day get stuck in transit through a danger-fraught migration through Europe, fleeing from life shattering circumstances in their home countries.

Scanning for a friend among the predominantly Afghani crowd of inhabitants temporarily occupying the tiny square I met the eyes of a little girl, no older than the spirited and sprightly kids that greeted me on arrival, and my heart sank. It broke.

Her eyes. So lifeless. So traumatized. Revealing little conscious awareness. My mind was literally suspended in the moment. Time seemed to stand still.

A mixture of emotions instantaneously surged inside me. Concern. Despair. Shame. Outrage.

In that very moment, acting on raw emotions, if I could have magically wiped the terrible memories from her mind I would have done it without hesitation. Using slow and methodical evidence-based thinking, would it do any good?

Considering the recent breakthroughs in both implanting, manipulating and erasing memories in animal models, such as the revolutionary fiber-optic memory manipulation tech developed by Steve Remirez at the Nobel Prize winning Tonegawa MIT lab in the picture below, foreseeing a future where human memory manipulation technology exists that could be used to target specific memories is near inevitable.

Yet, manifesting modern technology from the realms of science-fiction is often fraught with previously unexplored ethical dilemmas, no matter how noble the cause. Perhaps bringing memory manipulation tech into existence could do more harm than good to both the individual and society as a whole? Should we leave technologically tinkering with our memories well alone?

.ok so I have psychiatrist monday morning so wrote a couple of paragraphs which hopefully will help me get a diagnosis of ptsd. I'm sorry it's so long. Please can anyone read and help me add bits or take bits away.
.
.at night I'm scared
*To goto bed on myself because I don't want to be alone. But even when I'm laid with my boyfriend I still sense that there's someone there. My bf trys to understand so if something comes onto tv he turns it straight off.

See my uncle. See people. anyone dead. Day or night. Sleep with lights on. See dead faces. Like stood in front of me.
Feels so real.
Triggers are tv adverts programme with death in. Daytime programms also with a fake body. I tried to touch him but there's nothing there.

I used to love anything gory and horror movies but now I hide when something comes up or on tv or the Internet so I avoid* watching tv incase I get triggered. 

Not visited my uncles place where he lived since he died I can't imagine been there without him there.

Movie trailers. Documentary.
When triggered I get scared. And have to turn all lights on
.people talking about death triggers.

*Intrusive thoughts take over my head and I can't stop them sometimes. It's like it's all happening again. When I see his face I get scared it feels like he's just jumped out in front of me and I cry alot about him. I love him so much.

*Remember the memories of the event like it happened yesterday.

Nightmare of people dying. Keep dreaming that he's dying again and wake up crying.

When I close my eyes at night I see the body again and again and I get frightened that he's really in my room.
I can't look at his photos it just shows his dead face

My uncle died suddenly of cancer and stayed with him 3 hours after he died. Sometimes feel like there's somone in the room. Cold shiver. Only feel cold and shiver when the person isn't there. When I see my uncle the room is warm. I don't want to see him it scares me because he doesn't look nice any more. I can't get the visions of him out of my head even tho I have photos of him when he was well

My cat also died suddenly in march. He collapsed and started crying. So we got in the car too goto the vets and I had to hold him and he just died in my arms. I sometimes see him laid with our other cat. he was my very first of my own pet.* 

flash backs of been locked in a celler when I was about 9 yrs old. No glasses. There doesn't have to be a trigger. My gran had a celler and she told me it had been filled in so I spoke to my mum and she said different. 
Spoke to family and they said to leave it in the past. My gran tried to talk to me about it but she got told to stop telling me. Surely there's something they can tell me to help me deals with it..

Everything that I care for dies."
497,So hey guys I'm seeing my psychiatrist at 10am Monday morning.  I have a advocate coming with me. She wants me to write things down. I'm trying to get a diagnosis of ptsd. But I have to have it wrote down. I'm not good at asking questions and not good at putting my point forward.  So I need to write things down about my symptoms and what I expect from my not so long appointment. Please can anyone help me with the notes I need to write down please. I have been having hallucinations and paranoia. It's been happening years with also res that's happened to me. Plus being with my uncle for 3 hours after he died which was in december. I'm really stressing about my appointment tbh. So any help would be appreciated. Thanks
498,"This is my story. I am hoping someone can provide me with some clarity, understanding, meaning, diagnosis, and/or hope. 

(Before the summer started, I was abroad in Amsterdam. When I got there, my girlfriend and I (of 3 years) broke up. However, I made new friends and also wanted a new life. Therefore, I became a male escort (for fiscal and artistic reasons).  Genius right? There were wonderful nights full of intimacy, adrenaline, and adventure, and there were 2 terrible nights in which I feel I experienced rape despite the consent beforehand. During these nights, I felt incredibly trapped and was overcome with an incredible sense of rage during; however, I turned it inward and just imagined myself murdering the men over and over again, because it was my only way to make tolerable what I was feeling inside. This would happen again with a brief stint in porn I engaged in when I got back; again, I was trapped and internalized the immense amount of feeling my body was producing. However, I was (and hopefully still am somewhere inside) a great writer, and I turned my exploits into stories, and because they never seemed to bother me the days following the events, I assumed I had gotten past them. I also smoked pot throughout the day, and everyday during this time, and I wonder sometimes if that helped keep these events under the surface. I also had an oh so wonderful experience with molestation when I was a child, and I often ask myself whether or not I have been replaying this experience). 

February-May: In School, Happy, smoking every day still, in love with a new girl who had visited me abroad, writing furiously. 

June: I graduate from college. I stop smoking because I can no longer afford it without a job. I finish my last semester of my senior year well, obtaining honors in my English degree, and while I wasn’t entirely sure of my future, I had many pathways I could follow (IT, T.E.F.L, Journalism, the life of a published author if I finished my piece). However, all of this changed the first few weeks after school ended. I began to wake up at 5am each morning with my fists clenching the sheets, sweating, and filled with a panic I had never felt the likes of which before. I assumed it was post-graduation stress, and would write cover letter after cover letter to as many jobs as I could until the feelings subsided (which they somewhat did, but never entirely). These panic attacks only got worse. I saw a G.P, and he prescribed me Celexa and anti-anxiety meds. The celexa made my emotions mute, the anti-anxiety meds numbed my symptoms but never made the horrendous feelings actually go away. My psychiatrist discouraged me from seeing a trauma therapist, (despite telling her about my past) and so I assumed all of this was just anxiety and depression I had been self medicating with marijuana and exercise everyday, for a number of years. I stop taking the medication. Everything gets worse. Marijuana also no longer helps me, as it makes me feel terrified and dissociated (exaggerating my current internal state, where it used to make me feel euphoric, creative, and “not alone”). I began to feel like I am losing access to mind, and gradually I lose the ability to feel, think, and imagine. And then,  my mind is just “gone”. 

July: One morning I wake up, and I think I am dreaming. I look at all my books on the wall, and I feel an immense pleasure in thinking about all of the stories they hold. I am present in my mind, and absolutely everything is okay. But I soon realize I am awake, that “this” is my reality, and I undergo a severe episode of panic. And then my mind is snatched away from me. All of a sudden I can’t access my thoughts, my emotions, my personality, everything that makes me “me” is gone again. I want to cry, but I can’t. All I can do is tremble and fret. I make myself exercise and write and talk to my brother, and I assure myself if I can take care of my depression, I will be okay. 

I no longer wake up each morning in anxiety; instead, I wake up exhausted, terribly depressed. I have lost the thing most important to me: my sense of connection to the world, and I have no idea what to do to get it back. I research the hell out of everything, and decided I either have complex PTSD (because of the dissociation) (despite the lack of nightmares or agitation), Bipolar II, Major Depression, a depersonalization disorder, and/or all of the above. I see another psychiatrist. She prescribes Wellbutrin, and this is the only anti-depressant I can handle the side effects of (I am extremely sensitive to medication, and the world it seems). It helps minimally however. I feel myself becoming slower and stupider; I have an immensely difficult time stringing together sentences, finding connections in everyday life, talking to strangers, and cannot think of anything besides my current state. 

I come across EMDR therapy, and make an appointment as soon as possible. 
My first session of EMDR is the happiest day in my life I can think of. Afterwards, the sense of disconnection I have been experiencing for so long vanishes. Poof. I cry with tears of joy all the way home. I am able to recall memories, feel feelings from recent events I thought I was just a cloud in, and realize I have been “here” the whole time, but just completely unable to feel it. I spend time by myself for the first time in weeks (as I am constantly afraid of being alone), I make cookies by scratch, and I thank God/the World/ The Universe over and over again for my healing. I call my friends and family; they are so happy I am feeling like myself again, and I go to bed with biggest sense of relief I have ever felt. 

I wake up, and I feel refreshed for the first time, again, in weeks. However, I have been going back to bed for a very long time; I have been living in a bubble, for a very long time. I am very scared, despite finally feeling normal, and I try to force myself back to sleep. I feel a resistance in my brain; it does not want to go back to sleep, and it is terribly difficult to try and do so. I push against this however, because I am afraid, and I want one morning of dreams before I have to finally wake up, and deal with the real world for the first time in what now feels like years. When I do wake up, after fighting myself to sleep for two hours, I am in the fog again: not as much, but that connection I have lost. This is the day I now regret the most in my life. Everything I ever wanted was given to me, and I wish more than anything in the entire world to feel this way again. This is all I wish for. 
I go to more EMDR sessions, under the assumption it will work again if it worked once. However, whether it is my anxiety I now bring into it (as no matter how I try I cannot stop thinking, did it happen again? Did it switch again?), or whether my subconscious is now prepared for the healing which I now for a fact, can happen, I never again experience this breakthrough. I do not let myself become discouraged, but after 7-8 more sessions, I have begun to lose faith. 

August: I see a new psychiatrist. She is also unable to diagnose me. I try Zoloft (which gives me panic attacks in the morning), Abilify (which makes me feel further dissociated), and Adderall (which makes me realize I haven’t lost my abilities to think quickly or feel, which is great, but after a few days the depressive crashes inherent in taking Adderall everyday are too much for me to handle). None of the SSRI’s or stimulants make me “manic” or “hypomanic” as well, ruling out that day after my EMDR session, an “episode”. 

I do yoga every day, I run every other day, I lift weights, I talk with friends and family, I force myself to socialize, go outside, listen to music, etc.  But this disconnection has never again gone away (except in my dreams: during which I do seem able to talk and think clearly), and it is worse than depression, terror, or sickness I have ever felt. I cannot “feel” myself, and it is slowly killing me. 
September: I try microdosing with shrooms (0.1-0.2 g), as I have always loved psychedelics in my past (I also have a history with MDMA, which I never abused per se but wonder sometimes if it has affected my serotonin levels negatively). During this “trip” (if you could even call it that), I experience immense anxiety. I have to write, film myself talking, or take photos incessantly, to feel okay. I begin to wonder if I have always been dealing with traumas (from my childhood), as this need to make art is not new to me, it has just never been so extreme. This lasts for a few hours, and I begin to realize why I am dissociated from myself. I don’t think my waking mind could handle the amount of stress and anxiety that is actually going on in my subconscious, and is protecting me. But no matter how safe I make myself, I cannot convince it to release its protective grasp. 

October:  I read Peter Levine’s Waking the Tiger, and I feel it makes sense out of everything I am feeling. I recognize I was never able to discharge the energy associated with my traumas, and they are now wreaking havoc on my mind. I am seeing a Somatic Experiencing therapist tomorrow, but I am scared, as from what I’ve read concerning Somatic Experiencing it deals with points of anxiety on your body. I do not have any of these specific points, because I am so numb to everything, and when I am afraid, it is my entire body, which is clenched. I do believe in this therapy, but I am scared, because if it doesn’t work, I do not know what I will do. 

I download the app Sleep Cycle. It shows me that I am sleeping 1 hour a night, dipping into deep REM sleep, and the rest of my “sleeping” night, my chart shows that mind is actually awake. I take Benadryl, and start to feel somewhat rested in the morning (and my sleep cycle begins to finally resemble something normal). This is fantastic, but it doesn’t really change my day. 

Can anybody make any sense out of all of this? Or has anybody heard of anything like this happening to anyone? I read about periods of dissociation happened to sufferers of PTSD, but never anything so constant. I read about EMDR being extremely helpful, but never that it cured everything in one session, and then never worked again. I have also not been able to find any anecdote where a person was able to push himself or herself back into a dissociated state. Should I try doing different types of EMDR? Should I go skydiving to give myself better connotations of near death experiences? 

I have talked to a priest, I have asked for forgiveness hundreds of times, I am considering doing a soul retrieval with a shaman, and I think about killing myself on a daily basis (and honestly probably already would have had I not had that day post my EMDR session, as that proved this feeling I was feeling (or the absence of) was not something I was making up, and could go away. I feel I could handle absolutely anything if I could get through this: any depression, pain, or terror. But it is the dissociation and disconnection I cannot stand, and it is tearing me apart. I love this world, and I feel it is pushing me out. 

If anyone has any advice, any narrative to put through this which makes sense out of things, my gratitude to you would be ineffable. If I ever get through this, which I know I can because I did once, I would love to dedicate my life to helping trauma victims. I cannot think of a more beautiful art than raising the dead, back to life. 

Other Thoughts:
Do ayahuasca / DMT: Allow my brain to die a “chemical death”. Maybe this will release the dissociation, as I feel all of this came about because of how close to death I came. I am terrified to try LSD because of how the tiniest amount of mushrooms made me feel. I am also afraid of MDMA, as I imagine I would love it, but that it would deplete my already depleted “happy levels” and I am not sure how well I would handle that comedown. 

Go to a trauma center that does EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, EFT, Neuro-feedback and commit myself for as long as I can / afford to? My family will probably be able to help me with this, but it’s also hard because I feel far too ashamed to tell them what these “traumas” are. 

This is the only thing I can write about / think of. I don’t care about anything or anybody, and it makes my heart break to feel this way. I used to love the world with a fervor I had never seen in others before, and I long for the days in which I felt dedicated to making the world, and not just my own, a more beautiful place. I can’t feel love, for those I love, and I never thought such a hell could be created in this world. 

My own thoughts? I have a complex case of PTSD, symptoms of which were brought on by my anxiety of graduating from school. This has in turn worsened my depression (though again, it is the absence of feeling rather than any feelings of sadness, which make me suicidal). My brain is too stupid and too smart to allow EMDR to help again, and I could be like this forever, if I cannot figure out soon how to re-connect. 

I am slowly losing the resolve to reach out and help myself each day; it has been a little over four months, but it feels like an eternity. I used to be full of beauty, wit, and charm; now, I look constantly worried, have an absence of energy (which people do respond to, negatively), and am generally only tolerated by close friends and family, who knew how different I used to be. 

Please help me. Anything you can suggest. You would be helping to save a life, and I can promise you, I will never abuse it again. But more than that, I will learn from my mistakes, and make sure I can positively influence as many people as I can (in my lifetime and after). 

My very best
Lucy"
499,"Hi, 
I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD by my therapist.
Over the years I have had problems with intrusive memories which I have had therapy and CBT for in the past. I've been well for the last three years, but have recently started having intrusive memories.
20 years ago I suffered physical sexual harassment, which I dealt with in the past therapy.
Unfortunately I have recently experienced major verbal sexual harassment at work which has brought back my intrusive memories and caused me an immense amount of stress. I had to have time off work and my doctor diagnosed anxiety.
I started therapy again last week to deal with the intrusive memories. My new therapist has said I have PTSD. It has been nice and has helped to finally have a proper diagnosis of my problem, as I have felt so alone with this for the last 12 years and have also felt like there is something wrong with me. 
I am basically looking to chat to other people who also have intrusive memories. I have been researching techniques to deal with the memories and have also been researching the amygdala in hopes that I can retrain my brain and hopefully put an end to the intrusive memories for good.
Any help would be much appreciated"
500,hello. I have eu bpd. but ive also spoke to one of the workers at the mental health clinic about ptsd. I'm seeing my psychiatris at the end of the month. hopefully for a diagnosis. the reason I'm posting is to ask a question about it really.. my uncle died last deember and I was with him while he died and was laid with him for 3 hours after he died in his room at the nursing home he lived at. since then ive had nightmares and I see his face and body. it scares me and I cant sleep in the dark. someone please talk to me about it. thanks x :)
501,"I'm 37 and suffered years of abuse by my father as a young child. He was an alcoholic and emotionally, physically and sexually abused my little sister and I. I suppressed the abuse for nearly 30 years with alcoholism and focusing on my own family and career. However, about four years ago I had a breakdown when the painful memories came back. I lost my career, my house, my family and my sanity. I've tried to kill myself twice in the last two months and almost died this last time. I have supportive friends and family but nobody understands the daily hell in which I live. There aren't enough words for me to help them understand. I've tried so many times and failed that I've given up. Im on meds, but they don't seem to work. I've seen several therapists but complex PTSD seems to be a relatively new condition and I haven't found relief in therapy. I am starting emdr with a new psychologist next week but after four years of hell its hard to have hope. I joined this post with the hope that I could meet some folks who have had similar experiences so I could just share what we've gone through and what life is like for us so I know I'm not alone. I need to know I don't have to fight this battle alone. I can't do it and I'm afraid I won't survive another suicide attempt."
502,Anyone know any good/ helpful books about ptsd?
503,"I haven't been on here a while mainly because i been doing ok but today my stress is getting out of hand. I know other where I live know I suffer this horrible ptsd and some grin not a smile but a smirk and I just want to hurt them so bad just to wipe that grin off their faces. I know the next time I face a judge i will be going away for a very long time. I have been handling my stress with Yoga and meditation but lately i been missing doing it and now I am sitting here my teeth grinding my heart beating like a drum even after taking a valium I still feel like exploding. Why I let people get to me because they are drug addicts and bullies so why am I letting them get to me ?
   I am going to do a long session meditating tomorrow for definite. Tonight i am just far to vexed. 
    I have lost all my friends most of my family so I have nobody to talk to only my Mental health nurse which I see every 4 weeks or so. Man I am a mess right now. Wish I could turn the tables and make them feel how I feel right now. I probably could but would end up locked up. So bloody angry with them and myself."
504,"Pete Walker, M.A. Psychotherapy

""Renowned traumatologist, John Briere, is said to have quipped that if Complex PTSD were ever given its due – that is, if the role of dysfunctional parenting in adult psychological disorders was ever fully recognized, the DSM (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders used by all mental health professionals) would shrink to the size of a thin pamphlet. It currently resembles a large dictionary."""
505,"Next month it will be twenty years ago when my girlfriend was murdered and raped by her x and since then I have never been in a relationship. People tell me to move on but I am frozen and feel cursed. Is there anyone here ever been in a similar situation and did therapy help??

Thanks"

507,"It has to be.
Started therapy again. Need to move forwards, to find some trust, not waste the opportunity again.
Been told the hope, expectation, is that I can gain some peace with myself, that getting better after so long is very unlikely, but hope that I can survive my past and resulting self loathing.
If someone had said this to me 20-25 years ago I would have been appalled and despondent. Now, after years of being stuck in a horrible state, this feels welcome news, am grateful for the reality check. 
I think."
508,"I've had this a while in my files and wanted to share the quoted text as well as the other links below. 

Also it is normal for young children to be self-oriented. It’s just the natural way children are. The child thinks mostly of how things impact themselves and they try to figure out what to do to get what they want and avoid what doesn’t feel good. It takes years more maturity to realize that the universe doesn’t revolve around them, that other’s behavior and choices usually have nothing to do with them and are not their responsibility, even if they are impacted. So children just naturally feel that if someone touches them inappropriately, they must have done something to cause that, with resulting guilty feelings. When there is sexual contact between a minor and an adult it is always the adult’s responsibility. When sexual contact occurs between unsupervised minors, it is always the responsibility of the responsible adults to be aware that something unsafe has happened and to address and stop the situation.

Many children who are sexually abused are in families which also have other dysfunctions or addictions present. They may be neglected, emotionally abused, or rarely touched. A child who is desperate for positive attention in a love-starved home is likely to have powerfully mixed feelings if they are touched sexually. On the one hand, even young children usually instinctively feel the violation and experience that as “naughty” feelings, as described above. On the other hand, this may be the closest they have gotten to positive attention and touch for a long time. In spite of the guilt, in spite of the invasion, they may like the attention of the adult. This can lead to shame lasting well into adulthood when they may say to themselves, “I know it was wrong and I hate the person who did it to me, but I can’t tell even my closest friends or therapist that I liked the attention and hoped he would come into my room. I feel so ashamed about that.” What an adult seeking recovery needs to understand is that it is natural for children to want affection, a sense of belonging, and to feel special. These innocent and natural feelings of the child were taken advantage of if the interaction became sexual or secret in any way.
https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-compassion-chronicles/201501/healing-the-shame-childhood-abuse-through-self-compassion

Unbeknownst to them, adults who were abused as children often express the overwhelming shame they feel by pushing away those who try to be good to them; by sabotaging their success; by becoming emotionally or physically abusive to their partners; or by continuing a pattern of being abused or subjecting their own children to witnessing abuse. Former abuse victims may repeat the cycle of abuse by emotionally, physically, or sexually abusing their own children, or may abandon their children because they can’t take care of them.

Shame can affect literally every aspect of a former victim’s life, from your self-confidence, self-esteem, and body image to your ability to relate to others, navigate intimate relationships, and be a good parent to your work performance, ability to be learn new things, and ability to care for yourself. Shame is responsible for myriad personal problems, including: self-criticism and self-blame; self-neglect; self-destructive behaviors (such as abusing your body with food, alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes, self-mutilation, or being accident-prone); perfectionism (based on fear of being caught in a mistake); believing you don’t deserve good things; believing if others really knew you they would dislike or be disgusted by you (commonly known as the “imposter syndrome”); people-pleasing and co-dependent behavior; tending to be critical of others (trying to give shame away); intense rage (frequent physical fights or road rage); and acting out against society (breaking rules or laws).

Shame from childhood abuse almost always manifests itself in one or more of these ways:

o It causes former abuse victims to abuse themselves with critical self-talk, alcohol or drug abuse, destructive eating patterns, and/or other forms of self-harm. Two-thirds of people in treatment for drug abuse reported being abused or neglected as children (Swon 1998).

o It causes former abuse victims to develop victim-like behavior, whereby they expect and accept unacceptable, abusive behavior from others. As many as 90 percent of women in battered women’s shelters report having been abused or neglected as children (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2013).

o It causes abuse victims to become abusive. About 30 percent of abused and neglected children will later abuse their own children (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2013).

The truth is that for most former victims of childhood abuse, shame is likely one of the worst effects of the abuse. Unless you heal this pervasive shame you will likely continue to suffer from its effects throughout your lifetime.

Facing the problems that shame has created in your life can be daunting. You may be overwhelmed with the problem of how to heal the shame caused by the childhood abuse you experienced. The good news is that there is a way to heal your shame so that you can begin to see the world through different eyes—eyes not clouded by the perception that you are “less than,” inadequate, damaged, worthless, or unlovable.

509,"Not sure if I have a  form of PTSD.

As I don't wish to re-live my memories. I shall say this.

When someone harms me or tries to ruin my quality of life yet again intentionally. I get filled with hatred & rage. I then have flash backs of the hell that I have lived through caused by other people. And the rage and hatred is over whelming. I find myself hoping and wishing such people get eliminated for their misdeeds they have done to me, to others and what such individuals continue to do to me & others. 

Is this a form of PTSD."
510,"A friend pointed out a TV show yesterday, during which a leading UK expert on PTSD declared that PTSD is not a mental illness? and cited the fact that it's common amongst many people that are not regarded as mentally ill.Surprised me a bit, I had just assumed it was categorized in the psychiatric field  as a mental illness just  like any other such as bipolar etc."
511,Hi .. Our local MH team have suggested to my partner that he suffers with complex-PTSD. Our GP has agreed and now we are looking for help. We live in SE kent and don't know where to start looking. Any input would be very gratefully received. :low:
512,"I would like to apologise in advance, as some of what I may say will repeat from my introductory post.

I have a history of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse; anorexia, and bulimia. I currently am diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety, Panic Disorder, OCD , social Anxiety , EDNOS; and undiagnosed depression.

My husband (no previous signs of abusive tendencies) recently raped me while I was asleep on the couch, having had to much wine with a friend.

He is remorseful, understanding, and giving me space to sort my mind out; saying that his 'loss of control of his male instincts ' this once is enough to pull him out of the Earle if he should feel it again.

I believe that in his mind he feels this is the truth. He had always shown disgusted at the men in my past who had done things of the same nature, and feels the 'primal instinct' just took over.

I don't know if I believe the primal instinct part as I am not a man! I can relate though when it comes to my eating disorder in particular. Sometimes I feel I am not in control of my actions around food; so could it be the same?

We have two young children, and I do not want to cause a trauma in there life (like divorce) that may be their trigger later in life; as they will already be predisposed to mental health issues because of me...

I am trying to move past this, but it's so hard. My distrust for men as a whole has re-ignited, and PTSD triggers from the past and coming back into play, as well as new ones.

If anyone has experiences, advice, thoughts, on how I can get through and move past this I would be more than grateful"
513,"I am undergoing therapy and have been on anti depressants ( escitalopram) for a year, respiradone 1mg for 6 months, diazepam and propranolol. Over the last week my mood has plummeted, unable to complete a task, flashbacks, panic, self harm and suicidal and intrusive thoughts. Saw GP who referred back to psychiatrist. The psychiatrist asked no questions about how I felt just suggested that I increase respiradone to 4mg slowly over the next few weeks. I feel very anxious about this increase, has anyone else taken similar. I actually just wanted to tell him that I wanted to go to sleep forever and had active thoughts of suicide, I feel scared of myself and don't want this pain anymore, how can an anti psychotic help ?

514,"TRIGGER WARNING


mum is living with me seems she cannot face going back to stepdad or sort leaving him right now, none of my benefit people know this, she works full time, she is being made redundunt in september. mum is not on the tenancy with stepdad so he has a 3 bedroom house and signed off with depression. suggestions are made about me and stepdad exchanging and then mum being put on my tenancy. stepdad was up for it until the form arrived to exchange, my guess is he is reluctant because the form asks about any dealings with the police. mum and stepdad are having to share a car and he has fucked off with it for 12 days, leaving mum screwed to get to work. mum could get a car but then stepdad may end up with house and car. so will wait until stepdad comes back ask if he wants to exchange if no then mum is going to have to demand the car and grab all her stuff and im trying to persuade her to grab everything and leave him with nothing in the house. the police have been investigating this case since last november, we should know if it will go to court by september and then wait many months for it to go to court if it does at all. family have abandoned me and mum. i virtually have no friends. my bf doesnt seem to help or ask how i am, i hardly see him. right now im on day 8 of an injured back and can hardly move, at times i cant move for an hour or more. originally when the police were involved my cpn was off sick so had a temporary one come with me to do my statement which means being videoed, then cpn came back after knowing nothing. then i explained to my cpn what happened then a few weeks ago she left, now ive a new cpn that knows nothing about me or police situation, seen her once so far."
515,"Hi everybody. This is a little strange for me I've looked at this site of and on for a very long time but never felt brave enough to join. 

I suppose I'm hoping to hear something positive really from anyone who has si
suffered PTSD. Especially as I feel defeated by it again. 

I will give a history - not to be self absorbant but to give understanding. 

For me I initailly believed my journey began following a single incident back in 2007. I was a mature student at university studying psychology, recently married and two children. 
Both myself and my hubby love cars and we bought a specific type of car as a treat / investment. However we didn't know it had be flagged as a target car for a ""stolen to order"" list ( exactly like Gone In 60 Seconds film).

As the car required keys for entry, whilst on my own we had a armed agrivated burglary in the house. It was so strange. I was frozen, I couldn't understand the sight of these huge people in full black clothing, gloves, balaclavas. It didn't make sense then and I still struggle now to say the least. 

The ordeal went on longer than planned and it ended just in time before as they had said I was to be shot. 

I had two weeks off uni and tried to carry on - not sleeping, terrified, scared they would return as they'd threatened, drinking more and more. My life spiralled. I lost my friendships which are still difficult now. It has impacted greatly on my marriage and I feel at risk all the time. 

I managed to get a job - ironically in mental health providing therapy, I have been off a while now again as my PTSD symptoms relapsed as such. 

I began therapy - EMDR specially in 2015 which I did find useful to a degree with the flashbacks. Following this I was referred to a Psychologist within Secondary Care mental health for CAT  - cognitive analytical therapy. This was actually amazing but very hard going. 

I began to be aware of many traumas thoughout life, many areas of abuse and remaining abusive relationships. Of which contributed to my development and maintainence of PTSD. 

Therapy has been a long journey for me - 4 years continuous either therapists or psychology. I had begun to "" manage"" a as a normal life as possible. That lasted 6 months and I'm now in relapse waiting psychology again after support from a psychiatric nurse. 

I feel sad that the men that stole my life made me weak. I was strong despite many problems growing up but they took my confidence, security. I don't think I will ever feel safe again. I see everyone as a threat , I have no trust and that now results in me staying at home as much as I can. I can't see how I will ever return to work - and I feel a hypocrit - how is it ok for me to help others with their mental health when I'm such a mess?? 

I have heard people say "" Gp days I've got PTSD"" - ask for a formal diagnosis from a Psychiatrist they will sort your medication too. 

I do hope somebody has been able move on from their PTSD.... I'm not sure there is a light at the end of the tunnel anymore."
516,"Sat here. All tensed up. 

Hands clasped. Wincing at 'thoughts' flashing through my mind.

I Want To SCREAM!!!

Mustn't though. Even though no one will hear me.

Let yeself start screaming and where does it end?

No. Sit here. Go through this. Hours to go yet.

Till exhaustion. Lay down. "" Sleep ""

Couple of hours and light's piercing ye eyes. Images. Another fucking day.

Check shit out. Steady as we go? Check.

Bang off the walls for another day. We made it. By this time tomorrow ....?

And on. And on. And on."
517,"When I relapse nobody wants to remember or here those memories but me simply posting an old song or a reminder of a gathering where I divulged info is wiped away as is any future attempts of me away from that reconnecting with family and old friends. By tellingI wiped out everybody and they never want to see me again whether I keep it from them or not. It's like a nightmare or scary movie noone wants to admitt they have ever seen.  My family is gone, can't do this anymore. I am 100% alone"
518,"Hi,

I have been suffering from Complex PTSD for 7 years now

Was just hoping for any advice on medication/therapy that as helped people with this or people that you know of who suffer from this,

I have been through so many medications in past 7 years 
Numerous antipsychotics, benzos and anti- depressents 
and also have done heaps and heaps of different types of therapy.

This has all kept me alive - but I have had no improvement and
I cannot manage to live in survival mode forever - having no hope left due to medications and therapy I have done not making any improvement.

And hope lost for any sort of future living like this

Thanks for reading"
519,"Today I freaked out twice. One time a suicide attempt and the other was a knock-all-furniture-in-sight attack. So they said I should take 30 mg diazepam but Becky said it was poisoned so they pinned me down on the floor and forcibly injected 100 mg tranxene. I do feel a bit calmer now...
But Becky is annoyed and says I have to come now. So she's being a bit of a nuisance and the guys won't shut up either."
520,"Hey guys, help me diagnose myself a bit if you can... I seem to experience most of the symptoms associated with PTSD if I stretch it a bit, pretty sure I don't have it any more, but I'm 99% sure I did have it in the past as a child, and became afraid of many illogical things that reminded me of my trauma as a result. 

I got over that at some point, can't remember when, but other children became a form of trauma if I stretch the definition a bit. I don't believe that my schoolyard experience was traumatic enough to cause PTSD, and it'd be kind of pathetic if it was, but I'm not going to rule it out straight away. Not a day goes by where I don't remember my social failings in the past at least a dozen times at a guess, and now they are even worse with my occasional psychotic episodes which seem to be centred around me acting incredibly awkward and insane because I don't care any more.

Thanks for your time."
521,"First post here, such a lot to try and explain in one hit so I'll try and keep it as brief as I can.

I've been with my husband since I was 16, he is 7 years older than me, I am now 43 and he will be 50 in a weeks time.

We got married in Decemeber 2013 on our 25yrs to the day we met, we have had emotional trauma before, but that has been due to a few things. He went cold on me many times and I guess I reached out to anything that showed me love. I've not had an ""affair"" but there has been talk and flirtation, nothing serious. He does know about it and we have talked thing through many times. I thought all that was forgotten and in the past, and after a few years of things settling down and seeming to be ""happy"" we decided, well he asked me (again!!.. we were supposed to get married when I was 21 but he cancelled it, said we couldn't afford it, and this was after booking lots of things for the wedding, about 4 months to the actual wedding date, I was traumatised then, I guess my reaching out started sometime after that).. so we made the date for our 25th anniversary, like I said all ok and then 2014 we managed to finally get a mortage on a brand new, new build house,.... was really looking forward to starting a new life, in this new house with my now very happy life with the man I love.

We were due to move in the first week in December. One evening (not even into our first year as a married couple) first week in Oct, we were in bed and I was woken up by the light of his mobile phone, and noticed blurrily, he was looking at an image... I tried to grab it to get a better look, he said ""IT'S YOU""... but the phone flew out of his hand and I grumbled at him a bit, he then went to sleep, well I think so anyhow, I waited half an hour then reached up and managed to get it, and looked at his history, we have the same model phone so was easy to find out. It was a model who kind of looks a bit like me, long dark hair, dark eyes, but a much better body than mine.. I went nuts.. I stormed off into another room and sat down, he came in and said """"come on don't be silly, you look at porn too"""" (my argument was, if I had a sex life, I wouldn't need to look at porn!!!, but I found this personal as it wasn't a sex act, like the stuff I'd been looking at, he was looking at topless pics of beautiful women.. more on the latter comment soon)

Now to just let you know, our sex life has been bad for many many years, weeks, months have gone by and there's been no inclination of being intimate and when we did, it was brief and no passion, maybe twice a year we did have good sex but that was it.

A week passed, I didn't say much, but i'd always felt deep down that he was hiding something. we lived in a ground floor apartment, and when I would walk down the hall quietly, the web page he would be looking at would suddenly close, and I could have sworn many times he was closing down a pic of a nude woman. I have spoken about this but he tells me it's not true hmmm!!

I have in the past acted in a way as to say I don't trust him, not that I'm saying that think he's had an affair, it was just this feeling of something not being right and his focus has been elsewhere somehow. I know he shot a his work colleuges wedding before all this came out, this was after we got married in 2014, but I know that eve when he came home, I was acting a little arsey with him, which he did bring up once all this stuff came out, i.e. the next thing coming up (sorry I said I would keep this brief but I can't, if you got this far well done)

About a week after the first thing I found him looking at, I had a dig through his phone and found loads and loads of links to sites for glamour models (it was never sex porn, just models and sometimes these sites where they glamourize girls who take nude selfies) but some were of photography forums were we used to go to, we both are into photography and I am a makeup artist, we did get into erotica a little years ago but never really carried it out, just liked the imagary of it.. but these pics of women were more about their bodies, beauty, not the erotica I mention, it's totally different.

I went MENTAL and threw his phone at him, I just can't hold anything in when I get so upset, it just eats me alive, it's like I have to know what's behind it or it will always chew me up!! but he's never been one to explain things well, especially if he;s being threatened in any way.

He said, he looked at these things on his phone to catch me out, and he said"" it worked"" I guess that's a good excuse? maybe he did do it to catch me out, or not? who will ever know, but again, I felt FEEL, so so mortified like it's a personal attack on who I am!!!

A couple of days later, he was working nights and I tried keeping myself occupied by looking at different things, but this feeling wouldn't go and the more I then thought about how I felt, the more I was driven to do the next thing.. (to explain, it's like you think of one thing, like what does he see in this and that and why did he do this and that, and when did it happen, where was I when he was looking and your mind just can't switch off, it's horrible and all the while you feel sick to the pit of your stomach, to think you thought everything was ok and so happy being married, everything in the past as so much to look forward to then to be ripped away from you leaving this awful dark void) Sorry, I ramble, getting back to it.. A couple of days later, he was on a night shift, I decided I would spend the evening looking through his pc, I know this sounds awful, but this pc was originally a shared pc, and I guess through need with work, I needed a laptop, so over time it kinda became his and hers, although he has used my laptop too for things.. so!!

It was the worst thing I could have done, but I needed to know, I found all kinds and my heart was beating so hard, I could feel my pulse in my face, everything was racing and I felt faint with all this hardcore emotion.

I found he has been looking on a free webcam site and even recorded a woman for about 30 seconds, dark hair, perfect body, great boobs etc... wiggling about on cam with a stupid squeaky voice that still haunts me. then another was a pic of a woman on a phone sex chat line on our tv, over 3k pics or more I found of all kinds of stuff I can't remember all, but then I do try and get on with my day and something will trigger a memory and I will think of something I've seen and I'm set thinking negative hurtful feelings all over again. I searched through his YouTube history and it was laiden with erotic films I've never seen or heard of, clips of glamour women in fast cars with their boobs flying out, videos of womens up skirts... and then I found loads of pics of a woman who he works with... (will go into that more in a min)

I could go on and on about all kinds of stuff that I found, but I emailed him at work and called him stuff I won't repeat on here... he came back with I don't want to talk about this over email, as the emails at work are sometimes monitored as you can imagine... I had had a drink so I was quite fluid as you can imagine. He came back with it's to do with my mum!!! *felt confused at first* then he said, what she had!!

His mum died of Cancer in 2009 and then his uncle died of prostate Cancer a year later in his early 70's! Of course I love my husband very much so was willing to hear what he had to say. He said he's been worried sick that he has prostate Cancer as he's been suffering with Erectile Dysfunction for a while, I never really gave it 2 thoughts that he may have trouble down below, I just thought he wasn't that interested in me!!! But why not tell me??? He said he was too scared and stubborn to do anything about it. He never was one to go to the doctors, he would only ever go if there was something annoying but not serious and that was rare anyhow, and he definately didn't relish the thought of going to talk about why it wasn't working down below.

He said he will do anything for me and said he will go to the docs and have tests etc...

While we were still living in the city, we went to see a gp (not a great one) and they ran blood tests to see if he had raised cells that may suggest a Cancer, and it came back ok, then he had a few diff tests on his liver, rectal exam, and a camera into his bladder, the results came back and it said his prostate was only encrouching on his bladder slightly but put it down to ""his age"" which I find annoying as he's a very young 49 and looks at least 15 years younger. They said they would try him on a drug for ED sex side of things first before trying to treat any prostate trouble, as both drugs may have side effects... He just ended up having massive headaches, the results of taking the drugs really didn't seem to make much difference, maybe a tiny bit but we both knew it wasn't right for him. When we moved to the new house, we went with a new GP practice and they have been great for both of us... My low mood and depression has highs and lows, that have a pattern of a few good days, then a few bad, or then it will peak and I will just go into a wild rage again due to thinking about him and this other secret life he's had and not knowing how to deal with it.

It seemed that when I was worried he may have Cancer, that seemed to numb out all those feelings as I just was so worried for him, Once, I knew he was ok, that's when this all started kicking off again, and it's got worse and worse!!!!!

Firstly the new docs went crazy when they found out they gave him that drug without doing more indepth tests, which he is still waiting on at this very moment, they are testing him to see if he has low testosterone first and go from there....

For me, about 7 weeks ago, I went into see the nurse for a routine check up with being a new patient, he had one a week after me where he explained to the nurse all thats been happening! When I went to see the nurse, I ended up breaking down in tears and told her all of this... and she booked me an emergancy appointment to see a gp 90mins later... I was in the gp's office for an hour, just in floods of tears and told them I couldn't cope anymore! I told the doc that I had been drinking a lot over a decade, but he also has with me too, maybe dumbing down our emotions?

I have self harmed about 5 times after bust ups over this but was too scared to go too deep and 4 days ago, I took 2 of my 30mg Mirtazapine? unsure of the spelling without looking...

That ended up after a huge bust up and just wanting to end the constant feeling of being unworthy, ugly and lied to. I was out of it, he said he had been walking me up and down keeping me awake, I had been drinking that day before he came home with a friend, and I hoped to have a nice evening with him but it didn't end up that way, just this dark cloud just keeps coming over me and I can't get rid of it, I'm sick of it!!!

Before the mirtazapine incident, a week before that, after a bust up where I self harmed, the next day he emailed me from work and said lets sort this out once and for all and I will listen and tell you what you want to know when he gets home from work. We got something to drink to help the talk through (his idea) he said a few things, one I already knew, he said he had been looking at images of women to see if he could get things working downstairs, but to me this just seems a bit weird, why not just tell me and try things out with me instead, I was blunt before and then again over this, ""so you wanted to get an erection?"" I guess I was being hard on him, probably slightly humiliating him? or maybe just being factual, prob the latter as I need to know facts.. he said yes, but he said he never played with himself, (really???) :scratch: Although I forgot to say earlier, he had admitted that first night way back in this that he was playing with himself, and he did say that night as he couldn't sleep!! Urg!! makes me feel awful, anyhow, he swears he doesn't do that and it's never been him to do that, I know he's never liked full on porn, I've tried getting him to watch it with me in the past and he's pulled a face to it. Anyhow, he also said that he has looked at these women and said to himself, he wanted to see if he could see what I saw in other people in these women, and thought to himself, this woman will cheat, that woman will cheat, etc etc.... I said to him, but you asked to marry me, and you had all this ""£$^£"" going on!?!?!?! I've told him it's made me feel like the marriage is a fake, and I've been lied to, and to think, when we came back from honeymoon, not a week later, I've realised he's been looking at all this S**T and carried it on after we got back too and all the way into Oct the next year!!! I just feel I can't stop comparing myself to other women now and I go on this cam site everyday looking at these women and crying to myself.

Lastly a little on me, in 2006 I had a gastric band and dropped a huge 13st in a year, (14lbs to 1 stone if out of UK) and it left me with a lot of skin, but I have let him take glamour pics of me in late 2007 where you can't tell I have been big or see skin. My dad died 2 months after the op, I think that also kinda added to the weight loss with the berevement of it all. but since all that, I have gain back about half the weight, but I did drop 3 stone before the wedding and got into a size 18UK dress size, That's a 14US I think? but just to explain why I mentioned this, I am currently trying to lose the rest of the weight so I can have skin surgery as this alone has had a bad effect on my low self esteem, (the re gaining I mean and the excess skin) I was on a high when I was a size 14 at my lowest, and was one size away from getting skin surgery.. but in all this and he knows I have massive self esteem issues, I find this a horrible thing to do knowing how I would be if I ever found this out, which I did!!!...

Something I forgot to mention and this is the last of it ... the time I told you about him wanting to sort this out finally and he got a drink to help talk... and he told me the things why he was looking at them etc.... well 2 weeks before that I had to set up a password thing with a clue to a place I liked going to as a kid... it's about 4 hours drive away, won't say where, but after this chat he said to me he was taking me overnight to this place so we could have some special time together and it did really help and I thought it healed me... but yea, 3 days later.. the cloud comes knocking!!!!

Please help? xxx"
522,"I have been on the waiting list to get EMDR for 15 months now.

Since taking the clozapine in tablets instead of a drink the amount in my blood has gone down drastically even though it's the same dose. I swore to her that I am not spitting them out I let her check my bag that I'm not keeping them for an overdose and eventually she decided to up the dose and see what my blood results will be when I'm on 700mg. She nearly put me back on the drink which is disgusting. 

She wants to send me to a long term therapy clinic which has a waiting list of six months and you stay there for up to two years, sectioned. She believes they can help me in therapy with my traumas. That means I can't go to uni in September. It means I could be sectioned for a maximum of another 2,5 years. 

She says I'm deteriorating since taking the clozapine in tablets. And after the suicide attempt this weekend she has decided to keep me on 1-1 and no more escorted walking outside. 

This all is a lot to take in. 
Thanks for reading it all and please can someone help me.

525,These flashbacks are of my hospital stays. I can't stop flashing back to when I had to have shots to calm down or being touched inappropriately or being watched taking a shower. I'm so frightened. I'm so anxious.
526,"I have PTSD due to trauma, both childhood trauma and adult trauma. The traumatic experiences finally stopped about 10 years ago and over the years I've learned that I need to take responsibility for my choices in life. 

However, as part of that process I have also had to learn not to take responsibility for other peoples choices. It comes from the deeply ingrained feelings from childhood, that if somebody treats me badly, their choice has something to do with me = it must be my fault. 

This is a specific attitude that makes people like myself vulnerable to abusive relationships. It is common for abusers to make themselves out to be (and even believe) that they are the hard done by victim - that they wouldn't be abusive if...

I've had a hard day
pressure is getting to me
you caught me at a bad time
you don't know what I've been through in my life
if you'd had it as I have, you would be like me too

But other people often want to get involved and smooth things over...

well, they have had a hard life
they can be a bit feisty, just ignore it
they're usually nice
I'm sure it was nothing
It will blow over
you must understand they are very stressed at the moment

But by passing on all responsibility to the recipient of aggression, everybody involved enables it. Self-responsibility is key - however hard done by someone imagines themselves to be, however worse off than everyone else - enabling people to stay in that frame of mind and sweeping up after they abuse others, isn't supportive. It won't help them in the long run.

 Enabling becomes ingrained, but it doesn't succeed in preventing poor behaviour, it gives the message that it's ok. But more importantly here, it doesn't help those people that are stuck in the loop and giving up on their lives."
527,Anyone else suffer from this? I'm a bit disorientated so I'll post more later.

529,"Trauma-focused psychotherapies for PTSD in people with experiences of psychosis: A change in the status quo?

The effectiveness of Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) in treating Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been well established. Indeed, they are recommended as first line treatments for PTSD in international treatment guidelines.

People who experience psychosis have traditionally been excluded from these trials. This is despite the fact that PTSD is a common comorbidity in psychosis (with 12.4% of people with psychosis also meeting criteria for PTSD) and that the presence of PTSD is associated with worse social and psychiatric outcomes in this group. The biological and psychological sequelae of trauma are also implicated in the genesis and maintenance of psychosis itself.

There has been some preliminary evidence for trauma-focused therapies being safe and effective for people experiencing psychosis. Despite this, the status quo of exclusion of people with psychosis from receiving evidence-based treatments for PTSD symptoms has remained. Van den Berg and colleagues’ RCT is long overdue and is a potential game changer in the landscape of psychological treatments for people experiencing psychosis… I hope.

Ancient Assyrian warriors suffered from PTSD after combat, over 3,000 years ago.

Walid Khalid Abdul-Hamid, an honorary senior lecturer in psychiatry at Queen Mary University of London, and Jamie Hacker Hughes, director of the Veterans and Families Institute at Anglia Ruskin University, published their findings just last month in the journal Early Science and Medicine. 

Here’s James Gallagher, interviewing Hacker Hughes for BBC News: 


“The sorts of symptoms after battle were very clearly what we would call now post-traumatic stress symptoms.

“They described hearing and seeing ghosts talking to them, who would be the ghosts of people they’d killed in battle – and that’s exactly the experience of modern-day soldiers who’ve been involved in close hand-to-hand combat.”"
545,"I am not sure but after reading stuff online about PTSD, I think I may have it. I avoid talking about some stuff that happened to me and memories of them keep coming back no matter how hard I try to not think about them and certain things and words tend to trigger feelings of fear and I have trouble thinking afterwards. I mean I actually avoid doing things that I associate with negativity including stuff that really aren't so bad like cleaning or even brushing my teeth. I sort of associate brushing my teeth for more than one minute or less as a punishment which is a bit hard to explain. I also freak out if people point out that I missed a spot while cleaning and act as if they are going to yell at me and force me to do it over again even if it took me two hours to finish. I'm not asking for a diagnosis here but rather opinions on whether or not these things are considered traumatic events."
546,"Alcohol misuse and PTSD comorbidity: a significant problem lacking solutions

Readers of the Mental Elf will be aware that problematic drinking is a major issue in the UK; 24.2% of the UK population are classed as hazardous drinkers (8+ AUDIT scores) and 3.8% as harmful drinkers (16+ AUDIT scores). Two-thirds of harmful drinkers show symptoms of alcohol dependence (NICE 2011). Although alcohol misuse is a major problem in its own right, it is argued that alcohol misuse in combination with other mental illnesses may have especially poor outcomes.

One illness that may be particularly problematic when comorbid with alcohol misuse is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Although the rates of comorbidity between PTSD and alcohol misuse are not as high as some disorders (e.g. anxiety and depression) this does not mean PTSD with alcohol misuse is not a major issue. Indeed, symptoms of each disorder may mask each other, outcomes may be poorer than for either illness in isolation, and alcohol misuse may sometimes be a consequence of PTSD.

The current review focuses on the comorbidity between PTSD and alcoholism with additional focus on whether particular symptoms of PTSD are associated with alcohol misuse.

I talk to the helpline all the time, most nights, sometimes days. I am on the list for more talking therapy. 

Please tell me how long this will last. It's been two years now and i don't know how much more i can take.

I thought i was working through everything. Processing, but i feel like i'm getting worse sometimes. I cry, sleep, eat, cry, sleep, cry. My head races though, almost all the time.

Fashbacks suck me into their world so that i'm not present. I'm having lunch with someone and my head is somewhere else and i can't hear what they are saying.

My attention span is poor.

I'm 32 and have been off work for 2 years. I need to live again. I need to work again. Im trying to take this time to heal my mind and help my brain to fix itself but it is taking too long."
548,"Whilst my ptsd stems from an unspeakable attack on my person, I have become very interested in verbal abuse as was originally diagnosed with more than one personality disorder. I see this as verbal abuse in many ways as I was torn to shreds by a psychiatrist who appeared to be on a mission to destroy me with his words.

I have been crying this evening as I watched 24hours in a&e and saw a gentle psychiatrist die from cancer. His mum said he treated his drug adficted clients as gentleman. This had me crying so very much because I was not treated like the gentle lady that I now know deep in my heart that I am.

Victory over verbal abuse
By
Patricia Evans

It is the last section which helped me greatly.  Please go and get it from your library.

As I cried I said out loud-
I am a gentle lady. Sensitive.  Good.  Kind. Loving.  Made perfect. Special. Important. Gifted. Talented. Friendly. Helpful. Special. 

He treated me like I was the worst person in the world.
I was not treated like a gentle lady.
I had been through a horrific attack.  I was in bits and pieces. Frightened. Experiencing strange things that I could not verbalise at the time. Despite my telling him this. Despite my telling him that the police had taken me to a&e after the attack and all that entails, he made me feel like everything was my fault. He tore me to shreds. Spoke to me with words dripping with hate. He hated the person I was.

If I'd had a personality disorder or two, should this be how one is treated? I almost lost my son because of this psychiatrist. And much more besided. I lost myself. 

I think I'm finding myself again. 

God will rectify this when this man dies. I hope. I know not all of you believe in God. I'm sorry to say this then but I believe everything will be rectified when he and my attacker die. Justice.  

Don't let anybody tell you that you aren't perfect. You have to be strong jn that."

552,Ok let me start with saying i am pregnant with my 3rd child in less than 3 years. My first two are 18 months apart and this one will be 18 months from my second child as well. I have been having very paramoid feelings about everyone with my children. Im scared someone is going to physically or sexually abuse them. And i know thats a fear of evety mother but it consumes me. I dont like leaving them alone with anyone...  Including my husband who is the one person i know i should trust. And this is why Im seeking some answers. It ruined my mothers marriage because she thought her husband was hurting me but he was a wonderful man from what i remember as a child. Just as my hudband is. Just as everyone in my family is. So why am i having these feelings toward everyone? Is it because Ive gotten pregnant to close together and havent let my hormones balance out? Or is it because I was hurt as a child by a close relative and Im afraid it could happen to my kids? Please give me some input before I ruin my marriege. Also my mother and grandfather have thyroid problems which i know makes you feel paranoid. Im just looking for a rational solution here.
553,"Don't know whether to try a sensible thread or just let it out.... 

My sister is currently staying and she has done something to deliberately antagonise my brother. He's not found out yet, but when he does, I don't know what will happen.
I'm scared - not just for myself - but particularly for my Mum. I am worried about my sister too, but the chances are she'll be back where she lives before he finds out.

The fear is crippling me so much at the moment.
I lie awake at night and hear my Mum screaming (inside of my head). 
It's a replay of what's happened. It's what I fear is happening and what I fear will happen again. Only what will it be this time? How bad will it be?
Will he kill her?
I am kept awake by images of what he could do to me, or my parents, or my dogs.
He talks about my hair a lot... I fear he will shave my head because he got clippers out before as a ""joke"".
I fear he'll hurt the dogs. My dog runs out the room when he walks in and growls whenever he goes near him.
I fear my Dad will fly off the handle - not that I give a shit if my brother gets hurt - it's more what if my Dad ends up arrested or going to prison?
Every time my phone rings or I hear a car outside I think it's the police coming to tell me he's killed my parents.

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK I WANT TO DIE TO ESCAPE THIS SHIT.
I don't really want to die, it's him that should die. Fuck off and leave us all alone. Get out of my head, you ****. Get out of my life, you fucking disgusting ****.


MY bowels are torturing me at the moment. I'm (almost) literally shitting myself with fear. It feels like i'm being stabbed in the bowels. Under my ribcage is tender.


P.S. - I don't feel I can say this to my care coordinator. It's too awkward between us and her mannerisms make me feel like I should just shut up."

555,"Hi all,

Just wanted to say hi as I've been diagnosed with PTSD by my psychiatrist and am waiting for therapy to talk through several traumatic events from my past.

Briefly, I was emotionally neglected by my mum for years(she still tries to do it now) physically assaulted by my dad on a regular basis and was bullied by my younger brother for years as a child.

I have also been pulled from a crowd at a football match where I was being squashed, been assaulted by a gang of young men when I was seventeen and was in a violent / abusive marriage for ten years.

I am now with someone who loves me for me but I have struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember and daily life is a struggle.

Just wanted to know what I can expect from therapy as I have had several diagnoses in the past (dysthymia, BPD) and my initial assessment with adult psychology has led be me being discharged as the therapist has advised me that until I stop self harming, there is little they can do.....

Anyone any advice for me?"
556,"I'm sick of feeling lie the way I do, everyday is a battle and I just don't feel safe anywhere. I feel like I've nowhere I can go, nobody I can turn to that understands. Being out in the big wide world on my own scares me to death and I'm sure I'm being followed again.

My girlfriend keeps pushing me to work but I've tried for so long to work with people and it's just too stressful. Tried a job working by myself, part time for 5 weeks but that just gives me time on my own to think and all I can think about is the past!

Coming to terms with mum and dad abusing me as a child, so can't turn to them. My girlfriend pushing me into work, I'm sure she doesn't understand and I've no friends to talk to.

The stress is just too much for me at the minute, I just want it all to stop! I'm close to rock bottom and have been there before and it's not a nice place to be. What do I do???"

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

by Dr. Dan Bochner

Psychologists are always talking about “inner conflicts.”  Why is that?  Well, certainly “inner conflicts” can't have anything to do with a disorder that arises due to trauma.  Right?... Nooooo, wrooonng!!!  Post-traumatic stress disorder (also known as PTSD) is, believe it or not, also caused by an inner conflict.  The inner conflict of PTSD, however, is not borne from a troubled past or conflicted feelings about right and wrong.  Those kinds of issues can exacerbate PTSD, sure, but they are not what causes it.  PTSD is actually caused by a conflict between two essential biological imperatives.  These imperatives are at the core of health and development.  The first is the avoidance of pain.  The second is the integration of experience.

	It should come as no surprise that we avoid pain.  It is obvious that we humans, just like all animals, survive largely because we do avoid pain.  Most organisms move away from physical pain instinctively.  The instinctual first cry of birth is an impulse to have some kind of tension or discomfort soothed, whether it be the actual pain of being born, the first pangs of hunger, or the first experience of terror.  We then move on to cry for comfort of all kinds, which is not just avoiding pain, but is also deeply involved in connecting to others.  And of course, from the earliest ages, although we might reach out to touch the glowing embers of the fire or the red hot burner on the stove, our first burn teaches us a clear respect for anything with a yellow, red, or orange glow.  

	Trauma is, by definition, out of the ordinary, extremely painful, experience.  Sometimes severe physical pain is involved, but often the most horrendously damaging aspects of a traumatic experience involve the impact it has on others whom we love or for whom we feel responsible, or our feeling that we might be to blame for the trauma.  Emotional pain is somewhat different than physical pain.  Nevertheless, the impact of emotional pain is every bit as powerful as physical pain in traumatic experiences.  Just like any other kinds of pain, it is natural that we avoid all the different kinds of pain involved in trauma, including both the physical and the emotional aspects.  Avoiding emotional pain is at the core of PTSD.

	The second primary factor involved in PTSD, the integration of our ongoing experience, is just as essential for living as the avoidance of pain.  Life has little meaning without the ability to remember what we've been through, or who we know, or where we've been.  Our earliest experiences, perhaps by design, are especially difficult to integrate.  Maybe that is one of the reasons that being born is not especially traumatic (from the viewpoint that it is not recalled repeatedly with horror).  At that point we have not yet integrated any of our experiences.  As we develop, however, our ability to recognize our closest caregivers, to know how best to get their attention, and to steer clear of physically painful objects grows in importance.  Soon, our understanding of everything we perceive gets organized for the specific purpose of helping us manage our ongoing functioning in the most efficient manner possible.

	Trauma is especially chaotic experience that defies logical understanding and thus is especially difficult to integrate.  Although we typically expect to be able to avoid disasters, traumatic experience brings into question our ability to avoid accidents or painful experience.  Thus, we don't want to integrate traumatic experience because doing so requires us to admit that we might be in danger that is unavoidable.  Not only are many accidents unavoidable, but we also would like to remain in denial about how true it is that we are taking chances on a daily basis.  Our desire to deny the possibility of danger, even when it might be avoidable, makes it difficult to integrate trauma in that doing so requires us to realize how dangerous things are.  When we're making ourselves vulnerable in some way, we're typically in denial of the danger we're in.  For example, we operate motor vehicles so frequently that we forget how ludicrous it is to believe that it's safe to hurtle ourselves at 60 mph in a metal box on wheels, and to expect our vehicle will never malfunction, and to expect that we ourselves will never malfunction, and to expect that all the other drivers will follow all the rules.

	In spite of how safe we'd like to think we can make ourselves, when something does go wrong, the results can be horrifying.  We likely blame many circumstances and perhaps we blame others we don't know.  We can blame ourselves as if our ability to avoid disasters should be flawless.  Any loss of material possessions, a loss of the feeling of safety, or God forbid, loss of life or limb, can seem utterly incomprehensible.  Although traumatic events should be integrated into our understanding of life, maybe even more than other experiences since they could help us learn better what to avoid, these events defy logic, seem to make little sense, and hurt us so deeply and personally, that such events are often not remembered at all (even when head injury is not involved).  Our desire to avoid the pain of trauma often actually makes us forget the incident entirely.

	More than anything else, really, it's the severity of the emotional terror that makes it impossible to integrate a trauma into our ongoing experience.  Our emotions go into turmoil over the trauma, and the pain is so bad that we just can't bring ourselves to think about it.  Yet we can't help it.  Our minds do want to make sense of the event.  Flashes of the event thus push themselves into our consciousness, begging for recognition.  Although we do not want to think about the trauma, the trauma will not leave us alone because it must be integrated.  We do need to understand what went wrong and how similar disasters might be avoided.  If we cannot get such an understanding, we're likely to feel we're damned to experiencing the same trauma again and again.  That is the essence of PTSD.  The traumatic experience is both impossible to remember or integrate, and impossible to forget or avoid.

	So we avoid the pain by avoiding memories and thoughts about the trauma.  We attempt to avoid anything that reminds us of the trauma.  Yet reminders are everywhere.  Colors, sounds, smells, and all sorts of familiar everyday occurrences make us think and feel about the trauma.  Anything that could remind us of the trauma brings back a flood of thoughts and memories.  We busy ourselves so our mind can't possibly let thoughts or feelings related to the trauma bother us.  But as soon as our defenses are down, when we're not so busy, thoughts push their way into our minds.  Our defenses are always down when we sleep, and nightmares related to the trauma begin to plague us.  

	When we're supposed to be at our most relaxed, instead we find ourselves in hyper-vigilant states, watching out for anything that might hurt us.  In fact, quite often, because we have not properly integrated our trauma into our understanding of life, we start to generalize our traumatized state to areas that are completely unrelated to the initial trauma.  We start to be on edge all the time.  We can become hyper-vigilant to the point that we become paranoid.  Now, because we have not integrated our traumatic experience, the trauma sneaks into our way of being in the world.  We are avoiding all sorts of things.   We're irritable, tense, often paranoid and angry.  Now, because we have generalized our emotional state to all our experiences, the trauma in effect, has us avoiding relationships altogether.   

	In spite of how much we love our loved one's, it's often our relationships that suffer more than any other area of our lives.  Those closest to us are typically those who see us at our worst.  Unfortunately, the anger we feel about how unfair things are, or the anger that simply derives from feeling so tense, is often aimed the most at those at home.  Suspicion leads to lack of trust.  Simultaneously, the confusion of someone with PTSD often leads to their need for immediate gratification.  Family members rarely understand the need of the afflicted family member to have some sense of control which might permit them to feel things are not in complete chaos.  In short, trauma creates a complete mess, not just for the individual who develops PTSD but also for his entire family.

	It is also typical that a person with PTSD gets no treatment whatsoever.  Because they are paranoid and avoiding the pain of the trauma, someone with PTSD often has no desire to visit a complete stranger for the purpose of confronting their problems.  It is far more likely that they will become increasingly withdrawn and find various ways to escape even from themselves.  Substances or behaviors that help numb the pain of the trauma are sought and often result in addictions.  Anything is better than experiencing the feelings and recalling the events of a serious trauma.  When the victim of PTSD does not seek help, their problems often fester within their hearts and minds and dissolve their relationships, and all too often, the trauma ruins their life.   

	There is hope, however.  Treatment for trauma generally focuses on helping people integrate the traumatic response in spite of the pain involved.  Talk therapies, hypnosis and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing) help individuals combine the meanings they have derived from the trauma, with their memories, emotions, and body feelings.  It is remarkable how often traumatized individuals have taken the trauma to mean they are responsible for the pain of others, or have no one who cares about them, or that they just have bad luck.  Others will think the trauma happened for a reason.  If the trauma occurred at the hands of a loved one, they'll think the trauma was related to their behavior or that it showed them who they really are, or who they will always be.  Treatments for PTSD help people see how memory involving the trauma is associated with body sensations as well as painful, but irrational, feelings.  

	In the absence of, or in addition to, interpersonal psychotherapy, writing can provide huge relief (please see article, The Writing Cure).  Strangely, this simple tool can help a person get feelings, thoughts, and body sensations out of one's mind and onto paper.  The desire for integration in the mind pushes thoughts and memories into consciousness almost as if there's fear the the thoughts and memories will be forgotten.  In fact, in the case of PTSD, the mind is trying to forget that which must be remembered.  But when things are written down, the mind can start to work through the complications of the trauma.  An individual should specifically attempt to remember every detail – everything said, all the colors and movement, shading, textures, times of day, sensations, smells, tensions, stresses, tastes, emotions.  One can also try to remember the beliefs these feelings and sensations bring them to and how the feelings make them view their role in the world.  When it seems there may not be any more to write, any other thought evoked should also be written down.  Writing makes the mind know that what must be integrated has been acknowledged.  As long as the information is all written down, the mind often finds much less need to repeat the experiences, almost as if the mind believes the trauma has been integrated simply because it is written down.  

	Although trauma can be psychologically devastating, and can lead to a short-circuit in normal functioning as painful memories are avoided and integration of experience is prevented, it need not always be a completely life-changing event.  Treatments for trauma are very effective and are often relatively accessible.  In the absence of treatment, some individuals can treat themselves with focused writing, or can find that expressing their feelings to friends is not as unacceptable as they might have thought.  There is great hope for those with PTSD even though a lack of treatment can lead to a lifetime of avoidance and withdrawal.  With proper help, the splintered life of the trauma victim can be rebuilt so that pain is no longer considered impossible to face, and integration of experience can lead to a newly integrated life.  In recovery from trauma, the victim of PTSD puts life back in perspective, opens up to new possibilities, and begins to develop new relationships.  With recovery, the traumatic experience is integrated and the pain it inflicted, although remembered, is no longer overwhelming.  Often, then, the traumatic experience can be utilized in helping one relate to others who have also experienced trauma, and can actually thus make a person a more connected individual than ever.  With treatment, once traumatic memories are successfully integrated, what was once horrifically traumatizing is reduced in intensity to a powerful learning experience, and that age-old adage is often true, “what doesn't kill you, can make you stronger.”"

Emotional and psychological trauma recovery tips

Recovering from emotional and psychological trauma takes time. Give yourself time to heal and to mourn the losses you’ve experienced. Don’t try to force the healing process. Be patient with the pace of recovery. Finally, be prepared for difficult and volatile emotions. Allow yourself to feel whatever you’re feeling without judgment or guilt.

Trauma self-help strategy 1: Don’t isolate

Following a trauma, you may want to withdraw from others, but isolation makes things worse. Connecting to others will help you heal, so make an effort to maintain your relationships and avoid spending too much time alone.

Ask for support. It’s important to talk about your feelings and ask for the help you need. Turn to a trusted family member, friend, counselor, or clergyman.

Participate in social activities, even if you don’t feel like it. Do “normal” things with other people, things that have nothing to do with the traumatic experience. If you’ve retreated from relationships that were once important to you, make the effort to reconnect.

Join a support group for trauma survivors. Being with others who are facing the same problems can help reduce your sense of isolation and hearing how others cope can help inspire you.

Volunteer. As well as helping others, volunteering can be a great way to challenge the sense of helplessness that often accompanies trauma. Remind yourself of your strengths and reclaim your sense of power by comforting or helping others.


Trauma self-help strategy 2: Stay grounded

In order to stay grounded after a trauma, it helps to have a structured schedule to follow.

Stick to a daily routine, with regular times for waking, sleeping, eating, working, and exercise. Make sure to schedule time for relaxing and social activities, too.
Break large jobs into smaller, manageable tasks. Take pleasure from the accomplishment of achieving something, even it’s a small thing.
Find activities that make you feel better and keep your mind occupied (reading, taking a class, cooking, playing with your kids or pets), so you’re not dedicating all your energy and attention to focusing on the traumatic experience.
Allow yourself to feel what you feel when you feel it. Acknowledge your feelings about the trauma as they arise and accept them. Accepting your feelings is part of the grieving process and is necessary for healing.
Staying grounded: A trauma self-help exercise
If you are feeling disoriented, confused, or upset, you can do the following exercise:

Sit on a chair. Feel your feet on the ground. Press on your thighs. Feel your behind on the seat and your back against the chair.
Look around you and pick six objects that have red or blue. This should allow you to feel in the present, more grounded, and in your body. Notice how your breath gets deeper and calmer.
You may want to go outdoors and find a peaceful place to sit on the grass. As you do, feel how your body can be held and supported by the ground.


Trauma self-help strategy 3: Take care of your health

A healthy body increases your ability to cope with stress from a trauma.

Get plenty of sleep. After a traumatic experience, worry or fear may disturb your sleep patterns. A lack of sleep can make your trauma symptoms worse and make it harder to maintain your emotional balance. Go to sleep and get up at the same time each day and aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night.
Avoid alcohol and drugs as their use can worsen your trauma symptoms and exacerbate feelings of depression, anxiety, and isolation.
Exercise regularly. Regular exercise boosts serotonin, endorphins, and other feel-good brain chemicals. It also boosts self-esteem and helps to improve sleep. For maximum results, aim for 30 to 60 minutes of activity on most days.
Eat a well-balanced diet. Eating small, well-balanced meals throughout the day will help you keep your energy up and minimize mood swings. While you may be drawn to sugary foods for the quick boost they provide, complex carbohydrates are a better choice. Foods rich in certain omega-3 fats—such as salmon, walnuts, soybeans, and flaxseeds—can give your mood a boost.
Reduce stress. Making time for rest and relaxation will help you bring your life back into balance. Try relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Schedule time for activities that bring you joy—favorite hobbies or activities with friends, for example."
561,"Out of the FOG - Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD)

Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) is a condition that results from chronic or long-term exposure to emotional trauma over which a victim has little or no control and from which there is little or no hope of escape, such as in cases of:

562,"Hi guys

Where to start with this post....

Well i guess starting at the beginning is a good way to go.  My 1st 7 years of life was very good, my parents were very much in love, and while we didn't have a lot financially speaking, as a family we couldn't be happier.  I have many happy memory from my early years, i was always happy and laughing, i had an adventurous spirit and was always happiest while out and about exploring the local countryside, other than playing with toys indoors.  

Then it all went wrong - my parents divorced when i was 7, my mother remarried within a year to a younger man who was mentally unstable and abusive with it, so i decided to move in with my dad.  The problem being my father was also mentally unstable having endured cruel psychological abuse from earliest childhood at the hands of his mother.  My parents were childhood sweethearts and got married age 16 due to my mother falling pregnant with my older sister.  In the early years, my mother told me that my dad used to suffer with anxiety problems and was put on librium and vallium for some time.  My living memories of my dad was that he was outwardly confident and well loved within the local community.  Knowing he was well loved in the community made it that much harder to speak out about what happened next.  

He began grooming me - he'd cry on my shoulder over the divorce, let me have a drink with him in the home and treat me more like an adult grown up partner other than the 7-8 year old child that i was.  One night, we'd been watching tv in his room, and being the fun loving mischievous child that i was i thought it would be fun if i pretended i was sleeping when it was time to move me into my own bed.  What a mistake that was.  He began touching and kissing my chest, his hand also went up the inside of my legs - but thankfully that night it stopped right there.  When he stopped i began crying and pretended i'd just woken up from a nightmare about my guinea pig being run over - my guinea pig was the first birthday present my father got me after moving out of home and my step father had recently made me give him away due to me not cleaning out his hutch as often as i should have.  I remember that first time clearly, and i am aware that i was abused regularly perhaps every night until my teens - but my memory kind of jumps from that first time, with the odd flash of a memory in between - but nothing clear until my early teens.  I have no recollection of the first time anything full on happened, and therefore i don't know what it's like to lose my virginity - maybe it's a good thing that my mind blocked that out at the time - but now i think it's about time i was able to access these banished memories in order to deal with them and move on once and for all.  My mother finally divorced her second husband when i was 15 and i was able to move back home with her.  2 years later my father died aged 38 of a rare disease - amyloidosis.  We all grieved for him - i hadn't spoke out about what he'd done to me, and we love our parents unconditionally - so yes when he died as a family we were devastated, and even now all these years later i find death difficult to deal with as it always takes me back to that point in time.  

I do however feel lucky that he died when i was still young, as i was finally able to speak out about what he'd done.  I was very lucky and found my best friend who was physically abused as a child and also suffering with what i can now see as complex post traumatic stress.  He was studying psychology at uni while i was studying it at a-level and we must have spent thousands of hours over the years discussing it both academically and personally in our attempt to come to terms with our youth.  Unfortunately for my friend, he went on to encounter institutional abuse within the services while volunteering at various organisations while studying - he became aware of a paedophile ring who were using the voluntary organisations to access under 16's in order to get them prostituting the streets.  There were other things too he brought to light and ended up losing his career in a massive whistleblowing case resulting in a doctor losing his license among other things, but no action was ever taken with regard to the girls as they wouldn't give a statement.  That was over a decade ago now, but my friend could never get any peace from it and i think what killed him in the end was knowing there were still people out there suffering but last year he lost his fight and he took his own life.  We have both been mistreated by the NHS, we have both been actively seeking help since our teens, yet neither of us were ever diagnosed with C-PTSD, instead being diagnosed with the symptoms such as anxiety and depression and offered tablets such as prozac to be dumped on them unsupervised for years.  I believe my friend went on to develop more serious delusional mental health issues - what was real over a decade ago - i.e. the death threats while giving his evidence, was no longer real all these years later but he thought it was still happening now.  I wasn't aware he'd been put on anti-psychotics, or that he'd stopped taking them before he died - but he was let down in the end by social services - his social worker was on holiday at the time and no one else would take on the case - it was too late by the time his social worker was back from holiday as he'd already died by then.

Why are we being let down so badly - why is it so difficult to get a correct and proper diagnosis, and subsequent appropriate treatment?

My own experience with the medical services isn't great either.  I was sent as an outpatient in my late teens to our local mental health hospital - i was seen by a psychiatrist who put me on prozac and diagnosed me with anxiety.  My own gp is less than useless as i feel most of the time he thinks i'm just making it up.  I also seen a psychiatric nurse in my late teens - just after returning from a service user led forum entitled breaking the silence - all about survivors of child sexual abuse and their negative experiences of the medical services.  Of course the nurse wasn't too pleased when i started telling her all about it and in the end she got so aggressive with me that i had to leave in floods of tears.  The prozac must have worked a little when i first took them, as i was able to get a proper job working for benefit fraud and i was doing ok for my first 6 months.  Then i think the tablets were becoming less effective and in the end i decided to come off them on my own.  My working relationships suffered as a result and in the end i was bullied out of there - well i handed in my notice to move to ibiza with a moroccan lad - but it was  a case of walk or be pushed.  I came home from sunny ibiza not too long after when it didn't work out there, still not feeling well i returned to my doctors where i was offered 6 hours of cognitive therapy.  The result of this is that i should go to uni and find my self esteem there.  I did go to uni - but had no help or support at all.  I tried prozac again, and i also tried citalopram - elevated doses of both but i found they done nothing to help with my symptoms and only made me feel physically ill.  I had full on panic attacks the whole time i was studying - it was worse while on my placement year in my local authority - having to rush out of official inspections due to sweating and shaking uncontrollably and feeling sick.  I felt very isolated and alone and very much judged by my colleagues for my panic attacks.  I already felt judged and victimised because of them by the vast majority of my fellow students too - but that year out was so isolating.  One of the lads on the course had been diagnosed with lymphoma that year - we were friendly in uni and he was one of the few who didn't judge me - i used to call him up a lot to see how he was doing and i remember feeling that i wish i could have just swapped places with him as he had so much more to offer our chosen profession than i ever could.  Sadly, he lost his fight at the end of that year, but i still wish it could have been me and not him.  

I tried getting help in uni - they were marvelous once i told them what i was dealing with - granted me extensions, tried to get me funding so student services could give me lots of support - but my doctor wrote just a single sentence when i asked him to write a letter on my behalf - nowhere near enough to get me the funding and additional support.  Long and the short of it i didn't end up graduating - i got as far as the end of my final year gaining many 1sts and 2:1's along the way - what i didn't do however was one final piece of coursework and one dissertation.  Failing at the last hurdle like that almost destroyed me - i should have graduated in 2009 - ever since i have been in a state of severe depression - i still have regular panic attacks and just feel so vulnerable all the time.  I don't feel capable of work with such symptoms so i am trying to live on just £100 a week.  My C-PTSD also affects my personal relationships - i have not had a relationship since that moroccan lad in my early 20's as i don't deal with emotional issues as an adult - i deal with them as a child and i can't go through another bad relationship.  Also i have isolated myself from all my old friends - the one i lost last year was the only one i really stayed in touch with - however this year i have been in touch with an old girl friend from school and i spend an evening a week with her and her family catching up on the good old days.  I feel this is doing me some good, although i worry that i may mess things up there as i have found myself having to bite my tongue a few times and hold back this aggression which is building up and getting worse as the years go by.  It doesn't take a lot to anger me these days - although hormones are also getting worse with age so could be related to that.

Anyway - after failing at uni, and after the full year of counseling with new pathways didn't get anywhere, i went back to my doctor who referred me to a community mental health board - a psychiatric nurse and a social worker.  After asking me a series of closed questions the nurse told me that basically as i wasn't delusional or insane there was nothing wrong with me and they couldn't help me.  With my life being completely crippled by my still undiagnosed C-PTSD i broke down at this news sobbed like a baby and then i was shocked when the nurse got very aggressive with me - accused me of being aggressive through my tears - told me she would refer me to a psychologist for a second opinion if i wanted - which i said yes please.  However she continued with her aggressive stance, escalating the situation until in the end i had no choice to leave in floods of tears again and she never referred me for that second opinion.  I cannot believe how unprofessional this nurse was - the social worker looked very shocked by it all too - i should have complained but we never do when we feel so shit about ourselves - even if i was being aggressive through my tears well aggression is a symptom of ptsd so there is no way the nurse should have responded with aggression back.  After this experience i gave up on the medical services believing there is no help out there.  I escaped to the dark world of BDSM instead in search of a dominant male partner - if i could just find a nice old fashioned honourable dom out there then i could surrender myself to them and let them shape my life for me and teach me to be a whole person - i could be safe at last.  The problem with that is that there is only about 1% of the good old fashioned honourable type out there - the rest are just in it for themselves and seeking to take advantage.  For over 2 years i was in touch via skype and phone to someone who claimed they were a dom.  For over 2 years he played me good and proper - i thought i was in love with him but i can see now i only felt that way because of the game he was playing.  I strongly believe he is some kind of human trafficker - he was attempting to groom me into accepting abuse and no limits - he was an extremely intellectual individual and was very clever in the games he played - being mr nice guy for at least 6 months making me feel like i could trust him as he was so open minded and wouldn't judge me - i told him things i never even told my counselor.  Then things changed and he became a completely different person - trying to bully phone sex out of me but not just normal phone sex either but repeating back disgusting things around my abuse.  He'd told me he could help me, had helped others in the past by kind of reliving it but to be shown love and respect for doing so - that counseling would never work but his method had healed people.  I finally woke up to his games when chatting online to a trained therapist (also dom seeking d/s as a lifestyle) who pointed out this other guys behaviour was your classic text book abuser - so i read up on abuser profiles and particularly with adult grooming for abuse - and yes it was all there.  I also read up on narcissism and sociopathy and yes the signs were there for those too.  This whole experience has led me to go back to my doctors and continue with my fight for diagnosis and correct treatment - knowing i'm still vulnerable to grooming even as an adult has made me feel even more vulnerable, and i don't want to be vulnerable anymore.  I have returned to my doctor who told me he was referring me to a psychiatrist - however when my letter came it looks like it will just be another meeting like i had before - kind of like triage for mental health.  Given that i've had such negative experiences in the past with psychiatric nurses i'm a little nervous about my upcoming appointment.  My appointment is thursday this week - i don't know how i'll cope if they just tell me the same as they did last time.  I have no life at all, i'm 35 tomorrow and still living at home with my mother.  I am unable to work due to my panic attacks and as previously stated have no emotional life to speak of either - yesterday i almost self harmed, i am suicidal the majority of the time and am finding such feelings just get worse with age - it's not hard to see why my friend ended his life in his 35th year - this is around the time when you wake up and realise you're middle aged and still no life to speak of.

How do i go about getting this condition diagnosed, and how do i go about getting the right treatment - i am a little worried looking at the nhs leaflets as they like to treat it with CBT (which i've already had a little of) and EMDR - i have an old school friend who is also a psychiatric nurse and she seems to think this EMDR is a good treatment, more effective than regression therapy and far less time to wait - but personally i really feel that it is my unconscious mind which is holding me back and where all my troubles are coming from - i'd be a lot happier if i could confront my unconcious mind once and for all other than to bypass it with this EMDR - i guess i'm worried if i bypass it then one day it may rear it's ugly head once more.

Any advice would be much appreciated - thanks for taking the time to read my post.

568,"Common anesthetic procedure dramatically improves well being of veterans with PTSD

A single application of a common anesthetic procedure could be the answer to alleviating anxiety, depression and psychological pain in those suffering from chronic, extreme post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

In a study presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY™ 2014 annual meeting, researchers followed 12 patients with PTSD who had undergone a simple anesthetic procedure called a stellate ganglion block (SGB). This common procedure involves injecting a small amount of local anesthesia into the base of the neck. SGB is traditionally used to treat a variety of conditions, from pain syndromes to sleep disorders.

""While it doesn't cure the problem, we found that SGB appears to be a fast-acting and effective long-term treatment for chronic, extreme PTSD in veterans,"" said Michael T. Alkire, M.D., staff anesthesiologist at the Long Beach VA Healthcare System in California. ""These improvements far outlasted what we would expect from SGB, which is usually used as a temporary nerve block and typically lasts three to five hours.""

In the study, the patients each were given one SGB and followed closely with structured interviews and other psychological tests for six months after treatment. The positive effects of the SGB were evident often within minutes and resulted in significant improvement of scores for the Clinician Administered PTSD Score, or CAPS, the test used to measure the severity of PTSD.

Symptoms improved over time, and after one month, CAPS scores registered normal to mild PTSD levels for most of the patients. Positive effects were still seen at three months, but began fading and were generally gone by six months. Overall, 75 percent of the participants reported significant improvement of their PTSD symptoms after the SGB.

Data from the study further suggested that SGB might also be an effective initial treatment for depression and anxiety disorders.

""Further work is needed to identify which patients might respond best to this treatment as well as understand the mechanisms involved that produce such a rapid, dramatic and long-term change in psychological health for some patients,"" said Dr. Alkire, who also is a professor of anesthesiology at the University of California-Irvine.

569,"Ever thought about it ....? My parents lived through it. My Dad fought through it. That generation's slowly and quietly peeling away now, of course. Another decade and they'll be hard to find.

But, to those of us now in our fifties, or older? They were our parents. And, how the hell did they do it?

First world war? Crack up and they shot ye. Viet Nam? The penny dropped and they realised personal experiences of abject horror could mess with ye mind. In between times though? WW2? Ye just got demobbed and went home. Faaaark!!! 

 Just think about that for a minute, eh? No One offered ye counselling or medication. No one even had the slightest concept of how ye brain might have been boiling inside ye head. Ye just came home and had to carry on.

Oh; And ye wife hadn't seen ye for maybe six years. Ye kids may Never have any recall of having seen ye. They were babies when ye left to do ye bit. Now, here ye are:

Ye mind's doing back flips, screaming as it does. Ye kids are horrified that this 'Stranger' has suddenly walked into their lives and is ordering them around. Ye wife, who's had to do Everything. Play every role the household threw up, for Six Years, is now expected to step down and let the man of the house take over his proper role. Just like that.

And that's you. And ye have PTSD. But, no such thing even exists. So ye just have ye own head to deal with. The mood swings. The flash backs. The screwing ye eyes up and turning ye face away as ye mind Screams in torment of the relived horrors!

But, Men didn't cry, in those days. Men 'Pulled themselves together'. Men 'Carried On'. 

And let's not ignore the women. They brought their children through rationing. Bombing. Isolation. Day in, day out, monumental pressures. 

And, by christ; They became our Parents! How in hell did they just put up with what they must have been going through? And remember; All they'd have understood of it was that some heavy shit was going down inside their heads.

Amazing. Thought provoking. Humbling.

570,":) I can't believe it's taken me this long to find this place! For years now, I've not discussed my PTSD with anyone. 

I usually become enraged, when some doughnut starts a thread about PTSD on the General Chat board of any forum. Because, it always swiftly fills up with 'Experts' on the subject. None of which actually have it!

I've had it for years now. About as long as I've had a computer. And only last bloody night did it finally dawn on me to type "" PTSD Forum "" into Google! :doh2: I mean, there's thick. There's totally retarded. Then there's me! 

Anyway, I found several. Just looked them over. This looks like the one I'll fit best with. God, the relief! An entire, very active forum full of people who know Exactly what it's like! Just unbelievable! :clap:

Right; I'm off, to level out again. I'll be back presently. I see I have seventeen pages to look through. That'll set me off! Bet I'm in for a truly great time!

Did ye know that Rabies ~ of all things ~ is also known as "" The Running Disease "" ? That's because the animal ~ not having access to anyone capable of telling it WTF is going on, simply follows its instinct, and tries to run away from the shit going on in it's head.

Did You run? I know I sure as hell did. Away from the place I got it. Then just plain away from People. I now live, as pretty much a recluse, in the middle of nowhere. 

I go into town, for a few hours, once a week. Half those hours I probably spend wandering from my base, in the pub, to various shops and back. More exercise than I get in a week then :rolleyes:

But, what about the Rest of my week? Largely sat here. Getting older. Waiting for my Heart Attack!

So; Treadmill of life? 

What ye reckon? I Do know ye shouldn't exercise first thing! Hell no! Up at seven thirty? F**k yeself around? Dead by ten thirty! F**k That!

I just read that little bursts are better too. Five minutes, here and there. Rather than a one off, daily marathon.

I'm seriously considering getting a treadmill. I could put a decent track on You Tube. Drag my mill over. Walk in time to the music as I look at the screen. What's to not like about that?

Do it while the kettle boils. The dinner micro waves. The Dogs eat their dinners. All those times we'd other wise just stand around.

And, let's face it; We DO 'stand around', don't we? Preoccupation of the head slows the body down. We stay at home. How many of ye longer termmers are relating to what I'm saying here, eh?

F**k this! I used to be physically active as all hell! I'd basically drag my Dog all over the place, miles and miles, just going about my day to day peregrinations through the city. Dog was Ripped! Couldn't have been bad myself.

Now? No where to go. Got a computer and a beer gut. Dogs drag me up the f**king track and back. Four hundred yards. That's me for the day.

F**k this. I have a clutcher just waiting in the queue to reach me! Tread Mill? Rowing machines are for c***s and rowers. Exercise Bike? Get a f**king bike! Go somewhere!

What ye reckon? I'm getting too much like Elvis. I'd rather be back to :dance:"

October 22, 2013

Research from UCLA finds that rats exposed to early life trauma showed aberrations  of stress hormones, receptors in the amygdala, and inhibited or avoidant behavior, without indications of remembering the specific trauma (foot shock) they had experienced. The researchers conclude “traumatic experience during developmental periods of hippocampal immaturity can promote lifelong changes in symptoms and neuropathology associated with human PTSD even if there is no explicit memory of the early trauma.”

The only note he wrote was, ""cremation preferred"". His parents buried him in the clothes he died in and gave him no headstone. I visited his grave when I was 15 but the cemetery didn't know exactly where he was. We ended up kneeling on the grass hoping we were near him.

When I got mine, (PTSD) the GP they sent out to take a look at me was human. She was also a few years younger than me. And, quite frankly, bloody nice looking!

I'm happy to report though that, due to the state I was in, and my respect for the nature of our relationship, I never allowed the :drool: factor to rear its head.

 I just quietly appreciated the fact that spending five minutes across the desk from her was somewhat more rewarding than looking at a sixty year old man. She was nice to look at. And her manner was nice too. Yeah; I really liked her :)

Then, one day, I'm turning up for my latest appointment. I was just walking across the surgery car park. Lovely, sunny day. When, a little, red, open topped sports car came whizzing in and shot past me.

There she was, Cath' (As I'd heard her colleagues call her). Young. Attractive. Long hair streaming in the wind. And I couldn't quite believe it when she cheerily called out; "" Hullo, Darling! "" :eek:

Less than ten minutes later, behind her desk? She was the consummate Professional. Watching. Listening. Nodding. I was her patient.

But, I swear to god; I'll raise a smile, on my death bed, looking back to that quite stunningly beautiful moment. When my ~ off duty ~ Doctor just flashed me that breath taking little snap shot glimpse of her own humanity.

I thought I would just share my experiences, hopefully finding someone who can relate. Maybe someone who can explain why I reacted the way I did, I don't know, I feel like my past hasn't been put to rest, maybe opening up to strangers could help. 

I grew up in a family where both parents were alcoholics, I have deeply scarring memories of the police being round constantly and hearing my mum screaming for help. But she would always be taken away.
As a little girl I was very shy and timid and didn't know what to do in these situations but beg my parents to split up. Not many children want their parents to, but I did. As alcoholics, they could be very abusive towards me, calling me names to physical abuse.

Any way things ended badly and my mum was taken away for 9 months, through my birthday and Christmas. I was surrounded by social services, and wasn't going to school because everyone was talking about me and my family. 
I was bullied terribly and people kept asking me about ""what actually happened"".
Not only that I was an early developer and had terrible acne, and was bullied for being fat when I was ""shapely"". My family were poor and I was ridiculed for that. 
Swimming was an issue and the teacher was awful to me about why I wouldn't go swimming, and I wonder why...

I was very withdrawn and depressed. Kids can be so evil.
On the other side, I gained attention from older guys, who I wanted to impress by being ""promiscuous"" and trying to gain their attention that way, because my looks and crazy/quiet personality didn't do it for them. 
I remember becoming withdrawn again, feeling even more insecure. I was still getting bullied for the reasons above, plus being a ""slut"".
I just wanted to shut myself off from the world, and literally became a hermit for about two years, doing absolutely nothing apart from obsessing over my looks. I would scrub my face trying to get rid of my acne and starve myself. Makeup would take me hours to do and would always end in a hissy fit trying to get it right. I was diagnosed with ""BDD"". And put on anti depressants. 

After a good few years, I started to feel lonely.
I started talking to some ""friends"" from the past, one day and started hanging around with them, they were into drugs and alcohol, therefore I got into that. Although my first drink was at 10 after stealing my mums vodka. 

I become very and I mean very crazy after doing drugs an drinking. And angry and suicidal, everyone thought I was bipolar, but I knew I wasn't, it was the drugs. I was loosing weight and literally looked like a tramp. A homeless person. Things got so bad I knew I was either going to end up in jail, hospital or dead. One day I took an over dose and self harmed badly after a heavy night, and had to be restrained. After that I remember waking up, puking my guts out in hospital. 

I decided to stop all of it. Absolutely stop. Stop being with these people, who were abusive, and the reason I got so wound up. But I can't blame them for being abusive.. I was crazy, and out of order, and my actual true friends had had enough of me.

I became withdrawn again, and I replaced alcohol and heavy drugs for cannabis, I was again a hermit for another year.

One day I was offered the chance to go study. I was totally sure I wasn't going to do this. I can tell you, it was the best opportunity I took up, boys loved me, I mean like really wanted to date me! I was respected by the girls in my class and even the teachers. I was so happy and felt the most stable in a long time that I could even come off my tablets. 

Right.
After college a lot of my problems went away, apart from getting into a crap job which I obviously no longer work at! I've had a few ""episodes"" since then, but when I was younger everything just happened all at once. 

I could go on, but I don't want to go into too much detail about certain things. They are just too graphic and I'm just too ashamed to mention. 

Anyway, I now have a wonderful boyfriend, a beautiful home and my dream job. I mean, I have everything I wanted. I'm into meditation and have become a spiritual person after my experiences. But I can't get over it. I cannot, I get flash backs still, and nightmares. I guess sometimes trauma in childhood can really affect adulthood."
579,I am seeing an eye surgeon this morning. I'm having a lot of anxiety about it. I think I have PTSD from several surgeries as a child immediately after my dad's suicide. Not only was I emotionally traumatized already but my mother was very histrionic and before each surgery she would sob and tell me she was afraid I wouldn't survive each surgery. This terrified me. I was only seven so I believed her hysteria and it made the surgeries so much harder. That child in me still feels so scared when I've had surgery as an adult. Now I'm facing it again and I feel very anxious.
580,How does one know if they have it or not? Can it also be very minor as in symptoms only occur when a certain sound or image bring on a flashback meaning a veteran won't go off when he hears a gunshot unless it is fired by a specific gun model? I keep wondering if my time and the emotional and verbal abuse I endured for years from her has given me some PTSD because I tend to not like my apartment to be too clean beacuse she'd force me to redo things over and over again until it was to her standards which it NEVER was.
581,":cry:

 Cry from a teenage girl, regarding her Armed Forces boyfriend, who's begun exhibiting PTSD.

It's a long dead post. Five years ago. Those words are the last spoken on it. Clicky.

God; Is there Anyone here that doesn't resonate with? We become unrecognisable to our own blood. Yeah? My own old dear said the same. That she couldn't recognise her own son in the man I'd become since "" The Incident "" :low:

Grim.

Well, that's me suitably bummered. (Why do we do this to ourselves? <Disclaimer ~ I'm Not suggesting everyone's experiences are the same. Just saying>) Now, to go and do something more uplifting .....

582,"I'm having very bad flashbacks. I've written them down but they're still there. I'm very upset. 

I'm afraid of it happening again..."
583,"What it says, really.  
Had various ongoing lower level traumas (eg. social ostracism from v young age, bullying) aand basically learnt to keep it inside, please everybody, etc.  Didn't do very well at this so got into trouble for crying too.  As a pre-teen and teen lived in a 'walking on eggshells' environment where my dad would fly off the handle, mum was unwell (mental and physical) so looked after siblings even as I fell apart.  
When the shouting happened it was like being stabbed in the chest and would take my breath away, like falling, complete terror couldn't see straight.  Spent my time trying to avoid this happening and please everyone.  

Carried on like this until age 19 (left home at 18) when I was still getting these 'attacks' randomly despite no apparent trigger anymore, also had abusive boyfriend by this stage and was generally depressed.  As I couldnt hold down a job I went to GP to ask about counselling.  Thought NHS would provide help and support and kind smiley nurses/therapists - huh!  

Was then referred to CMHT where I was given a CPN who never saw me and told me to grow up when I felt suicidal.  Various very distressing and overwhelming things (violence, homelessness) happened that they saw my reaction to as 'overreacting'.  I was offered no treatment and when I asked they avoided the question.  The police used to check I was alive and drag me to the hospital or lock me in cells to be mocked by the crisis team.  I was criminalised for standing up for myself (non-violently) at the bullying ways and verbal abuse of the MH team.  

After a year or so I found out I'd be diagnosed BPD (right at the start by someone not qualified to do so, and without enough symptoms... the symptoms worsened after I asked for help, but what do you expect if no help comes?  And still my symptoms were stuff like 'anger' - totally reasonable in the circumstances!)  This was pre- BPD being treated as a mental illness and meant exclusion from entire system and surrounding services, including council homelessness services, I was asked to leave a homeless hostel onto the street on one occasion, as the CMHT said I wasn't to be deemed 'priority', in fact on another occasion (aged just 20) they said I wasn't mentally ill.  

Sorry thats a bit rambly... sorry if I sound needly and pathetic... believe me I have kept fighting... and there's been some beautiful joy too... I have achieved some of the things I fought for though lost so much in other ways... it's ten years since I first sought help now, with various levels of functioning in that time, had a sort of complete breakdown 4 yrs ago and haven't worked since (it's as if I somehow was so frightened I kept carrying on until I just couldn't anymore).  

Anyway in the past four years since that breakdown, and in  new geographical area, the CMHT have misled, lied, buck-passed, discharged repeatedly and ignored referrals. Eventually I was offered private therapy paid by family member.  

CMHT, after speaking to someone higher up who actually has a soul, have offered DBT skills training alongside.  However I have no diagnosis at present as far as I know - BUT BPD might be there.  I think it's c-PTSD as fit that in a nutshell, whereas BPD I only almost fit if you willfully manipulate and misinterpret things subjectively to get that diagnosis...

I feel I should add, I'm in crisis now, the nightmares and memories are almost non-stop at the moment, things haave been going downhill for the last week or so.  I can't call the crisis team (have tried and they just say not to worry, will be in DBT group soon, and refuse to speak to me).  I dont have a CPN and have been told in no uncertain terms I won't get one/don't need one.  My GP is lovely but can't do anything except talk to me and I feel awful taking up emergency appointments for that.  The urges to harm myself are very strong, even though that is not usually a problem for me.  

Argh... the diagnosis is why I posted here, thats what I want to know, please dont focus on the current crisis part, just had to tell someone."
584,"Cannabis prevents negative behavioral, physiological effects of traumatic events, rat study shows

Administering synthetic marijuana (cannabinoids) soon after a traumatic event can prevent PTSD-like (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms in rats, caused by the trauma and by trauma reminders. This is according to a new study conducted by Nachshon Korem and Irit Akirav of the Department of Psychology at the University of Haifa, which was published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology. ""The importance of this study is that it contributes to the understanding of the brain basis of the positive effect cannabis has on PTSD and thus supports the necessity to perform human trials to examine potential ways to prevent the development of PTSD and anxiety disorders in response to a traumatic event,"" the researchers noted.

585,"It's been bad.

Last night I had nightmares to do with my brother, situations that weren't nice.
Very stressful, woke up feeling knackered.
Went back to sleep this afternoon, more nightmares about him.

This evening, my neighbour who's been harassing me for a while with trying to get me to have a conversation and who keeps coming out of his flat whenever I go outside crossed the line.
I went out earlier to go to the supermarket, as I came out he asked me where I was going. He hasn't done this before - it was weird and quite frankly none of his fucking business.
I came back in my car and he came outside walked around the car park with his penis out.
I waited in my car for him to go back inside, he didn't.
I bailed out and let myself into the building as quick as possible without looking at him.

I have called the police and waiting for them to arrive. I hpoe they don't bring up my past mental health stuff and imply that i'm making it up.

I'm really shaking, my whole body is  tense and I want to pass out. Fuck, it's been a fuckng shit 24 hours.
I don't feel real, my muscles are screaming.


I went iinto the refuge to get away from my asshole brother who threatened me sexually when I didn't give him money for alcohol.

Why is my neighbour doing this to me?:sorry:"

588,"Hi everyone

Ive been receiving treatment for anxiety and depression since May following a melt down at work and an attempt suicide back in September.

I have been receiving CBT via the NHS since May and have now had 5 sessions of Focus based CBT having now been diagnosed with complex PTSD.  I am booked in for 15 more CBT sessions and my therapist said yesterday that they will then offer me 20 sessions of EMDR.

Anyway to get to the point...

I have never been the type of person to remember dreams but recently the dreams have become more vivid.  To the extent that I think I have started sleepwalking.

I have woken up staring out of the window (which is something I use to do whilst experiencing my trauma), my husband has also found me sleeping on the stairs while I dont even remember getting out of bed.

Last night I had a very vivid dream where I was back in one of the traumas.  It felt so real, I woke up feeling sick and for that moment I actually think I believed that I was back there and not in a safe place.

I have been taken Citalopram for 2 weeks now could this be a cause of the more vivid dreams or do you think this is just part of the recovery / processing stage of my therapy?

Any thoughts or experiences would be great to hear, feeling confused and lost.

Many thanks Nicki x

590,"I have been diagnosed as suffering with complex PTSD which has been caused through a very complex long going work situation.  

I have been off work since May and am really struggling, the NHS have be absolutely amazing with me and beyond supportive.  They have been giving me Focused based CBT since May which is weekly 90 minute sessions.

I contemplated suicide and took steps to carry out the same late last year and after feeling the same thoughts and actions the doctor has put me on citalopram which hasnt kicked in yet.

Work have been shocking but the occupational health side of work are actually quite good and have sent me to be diagnosed hence the complex ptsd, anxiety and depression.  

Anyway to get to the point they have mentioned EMDR but my counsellor says they wouldnt recommend both EMDR and CBT? Any thoughts on which is best? 

Also any experiences on citalopram. I desperately dont want to feel how i feel i just struggle to see any light at the end of the tunnel?
thanks everyone :scratch::panic::cry2:"
591,"Hello from the UK.  I'm the mother of an 18 year old who has suffered from mental health issues for several years now but I never really considered it until last week.

She had a massive breakdown on Tuesday when a memory popped out of nowhere regarding the incident that caused it, and I looked up the symptoms online (I know, you shouldn't do that but it lead me to be diagnosed with both MS and Fibromyalgia) and it all fits. 

She doesn't wish to talk about the incident that leads us to believe this is the case and I'm worried that our GP may not take us seriously, even though she has had counselling in the past.  Obviously we don't want to straight out say this is what we think it is, but there are too many coincidences for our liking and she obviously needs help as it is causing us both tremendous problems.  

She is willing to get help, but I'm concerned after my many years of knowing something was wrong with me I was still fobbed off until I was able to ask the right questions.

Does anyone have any advice, as I want to help her as much as I can, and I'm worried as she is so badly depressed she has mentioned that she sometimes feels that suicide may be her only option.

Thanks in advance"
592,"I've been having emdr for about a month now and since I've started I've been seriously emotional, to the point where I can't watch the news or music videos because I start crying.
It's doing my head in because I start my access to nursing course next month and I can't be like this in class! I do have bipolar II as well but that's dormant for now I think.
Does anybody know if this is normal for emdr or any tips for stopping my crying? Thanks in advance!"
593,"Just back from trauma therapy. Tough one. Really tough one. Psychotherapist realised that the adult me doesn't know about the prevalence of something and so we looked on the internet and found info and info is there and it's all confusing and I want to step off from this spinning planet right now , just for a while, and it's all rather overwhelming right now. I don't know. Confused. Why do people do bad things? Why do they do them? Why doesn't the adult me know things as the young me needs a strong adult right now. Can't remember last time so dazed. Sorry xx"
594,"After almost 15 months of EMDR to deal with the second of my four traumas, I had a major breakthrough today. Ended up completing letting go and sobbing with my psychotherapist. At the beginning of today's session when she asked me to recall a particular image, I could feel this awful pressure in my stomach and chest, but having then processed the trauma, she asked me again at the end where I could feel the trauma in my body and those physical effects had gone. Tired beyond belief but feeling more free. Still two traumas to work through so a way to go. Feels surreal x"

Had had a positive trauma therapy session yesterday which reflected in a positive shift that has happened....and how it was good that the competent, adult Kate was able to hold the conversation with the therapist rather than vulnerable S emerge. Whilst I was shattered afterwards, I was able to recognise that steps are being taken and that it's good that the therapist is providing positive feedback.

But today, S has taken over with a vengeance. Have felt very weak and was thankfully not at work. CPN recognised struggles and gave me a hug. Felt very stupid and little like a child. And to top it all, I was meant to take my son to a sixth form meeting that I was dreading anyway and the quiet village road between home and there was closed by the police which would have resulted in a massive detour that would have made us embarrassingly late. Of course, I know it's not my fault as I had left ample time but it just feels like the last straw. Am meant to be on an all day course tomo in the middle of London and can't it.....

It's only in the past few weeks where the identity of the different parts of me having become clearer, more defined, named. And I found myself talking as Kate in trauma therapy today, talking about a younger vulnerable part, S. I could see S in the corner of the room who was playing with some toys and I wanted to protect S. S is very vulnerable right now. But, the psychotherapist and I were able to have an adult conversation and all I know from previous sessions over the past 18 months is that I lose my sense of being an adult and that I go quiet and I'm scared and I feel little sitting in the chair and very childlike. Today I wasn't the same person. It was the first time that I could see that child, separate from me, playing in the corner. I really would love S to be happy and am desperate for her to be safe X"

607,"I've been in therapy all my life dealing with the many traumas I experienced as a child and young woman. It has helped me a great deal but I think some traumas can be so severe, the best I can hope for is to have an arsenal of coping methods and accept that I'm going to experience some pain and fear at times. In the past year I have begun talking in my sleep during my frequent nightmares and then the dreams changed. They became so viscerally real,I would respond by screaming,cursing and physically attacking my husband. All while still asleep! He's a big man and manages to get hold of me, desperately shaking me and calling my name to wake me. When I wake up I am terrified, convinced I was being assaulted. It's so disturbing for both of us. Anyone else experience this? My therapist doesn't seem to have an answer other than to talk about it. But the terrors keep coming."
608,"I've been abused sexually for many years, starting when I was just a baby. Of course I not remember this and I didn't even know until last year. I didn't remember it and I have DID so I created these alters to survive. It was by my biological father. I have no contact with him and haven't for thirteen years. I just don't know how to get over this. 

When I was 8, my cousin did some pretty awful things to me. He was 16. I'm not believed about this by my mom. Only Sue believes me that this happened IRL. My mom was watching his three children (I'm 23 and he's almost 31 now). The first day when he picked up the kids I was fine, it didn't affect me. The second day though, I started having really bad flashbacks. To the point that I could feel what was happening to my body. And it was all about him doing those bad things. 

I feel stupid by still being totally terrified of him. I'm terrified that he will do it again. I don't even know if I'm his only victim, he has two sisters and he has a daughter. 

How do you get over something so terrifying?"
609,"Having a seriously bad day and am not coping. Have had a week of dissociating, flashbacks, nightmares and have even emailed my CPN about possibly taking meds which I've been against up to now.

I've had flashbacks for the past few tears but One flashback hadn't made sense because I couldn't place myself there. And today, I dissociated and typed and typed on my laptop and my secrets about what happened many years ago come out and with them coming out, the biggest element came out. The one that links to that flashback. The one that makes the flashback finally make sense. The one that my dissociation had kept suppressed. And the thing that happened is bigger than me.

610,"In case you missed it in the thread title:

TRIGGER WARNING

I'm new here, so for those who aren't aware, I'm 29, male, bipolar 1, and PTSD. Currently medicated with Lithium 900 mg, Prazosin 4 mg, and Vistaril 100 mg (all daily). What I will describe below will be a vague description of sexual trauma that happened to me as a child. By now, those who need to should have had time to bail out on this thread, so let's get into it.

I was six years old when a female relative of mine--several years older but still a child at the time--exposed herself to me, prompted me to expose myself, and encouraged mutual fondling. No intercourse took place, but this scenario occurred from the time I was six to the time I was approximately twelve years old. Two years later, I became involved in a pornography addiction that went from Victoria's Secret catalogs and websites to hardcore BDSM within a week. In the years since, my addiction has explored more severe, deviant behavior that I'd rather not describe here.

My therapist and I began my treatment in March; I was diagnosed and medicated in early May after being hospitalized (voluntarily) for mania with homicidal ideations (images without intent or desire to act on them). I have told my therapist about a few incidents in my childhood where other children touched me, though it was decidedly non-sexual in nature and was likely an issue of kids not understanding boundaries.

I want to tell my therapist about these incidents, but I am still close to the female (in a strictly platonic way) who engaged me in these encounters. I can omit enough information that she would be safe from any legal investigation, but I don't want to omit information necessary for my therapist to help me. I feel that the first of these incidents is vital to the beginning of my PTSD, and these encounters explain why I have certain unusual triggers.

How do I tell my therapist? What do they need to know about what happened?"
611,"After losing my father to cancer, and my grandma to old age, I feel myself wanting to be in close contact with family.  Lately, though, it bothers me when I stop and think about my past, and how my mother has been responsible for a good portion of the trauma in my childhood.  It kills me to think that the woman that I yearn to be in the same town as, and long to spend valuable time with, is the very same woman who used to throw fits, run out in traffic, call me names, yell at me until I was in a fetus position, threaten to kill herself and make me chase her down.  I know I can't hold any of this against her either, but I do feel resentment towards her.  I don't want to resent her.  She is getting old, and I can never be sure how long I have with her.  I've lost two jobs because of my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and I nearly lost my most recent job too.  I've become like my own mother, and I fear what would happen if I ever became a mother.  Would I be just like her?  Would my children grow up to resent me?  With all this being said, how many of you are in close contact with people who caused you trauma?  Do you resent them, and if so, how do you cope with your resentment?"
612,"Hi 

I'm having problems because i cannot keep distracted all day, naturally. I've been reading '8 keys to safe trauma recovery' which was recommended by my previous psychologist. It talks about how time undistracted can send you in a bit of a spin. The author says she used to do some kind of puzzle i cannot remember, to keep her brain busy. I've decided to join this forum to keep my mind busy during this time every day. This is the time of day when i find i can end up having thoughts like 'my life isn't worth living', and similar things like that. I seem to spiral downward pretty easily when i've nothing to do. I feel great panic over it. Does anyone have any experience with this or any tips on how to deal with it.

Many Thanks

613,"I believe that I am stuck with both flashbacks for what is in my mind, and also physical body memories (BM) flashbacks. 

This means that despite all the work I do on my emotional mental problems, at the moment I can't stop the BM flashbacks which are stored in my physical body.

For those who do not understand what a body memory is. It is the trauma that happens to your body whilst whatever traumatic circumstance you are suffering is occuring. A traumatic event may render you unconscious, blacking out to escape the pain say, but the body is still being tortured. 

I have no control over these BM flashbacks. I can suddenly start shaking uncontrollably in any given situation. I also experience body shocks where it feels like I have an electric shock shooting through my body. I know that when I was treated with electric shock therapy in 1972 at some point I was rendered unconscious as my mind tried to escape the pain. I dissociated. 

Dissociation is not always a bad thing. it certainly saved me experiencing the pain, unfortunately no amount of dissociation will stop the body experiencing the pain. 

So there may be a time when you experience feelings in your body that do not make any sense. You don't know what is going on. I had one BM of an excruciating pain and itch im my right forearm. My GP thought it was an allergic reaction to something, but despite all the treatment the pain continued. It wasn't until I realised (it took 10 years) that the pain only appeared in certain stressful situations. When my mind finally realised that the electrodes by which I was shocked in 1972 were attached to my right forearm the pain went away and never came back."

616,"Sorry. I really don't want to trigger anyone reading thus and I truly apologise is advance. My head is full of the most awful thoughts and,in addition, I'm considering what my CPN mentioned yesterday. 

Stuff happened when I was younger which marked the beginnings of my mental health problems. It begins with the letter A but I can't say the word because then it feels real ... But I ended up with 14 years of a serious eating disorder but, after years of thinking life was normal, I had a major trigger about 4 years ago which led to complex PTSD, a return of my eating disorder and a dissociative disorder where I have an 8 year old in me. And this trigger relates to what happened to me age 8-10 and I'm hurting and I don't know how to handle it. And if this wasn't enough, I was attacked seriously in a park aged 19 and I can't say that word beginning with R but I didn't know this person and I had already had an incident in the high street aged 16 where i was sexually molested bit the police couldn't find him. And I wonder what I've done to ask for this. And I'm not coping and my CPN said how I could report the age 8-10 stuff and have it registered and acknowledged by the police but I don't want it investigated as I am scared but I don't know know whether he went on to do it to others and I don't know how to handle these thoughts. And even if I do, I live in a different county and don't know whether I go back to that county. And my CPN is wonderful and I have trauma therapy but I have these thoughts in my head and I don't want to live in my head. And I don't know what to do. I am so sorry for being me. So sorry. What do I do? :'( I have awful flashbacks, nightmares and I disassociate and, as you'll are in my other post, I am holding down a demanding full time job and family and other things too. Tired. Tired. Tired. Tired. Tired

618,"Why Do Women Report Higher Rates of PTSD Than Men?

Men and women are equally vulnerable to factors that can lead to posttraumatic stress (PTSD), such as child abuse, sexual abuse, maltreatment, violence, and natural disasters. However, women report far more cases of PTSD than men and tend to have longer symptom duration. Some speculation regarding this unique dynamic has hinted toward a higher vulnerability to symptoms of PTSD in women. Other factors that could influence the discrepancy in PTSD rates between sexes include type of trauma and the role of the perpetrator. For instance, people who are abused by a caregiver may experience a unique type of trauma known as betrayal trauma. This form of abuse can challenge attachment relationships and cause significant psychological damage unlike that caused by trauma at the hands of strangers or noncaregivers.

In an attempt to better understand why PTSD rates are higher among women than men, Sharon Shin Shin Tang of the Department of Psychology at the University of Oregon recently led a study that evaluated survey responses of more than 1,200 participants gathered from a local college and the surrounding community. She found that betrayal traumas posed the highest risk of PTSD in both men and women, but women exhibited more reexperiencing, anxiety, and depression than men. Overall, the men reported nearly equal amounts of PTSD as the women, which was an unexpected finding.

Upon further examination, Tang found that the women had rates of childhood sexual abuse by someone close that were 45% higher than those of the men, but men had higher rates of physical abuse and witnessed more violence than women. Also of interest were the coping strategies used to deal with the symptoms of PTSD. In particular, this study did not show that women used more avoidance coping than men, as has been demonstrated in previous research. “Additional research is needed in order to understand the potential roles of types of trauma and relationship to the perpetrator may influence PTSD symptom presentation,” Tang said. In sum, these findings suggest that although reported rates of PTSD are higher among women, the effects of trauma may be negatively affecting just as many men as women.

619,"Hello,

As you've most likely already guessed my name is Adam, I'm 19 and I can honestly say I'm yet to have a year which I can truly say that I've been happy.

I'm not yet diagnosed with PTSD but having spoken with a Councillor I've been informed that I display several symptoms of PTSD as well as other anxiety disorders.

I've decided that I'd share on here due to me having one of my 'bad' days (if you can call 6:30am day) which in turn has left me unable to sleep yet again.

I'm sorry for such a long 'intro' post, I don't expect anyone to read it fully, just the thought of being able to tell someone my life with complete anonymity makes me happy enough.

To start off I'll talk about my mum, the only person in my life who I can say has always been there for me and asked for nothing in return, even if it doesn't feel like that at times.

Throughout the years I've basically lost/pushed everyone close to me away due to me fearing emotional attachments to people and even when I've been difficult to love as a child/person my mum has always been there, offering to listen and help in any way she can.. Whether or not I share is a completely different story. My mum blames herself for my life which in turn leaves her emotionally weak in terms of my feelings, if I ever display how I'm feeling it upsets her which in turn leaves me having to keep everything 'bottled up' which you can only do for so long until you explode, and even then when I'm at my lowest/worst I still have to keep everything to myself.

The part that my mum blames herself most for is my dad, for the first 9 years of my life we lived with him and he wasn't a nice person to say at the least. There was forever hostility in the household due to there being a lot of domestic violence, which not only ended at my mum but me too.

My dad was a very controlling person, all it would take to 'set him off' would be 1 word or comment that he didn't like and you'd get a smack. I have memories of him breaking my mum's nose because she threw an already broken remote control out and because I tried to stop him repeatedly hitting my mum the attention was diverted to me which resulted in me getting the belt, which wasn't uncommon. On more than one occasion my back and bum was left blue with bruising because it was never left at one smack or one hit with the belt, if I shouted I'd get hit, if I cried I'd get hit, if my mum tried to stop him we'd both get hit.

On one occasion I went 'too far' away from the house which resulted in me getting dragged back to the house and when I got to the front door my collar was released which left me feeling relieved until he then grabbed my hair and proceeded to slap me.

Around 2 years ago I was at my worst, I was having what I can only describe as a video being played back in my head of me running into the bathroom after hearing my mum screaming only to find my dad trying to drown her in the bath, and there was many more memories very similar, some of which I was the victim other times my mum.

The hold my dad had over me and my mum extended so badly that I was given a phone at the age of 7 for when I was playing out in the park across the road from the house or playing in a friends house so my mum could call me telling me to run back home because my dad was on his way home or in case I ever had to call the police.

Throughout the 9 years of us living with my dad we moved several times while he was in work to my Nan and Grandad's house only to be told after a couple of weeks that we weren't welcome there, and that my mum had to pick herself and her 'f***** up' kids and get out.

During the time we spent living with my Nan and Grandad they'd regularly get drunk to the extent that they'd forget to cook for us and due to my mum working night shifts, she wasn't there to cook for us and expected her own Mum and Dad to care for her children. When I told my mum they denied it, told my mum that I'm a liar and that I was 'screwed up' and needed to see a councilor, there was once a comment made that I must have been 'hit pretty hard in the head' for me to come up with such apparently 'fictitious' events. At this point my mum started preparing meals for me and my sister before she left for work, due to her having no alternative, with rent and bills to pay as a single parent working part time she couldn't afford a child minder and she had no friends.

While my Nan and Grandad looked after us my Grandad would regularly hit my Nan when they got drunk and I often got threatened with a punch or a smack if I told anyone. At one point my Grandad told me that I'm 'just like my dad' and 'I'll never be any better than him' because I told him that a man doesn't hit a woman.

Jumping forward a few years, when I was 10 my mum her now ex fiance which was quite alien to me, I wasn't used to having a man around the house who offered to take me to school, cook me meals, looked after my mum and most importantly to me, made her smile. It had been so long since I saw a smile on my mum's face, a genuine one which displayed that she was finally happy and free, she could finally be herself without worrying when the next smack was going to come. 

My sister didn't have the same outlook on the situation as me, she started going to my Nan and Grandad telling them that we had pinned her to the bed and beaten her, yet there was no bruises and they believed her. She even said that my mum's ex had intentionally walked in on her getting changed out of her uniform which was impossible due to us getting home from school at the same time. I would have been in the house as well so I would know.

I'd finally felt like my life was finally stabilizing, I was content with life. My mum was happy and we were safe, or so I thought. 

My sister proceeded to tell lies to my family which resulted in everyone stopping talking to me and my mum and my sister leaving us to move in with my Nan and Grandad, as well as causing numerous threats to be given and a lot of hostility, I could walk down the street and see my Nan, Grandad, Auntie or Uncle and they'd look right through me when I've always been a innocent bystander getting caught in the crossfire.

At this point my existence was not only irrelevant to my own father but to my sister and my whole family. My sister who I used to protect and comfort while she cried at the sounds of my mum screaming and crying had now turned against me.

After 4 years of my family not speaking to me and my mum, they finally got in touch, but for different reasons than I had expected. My sister called telling us that my nan was going to kick her out and she had no where to go because they had an argument, and due to her being my sister and my mother's daughter, we took her back forgiving her of everything she had done. During this time my mum started speaking to the rest of my family again for what I can only assume was for my sake, to give me something I had been lacking my whole life.

Throughout the time of me and my mum speaking to my family we were told numerous lies that my sister had told about us, ranging from me pinning her to the bed and beating her up on several occasions to my mum apparently being suicidal and claiming she wasn't a fit parent, when one thing I can't call my mum for is her capacity to love and care for her children.

The lies worked both ways, my sister told us lies that my family had been telling about me and my mum, that my mum's ex had apparently been molesting me, beating me up and that my mum apparently had a string of partners. This went on for near enough 2 years.

After 4 years of not having to deal with constant chaos, it had all started again. The lies and trouble had gone to the extent where I was trying to play the peace keeper, attempting to salvage an already broken family at the expense of no one other than myself. I was paid no gratitude, only abuse. My mum started arguing with my Nan again which then resulted in them hurling abuse at me, the person who sacrificed his own happiness in hope of everyone else's. 

My mum now had to make the hardest decision that a mother could make, keep my sister under her roof where she would have ended up getting someone sent to prison with the lies she was telling or tell her that she had to leave but she'd find her a flat and pay her rent. 

Upon hearing the news, my Nan and Grandad jumped at the chance to take her in providing they got the rent to which my sister happily agreed to.  They'd went from enemies to rejoining forces if you wish, attempting to destroy both mine and my mother's lives. My sister was nearly 18 at this point.

After having no choice but to tell my sister she was no longer welcome in our house my mum suffered with severe depression, she'd often get abusive texts and phone calls from my Nan and sister which after a while left her suicidal. 

On 3 occasions my mum left the house in hope of me not chasing her with intentions of never coming back, when finally getting her back into the house I'd find notes left for me, telling me her credit card pin number and that she'd left everything to me and that she was sorry. 

No beating off my dad, with or without the belt could compare to the pain that I felt during those weeks, the one person in my life I thought would always be there for me, the strongest person I've ever met had been left so heart broken, feeling so responsible for my life, she thought that everyone would be better off without her.

At this point I was too afraid to sleep in fear that my mum wouldn't be there when I woke up, I made excuses to stay off school because I was too scared that she wouldn't be there when I got home. I thought I knew fear when living with my dad, but physical pain can't compare to the unimaginable pain I was feeling. The thought of the person I idolize, respect and would put before myself in any situation, the person who I can honestly say to this very day I would die for, was being taken away from me.

I was 16 at this point, my mum's ex had made no attempt to comfort her due to him not getting on with my sister but instead was blunt telling her that she 'should have known better' and to 'stop feeling sorry for herself' as well as being told to 'get on with her life.'

During this time in my life I was also diagnosed with mild scoliosis and Fibromyalgia which no matter how often people told me it wasn't that bad, it left a broken and incomplete person feeling even emptier than he did before.

After feeling like I could potentially get on with my life, feeling some stability, it had all been taken away. 

1 year later my mum found out she was pregnant, which to me was good news due to her being happy. After my little brother being born my mum's ex turned from the once loving and caring man he was to a emotionally withdrawn, short fused and verbally abusive man. On countless occasions I went to intervene in their arguments only for my mum to beg me not to get involved, I'd go back to my bedroom only to hear the same thing I heard 8 years ago, my mum crying, her ex shouting telling her that she's stupid and worthless and throughout that time, I felt like the scared and helpless little boy again.

When my little brother was born my mum's ex was doing a PHD, so he didn't have a lot of free time but with the small amount of free time he did have he'd pay no attention to my little brother. Infact, I'd go as far as saying that for the first 2 years of his life I was more of a father to him, me being his brother.

A couple of months after my little brother's 2nd birthday my mum and her ex broke up, which left him and his brother attempting to threaten my mum, telling her that she had no chance of keeping my little brother due to her suffering with anxiety. They told her that she's mentally unfit and can't look after herself let a lone her kids. My mum begged me not to get involved due to her fearing the outcome if I did.

After going through court my mum has permanent residency for my little brother, his dad only having him every weekend until he joins nursery.

My mum has now found a nice man who has done wonderful things for 5 unfortunate children. Despite him not being my dad, when he can tell I'm upset or I'm having a bad day he'll insist on me going somewhere just so we can go for a drive and he can talk to me, he'll take me for something to eat, make sure I know that despite how alone in this world I feel I'm not really as well as him being great with my little brother and my mum.

Due to me suffering with Fibromyalgia and according to my councilor PTSD I've dropped out of college twice due to me not being able to stick to anything as well as me lacking the motivation or see any potential in my future.

If I was asked to explain how I'm feeling right this minute I'd have to say that I feel like an empty shell of a person, my ability to display feelings towards others was destroyed by those who are supposed to love and comfort me, as well as me feeling unlovable. I struggle to see what anyone would see in me, I'm registered as having a disability, I can't talk to new people and I lack the ability to get close to anyone as well as me feeling like a bystander in a world that's moving faster than I am."

621,"I need to vent. Possible triggers ********




About 2yrs ago I had a total breakdown which though therapy led to me admitting I was sexually and emotionally abused as a child. Been unable to work properly or even function like I used to. Isolated myself, had my house repossessed, living on benefits and really struggling. Been through a recent crisis after my abuser (not disclosed to family and he's still part of family) f**ked with my head and triggered a lot of feelings of shame, disgust and powerlessness. 

I've been treated by crisis team, and the psychologist. Who won't do any trauma therapy with me as it's short term and he can't finish it. So we've spent 3 months skirting around the edges. I've asked for help&support coping with flashbacks and effects etc but I'm always told ""you have to be in a good place to deal with trauma"". It's already ruining my life, keeping me isolated, intruding at inconvenient times and generally f**king me up. It's here. It's been a struggle for months. And I want to face it. Deal with it and put it behind me. I'm not an idiot and after keeping it quiet for 20+ years don't I deserve the chance to tell my story?? I can't tackle my family until I'm stronger and at the moment I'm a hostage to the whims of my PTSD. 

The NHS treatment available for CSA survivors is woefully inadequate. And in my situation, it feels like they're no better than the world of secrecy my family and my abuser kept me in for all these years. I'm trapped within a prison of my mind, looking for the slightest hope that there will be a release and seeing only shut doors."
622,"I have been seeing my OCD therapist for almost 6 weeks now.  She is great, and she has helped me to understand my illness (intrusive thoughts) and why my brain works the way it does. I have been reading ""Imp of the mind"" along with other OCD books on how to finally get over my intrusive thoughts. The worst thoughts are of sexual content, usually involving family members. Now, the book and my therapist tells me that in order to successfully treat myself, I need to undergo CBT therapy, involving exposure to the thoughts. I am to ""let the thoughts pass through my head and not resist"", I am to ""purposely think the thoughts and put myself in the situation that triggers my thoughts"". My only thing is that I find it makes me more anxious/stressed when I attempt to do this. It's hard because thinking about sexual thoughts involving my mother or my sister is so sickening sickening to me.  
                                             
The thoughts are worst when I am around my family, so basically what the doctor is asking me to do is think of sexual thoughts while I am around my mother and sister, which I find has not worked and makes me sick. How do I expose myself when the thoughts are so sickening?  Would you want to think sexual thoughts around your family, even if you knew that you were doing it for a treatment? Another method is to either write down or record on a cassette tape the thoughts, and then listen to the tape for an hour each day until the anxiety subsides. How do I do this when the thoughts that I am fighting involve sexual thoughts involving my family? I can't willingly think these thoughts around my family because then I feel so sick. Someone please help me, my personal doctor assured me the anxiety will go away if I stay persistent. But I have tried this for weeks and I still feel sick when I intentionally think these thoughts around my family. What method can I try? Please someone help me!"
623,"My old dog had to be put to sleep last monday. She was a collie/lab cross nearly 13 years old.

Over the worst of my flashbacks and depressions she has been a great help to me in helping me through the many panic attacks. 

When I was at the vets, they asked me if I wanted to be present when she was sent her to sleep (forever) and I said yes.

So I held her head as she died. Unfortunately for me part of my PTSD relates to the death of my boyfriend in front of me 40 years ago. 

I am now getting depressed by my fucking mind mixing these 2 events up and the flashbacks have returned. 

To keep me from killing myself when my boyfriend died, I told myself that by staying alive I could honour and remember him, so I lived on during even the worst of my depressions. Then I found out in 2011 that seeing him die was a false memory which came about as a result of brainwashing in 1972. This took away my reason to live.

But  luckily I had a dog. When I have been near to despair over the last few years I told myself it would be awful for my pooch if I were to leave her permanently, so I lived on for her. 

Now I am on my own again ( I am definitely not getting another dog for a while, if ever, again, I can't afford it) I find myself thinking more and more about having nothing to continue to live for.

what is the point of continuing?"

Declaring today as a 'stay in bed' day which Is the right thing for me right now, and hubby and sons are absolutely fine with that. But am just feeling a great loss about the old me and I can't see I'll ever be that person again. I used to be care-free and genuinely happy.... but those days seem like a long time ago now.

My CPN and trauma therapist say that they believe I will become well again and I can recover from my PTSD but three and half years seems like a long time ago when I was consistently well. No flashbacks, no nightmares, no feeling different to everyone around me. I changed CPNs a few months ago as the new one can provide long tern support so I know I am lucky to have this, I really do. But life is just different.

625,"Hey guys,

I honestly don't know what to do. I have been feeling extremely down with suicidal ideation and a strong urge to harm myself. I am taking sertraline 150mg's but I still feel like shit! I'm also having counselling.

I don't know what else I can possibly do. I'm trying to proactive and not just dwell. But nothing seems to be working. I don't know how longer I can go on like this.

I don't really want to go back to my GP because they will just up my sertraline to 200mg's and its already effecting my memory. Making me clumsy, forgetful and slow."
626,"Hi there guys and dolls..

Need some advice.. not about me but my wife.  I will go through the story with facts and not skip anything out.

When I first met my wife 15 years ago, she was the woman of my dreams.  Everything I ever wanted.  

She quickly fell in love and we shared everything together.  

She told me about her father and mother.  Her mother just upped and left for no apparent reason when my wife was 2.

That left her dad to bring her and her brother up.  

Now my wife has told me that during her childhood, her father hit her, massively favored her brother over her (which continues to this day), he step mum didn't really care too much for my wife or her brother and even put labels on food that were in the fridge with her own childrens names on.  Besides always craving her fathers attention which he ignored, in her early teens she self harmed and has scars on her arm.

Fast forward quite a few years and we have married.  There have been many times that my wife has come home and cried for ages on my shoulder because her father was busy with her brother and pretty much ignored her.  She said many times that she felt closer to my parents than she did her own father but of course, he was her father so she kept trying and trying and trying.  Getting broken promise after promise and being ignored.  It wasn't always like this.  They did sometimes click.

Her fathers step daughter moved to Wales which is 230 miles from us and he still went to see them more than us and we are 10 miles away.  He was missing out on his 2 grand children.  I personally was at a bit of a stand off with him as it used to annoy me that he would travel to Wales more than to come and see us and I think he knew this so he stayed away more.  Bit of a catch 22.

Anyway, added to this, although we have 2 amazing girls, we have also suffered 6 miscarriages.   

The first was before our first child was born.  The second and third were before our youngest was born then the last 3 were after.

The last 2 were very stressful.  The 5th miscarriage was in October 2012 and she was 3 months pregnant.  Had the scan only to be told it had died at 10 weeks.  My wife chose to pass it at home and one night she did.  She informed me that when it came out, she sat there with it in her hands for a while before getting rid.

We then tried in August last year and at the beginning of September, we found out she was pregnant again.  I did say that if we unfortunately lose this one, that will be it for me.  I was heading towards my 42nd birthday and it was damn painful for me.  I will never have any idea of how a woman feels about it.  Must be so much worse and she had often said that why is this happening? what am I doing wrong? Why is my body rejecting them?

Unfortunately in October we again suffered our 6th miscarriage.  It was horrible.  My wife is a very maternal person and she was again devastated.

There was one night about 3 weeks after and the bleeding had about stopped..  We had an argument about something I can't remember and she provoked me with something and I shouted at her 'Just go on the pill and stay on it'. At the moment she got up, said she couldn't bare to be near me and went for a drive.

Again, I know this was wrong but we all say wrong things in an argument..I actually thought that was a good idea as we would then stop arguing.  She was out for a couple of hours and as it was quite late, I fell asleep on the sofa.

Next day and for the following couple of weeks, I so wanted to put an arm around her and see how she was but she was seeming absolutely fine.  It was constantly on my mind but I was worried that it would start another argument.  She then massively got into exercise.  She has always enjoyed running but she got into the insanity, T25 and running etc.  She wanted a dog... something massive changed in her from that October.

On February 10th this year, I returned from work and my wife said that she wants a separation.  He reasons were that she did not love me any more because:

I apparently did not tidy up as much as her (I did)
I didn't go and see her folks as much as her (this one is true)
I was on the computer a lot (I have a desktop so im in a corner, she has a laptop so can sit on the sofa)
I didn't take the kids out as much as her (complete rubbish)

Since then, there have been a lot of arguments.  We were trying to live together but it was hard.  I could not understand it and she even admitted herself that something in her mind changed massively after that night in October.

She has been very angry, stressful, anxiety has played a part.  She felt and even told her solicitor I was being aggressive (never raised a hand in my life), blocked and deleted me on Facebook and Twitter.

In mid March, she told me she was moving out and said it was 'not her problem' when I asked how the hell I was going to pay for the house on my own.  I went to my mum and dads for 30 minutes and came back to see that she had just upped and left with the children.

The police confirmed that she and the kids were safe and well but I thought I would try and find out where she was so I looked on a forum she used to go on and saw that all my life and relationship issues were all on there with her exaggerating the truth and she was being backed up by her e-friends calling me all the names possible and backing her up in her decision..

She came round the next day to get some stuff and she barged in with her dad and her dad assaulted myself and my mum.  I didn't react to that coz of the kids.  She has tried to stop me seeing the kids and also telling our mutual friends what I'm apparently like and they all avoid me now.  Shes a mobile hairdresser.

The last week or so we have been getting on better.  Although I myself are still having up and down days emotionally and I spilled them out to her on text.  Nothing horrible but just my emotions and I text back saying I am being unfriendly and she is deleting me again from Facebook. (she had only added me again last night) My world has fallen apart and I myself went to see the doctor and he wanted to sign me off work and I refused then he said he wanted to see me again in 2 weeks and may consider pills.  I will refuse the pills.  My auntie is addicted to these unfortunately.

So, baring in mind her childhood then the miscarriages, what do you guys think?  She is trying to get herself away from me as far as possible.  We had 15 years together and I just feel that I don't exist to her any more apart from being the father to our kiddies.

I see the kids for 3 and 4 days a week which is good and I always said I would share any tax credits with her I get.  She got awarded all of them and is refusing to share any with me so I'm £400 short each month... 

I am currently setting up a business with a friend and that will be launched in the next week or so.  I am doing that for a better future for my family (original reasons), we would have more time together, no more financial woes - life would be great.  1 week before she dropped the bombshell she even said if the business takes off, we can get that dog and I would love a 4 x 4.  I said of course.  Im doing it for us all to enjoy.

I actually think she is suffering from PTSD.  She now has the full attention of her father that she has crazed for but all the other things that have happened in her life I think has built up then it just exploded in her mind that October.

I am at a complete loss and I have such a void left in my life, I honestly feel like there has been a death.  Ive lost 3 stone in 6 weeks, not sleeping or anything...

I want to inform her coz I have read that most people who suffer with this sort of thing are unaware but I have no idea how to go about it so any ideas there would also be great.  She has been very irrational and illogical.

Any ideas? or if not PTSD what else?

Thanks for reading and I appreciate any feedback."
627,PTSD in the Family: Helping a Loved One or Family Member with PTSD
628,"Researchers have put ample effort into identifying genes that help explain why cancer or heart disease run in some families. But scientists still don't know if some genes can explain why the children and grandchildren of people who've survived traumatic events are more likely to experience mental illnesses than the general population. If there is a gene, or set of genes, that make the children of survivors more likely to develop depression and schizophrenia, scientists have yet to find it. Now, new research suggests that many scientists might have been looking in the wrong place.

A group of European researchers have discovered that early life traumatic events can alter a non-genetic mechanism governing gene expression in the sperm cells of adult mice. And they think that this finding, published today in Nature Neuroscience, explains why the offspring of these mice exhibit the same depressive-like behaviors that their parents do.

I had a task then that was to ensure my daughters didn't give up on their dream of going to university. I'm pleased to say that they both succeeded, but the elder daughter took a year out because she couldn't get on the course she wanted. That meant that a year later they both left home within 5 days of each other. So after 54 years of living in a stable family situation I was suddenly totally alone. No job. No family within 100 miles most of my friends had moved due to work and my previous job was in a nationwide specialists group with the nearest one in Birmingham. Not exactly 5 minutes down the road from Huntingdon. At that point the previous 2 1/2 years caught up with me and I fell to bits. I have suffered from severe anxiety especially in situations which are unfamiliar to me and with people I don't know or who are in a position of authority. I managed to get a job in November 2013 as a gym instructor. After 3 weeks I fell ill with sickness and diarrhoea which then turned into a massive anxiety session lasting 8 weeks. The doc gave me diazepam short term and fluoxetine for long term. I started at 20 mg fluoxetine for 4 weeks so went through the low point at 2 weeks. Then my dose was put up to 40 mg again I had to go through the low point then my dose was upped to 60 mg. After two weeks I was told that due to my mental health they would not be renewing my contract. Various other factors including the death of a close friend and on Sunday March 9th I took a big overdose of co-codamol and went to bed not thinking I'd ever wake up. But I woke at 7 am realised what I'd done, called an ambulance and after 4 days in hospital on a drip of antidote to paracetamol metabolites I was declared fit enough to go home. No damage to liver or any permanent damage. My problem is constant flashbacks to the moment my wife died, nightmares etc. I have now been referred to the local mental health team. My question is that I believe that it is not simply anxiety and depression that I'm suffering from, but PTSD as I seem to have all the symptoms described, flashbacks, nightmares, aggressive outbursts, being unable to do almost anything I'm asked because there is so much crap flying round my mind like a million mile an hour slide show that I can't listen to things people say properly or concentrate. The only thing that brings relief is listening to music in the day and about 4 sleep aid tablets and 10 mg of diazepam and after about 3/4 hour to an hour I will doze off. Only then to be constantly waking up at least once an hour through the night. 
It's either that or knock mŷself out with vodka which I don't like because the anxiety comes back twice as bad the following day. I am now at a loss as to what to do
Does anyone else have similar symptoms

632,"Sorry, this is going to be a rant rather than a sensible advice seeking thread. Cue the endless profanities...

I AM SO FUCKED OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY FUCKED OFF!

I'm so SICK of the fucking trauma of it all. I am so SICK of it all being swept under the rug and the pretending that everything's ok, that nothing is wrong... it's fucking perverse, the way that nothing is acknowledged within my family.

Since the incident last week, i've had nightmares. Every fucking night.
Not only is that bastard affecting my waking life, he's affecting my dreams. There seems to be no escape and no relief. I am constantly being tortured.
A lot of the time over the last couple of years i've been in serious shutdown mode and so I can't say i've fully felt the fear/anger/whatnot, but right now I am a nervous wreck - locking doors, jumping at the smallest sounds.

I don't know how much more I can take. At this precise point in time, I am feeling like I really want to self-harm or ""do something stupid"". I just want a break from it all.

I know this sudden wave of anger/impulsiveness has come from me just trying to call my parents but having him answer. I cannot stand the sound of his voice right now.

I just feel like banging my head against a brick wall with frustration.

633,"In november, i left an emotionally abusive man. He took my son and kept him for a few days. During this time, i was verbally abused and harrassed and repeatedly told i would never see my son again. 
Since he had PR, there was nothing anyone could do to get my son back. 

I couldnt sleep, eat or function properly. It was a very, very difficult time for me. 
Since that time,i have shut down on an emotional level. 
I had nightmares.consistently for a few months about my son being taken. 
I would have flashbacks of it all happening. I would be tormented by reminders of my nightmares. 
Thankfully these have settled. I have noticed that i cant talk about the time he took my son. It makes me very emotional (yet nothing else does. Even things you would expect), and so i stay away. Even reading the things i wrote at the time make me break down. 
Do i need to let myself go there again and relive that event, in order to open up emotionally again? 
I did get my son back after 3 days. Which doesnt seem long, but felt like forever to me.

Therapists and the likes.are telling me ive become desensitised as ive had so much trauma. 

Is this a form of ptsd?"
634,"Hi.
In 2010 I was placed in a psych hospital. It was so bad there, but I don't know how to describe it because I repressed most of it. I remember snippets, like my girlfriend. But it's like im watching them happen through my own eyes. Like it happened to me but I don't have the feelings or the body memories. 
About 6 months ago I was sexually assaulted in another psych hospital, and I remember it, and I feel a lot of guilt and regret about it. I'm just really depressed about it.
My question is if I had one reaction to trauma the first time, why would I not have the same reaction to the sexual assault?"

636,"I have been relatively OK for a while but last night I had an enormous panic attack, with many flashbacks of being electrically shocked. I feel these pains shoot right through me, as if I am still in the mental hospital of 1972. 

I keep hoping that I have seen the last of my past but it keeps coming back to haunt me. 

I have an awful feeling that there are more hidden memories of things that were done to me at that time that have still to appear. I thought it was all gone. I hope it has all gone."
637,"Saw this Dr Phil show today and frankly it just plain pissed me off 
Has me thinking on how my memories resurfaced and what the term repressed really means. I always had vague emotionally detached memories of the events, all of them, but when PTSD surfaced they came back in relentless flashbacks with complete emotional and sensory, reliving of the events. I never had any false memories. But that emotional detachment and displacement of emotional responsibility really reaked havoc in my developing years and early adulthood. 
Just curious as to how others had their recollections and if false memories were involved? uggg:confused:"
638,"Here is the 'agony'.  I have an online friend that I have known since 2003.  She has PTSD from childhood(she is 32).  She has never told me what it is from, and I have never asked.

Anyway, Her push/pull behavior is classic.  She will go back n' forth, between wanting me in her life, to cutting me off.

She will also tell me from time to time, F-off, that something is none of my business, or that I know nothing about her(after eleven years, that is impossible).

Then she goes on a trip with her controlling boyfriend.  Her boyfriend even threatened me a couple weeks ago.  Then when recently told her what he said, she apparently told him to back off.  He is very insecure.

Three months ago, she left him because of their continued arguing and moved 1,000km.

How are they going to repair their relationship being 1,000km apart.  Sure she has PTSD.  But, they are putting the nail in the coffin to their relationship."

640,"Hello, everybody, I would like to share my experience with trauma and find out if anyone has similar experience. 

It's been one year and half since I ended abusive relationship. After that nothing seems to be normal and although I can function at work, finding new partner and building a relationship is out of the question. For four months I dated a woman who was divorced catholic. Her husband abused her in all imaginable ways, she also has a history of abusive childhood (her father was an alcoholic). She was divorced for two years and suffered from depression. When we begin to date she told me that she is ready for new relationship, she is OK now and she wanted new beginning. She kept telling me that I have ""healing effect"" on her. However, over few weeks, I felt worse and worse. She made complains that I am very ""slow"" in progressing in relationship, that she does not feel loved enough despite all the things she was doing for me. 

She was obsessed with sex and porn and thought that I have some serious problem if I wanted things to go slow. She kept telling me conflicting messages, like she want to begin again but – since she was raised catholic and had wedding in church – technically (from the spiritual point of view) she is still wife of her husband, they are still ""married"" and they are eternally bond. I wish I was wise enough to leave her immediately. But I loved her. Over the time I felt unbearable feelings, emotional pain, like my body was burning in fire and I couldn't breathe. I though it was all my fault, that I had problems with commitment and in some way I am not normal of having such a strange feelings. She disrespected my boundaries, she kept seducing me although I told her I need more time for intimacy. Finally, I couldn't sleep with her anymore, I had suicidal feelings and pretty much lost myself. It was as if my emotions and my sexuality turned to opposite directions and this begin tearing me apart. For weeks I couldn't decide whether to leave her or stay. Most of the time I felt like under some weird spell. It was like I was frozen, completely powerless. She was disappointed and angry that I did not want to sleep with her anymore. It's normal that couples sleep together, right? She told me I am an egoist because everything had to be according to my feelings. Yet nothing was according to my feelings. I completely distrusted my inner warning signals. We finally broke up, I couldn't take it anymore. 

Two weeks after the break-up, when I was in great pain and confusion, very strange thing happened to me. One day, in a moment of horror, I felt like my soul broke from all that pain in two pieces. Like somebody took a knife or sword and cut my body in two halves. I couldn't put myself together. On one side there was my twisted body, on the other side there was my spirit, or personality. It was as if ""I"" was no longer in my body. It was not out-of-the-body experience (like I was distant observer of myself outside the body), rather, I was broken body without a self. My vital part, my self, was standing on my right side and partially overlapped with me. I cried for hours and in next two weeks I mentally broke down. I began therapy and for several months took antidepressants which helped me to function at work. However, along with helping me to conquer depression and anxiety they blunted my feelings.

After several months I slowly realized that I was in abusive relationship (until that time I thought it was all my fault). Ten months after the break-up I bought a book from Peter A. Levine ""Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma"" and then it hit me – maybe my strange feelings are not unique, maybe there is label for it – PTSD. It was major turning point. I continued therapy, start to study disorder and experimented with healing techniques. I found expert on trauma. I met all criteria of PTSD except hyperarousal symptoms, I have one or two of them, so it is probably partially PTSD. I still cannot explain my strange body feelings (feeling broken, disintegrated and twisted inside myself, intense pain in chest and waist areas).

It took me year to process feelings of guilt from putting and keeping myself in such relationship and feelings of anger towards woman I dated. I feel used. 

However, there is one complication. Three years ago, I did really stupid thing – I took drug. I with friends and one of the offered me salvia. It was not illegal in our country, he did not tell me it was hallucinogen and told be that if it went bad, after few minutes I will be OK. Well, I wasn't. My trip lasted four days and after that I got acute psychosis and depersonalization. I was lucky enough to recover in nine months or so (there were people, who struggle for years after that kind of experience). My therapist told me that my strange body feelings may not only be result of that relationship but my nerve system was probably affected also by this previous experience (I never had history of substance abuse, it was one time mistake). 

I did many things to recover, especially EMDR and various relaxation techniques. I have read several books on trauma. Some information I found was really helpful. I developed my own healing routines and exercises. Along with working out and stretching, I do focusing, breathing exercises and autogenic training. I devote several hours weekly to do the exercises, usually from one to two hours every day. I learned how to dissolve some of the pain in certain parts of the body, how to be aware of body sensations and most importantly, how to manage anxiety. Most helpful for me was focusing (technique described by Eugene Gendlin). 

I learned how to feel better. Still, there is one thing which is major concern for me. I cannot imagine intimate relationship again. I feel as if my sexuality, my vital self is damaged. I cannot have sex again. Few times I tried to masturbate to see if everything is OK (sorry for being open here) left me in such emotional pain that I thought of killing myself. I found myself broken and disintegrated even more than before. I felt like I was broken glass. Inside my body there were pieces of myself, some of them felt dead, some of them painful. It took me weeks to stabilize again. 

Same thing happened when I had wet dream. It was like falling into the abyss: I started to feel even more pain. Anxiety and depression came quickly along. Soon suicidal feelings emerged and I felt that my inner self is even more damaged. I cannot describe that pain and my desperate efforts to heal from the consequences of ordinary orgasm (physically everything was OK). Despite I am in my thirties, I managed to live life almost without any thoughts of sex in order not to be aroused and experience that horror again. Living life with fear from my sexuality is very hard. 

I am afraid that I will be never healthy again. I would like to know if anybody here has similar experiences with sexual arousal and soul-body disintegration after trauma and if so, what did you find helpful. I have to find the path of recovery. I do not want to stay alone with this disorder."
641,"Hi All, 

I am new to this kind of thing. I was diagnosed with PTSD just Tuesday past and I am struggling to come to terms with what this means and what I do from now on. I have always known that the way I cope with things hasn't been great and I have suffered from some severe moods and flashbacks. I have been offered group therapy but I am not sure what to do as I really do need something that will help but I do not want my work to find out and getting 3 hours out of my working day every week is going to be a struggle. Should I be honest with my work and tell them or will that hinder my promotion prospects for the rest of my life in this company? I work in a close knit team who tell each other everything and I am worried about confidentiality too. 
I have told my current partner about my diagnosis which we were both expecting due to the way I behave and what I have been going through; I am shocked, he is not. In fact he seems to be ignoring the fact that I am going through something. He is happy to give me a cuddle but doesn't really understand the gravity or upset I feel from this diagnosis. I don't know what I can do to make him see that I am not coping, on one hand I do not want to put any pressure on him to help and on the other I feel so alone as no one knows about this or seems to want to talk to me about it. I suppose there is a stigma and because all of my friends see me as a determined, hard working ""shit together"" type of person they have kinda gone into shock when I told them what happened (it was over 10 years ago) so I do feel a bit pathetic also. 

I am really at a loss at what I should do - I am fighting the urge to curl up in bed all weekend and ignore the whole world but I know that it is not a helpful response and I do have two step children coming to stay the weekend so I really need to not appear unwell or upset. 

Any advice greatly appreciated. I am hitting my head off of a brick wall. 

:unsure::low:"
642,"I'm not entirely sure what to write here. I suppose this is more of a 'musing' thread..
The diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder was slapped on me when I was 20. 
Previous to then, the CAMHS team said I had 'Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features'.

While there is no talk of giving me this as a formal/new diagnosis, my therapist has mentioned that I seem to meet the criteria for Complex PTSD. I've done a bit of research and it says that BPD and PTSD (or complex ptsd) are indeed very similar.
So how does someone distinguish between the two?

Anyway, I feel that this completely fits into place. All of it. Particularly the fact that when I got my BPD diagnosis, I was actually well in the thick of the abusive situation. A lot of my ""BPD symptoms"" were a result of desperately seeking a rescuer from the shit I was in. Since escaping the situation, those symptoms have calmed down. I had a very brief period of exhibiting BPD-type behaviour, but that was during a time in which I was seeing a man who, I didn't realise at the time and can only see it now, was very emotionally abusive and controlling.

I don't know.
The reason i've taken to making a post is I realise just how much I get flashbacks of things (which i've never really spoken about), and just how much of the rest of the time i'm absolutely numb and remember very little.
And by acknowledging that fact, I started to spiral a bit about a really traumatic night I had during the time in the abusive situation... so I suppose this is a bit of a distraction from that. :)

If anyone can relate then it would be interesting for me to know. Thanks for reading. x"
643,"Hi. Im new here, joined today, hoping someone will help me to understand what is going on.

A quick overview:

I'm a 59yr old, semi-retired builder.  

Was physically, emotionally and sexually abused, as well as tortured to the point of impending doom over a 3 yr period between the ages of 18 to 21. (back in the 70's)  

Gone through life always knowing something wasn't quite right but never knew what. Although the thoughts of what happened as youngster have never been far away, Ive never really gave them much more thought than a quick reminder.  

2010, for no obvious reasons, suddenly started to experience epileptic seizures. Late 2010, diagnosed with Acute Anxiety disorder. 

Late 2013. Underwent a full psychiatric evaluation by a world renowned professor of psychiatry: 

2014. Diagnosed with Moderate to Sever PTSD,  Acute Anxiety Disorder, as well as, Moderate to Severe Personality Disorder.  

I feel like i'm reading about  another person when reading through the report.  

Pls help me to better understand what these illnesses actually are.

Thank you in advance."
644,"Hello, I've been diagnosed with PTSD. Just want to tell you I kept having bad episodes during the past 2 days. My anxiety levels were so high I couldn't control it. I kept walking around mindlessly and over thinking until my brain hurt for 2 days. I kept feeling like I'm about to fall down. Today, the pain subsided and my anxiety subsided thank god. and i felt so depressed. I kept on eating and eating. Cannot properly sleep. Scared, paranoid I even thought someone was gonna kill me outside my house waiting for me. I've only had one session with my psychiatrist and he hasn't put me on medication. Do you think I need it ? I remember one time it was so bad my eyes started twitching, I wanted to faint, my legs were shaking real bad and I felt so disconnected. That happened last 4 weeks ago. I had to be given a shot idk what kind of shot but it cooled down my anxiety down until i slept really deep. Idk what to do with myself sometimes I just want to commit suicide for real and just end my life. It's a pain to fight my anxiety..."
645,"I haven't done the work I need to do for Wednesday.  I had two weeks and I did nothing, just sat and looked at the computer all blank.  I had a panic attack the other night, where I was just shaking and couldn't move or talk.  It's so scary, I hate them.  I'm scared I'm going to let everyone down.  I'm scared because I sh'd and my oh will be upset if they find out.  I need to keep the anxious down or I'll have flashbacks.  I need to be alone in a room with two guys on Wednesday and not sound like an idiot.  I'm scared about that too."

647,"I woke up this morning from a very convincing dream in which I met my daughter and my grandmother in the afterlife and it was beautiful, no pain, no suffering. They wanted we to stay and told me it was time to stop hurting. My grandmother, who is one of my idols, told me it was the right thing to do as I have been putting so much stress on everyone else that it's become too much for them now. I wake up and I am instantly met with a flood of suicidal thoughts aimed point blank directly in my face. I try to convince myself it was a dream but fuck me, I would have given my left arm to go back that place. 
I ended up calling the county crisis line and spoke with a woman about what I was dealing with and she eventually convinced me to go to emerg to talk to a psychiatrist. I was extremely relectant as I have an intense fear of doctors and medical facilities due to loosing my daughter to that vaccine, but she was lining up a small team to meet me there and was advocating on my behalf to prep them for my unwilling visit. 
When I got there I was met with the same resistance that triggers my panicky shittyness and I felt misunderstood and attacked.... And I never got to talk to the shrink. They tried to keep me overnight and they wouldn't hear how that would make me even more upset. They were making me feel trapped and I had to put up a huge fight to go home with my dad. I want help, I really do but every time I go into a hospital it is an extremely traumatic experience for me. My dad finally saw first hand just how upset I get over all I this so I think he understands a bit better which is nice. But how can I accept help from the ""people"" that I feel are responsible for the death of my child? How can I trust that? How can I get them to see that that is my first step. They want to ""cure my suicide"" but I'm not letting them in.... How???"
648,My issues stem from living in a dangerous neighborhood and living with a family that does not understand me. My dad emotionally and physically abused me and my mom believes I do not even have any issues. I was teased all my life for being quiet and petite. I am not able to function outside of the house for long periods of time due to fear and anxiety. Can anyone relate to my story? I also very rarely go out alone.
649,"I've been in therapy for about a year now and after a misdiagnosis of solely major depression, I think we almost have a more accurate diagnosis now... although I feel there are still some holes, or at least some things that I'm not understanding. Chronic complex PTSD, borderline personality disorder and dysthymia... when that started to sink in I couldn't help but feel that I have a bleak future ahead of me. 

My world is already crippling and I'm only 26. I have been in 2 abusive relationships, married, had a baby, lost the baby and got divorced. I am very intelligent and physically healthy so my chaotic mental state seems just that much more unbearable. I've been watching myself go ""crazy"" for over 5 years now, and not many people believe me. I feel like life is teasing me. I'm reluctant to accept my diagnosis, and even more reluctant to take any medication. I tried Celexa, Effexor and Lamactil, all of which appeared to make things worse, especially the Effexor.... That stuff is awful. I've been promised DBT and CBT but haven't seen any of it. My current therapist who is a lovely woman and has helped me immensely with all of this isn't very well equipped to work with my new diagnosis. It is common feeling for me when working with most doctors, that I feel like I'm faking it all, almost as though they are accusing me of trying to get on the loonie bin band wagon for some kind of personal gain. I feel as though I have to prove how sick I am before try will even think of treating me. I feel as though my insights and predictions and intuitions are all discredited and assumed to be anxiety riddled self diagnosis. I'm getting so sick and tired of having to fight for treatment and support; my family says ""oh, you're fine, you don't have any of that. You're just going through a hard time... I remember when I blah blah blah... Don't worry. You're perfectly fine."" AAAARRRRGG!!! I'm not perfectly fine! Very very far away from perfect! .... but regardless it is the standard at which I compare myself to. Perfection is one of my many nemesis. 

Everyday is an emotional roller coaster, I feel like everyone is out to get me sometimes. Other times I can feel all the love of the world flowing to and from me... talk about confusion. The physical manifestations of this pain are wild and creative. It has the power to take over my body and do.... pretty much whatever it wants to. I jumped out the window of a moving vehicle once and other than being upset before hand, I have absolutely no recollection of any thought process before my actions. (I know it has something to do with fight or flight response due to circumstances... but it was a HUGE over reaction) It was like being black out drunk. Anyways, 1 massive concussion and no real treatment I've landed some pretty gnarly cluster headaches ta boot.

All of this is slowly taking over, however... I have my ace in the hole. For some reason I have this undying will to keep going. No matter how many times I want to end it all and throw in the towel, no matter how many times I actually try... I don't. I don't end it and I don't really know why. I think I would feel guilty for leaving my family so much heart ache, but then again.... can I feel guilty if I'm dead??? I haven't figured out why I'm here exactly, or why any of us are for that matter, but I would like to know... or at least have a better idea of it before I off myself/kick the bucket. (Ultimately I do believe that I will be the maker of my own demise in some fashion) What I've come to so far is that ""We are here to enjoy being alive. We are one of the most able bodied, able minded creatures in this life, as far as we know, and we should feel grateful for being blessed with our minds and bodies"" So basically, we are here for enjoyment... Ok, so then if we are here to enjoy ourselves, and the ways in which I feel enjoyment are askew... then.. what???  .......Also, I just plain old don't like loosing, so if life is a game, then I want to win. Yup... sore looser right here. In it to win it bitches. 

That being said.... I don't know what to do about treatment. The city I live in is backed waaaaay up in the mental health departments and I could be waiting for months. Also, I am very very very nervous about medication. I lost my daughter to the H1N1 vaccine and I just don't trust pharma nearly as much anymore. However, if someone has had any luck with some type of medication for borderline or PTSD or for being a guilt factory, I'm at the point where I will give something a test drive. Even at home remedies; herbal, homeopathic, shaman, psychedelic, ancient things, mantras, ... whatever. I've stopped all medications as of Nov of 2013, I don't take much for supplements occasionally vitamin D and omega oils. I smoke pot to help ease my panic attacks and anxiety, but I'm looking to cut that out of my regimen as I don't want to carry it on long term. It does help, but the stigma around it aggravates my guilt issues.  Please help"
650,"Help!! recently diagnosed with PTSD OCD and possible Bi Polar. Confused.

Hi All,

I hope I can receive some advice or opinion from others.
A few weeks or so ago I spent time in a psychiatric hospital. I had a break down and was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder because of trauma suffered as a child(wont go into too much detail) and some ocd behaviours(cleaning and repetitive like when see the number 6 counting to 20) and being paranoid, night terrors etc. I came home but had to attend a day clinic, everything was okish and thought I could handle things without medication so I stopped. I came clean to my psychiatrist and it was suggested I go back in to hospital but voluntary. I went in for a few days and took medications again but my dosage was changed. I felt my mood change and in a dark place. Spoke to psychiatrist again and she changed to original dosage. Its only in last day or two I am feeling the benefit. My mood is starting to even out some what.

I suppose what I'd like to ask is my boyfriend and best friend at times over last few months I was not very kind to. I would have emotional outbursts but he has always been very understanding. My most recent outburst was this week, and after considering everything I thought the kind thing to do was radio silence not for me but for him. To give him a break, peace and until I am mentally better or adjusted. He said whatever I need and has been wonderful. Am I doing the right thing?. I am doing it for him. I will miss him terribly.

Also side note he suggested on more than one occassion if I was bi polar, I asked to be assessed again and when I go back to clinic after xmas I ll have more construtive answers. I was told with ptsd can be similar to bi polar. My psychiatrist wants further assessments but thinks could be likely I am bi polar also so kind of up in air at moment. If I am bi polar is it not best I just remove myself from his life?. He does not need that stress. I don't really know where to turn or where to seek advice on relationship with having these disorders or how they affect the people you are involved with in the long term. I'm just scared if I don't leave him alone I will lose him for good. Is it kinder to walk away for their sake?.

Any information from someone who has been there would be greatly appreciated. Feel like I'm going crazy right now. I don't know what to do for the best.

Thank you."
651,"I haven't posted here in a long time. I felt it wasn't good for me because I absolutely hate the thought of people giving me any kind of attention. I hate reflecting on the fact that when one thing gets better I am still stuck with everything else. I also hate the fact that nothing ever changes for me. I ask for advice, people give me amazing help on here but the doctors just do not want to help me and there is only so much people can do before I feel like a drain or a real let down :cry: . 
 I didn't know where else to go, where else to write so I'm sorry . My number one coping mechanism to deal with my childhood has always been to disassociate from it. When I wrote about some of it briefly on here for the first time or told the doctors it is as though I'm recalling it from somebody else's mind. I have never dealt with it because it's too much for me if that makes sense. :unsure:

 I have managed to avoid bumping into my mother for two/three years, that was until 8 weeks ago at the job centre . I had an appointment with my DEA as I opened the door to the first floor I fiound my mother sitting at the desk with my adviser no further than 3 feet away .I almost collapsed, ushering the security guard over desperately to the hallway because I couldn't physically walk in and had no choice in attending the appointment, so I couldn't run off. He  took me to another room on the other side, walking me round the corner (so she didn't see me) into a private room. My DEA , she was absolutely mortified this had happened (she was aware of my problems with my mother) and it's safe to say she's put so many things in place to ensure it never happens again. As much as I know she will ensure we are never in the job centre again, I no longer feel safe. 

Ever since this happened I am being triggered left right and centre even worse than I was when she left around three years ago. My symptoms have just gone from being 'manageable' to out of control. I have been unable to leave the house unassisted and can no longer go to the job centre alone. I'm back to square one with my fear of humans, my ED is back with a vengeance, self harm is horrific and the agoraphobia is severe again :low:. I have been suffering from a plague of anxiety and panic attacks constantly. Worse than I have ever experienced. Things from my brain are just sort of 'leaking out' for want of a better word, horrific memories, horrible things that have been said to me, associations and its affecting me really badly. If anyone says certain phrases or makes certain noises I start panicking and end up in fits of tears.  My temper is also back to square one, I'm snappy angry and terrified lashing out at my friend and the other small number of people I have contact with. I couldn't hate myself any more . I didn't need this. I didn't want to feel any more pathetic. 
I'm not sure how to cope, what to do or anything at the moment. I'm 24 , I've never had a job, I'm pathetic. I still don't have a diagnosis for this which is is the worst part because it's like my mother told them not to believe me. The psychiatrist couldn't care less and they never even sent me my next appointment I hate myself because I can't stop the reactions and I need help :help:

652,"I had a hugely traumatic experience in the mountains/countryside about 20yrs ago which at the time lasted about a week.
Whenever i go back there i have awful/terrible feelings which i cant put my finger on.As soon as im out of the area im ok again.I have been back about 20 times but the feelings just dont go away when im there.How can i overcome this?"
653,"Hey guys,  
Ok so ive been talking to my councellor about me maybe having a type of ptsd. 
Before i was a farmer and a family man i had a shady life where i was homless for close to 10 years.  During that time i saw and experienced alot of traumatic things.  It was totally normal to see alot of violence like stabbings and beatings as well as overdoses and even murders.  as i moved farther away from that life style and "" cleaned myself up"" i started to be haunted by the memories of the things i witnessed.  Being a homless kid meant you were at the mercy of the streets and when bad things happened you just were thankful it didnt happen to you.  And sometimes it did. I was desensitized to violence and didnt even feel anything at the sight of blood.  But now i have nightmeres of needing to kill people in self defence. Or memories that replay over and over of things that were NOT ok. Very disturbing things. How do people cope with this?  I feel like i am a sort if war vet in my own way.  Any ways to push the memories back?  What helps?"
654,":welcome: I don't know how open I can be on here? But I'm sure they'll say if it's wrong. 
I don't know if I'm over thinking or just attention seeking, I've tried speaking to my friends but they think I'm insane and being dramatic and the doctor has just gave me anti depressants (I get called a drama queen a lot) so I'll see what you guys think. Ps, this will be confusing, I don't know how to write to make things understandable when I'm explaining, I go off track a lot!

So basically I was put into care at the age of 14 after years of mental and (siblings suffered physical) I was raped at 14 and it went to court last year. Also that year (2012) I had an ectopic pregnancy and had my Fallopian tube removed. So yeah that's it really haha, it doesn't really seem that much now I've written it down and I know for certain there's people who had worse experiences than me so it feels abit pathetic really that I'm even complaining! I didn't even think twice when I had the ectopic, I didn't feel any emotions except for being scared when I was told I needed an operation (I was 18 and it was my first hospital visit) I was going out seeing my friends within days of being out of hospital, I was never at home. 
This year I'm just an emotional mess,- I never really think about the baby which is probably why I'm getting such bad Karma- I never go out, I spend 90% of my time in my room and I see one maybe two friends once or twice a month. The outside world scares me. Which if anything is the complete opposite to when I was little, I'd rather of been out than in. I don't know if it's a normal part of growing up but It just seems abit drastic from going out to never going out. I go to college then spend my days in bed. I get called lazy and boring but the thought of going out scares me. If I could I wouldn't even go to college, I hate it. I hate everything haha. I just want to be in bed away from the world. 
I used to love being me but now I don't, I sit on the bus and pray it will crash so then I can escape from reality. I know it sounds awful but my mind would never let me physically hurt myself but if others did then it's ok. I feel like I deserve it for some reason? I know someone wants me to suffer for some reason and that's the scariest part. I never know what's going to happen, I wake up and wonder what bad things are going to happen to me and I wait all day whether it be at college or at home. Either way, i just wait and I know it's because of this person who wants me to suffer. I wish I could just end it all but death scares me, but if someone else killed me then it seems okk because it's what I deserve. I don't know why I deserve it but my mind tells me I do. I'm scared. My mind tells me to do things that would harm myself but then when I do it I'm telling myself I'm stupid? I never hear voices, it's my mind and thoughts and always my voice. It's hard to explain because It just comes and goes, it just pops up and goes when it pleases so it's not really anything. I always have dreams about killing people I don't particularly like (I'm not an angry person I never complain or even stick up for myself) I tried speaking to my doctor but they aren't much help and I really feel like I need help, I don't know your opinion but I just want to feel like the old me again, I miss being me lol, I think ive covered most parts. Thanks for reading- opinions would be very grateful. :)"
655,"Just before my 6th birthday I was involved in a near fatal car accident, I was rushed to the hospitalwhere I was put on strong pain killers because I had a fractured left femur, I stopped breathing twice that night and l had to be revived. I spent 6 weeks in hospital and then I was discharged from hospital and allowed to go home, I was in a hip spiker which is plaster from my feet all the way up to my neck, I had to spend 6 weeks in that plaster which was very uncomfortable, but the worst part was having it cut off because there was a lot of plaster the saw got hot and so I got extensive burns. And then in my early teens I started to get physical illnesses because my body was still traumatised so my immunitywas affected. Then in my early twentys I started to address the PTSD with my psychologist and psychiatrist, but it's not an easy thing to talk about because it brings up a lot of painful memories, so my coping strategy is to self harm whenever I get strong thoughts or emotions."
656,"A neighbour mentioned something to me today that was the most horrible trigger and immediately I had a pain in my stomach that felt like a c*t from a k**fe, resulted in the most awful stomach upset and I asked them to not mention it to me again, not nastily but they'll probably forget and tell me more in future. I can't bare to listen or know about any of it and thought they'd know better or realise but people really don't no matter what you've mentioned or they know has hurt you.  
I feel so sad this evening now and am trying to distract myself here but can't stop flashbacks or crying. Sorry I don't know why am posting this and don't want to upset anyone but just needed to 'get it out' xx"
657,"I was diagnosed with having pretty bad ADD when I was a freshman in highschool. Around 5 years ago, I began having life-crippling panic attacks and was diagnosed with GAD/Panic disorder. Shortly after this diagnosis, I was diagnosed again but with having severe and recurrent major depressive disorder which I've actually suffered from for as long as I can remember... Anyway, I have recently suffered a series of traumatic events resulting in PTSD. I have been in CBT forever, and placed on more medications in the last few years than anyone should take in their entire life. As of now, I am taking Effexor XR 150mg daily, 20mg adderall twice daily, and vistaril as needed for anxiety. My doctor did not let me refill my seroquel I'd been taking for sleep for some reason, and put me on this vistaril instead of the klonopin I'd been taking before. At first, I felt okay. But now, my anxiety is through the roof, I no longer sleep through the night, I have horrific nightmares, and even some form of hallucinations....does anyone else suffer from these same conditions??? Or know effective treatment as far as medication goes???? Please help!!!!"
658,"I feel so incredibly nervous about seeing one. My appointment is on Monday afternoon and I have this total fear which I think is probably thanks to the media! 

I already see a psychologist- I've opened up a lot to him. Presumably the psychiatrist will have all that info? 

So I'm going to see this guy and I'm wondering what types of things he'll say, what he'll do and basically what will happen in general? 

I saw one as a kid but I can't remember very much at all. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)"
659,"I'm lost in the memories
One after another
They hit me like waves
I hug myself so hard I leave bruises
Jaw clenched against the whimpers that want to escape
I am aware of my surroundings
The children want a snack
The laundry needs to be folded
Dishes washed
I'm shaking
I want to vomit
Movie after movie
Shame after humiliating shame
I hug my babies
Their tiny hands wipe the tears that accidentally escape
Right here
I tell myself
I am right here
How can one short life be filled with so much uncontrolled pain?"
660,I am angry because my family still treats me like a child. They all tell me what I am doing now is wrong and what I should do to be better. My mom has gone so far as to say I am the weakest family member and she doesn't think I can make it on my own. I am not like them. I do not want to be like them. They hurt me and they expect me to suck it up and keep it inside like they do. I did that for too long and that is one reason I am the way I am now.
661,"I have been trying to bond with my son but I am so screwed up myself .I have been more than generous when it comes to money with him. He has a girlfriend and I know all his time and emotions are rapped up with her which is fine by me as long as he is happy. Because of a very abusive parents I find it so hard to connect with people .I say and do the wrong things. I can't relax around people at all ,so I am a loner but would love to be closer to him. I love him so much ,he's 24 and showing signs of depression which its breaking my heart to be honest .I want to be able to talk openly about our feelings .I tried today ,offered him a drive around whilst he was waiting for his girlfriend, just so we could talk but he refused .I have had a really bad time lately with my pdsd because (I think) I am having CBT with my forensic psychiatrist and its bringing up ugly things and making me very irreparable and nervous plus I giving up smoking ,so I am not at my best. I watch other Dads with their sons and most seem to be so close. Any tips or input would be appropriated. Dodo."
662,is it normal to not want to talk about the trauma and completely blank it out ?
663,"Hi everybody, at last something seems to be happening, as last thursday I got to see my PTSD therapist and she mentioned the possibility of being given EMDR. 

I have read about it, and would like to know of anyones positive experiences of EMDR.

I am not asking for people to just say ""it didn't work for me""

 more of the ""It improved me because of ................""

I have been warned that the therapy may threaten to resolve parts of my traumatic memory that I do not want to lose. By this I mean that because of my PTSD is related to both physical pain, and being in love. I have mixed pain and love totally, and whereas I want the pain bit to be gotten rid of, I have no wish for the loving part to go as well.

any help?"
664,"And the point of my existence is?
Fuck it. All of it. Comparing me. No. I cannot take it. Its been building and building. I can hardly sit still for five fucking minutes. What is the point. I know i have to continue anyway but i basically died that day. I was already dead. Im just a shell with shit inside. Nothing much left. Cannot go away this weekend. Cannot even be with peopke. Go away. Door shut. I cannot keep going with this shit. Im exhausted. I never get a day off. Im an idiot. It was all my doing and they were right about me. They all think im a pathetic loser. There you go. I spout bollocks am i allowed to swear. Sorry. Fucked off. No strnger than that. Im gutted. Heartbroken and lost. I cant cope. On the edge. Im going to have to take a pill now and be dribbling tomorrow. Stop comparing me with others. Whay happened to me was wrong wrong wrong wrong. All of it. Wrong. Why. Why. Stop comparing me. Just because you cant see how i feel. You cant see my thoughts. Im always on the edge. Im exhausted. Every day. No telief for four years."
665,":low:
This is going to be hard, I hate talking about myself and I really struggle to ask for advice or help. I'm surprised I was brave enough to even join a forum if I'm honest but everyone had been supportive thus far so I have been reassured slightly.

I really don't know where to start or whether this is even the correct forum to write in. I have never told anyone other than my best friend and also my psychologist about this.  I don't have a diagnosis because I can't tell the doctors too much, due to fear.  I'm scared she'll find this, oh god why am I doing this... 


_________________________________________________


My entire life I have been the subject of intense abuse from my mother who only left the family home three years ago when I was 20 years old. My mother can only be described as a very manipulative and very controlling woman to put it mildly, if things did not go her way then all hell would be directed toward me. 
She often told me from when I was a very young child, that I deserved to die , that she should have killed and disposed of me when I was born. She justified this by informing me that she almost died in child birth (which was untrue) and was therefore entitled to treat me how she did because I should be grateful for my existence. I was often beaten with the same justification given and on multiple occasions she attempted to take my life but was stopped by my sister. 

My mother cheated on my dad when I was seven years old. All hell broke lose, arguments, furniture being smashed. It was horrendous and I can't talk about it. When she returned back to family home she came back even more determined to ruin my life and blamed me for my dad 'turning against her'. I developed anorexia nervosa and OCD during the next few years using  self harm in order to find some control. 
Her campaign became stronger as she carted me off to the doctors at the age of 10 due to my unhealthy eating habits and the fact I was completely emaciated. She did not do this to get me help, rather she did it because she knew I was scared of the doctors. I was given no diagnosis because I was too scared to tell the truth, so I was sent away and prescribed something to make me gain weight. After this appointment her threats became more extreme. The threat of being locked up by 'them'  was first given and to this day I am convinced they will find me if I self harm or fail to commit suicide. I don't know who they are but I know they exist. 

I was often called an attention seeker and told I was making up my moods and behaviours to get attention. If I was ever low she'd tell me they were coming to get me, which led to panic attacks and a refusal on my behalf to ever go to seek help until I was almost 21. Sometimes she'd be nice, be like a real mom is supposed to be for a few days, buy me small gifts and such but this never lasted and she'd use everything nice she did as justification for her being abusive again. She told who ever would listen that I was in fact a problem child and that it was I that beat her. I actually never even defended myself till I was 13, which was the worst thing I ever did because then she ammunition against me. Any bruises from a fight she broke up between me and my sister, she'd show off as evidence I was evil to whoever she could, even random people on the bus. She even lied to my dad, he was made to discipline me because after all she was his wife and he should defend her. No one believed me when I told them what she did, no one ever believed me, they believed her.  It scares me how much she was able to manipulate people and make them believe her. It scares me how much power she had, she still has . My sister still has contact with her you see and I am aware she now seeks help from the doctors for 'domestic violence' and 'abuse' none of which she has actually ever suffered with. If she can convince them, she can convince anyone of anything even now. :panic:

When she left three years ago she did so in the worst possible way, she cheated on my dad again and it was back to being seven again. I can't talk about what happened and the intensity of the arguments and how she behaved because it's too much for me at the moment.

My self esteem is none existent, I hate myself and the very ground I walk on. I struggle to form relationships and I am extremely sensitive to criticism. I freak out when someone rings the doorbell in a certain way and often find myself dissociating for hours when triggered by many things. I could never have contact with her again, last time I saw her I had a panic attack , even her name gives me panic attacks. I don't know what to do, I'm sorry for being a burden and talking about myself so much I really am. This isn't even half of everything she's done either.  

I have so many things wrong with me , I feel like I'm making it all up. I sometimes can't see the point of even trying any more because when one thing gets help another thing just takes its place. I need to know what to do, who to ask for help because it affects me and triggers my mood disorder. Does anyone have any advice?
I'm sorry for this long post, I'm so sorry. 

Bethe xx"

Still as painful
Gaps of information i try and try to remember
I wake up and it comes and makes me feel sick.
It hurts so badly. Makes me want to harm self as i cannot bear the pain.

Self talk. Too overwhelmed.

My brain feels fuzzy and it's really hard to think what I need to do or what I've done and to reason through things WHICH I NEED TO DO :cry: I constantly feel on the verge of a panic attack and/or a flashback. If I try to sleep I lie there with my heart racing or get stuck with my body asleep and my mind having flashbacks. I really want to self harm in the hope that it will help me to stay present, calm me down and take away some of the guilt for not doing enough work. But I have promised that I will talk to Katie before I do and I can't justify it unless I'm feeling desperate. I am, but I don't think she'll understand because there is something I can do about it ie work. I have bought a load of lucozade and relentless to do work but this might just string me out even more.

They did tell me that when I was being tortured all those years ago into believing my mate had died, that it was something that was bound to happen given the circumstances,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the words to start this isn't coming easily. I don't know where to start, it's all such a mess and I don't even understand it all myself. 

Late February my youngest daughter very neatly died having got Toxic Shock Syndrome, something so rare that many doctors hadn't seen it for years. Anyway, going back to when she first started getting ill I remembered the doctors saying ""IF she gets ill following the burn, get her seen by a medical professional as soon as possible as it may be TSS, although extremely unlikely, but just to be safe"". Now me being me, I instantly looked the symptoms of TSS on Google, just in case. 

24 hours following this my daughter became extremely drowsy and didn't want to eat her dinner, which was extremely unlike her. Although she was less than a year old at the time, she loved and still does love a big plate full of food. I didn't have a thermometer with me, but to touch her she felt hot. Don't get me wrong, at this stage she just looked like a tired baby girl, not blatantly ill. I guess my main concern was the fact that she just wanted to sleep. She was never a good sleeper and after sleeping 4 hours during a car journey just before dinner, I knew that she would be full of beans if she was okay, most likely up until midnight. If only. 

After half an hour or so of trying to figure out what to do I called the burns unit and explained her symptoms. The told me that if she appeared mildly ill then to just keep a close eye on her or take her to A&E, but if she seemed extremely ill to call the ambulance. To look at she looked mildly ill but I just knew she wasn't right, I knew that something was going so strangely wrong. My husband suggested that we take her to bed and see how she is the morning. I guess I contemplated doing so for a few seconds, but something just didn't feel right. 

The ambulance crew arrived and made me feel like I was crazy. I remember them saying ""aww, she's smiling now look"", though they agreed to take her in I could tell that they were put out by it and didn't think it was necessary. The ambulance crew remained in a joking and light hearted kind of mood while we took the hour drive to the hospital (no blue lights), all the while I saw my baby deteriorating and they saw a paranoid mother with a daughter who had a common cold. My husband remained at home to care for our eldest daughter. 

We finally arrived at the hospital and saw the triage nurse almost instantly. I explained everything and she started checked my daughters temperature, blood pressure, etc etc. I raised my deep concerns about the possibility of her having TSS, the nurse didn't say anything. We were put in at none emergency but needed to be seen within the hour as her temperature was above 38. 

We were eventually taken in to see the doctor and again I expressed my deep and ever growing concerns about it being TSS. He told me that it was too early for it to be TSS and that it's most likely just a virus. I explained that the burns unit thought otherwise and that I had read the symptoms and knew that although unlikely, it COULD be TSS. He told me that he was the doctor and knew what he was talking about. My daughter at this point was barely able to hold her own head up and I became hysterical. The doctor took swabs from her throat, convinced it was viral, and told us to go back and wait in the waiting room as he needed to see somebody else. I told him that something was wrong, something was so wrong but all he did was saying ""I'm not denying that something is wrong, you are in A&E, she's obviously not quite herself"". I hopelessly left the room and walked around the waiting area shaking, crying and cuddling my poor, poor baby. Nurse after nurse asked if I was okay, every time I shook my head and they just looked at me and walked away. 

A short while later I contacted my husband and told him how worried and scared I was while crying, he told me that it was probably nothing to worry about but he'd make his way to us. 

Our daughter started with diarrhoea and sickness. I felt so lost. Why wouldn't they listen to me? She looked awful, surely not only I could see that?

Eventually we were taken into another room and they started trying to get a cannula into her to take some blood. It was awful. They poked and prodded her for so long, taking forever to get a cannula in her. At this point I noticed a rash on her tummy and told the nurse. Nothing much was said about it, it just seemed like we were going through the motions, but nobody was rushing, it wasn't a medical emergency in their eyes, they didn't see it. We were left alone and I held my baby tight, trying to breastfeed her but not really able to because she was so drowsy. Some time after, my husband arrived. He also could now see that she looked very ill and something certainly wasn't right. 

Not long after my husbands arrival the plastics doctor arrived (a man who sees a deal with TSS). He knew straight away and told us that she needed to go straight to theatre to get her wound surgically cleaned and scrubbed and then she would be moved to the intensive care unit. Finally, somebody else knew! I felt so relieved yet so, so petrified. My baby, not even a year old was going to theatre, how could this be right? How did this happen? Am I dreaming? Please tell me I am, PLEASE. So many emotions crossed my mind, all still there, still fresh in my memory. Watching the surgeons put your baby to sleep is absolutely horrific, and just not knowing if I would ever see her beautiful blue eyes again. I hesitantly left surgery and held my husband while he held me. I remember thinking that even if she comes out of surgery, ICU is where people go to die, right? That's where the most critically ill people go, the ones that people expect to die. 

The first time I saw her laid in her cot in ICU was heartbreaking. She had so, so many wires coming from her, too many to even imagine. Machines were beeping, a machine was breathing for her, how could this be true? She was happily smiling and laughing just the day before. 

Slowly but surely she began to stabilise a little, but still remained on the machines, still on what seemed like hundreds of antibiotics, having blood pressure medication, a drip, a feeding tube, she had every possible medical equipment attached to her tiny little body. I'm not certain how long she has been in, but I remember her hands and feet being stone cold, her body had gone in to shock and all I could do was desperately try to warm her tiny hands and feet.

My husband and I were allowed to stay in the hospital and could visit her bedside at any hour, that was a wonderful thing to be able to do, to have a quiet space and place to sleep upstairs but I wished we wasn't there, I didn't want it to be happening to us. It wasn't fair. 

I can't specify days, but she went back to surgery to get her wound cleaned again and eventually got her skin grafted. That week in ICU felt like a lifetime, like we had been there our whole lives, but eventually they took her off the paralysis and sedation and I could finally cuddle my beautiful angel. It was like holding her for the first time again. 

After one night off the paralysis and sedation she was quickly moved to a ward as she wasn't critical anymore. Hallelujah, I hear you say? Well, you'd thing so. I hated it. In ICU I knew that she was getting the upmost best care, I knew that her heart was beating and what could be monitored was being monitored. It was somewhat comforting, in a strange kind of way. To me it felt like she was still incredibly ill but now I was expected to care for her, almost single handedly. She was still so sleepy, so drowsy, still had a rash, still needed blood pressure medication and antibiotics, her skin was peeling, she still was so, so unwell and I hadn't expected, I'm not sure why. I really struggled with her being on that ward, there were dozens of children running around, playing, laughing, joking yet my baby just wanted to sleep and wouldn't eat, how could this be the place for her, she didn't fit in here, these children don't look ill! One morning I remember going back to ICU and begging to registrar to take my baby back, insisting that she wasn't ready for her ward, begging for them to look after her. I pleaded. Of course, they didn't take her back in there and she did start to play, to eat, to become my baby again, it was such a relief to see. Although it sounds astoundingly bizarre to beg for your daughter to go into ICU, I so wanted her to be back in their care. 

She eventually came home and it was amazing to see her and her sister reunited. It made me appreciate every precious second with them. Although I was so thrilled, I hates anybody but me touching her. Especially my Mum. I was worried that people would 'infect her', they couldn't possibly be clean enough to touch my baby. I cringed at the idea of letting her crawl on the floor, but I had no choice, I had to let her have fun. 

I guess that's where the negative thoughts started, that when I realised that things can and do go horribly wrong and there is nothing I or anybody else can do to prevent it. I started reliving every moment, crying while doing so, obsessing over my hatred for the doctor that I felt called me a liar, filled with the thoughts of 'what if I would have taken her to bed that night? Would she still be alive?', probably not. Now, while I can see that it's normal and rational to think that I did take her in, I did get her help eventually, I can't stop myself from thinking 'what if I hadn't', and that haunts me. Even now when she reaches milestones like saying new words, walking, and generally amazing me I think how wonderful that is, but at the same time I feel so sad that she nearly wasn't here to do that, and I go right back to that waiting room. 

These feelings have been going on for a few months now. Some days I lay and I cry about it, or quietly shed a tear when I look at her, other times I feel a deep sadness but can contain my emotions. I'm now 16 weeks pregnant and I feel so unstable and so unlike myself. A few weeks ago I wanted an abortion (something I am TOTALLY against) and I begged my husband to agree to us doing it, thankfully he didn't agree and I continued on, but I still can't bare the idea of this baby being born and then nearly dying on me, or worse, actually dying. I'm petrified. The pain just won't go and I find myself wanting to escape the thoughts at all costs. At the same time I wanted an abortion, I also decided I wanted to go to university to study counselling, to focus my mind on something new, to help heal me. Although, now, only a few weeks later I hate the idea of going to university, I don't want that, I don't want to spend hours upon hours away from my husband and babies. Never. But at the time, I thought with all my heart that I wanted both those things. 

Here goes with the hardest bit of all. The biggest regret of my life. The story here begins with me wanted to talk about what happened to my baby, wanting people to know and understand how awful I feel, but nobody understands, not really. I told my husband that I wasn't coping, but he just told me that ""she's okay, look at her, YOU saved her"", but that's not what I see, that's not what I feel. He suggested I see a counsellor about it all, but I instantly shrugged the idea off and told him that wasn't necessary. I then went on to tell my closest friend how I felt and she repeated what my husband said, and I can't ever bare to hear it, let alone believe it. I mentioned it a few times afterwards, but I felt that they didn't understand, they wasn't telling me what I wanted to hear (although truthfully, I don't know what I want to hear) I felt like I was on a downward spiral because I couldn't stop thinking about it, but I also wanted somebody to listen to what I said, to just say ""yeah, that makes sense"", it's so hard to explain, I don't even understand, and I know I'm not making any sense at all. I don't really have any friends anymore, completely out of choice (typical introvert) and that sits well with me, but I guess it isn't so great when you need a friend to talk to. Anyway, I can see that I'm trying to avoid actually telling you the next part, but it's so hard to explain, so hard for even me to believe.....

While I was going through the abortion, university, downward spiral thing I started speaking to my ex online, an awful man, who I know is awful, but I initiated conversation and started telling him what had happened. He wasn't supportive, he just said that what I said made sense, and I liked having somebody the vent at. The conversation lasted a couple of days and he would ask how things were, what I was up-to, etc, and I would reply and say what I thought of that particular day. The conversations weren't anything shy of basic, but I felt like I was being listened to. Idiotic of me, I know. Remember I told you that this guy is awful, well it's true, I know it and he knows that I know it. He rambled on some about his life, how he was so much more mature than when I knew him and how he was enjoying life, blah, blah. 

On one particular day, just a couple after I had started speaking with him he asked what I was doing on that day, I explained that I was going to a well known and very big shopping centre with my Mum, again just the usual chit chat. A few hours later I went to reply to his previous message and he explained that he was also going to be there and we could meet up. I knew I should say no, but I guess a chat in a busy shopping centre wouldn't cause any harm, right? My battery was low so I said ok and asked him where I should meet him, he instantly replied and told me to go to a specific room what is intended for talking, I agreed and I went. I don't know why I went, because now I feel sick that I went, I don't even like the guy, seriously, I don't. I felt like I was in a bubble, that's the only way I can explain. 

After a few minutes of arriving he made a move on me, and for a minute or so, I let him. I remember him being near me and feeling physically sick, wanting my husband to come and rescue me, not knowing what to do. I felt like I had come out of my 'bubble'. I pushed him away, told him I love my husband and ran away crying. What was happening to me, I thought. When I look back now I feel so physically sick, so ashamed, so awful, so alone. Words cannot describe it. 

I eventually told my husband of my deception and he is of course devastated and cannot understand why I did it, why he isn't good enough. But the truth is, I don't know why I did it? My marriage is and feels PERFECT! So why did I do it? Why did I want to kill my unborn baby? Why did I want to go away and study? Why did I take to 'him'? Why did I let him take advantage of me? I want to understand my actions, my thoughts, but I don't, I truly don't. My husband keeps saying ""how can you not know?"", but I don't, I don't understand. I feel like I was another person, a crazy unrecognisable person and it makes no sense, no sense at all. My husband IS amazing, he is. I adore him! There have been many times that I've cried because he had to go to work, watched him sleep, laid in his arms for hours and hours, laughed with him, all the wonderful things about marriage we had right up until now. So why did I talk with my ex? Nobody believes me when I say that I think my marriage is perfect, because I wouldn't have done it otherwise, but it is perfect. 

Right now I feel completely unstable again. The pain I have caused in my marriage I unbearable, it hurts so bad to see my husband so devastated, it hurts so bad not to be able to hold him, cuddle him, kiss him, laugh with him, make love to him. I hurts so bad :'( Two days ago I took an overdose, I couldn't bare the pain, couldn't bare not understanding my actions, couldn't bare that I had done this to us. I still can't. My husband called an ambulance and I discharged myself from hospital, saying that I wouldn't do it again, although not quite believing that myself, not really. I didn't want to die as such, I just wanted to disappear into a coma, stop my husband from feeling pain every time he looked at me. It's so hard. So incredibly hard. What is wrong with me? Is it PTSD as suggested by the doctor? Is it Bipolar? It's something, I know it's something, what what? What is wrong? I have symptoms of Bipolar, but not many. I believe that the unobtainable is obtainable. I believe and want to move home in a day, I want to buy a boat and live on it, and sometimes I believe my husband can pack work in and do that, but he won't. Right now I know it isn't possible, certainly not right now, but when it's in my mind I feel so frustrated that we can't do it! I sometimes get spates of lack of energy, no interest in going anything, irritable, feeling despair, ugly, disgusting and have illogical thoughts. I guess the thing that puts me off it being Bipolar is that I don't really go manic, alright I want and I feel I can achieve the unobtainable and get so frustrated when it doesn't happen, but that's all. 

I feel so scared. I'm seeing a counsellor on Monday, but I don't see how she can make me feel better? 

I want my husband SO much. Why did I do this? Why do I feel like I don't even recognise my own actions? 

I'm sorry for such a long post, but I really needed to get it out there. So if you're still here, thank you."
672,"Hi, is any body out there? I wrote yesterday about feeling so lost and so overwhelmed by my PTSD, I read around all sorts of posts last night & think that the lost feeling that kicked in when it all started going wrong again, the feeling that the lights are on but no one home, is disassociation. So I can put a name to it, don't make it feel better. My problems are complex in that I have PTSD because I had a very bad 5 years, my husband got badly beaten up, then they sacked him & his attacker from the best job he had ever had, because he had reported his attacker as being unstable & dangerous before so they claimed the camera was not working in that area & as there was no proof who did what they were both sacked. It was to prevent a claim but it shattered our world. A little over a year before that my best friend died, then 6 weeks later I had routine tests done in hospital which went wrong, I developed an aneurism, had emergency surgery to repair that, that went wrong, to cut it short I nearly bled to death at home, got no real help, more surgery, infection & left disabled needing a wheelchair to get out the house. We lived in a big house in suburbs, I couldn't do stairs and couldn't cope, but my mother who has lived with us for 17 years & is the most evil b**** who ever walked the face of the earth refused to move. We had 21 weeks without money when the dss couldn't process our claim and I had to sell loads of stuff just for us to eat. The cat got run over and died. My youngest got arrested for drug dealing & we had a police raid at 3am. It turned out the surgeon who operated on me was struck off pending appeal. The after 3 years next door decided to build an extension which would have left our sitting room completely in the dark unless we extended too. At this point mother agreed to move. My beloved dog died and then we sold the house but lost £80,000 20% of its value because of the extension. We moved to a big bungalow that needed work & the workmen stole my jewellery box which had all the family bits in it as well as every bit I had been bought in my life apart from what I had to sell to keep body and soul together when the dss didn't pay us. I'm not allowed to drive because to control the pain from the nerve damage to my leg I am on morphine.  For ages after we moved I saw no-one, weeks and months, because we had moved to a new area. I had had no treatment mental or physical from nhs because all they were interested in was protecting themselves from being sued. I had a good gp but got nothing from the hospital. I put on loads of weight. I met a woman who I didn't know but who told me all about a society in the town we moved to and who wanted me to get involved and do some research for her, & to get involved in a new project. I suppose I was so vulnerable at this point she saw me coming & used me to further her own political ambitions. She used me to make herself look good and made me look bad. After that I got treated so badly by her, & some of the locals, I later found out she is bpd & hadstopped her medication, but that didn't change what she done to me. Eventually I got some help but then my ""quota"" of treatment dried up & now all I have is a support group who don't do any supporting.
I do go out once a week to the library but if I want to go anywhere my husband has to be available because even a cab down to the library which is 1 mile away costs £15 the only other contact with the human race is the support group. The main day for the group is Tuesdays and I just got a message saying that all the members of the group will be at meetings or events tomorrow so there will not be a meeting tomorrow. Mt hubby hs turned down a night shift so he could take me, so we have lost money & when I went on Thursday to the group no one mentioned meetings, or events. I know some people there don't like me, there are people there I don't like too! But the group is run by service users for service users so it really is a case of the lunatics running the asylum!
 The trouble is with that there is no one to be professional, no one to ensure that rules are abided by, & strange things happen when members who suffer from hypermania or mania make decisions, when the depressives are left to make the decisions nothing much happens.  I have witnessed other people being treated badly by the volunteers, I think some of it is that being a rural area the mileage they can claim adds up to a fair amount of money along with other expenses. The main leader openly admits that he has no other income apart from his expenses because his wife works, so if they feel threatened in any way then they will try to protect their position. 
Because I use a wheelchair, I feel excluded from some activities. The group receives funding from the NHS so I think I should be entitled to join in, but the manic person has donated a bus & an allotment to them, when I asked about the allotment being accessible it clearly isn't but they just treat me as being awkward. One of the volunteers who plainly doesn't like me has a disabled husband & he has a very expensive electric wheelchair which can deal with terrains that my manual one can't but if he can do something then she says it is good enough.
I know I am not being paranoid, I know that some of them don't like me & I know when people are trying to exclude me. I am not allowed to go out into the garden because the access is through the kitchen & they have decided it is dangerous for a wheelchair to go through there. They all go through there, & the kitchen is only used for making tea well away from the route through it. One of the nice women there tried to improve the access by putting some wood either side of the threshold so I could get in and out but they said that wasn't allowed either. 
I'm so lonely, yet I can't do anything to make things better, I can't make friends because people seem to know I am mentally ill, however hard I try. I cannot get out by myself, I just knit & sew & watch crap on the telly. I even feel scared that writing this on here someone will decide that it is not allowed & I will be excluded from somewhere else. I don't know what I want, I just try to keep the lid on & keep all the feelings under control, I don't want to upset anyone, I am the same person I was before all this happened and the same person I was before I had to use a wheelchair. If you are in a wheelchair you seem to have to be polite and never answer back, if I complain, politely about anything, if I politely ask someone to move a car from a disabled space or that is blocking a cross over then I seem to deserve a tirade of abuse, when women use the only disabled toilet in IKea to change their baby when there are 8 baby changes in the building then when I complain I am the problem. I don't like the new me & I don't like living like this, I've had enough
Sorry if I have gone on a bit, just wanted to say it, I'm fed up of nightmares, flashbacks, fed up of being scared & fed up with being disabled"
673,"I have had PTSD for 5 years, took 3 1/2 years to get referred for help, had to wait for a year on waiting list and by then was such a mess that the 26 weeks treatment the health authority allowed was mostly spent trying to get me in a suitable state for treatment, the aim being for me to have EMDR. Tried a session of it but with buzzy things in my hands not eye movements. Then my allocation run out so got to have 6 months theraputic break before I go on waiting list again but only get 18 sessions this time. 
I go to a support group for anxiety and depression but gradually I am coping less and less. The group has a mix of people and at least one of the volunteers plainly doesn't like me, one of the group users is a strange woman who seems to disapprove of everuthing I say. I don't think I am being paranoid, so the support I get from the group is limited. 
Twenty years ago I had very severe post natal depression brought on in the main by my husbands family, we haven't seen or spoken to them for 17 years but suddenly they have popped up and some of them want to be friends again and I can't cope.
My PTSD is about doctors/hospitals/form filling/bleeding/vulnerability. Now I feel as though ""me"" has left the building. Ever since his family reappeared. 
I feel totally empty inside, can't hold a cpnversation, don't want to speak to anyone in the flesh or on phone, won't go out. If I watch TV then the flashbacks to my PTSD come thick and fast far worse than normal. 
I have not got the energy for this. Don't understand the logic of spending 26 weeks getting me ready to open up then dumping me and letting me get ill again. Don't know what is happening, why I have switched off, don't know how to fight back anymore.
Does any of this make sense to any one?"
674,"Before I begin this I would just like to say there is a strong trigger warning about child sexual abuse, and please do not read this if you think you could be triggered. I am writing this to help me get out what I want to say to the one that abused me...




















Dear Dad 

It feels weird to even call you dad for a father figure does not behave and treat kids the way you treated me. You set no boundaries and I blamed myself for so long for not having clear boundaries as a child. Children imitate role models!!! I have not been able to recognise in past and many relationships that I was being abused not loved. I was only a child, you should have been the responsible adult! But you sexually abused me many times throughout my childhood, I didn't know it was abuse back then, and you rationalized in your head that it was okay to do this to me, but it wasn't okay, I am much older now and didn't know until the past few weeks that I have been suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, which has caused so many problems in life what with all the anxiety, fear depression, dissociation... let's talk about dissociation just for a minute, YOU made me do this as a form of protecting myself from potential danger, a way to escape... now as an adult I can't stop dissociating and I didn't even know until a few weeks ago dissociation existed and other people didn't just zone out too... it's made me very angry that you are the main source to my problems and I've only just figured this out

Your sincerely

The daughter you have destroyed"
675,"They're worse again and flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, self doubt, it's all going round and round in my head, what I'd like to do to those horrible people and wish would happen to them.  Apart from that I've been taking the meds, trying to do a bit more to regain some sort of balance in life for some of the time to try make it all stop, small breaks are better then none at all and don't know why I'm writing this, just having a good old grumble

It happened again whilst typing this post the word paedophile came up....hell knows what else they said on the tv...."

If all depends on how your womb is situation.

My three sisters and I all had inverted wombs.   Which means we had a hard birth anyway.   So why the bleeder..... ooops excuse me search my brains for an answer to any one's problems, but did anyone else ever tell you to lie on your back and push uphill when giving birth?   Or did anyone else have an idiot of a quack causing your back pain to disappear by giving you morphine when the pain is sent to tell you where you are in your disposal of labour?

Did anyone else ever notice, when in maternity, how many boys were having their tails cropped because of the explosion of males born without a penis, testicles or assumed dirls.

Did anything happen to you to cause you to PTS over to the Queer ones for a prescription when you were bleeding abdabs to all around yo for the facks sar

In my opinion The birth pill causes deformities in chilts reproductive systems and are in fact the culpurable system of disposal of mankind.

682,"Please avoid if easily triggered by sexual abuse. Really could use support. It's not actually detailed...
But it still could trigger. I don't know.








I've been having horrible, horrible flashbacks. I know some things happened to me but they didn't happen to ME, they happened to an alter. Which I know is still me, but not me. I get flashbacks of these. I hate Dan. I hate D. I hate R. I hate everyone who has hurt me. I wish I could die so I would get away from them. Especially D. He is still in my life as he's my cousin and lives in the same town. The one I'm really afraid of is Dan. He's my biological father. He did horrible, horrifying things to me. Everything that I go through is mainly his fault. 

I hear his voice. Saying horrible things to me. I haven't seen him in 12 years. I'm adopted by my dad. I want to pack up and leave. Or...kill myself. But then it gives Dan the satisfaction of that. 

Nobody knows what I went through. Some people knows parts of it. Nobody knows the actual extent of it....I want to know I'm okay."
683,"Because of my illness I have done mad things and get looks and I know people think less of me because of it. On my weak days I sit and worry about how one looks at me .Sad isn't it. I know if they new everything they would change towards me and I know if they went through what I went through they to would be emotionally disturbed .There are people in my area who knows what I went through ,I just hope they fight my corner .I am a nice guy just my emotions are messed up because of severe abuse. makes me angry at times."
684,"I have a question for anyone seeing a shrink....
I saw my therapist this week, and just like every week I see her I'm super low now, I'm tired, I'm raw,  I feel like I took a belt sander to my feelings, my flashbacks are stronger after I see her, it's like opening a door and not being able to close it and all those horrible things I swore I'd never think about or remember are rushing to escape
I'm not sure I'm strong enough to keep them in there anymore"
685,"This is the best I have felt in years. Soon as a bad thought or doubt come in my head I pushed it out .I feel at one ,been lonely but its been good.

   Hope you all had a good day too."
686,"Because my parents dressed well spoke well and were very polite they got away with years of abuse. My mother would keep me home when I was marked from a stick ,belt ,iron, poker, heal of a shoe or whatever came to hand.
   After a beating I was bought loads of chocolate and  cake. Guilt I put that down to.I am writing this down because of a memory I had when I came in from school once and I put the radio on, my father came running down stairs and beat me about the head. When my sister came in done the same thing but twice as loud as I had it my father came running down stairs again seen it was my sister and walked back up stairs like if nothing happened .
   I am so angry with the authorities ,teachers ,police ,probation because they seen and new a lot but did nothing .Back in the 70s all this happened when sexual abusive people had a field day and beatings from parents was mostly the norm.I was so stressed from my fathers constant bullying I chewed all the skin of my knuckles .Once I punched 20 windows in the police station screaming for help only for the desk sargent phoned for my parents to pick me up and take me to hospital .
     Writing this helps me makes some sense but I can tell you this ,ignore abused children and they will become nasty, withdrawn ,violent individuals the pain never goes away just learn to cope but there are times emotions becomes to overwhelming .
    My life is now ruined cant deal with people find evil in everything ,scared for life."
687,"I was involved with a person for a year. The relationship was psychologically abusive, which lead me to develop:

- Hallucinations;
I was seeing blood on any visible body part, and this lasted for 10+ months. 

- Flashbacks;
Certain things would remind me of feeling horrified, and I'd break down. 

- Nightmares;
I'd wake up in an instant, afraid for my life and was on guard every single time. My heart was racing as well. 

- Detachment;
I felt as though I couldn't relate or feel close to my family. It was like my body, wasn't my body anymore. Mind was clouded for months. 

Even now, 16+ months after, I still find myself on edge. I still cannot fully feel connected to people as much as I'd like, and I break down as well - especially at night when those thoughts of terror start. Always had to wrestle violent implements away from my former lover, and it's still difficult to deal with; this has even put a strain on my current relationship. Terrified that they'll die, that I'll be the reason they do."
688,Hi. I know someone who has PTSD. He male in his 40s. He was abused by his dad when he was a child. I goto a day centre in town and he was also reffered. We are friends but he is is really beginning to piss me of with the shit that comes out of his mouth... Ok I understand the PTSD but I don't understand why he is saying things about him as its not true..he's on medication. But he keeps saying he's got things wrong with him and it gets a bit much as he wants everyone to hear him. Keeps saying he mite have cancer. One week he says he has testicular cancer and the following week he says he's got a lump under his arm that maybe cancerous. Then he says he had.his stomach pumped but then came to the centre the day after. Other people have noticed his behavior too but were not sure how to tell him its all lies. What do I do or say as I just can't take it anymore. Makes me mad x
689,"these bloody flashbacks just jump out at me all the time.

I see the catholic priests spreading their endless hatred of gays,and it sends me back 40 years to find myself as a young boy being told how evil and diseased I was.

I hear men on the radio describing their past histories of the sexual abuses they endured.

I want to shout ""I was abused my the whole church and medical profession"" but because they just fucked with my mind and not my body who is listening?

I see people being electrocuted in a film (Taken) and I am instantly returned to the electric chair.

I have to be wary of what I see or hear. Sitting in the dentists chair, laid back in a position where I have to withstand the pain, and  thinking of other times past.
Hell I went for an eye test the other day and had to stop because I was sat in a chair and being told to look up at a whitescreen."
690,"I all, new here. Among depression and anxiety issues, my therapist says I have PTSD stemming from the death of my father 6 years ago. It wasn't a sudden, traumatic death (well, of course it was traumatic...) but he was diagnosed with cancer in September and died that December. I'm still not over it, to the point where I feel like I'm almost obsessive over it/him. We were very close, and the loss of him colors every waking aspect of my life. 

My question is, I thought PTSD was brought on my something such as an act of violence, being at war...things like that. If I saw him being hit by a car or something, I wouldn't doubt PTSD. But...I don't know. I'm just wondering if THIS is what it is. Maybe it would help me deal easier with my issues if I could put a name to it. I do have panic attacks, depression, been in a day program and the local hospital, etc. I'm just trying to find answers I guess...

Thanks! =)"

693,"I was sexually abused for a couple years while I was young. The person who did the first abuse is my cousin who is 8 years older than I am. He was 16, I was 8. I haven't seen him since before I was hospitalized in April 2012. He has two existing children, one on the way. His son is turning five the 18th of February. They are having a birthday party tomorrow (Saturday). I'm so very nervous about seeing my cousin. Every time I see him I have horrible flashbacks. Then I feel guilty for several days. His daughter is turning 8 this year. 

He's 30 now, I'm hoping he's grown up. I can't shake the feeling he's abusing his daughter. I didn't tell anyone until I was 18. My mom didnt believe me (long story). Nothing legal has happened to him. 

But the point of my post is how do I survive seeing my cousin and the forthcoming flashbacks?"
694,"Hi everyone

I was just wondering if PTSD can be brought on by traumatic (or very stressful) life events other than the usual ones (ie; war, abuse, rape, torture, the death of a loved one, natural disaster, etc). For example, can PTSD be brought on by an event such as the loss of a beloved pet?. How about multiple traumatic events all occurring within the same year like the loss of a pet, a relative becoming ill and you becoming homeless?. Can multiple traumatic/stressful events accumulate to the point where they become overwhelming and finally trigger PTSD?. Also, is it possible that one person might develop PTSD as a result of fighting in a war while another, more susceptible person might develop PTSD over something as seemingly benign as performing badly on stage and suffering a huge embarrassment?. Does the traumatic event have to be *major* before it can cause PTSD?. Are our PTSD triggers and thresholds for what brings it on different for all of us or does it have to be something like war, rape, torture, etc before PTSD is triggered?.

Now a little about me and my story.

I am a middle-aged male who had a pretty rough childhood. I was diagnosed with ADHD at some point as a child and put on ritalin. Anyway, I ended up in various orphanages, foster homes, Psych hospitals, out on the streets for years at a time, etc. Eventually I got myself together (somewhat) and have been fairly stable ever since. I have a history of alcohol abuse but have been completely clean for about 3 years. I also have little in the way of an outside support system since I suffer from social anxiety and rarely leave the house.

All went well for a long time but as I grew older I was diagnosed with GAD, OCD, Panic Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Tourettes, etc. Then, over a year ago I had about 4-5 very traumatic experiences almost back-to-back. The loss of a pet, a life-long friend began having serious health issues, a close relative was seriously injured and several more which I'd rather not talk about at the moment because they are very triggering.

As a result of these traumatic events (and others which I have chosen not to discuss) I began to feel less secure, less safe, less trusting, more paranoid, more fearful, more anxious, always on alert and planning/preparing in advance for the next threat that might pop up, horrendous nightmares almost every night that completely drained me during the day, a ""survivalist"" mentality, very vigilant, a feeling of hopelessness and loss of control, small stressors get blown out of proportion, lots of worrying about every little thing - even things I never used to worry about, etc.

The nightmares are the absolute worst part of all this. They are so intense, detailed and vivid and often they very loosely reflect the things that are going on in my real life but with a cruel twist. Just as a purely fictitious example, if I had an appointment with the dentist for a tooth extraction, instead of having a normal reaction, I might have nightmares with an evil twist where as the dentist is pulling my tooth, he might suddenly slip and stab me in the eye with the pliers (or whatever they are called). A few nights later, I might have the same dream but the dentist has me on the floor choking me. This might go on for weeks leading up to the appointment and even after the appointment I might still have the nightmares - even though the appointment went just fine.

These nightmares seem to come in waves and always seem to revolve around hiding, escaping, sorting, complex and unsolvable tasks, impossible problem solving, repetitive searching/seeking, catch-22 events, losing things, etc. Then, I wake up the next morning completely exhausted and usually feel really run-down, anxious, lousy and dazed (out of it) for the rest of the day. Sometimes I lose track of time and it becomes difficult just to function. Sometimes I wake up in a full-blown panic attack and can feel the adrenalin rushing through me.

Can anyone relate to any (or all) of this?. To all of you who suffer from PTSD - does this sound like what you experience?. Does it sound familiar?. I seem to have many of the risk factors, triggers and co-morbid conditions but I wanted to get opinions directly from those of you who already suffer from PTSD.

PS: I have seen many specialists over the years and plan to see a Pdoc soon. I'm here now  because I'm trying to find out if anyone can relate and because I very much need support from people who are going through the things that I am going through and from all I've read, it sound a lot like I'm going through PTSD just like the people here.

Thanks so much for your time and input. I really appreciate it a LOT!."
695,"when i was in hospital a few people were on anti phycotics. My friend, who had ptsd quite bad was on respiration. I was wondering can they treat some of the symptoms such as seeing people (depending on your ptsd) like, my mum caused my ptsd and sometimes i see, hear, feel her and its very distressing. i know its not like a headache and you take a pain killer. but can anti psychotics treat ptsd?"
696,"to let all this go, just let it all drift away:) xxx"
697,"This is my first post. I'll be honest and say that I'm nervous about it. I haven't really shared much of this besides inklings and hints with anyone. I am an Army vet who served three years as a combat  medic. I spent a year serving in a combat support hospital working on wounded soldiers. I transferred to a new duty station and my unit was about to deploy to Iraq and I broke my leg. My best friends went  and I didn't. Several months later (after I healed) I was assigned to a CAC unit (casualty assistance corp). My job was to travel around and provide funeral services for active duty soldiers who were KIA, as well as some retirees and vets.  I worked out of the dallas/fort worth national cemetery, but we also traveled the greater TX, MI, OK, and AZ areas. In six months I did 479 funerals. It was the worst period of my entire life. We informed families that their sons, daughters, mothers, brothers, and fathers were killed in action and provided support for some aspect of their funeral (based on what duty we were assigned to that week). I got out of the military around 1 year ago. I didn't think I had any mental health issues at the time. I was just happy to be done. But, now I believe some problems have arisen. I have trouble sleeping every night. I have dreams about soldiers I buried, and I remember details. Very specific ones. Names, or faces, what their kids were wearing at the funerals. Things people put in the caskets. And sometimes the songs that one or two of the widows wanted played at the funerals. One in particular bothers me almost daily. His best friend wrote him a song and played it at the funeral. I have trouble sleeping, focusing, I'm exhausted, and I'm irritable almost all of the time. Im a freshman (at 23) at a local university and i have trouble making friends or maintaining normal relationships, i tend to hate most people. I've opened up to a few friends and all of them either judge, or don't understand. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm not fit for life on the outside. I feel guilty for not deploying with my unit and I feel like I'm having issues for no reason. I feel like i haven't earned feeling this way. I'm just exhausted. And I can't get out of my own head. I guess i'm just looking for others who feel the same way. Some kind of connection. Maybe sharing some stories or experiences. I'm looking for an outlet to get all of this emotion out because I don't know what else to do and I figured this might help. If anyone has some words of wisdom or advice, it'd be much appreciated. Thanks"
698,"Don't know which sub forum to post this in?

I've had severe anxiety since a kid (along with a lot of other stuff). I feel it all stems from trauma prenatal/perinatal (in the womb & birth) & also the first 0-3/5 years of life - & then compounded by certain stresses & traumas growing up. This culminated in being sectioned for 4 months on a locked ward at the age of 17 - where I believe I was severely sexually abused. 

Add in a history of long term addiction, multiple hospitalisations/breakdowns, 14 years on a powerful neuroleptic drug & a catalogue of stresses & difficulties. 

I'm over 11 years sober - but still very much have a number of difficulties & struggles. I've tried everything that I can. I get very bad feelings sometimes, & a lot of anxiety & depression. I don't talk about it much with people, they just don't appear to understand. 

This past year the anxiety has been worse again - it comes in waves. 

I've been single & out of work 14 years as well, & living alone 11 years. I've also been discharged from all MH services. I get no support from any services - & it was very little before (a couple of psychiatrist appointments a year). 

This is the 5th time I've been completely discharged from all services; to go it alone. 

In 23 years I've been given 10 session with an NHS psychologist - that's been it in terms of any psychological help from the NHS. I've tried finding outside psychological help - it's all been crap. 

I do have contact with a few friends & one in particular has been very helpful. I do have things to be grateful for; but fluctuate greatly in how I feel. I don't 'act out' on any of it any more - haven't done for years - for well over 13 years I behave; I sit quietly & deal with it all. 

The loneliness & isolation is very painful sometimes. The mental health system & mainstream society has neither helped nor cared. I am very close with 2 family members, but the dynamics have always been hard & they have a lot of their own difficulties as well; although different in nature. 

I'm amicable & open with people - but find it really hard to more deeply connect with them. I often spend a lot of time on my own. It's only a few people that I feel I can really chat with - a lot of people I just have no time for. 

Is this it - a lifetime of difficulties & pain? I've tried all this on-line stuff for years - all kinds of avenues - it has severe limitations & problems - & I've been blamed, attacked, & abused by a lot of people on-line - but such are humans; I have little regard left for most of my species.   

Some days I'm content to be in my own space, in silence & stillness - to meditate & contemplate things a bit, to read a book & just be. Would be good to find more fulfilment from life however - to feel better about things - to be able to resolve things more. I'm stuck with the realisation that no one is going to do it for me - but also that I need genuine support, understanding, empathy, compassion, care & human relationships. I see such sickness in our society & people. I don't see how most are in any position to really help or understand - indeed many don't seem able to comprehend what I'm talking about - the idea of people needing genuine human kindness & care has become so Alien to them - the sociopaths & narcissists. 

I get all the usual one liners - 'Lots of people are worse off than you' - 'being in a relationship is crap & it's better being single' (can't understand why the people that say that are always in constant relationships!?) - 'everyone has problems & off days' - & on it goes. 

Pointless trying to share all this on here - I'm sat alone in a room slowly smoking myself to death. It doesn't change anything."
699,I have recently been diagnosed by my psychiatrist as having complex PTSD and he said he is referring me for EMDR. Has anyone had this treatment and was it successful? Do you have to talk about the trauma? Slightly anxious about it all and any information on this would be gratefully received!
700,"Hi all,
      New to this forum, so go easy on me:-)
I'm so totally fed up. I loath Christmas because of bad memories as a child, e.g. Like eating our Christmas dinner off the floor cos my step dad flipped cos we( brothers) were laughing at the dinner table.... He was drunk by all accounts. This time of year reminds me of all the awful things he made us do!!
I've had a life where,given to someone else, they would have surely died:-( but I still bimble along, fighting every minute of everyday. 
I was referred to a cbt therapist, who past a diagnosis of PTSD. My first thoughts on this were, I've not been to war. Ignorant I know:-(. She gave me some photocopied information about PTSD to read.after a two hour session she said she couldn't offer me cbt for at least another year, because of waiting lists on nhs. If I was a drunk or a druggy I'm sure it would be sooner. What a slap across the face!!!!
I then lost my job because of erratic behaviours, which I can't help( it just happens) I feel like two people at times.
Everyday life is such a chore in its self. Simple tasks like getting self dressed,going out in any form terrifies the heck out of me."
701,"The second psychiatrist asked this and I said ""no"" and still can't and never will, three years after the event she was referring to.  Therapy is helping me cope with everday life better most of the time but is this it, how it's going to be forever?  Some people say you have to accept what's happened to be able to move on, whatever that means, but I can't just flick an 'accept/don't accept'switch and don't know why and it's starting to frighten me now.  I feel so angry:("
702,"Hi ,
    I have been trying very hard to feel better but my circumstances are getting worse by the day. I keep waking in the night and having nightmares regularly.
During the day I feel extremely anxious and upset followed by depression at the end of my day. I have been taking care of my body at least. I eat three meals every day and exercise. I have reduced my food intake because of my circumstances right now. I don't want to live but I don't want to kill myself either. It is not a place anyone wants to be. I don't really know what my future holds if anything. I am in limbo. I don't know where to go from he:BLAH:re."
703,"I note with interest that a fair number of you fellow PTSD sufferers mentioning feeling anxious.

I assume that the awful past experiences you had have caused you to have these awful anxious feelings.

I just thought it would be of interest to you that the anxiety that I feel in regard to my own PTSD was inflicted on me by design by the people who caused my PTSD in the first place.

Here I quote ""The majority of aversion therapists have attempted to make the patient associate anxiety and fear on the application of electric shocks with the previously attractive homosexual stimulus""

"" Homosexual Behaviour: Therapy and assessment""

Feldman and MacCulloch. 1971

Another quote regarding my own assessment by psychiatrists in 1998 when first diagnosed with PTSD 

""He is undoubtedly suffering PTSD as a result of his aversion therapy treatment in 1972""

I still feel shit in 2012, still got PTSD, still anxious and fearful, 40 years on.

There will be no end to this until ............a bucket is kicked."
704,"Hi, I'm actually the WIFE of a sufferer (having my own separate problems, plus the stress caused by his). 

My husband has suffered badly since a baby, abuse that would break your heart, but throughout his life was either mocked or put down, and never offered any real help. When we married in 2006 I encouraged him to seek real help and after about 2 years of grinding through the NHS system he was finally offered Psychotherapy.

This wasn't much good, but it was something. Then suddenly it was announced that the Department was closing down due to financial cutbacks (thanks, Cameron!) and from then on he was being pushed to ""find a job"" - as if THAT was the sole reason for his therapy. 

He kept trying to say, look, I'm not ready to just bounce out there and ""be normal"" like you seem to think I can! For this, the Therapist called him ""uncooperative"" and wrote to the GP in that tone.

The Therapist signed him off in June this year, after having refused to do anything to help him claim benefits. Thus his claim for DLA was totally refused, zero points.

At that moment the crisis was so great, we nearly got separated but we are still together (just.)

Well, to get to the point, the latest visit to the GP (and I have to go with him every time, so I know this) we both ended up in tears and she just sat there like a stone. We explained how the therapy had come to an end, but John felt nowhere near being better, in fact in some ways the process just opened up the wounds to leave them unhealed.

I also said how we were thinking of separating. The GP looked at me and said, oh well in that case, I suggest you phone Relate.

I tell you, we left that surgery feeling like we'd been punched in the face. Not only has the benefits system let us down (his ESA money stops in April 2013, and then what? I'm a pensioner and cannot work.) But now the therapist and GP have lost interest.

Every felt like nobody wants to know?"
705,"I am alone with my cptsd. I have no freinds, family or anyone who cares about me. I cannot relate to people either. There is so much I am unable to do that others do easily. My two children don't love or respect me anymore. I had one freind which I don't like anymore because she is abusive and an alcoholic. It is definately a long painful journey through life."
706,"I got scared shitless on saturday morning. I had to have an MRI scan on my back. This is the third MRI scan in a couple of months. Because the machine is very very noisy they give you a pair of headphones and play the radio through them. I had asked on the previous 2 sessions that the operator not to turn the radio on. I could more or less dissociate and blank out the noise and since I have tinnitus I didn't mind the noise. 

This time I just assumed it would be the same thing again, but after being in the tube for a few minutes some fuck turned the radio on. Immediately I was transported back in a flashback to the time when I was tied to a bed and given electric shocks, whilst listening to tapes telling me what an evil person I was. I started shaking like hell, as a panic attack took hold, and luckily they pulled me out to see what was wrong. They must have thought I was going mad, shaking. I had to go and sit somewhere quiet for a while before going back in again to complete the MRI scan, this time with no noise apart from the machine.

Sometimes I can go along for a while in a reasonable condition, but always knowing that the next panic attack/flashback will come out of the blue.

It takes me a lot of time trying to avoid these flashback situations but really the do seem to appear with some form of regularity.

I find it very difficult to explain to most people the state of fear I am living in."

711,"Hello
As we all seen to have the same pain and suffering I was wondering if someone could help me.  What is loss of control can we lose control are we in control? (In a threating situation). I have suffered with post-traumatic stress disorder now since 1987 and when my terrors return there is a build-up of something inside me. I am told and advised to try and live my normal life i.e. with a cocktail of drugs from the psychiatrist.  I know that some of us will look at a threat differently to others. I was attacked by numerous assailants and left scarred for life both in and out. So if I’m confronted I can and have lost I believe control. I have never nor do I ever want to hurt anyone but I fear a side of me inside so much. I wonder if anyone else suffers like that too.  My psychologist is also looking into this but I feel I will get a better response from you.
 Thank you
sry about spelling"
712,"I can't deal with my PTSD anymore I panic everyday around dinner time I can't handle it all night I have panic attacks and flash backs. I don't want to deal with this anymore it's just to much right now. Everytime I have a flashback or dissociate I then have bad thoughts 
bad bad thoughts.  I am trying to be a normal college student and I can't do that bc my PTSD and anxiety gets in the way of being normal and I just hate it so much I want it to end now."
713,"hello everybody,
i am new on here. i dont have ptsd, my boyfriend does. we have been together over a year and i have tried to be there for him, accept a lot of things and overlook certain mistakes... but i am starting to get to the point to where i feel like enough is enough. he used to take xanax, which was ok,then had to change to valium, then had to change to seroquil with valium... and everytime i felt like he was a different person... i dont even know if i know the real him anymore. his medication is not working well so i have to suffer the consequences... he has nervous breakdowns, breaks stuff... gets angry and irritated very easily... doesnt want to be around anybody and doesnt show me any affection at all... everytime i try to break up, he wants to fix himself and make things better .... for about a  week, everytime he makes a mistake, he blames his sickness for it. i am so tired of it... today he kicked the door plenty times and yelled and threatened me because i said he was retarded... (i know that was not right ) but it never bothered him before. am i dealing with a ticking time bomb i need to know what to do... i tried helping him but i am not a therapist and i do want a healthy relationship.... what do i do"
714,"Haven't posted in a while, I guess I've been sticking my head in the sand. I ended up in hospital again, go me, and since then just.. wow. It's an endless cycle and I'm so so tired. I'm tired of the nightmares that come almost every time I try to sleep, leaving me in a state of pure panic and bringing back all those things that I try hard to forget. I hate that because of those nightmares I'm too scared to sleep, wondering what's in store for me when my eyes close. I hate that I can't remember the last time I had a decent sleep, because invariably I awake having a panic attack and then can't get back to sleep.

I'm tired of the flashbacks that are sooo real they petrify me. Where I can smell, taste, feel EVERYTHING like I could back when I was younger and so every time I have one, it's like it's happened all over again. Like it's the first time, every time. I hate that they have such an effect on me, that I can't ever talk about it because I feel so ashamed and so dirty that I feel talking about what happens and how it feels is just out of the question. 

I'm tired that the above, amongst other things, mean that I can not leave my flat. I can't bring myself to step outside that front door, to take a walk down the street or meet up with someone for a coffee in town. I don't feel safe enough, and the paranoia and stress just makes it impossible. I would love to be a 'normal' person. I would love to sleep without the nightmares, to get through a day without a flashback. I would love the PTSD, EUPD, agoraphobia and anxiety to just FUCK OFF. But it doesn't look like it ever will.

The anxiety of all of this consumes me, literally, and I feel like I am drowning. At what point does one realize that fighting against the tide is a useless thing to do, and just lets the tide take them? Is it now? Because I feel my fingertips slowly letting go."
715,"It is, it really is:low:  It's awful not being able to stop it from hurting, flashbacks, images, nightmares, triggers everywhere, anger, frustration and an old life of being able to do so many things like it was a good dream that you want to fall asleep and go back to.  Time heals, sh** happens, get over it, i Bl**dy well can't:stomp:  It's doing my head in, sorry to go on:sorry:"
716,"SO I am at my wits end with this! I went through some very traumatic events growing up and through it all developed PTSD but no one believes me! When I went to a rehabilitation place last year they didn't believe me and said that because I was never in the military that I couldn't have PTSD as I am making it seems. I link all my anxiety back to this as I can't be in a room with guys that I don't know and can't even stand being spoken to at work sometimes by men and I am a bartender so I have to at all times. The only one that believes my boyfriend and he also has it so he knows. The only difference between us is that he has been deployed and I never even made it into the military because of my head problems. Not even the therapist that I have had believe that I have ptsd so I am just lost on what to do. I have had and still have my moments of PTSD where I completely lose it and am even known to black out when I lose it, I don't become violent towards anyone else unless they give me a reason too it is normally myself and I am at a lost of what to do!"
717,"I posted it on my last Journal post but think maybe I should share, I recieved a message yesterday that the dog I had with my ex was killed yesterday. The message was very short and by a girl who was once the only person too friend me when things were bad with my ex. Since the split with my ex she barely has spoken to me. The thing that gets me is I wasn't told by my ex and that I wasn't told how our 13 yrs old Jack Russel had been killed.  My ex is recieving all the support in the world as I let him keep our dog when he split.  I just feel like I got slapped in the face, cause my messages wanting to know what happened go unanswered now and my ex and his friends caused me so much pain and damage while I was with him.  I thought I had moved on but this is devastating news and their treatment of me makes me feel like a victim all over again and it sucks. It just really sucks.  I have been depressed the last few days on top of it so this really doesn't help at all.  I'm afraid of going into another PTSD episode over this. My mind has been cycling flashbacks the past couple days, my son is not showing any improvement on rational thinking and I'm at a loss how I can help. I just feel like giving up all together. Hiding and closing off again.  Sorry this sounds so self pitying and depressing.  Just had to tell someone how I was feeling:cry:"
718,"Brief outline, suffered depression, anxiety and panic attacks for past 10 years and over the last two years it's worse and have also been diagnosed with post traumatic stress. As well as suffering insomnia and having severe nightmares!!
I live in rented accomodation which doesn't help as I'm moving around alot... It really worries me constantly that I can never get settled and create a home for me and my little boy... Even when I move I constantly worry about the next move!! I also live in a small block of six flats and sometimes find it difficult to walk through communal area to my front door. When I'm really bad I can't go out because of panic attacks and it's hard not to have my own garden where my little boy can play outside when mummy is too ill.
Last year I was off work for 7 months, currently working 2 days which I struggle to cope with but pride makes me want to keep it up an also better than stayin at home moping...
I have been trying to get the council to recognise my mental illness for the past 2 years to give me additional preference however so far they have failed to do so despite letters from phyciastrist, phycologist, social services all informing them of my problems and saying that although a permanent house wouldn't cure me, it would make things alot better...
Finally having an assessment with housing on Wednesday at home but it is very hard to open up to someone I have just met, and as I only have a short time, I don't know what parts to leave in and what parts not to tell them... ( I could talk and cry for weeks)
Any advice on the main things to say...

719,"Been watching a lot of episodes of Mad Men, I think it's fairly accurate in how roles were for men and women in the 50's the same time period my parents met and married.  It explains for me quite a bit of why my parents raised us the way they did, for them being distant, keeping your emotions hidden, and such was normal and they were passing this lifestyle on to me and my siblings.  (Not including the abuse)
Just an interesting observation I'm up to season four of this show and still enjoying it with fascination.  Brings back some interesting memories that aren't traumatic about my family but that for some reason I couldn't remember till this past year. Before I was born and the 70's during grade school years.  Even better they're good memories. :thumbsup:  Just little things but was blocked in with the rest I guess.  
Does anyone else regain good forgotten memories triggered by time period shows?  PTSD is still surprising me.  Live and learn. Heading off to bed goodnight folks"
720,"I find the PTSD is making me afraid that I'm posting too much or saying the wrong things. :confused:
I am so terrible at social interaction off the internet out there in the real world.
Here I get courage to say things I normally wouldn't and put my input into many threads. 

Beginning to think in my excitement of making friends/ wanting to make friends,I am being to pushy or sticking my nose in where it doesn't belong.  I am scaring myself and afraid of withdrawing altogether off here altogether. Something I have done on other forums in the past when I get really scared.

I really enjoy making friends online or helping when I can but I fear the PTSD still screws my head with all these doubts and I don't know if they're valid or just me being still screwed up.
  
I lived so many years carrying around so many secrets, letting others do all the talking, being shy, and doing anything not to appear opinionated, I still back down from confrontation, run away or just plain hide when things get overwhelming and stressfull.  I start feeling weak and stupid again like I really have no right to say anything at all.  After all my life is such a mess.   

I think I know this is long term effects of the PTSD I try to battle that kind of negative thinking daily.  I hope you guy and gals here don't mind me posting so many replies but don't be afraid to tell me if you think I am. I just get lost and don't know.

I'm still just learning to get into conversations, be open and the hardest initiate conversations.  I do ""the mom thing"" with advice so much with other folks.
Don't know maybe some of you feel the same way. 
Last post tonight, seeing my name in so many replies today has scared me into thinking I look like just a know it all or someone sticking there nose where it doesn't belong. Sorry"
721,"Okay, that's a weird title for this thread, I know. It's like this:

I've spent years dealing with (or trying to deal with) the consequences of being abused by both parents. Every so often, when I think I've really got somewhere with it all, another, deeper layer emerges. So I go looking for help dealing with this (generally some kind of therapy, though meditation used to be a big help too until my PTSD made that almost impossible to do).

Then a pattern emerges: I find someone to help me, and I make an arrangement with them to begin therapy (or whatever). And while I'm in that gap between having said what I need help with, and actually starting to get that help, I find myself feeling like I should commit suicide. I've never actually taken that seriously as an option, so don't worry about this - the point is, I was told ""never talk about this"" by one of my abusers, and so every time I do start to talk about it, I get this feeling like the kind of post-hypnotic command that espionage agents get given (see? there was a point to this thread title after all!) where if you get caught, you commit suicide, ""self-destruct"".

This suicidal feeling reminds me of how I get really depressed on antibiotics - but I know it's because of the antibiotics, so I don't buy into it. I've had this pre-therapy suicidal feeling enough times now to respond to it the same way, but it also really helps to tell people that's what I'm feeling, which is why I'm writing this here.

Let me be quite clear here - I've never harmed myself, and never intend to (the closest I ever got was being anorexic for a while as a teen). I just want to say out loud that I'm going to say what was done to me out loud, and nothing will stop me.

I'm about to start having EMDR therapy - which is either going to help or it isn't - and which is probably going to stir things up like crazy for a while. Wish me luck :)."
722,"Sleep deprivation in the first few hours after exposure to a significantly stressful threat actually reduces the risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), according to a study by researchers from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) and Tel Aviv University.


The new study was published in the international scientific journal, Neuropsychopharmacology. It revealed in a series of experiments that sleep deprivation of approximately six hours immediately after exposure to a traumatic event reduces the development of post trauma-like behavioral responses. As a result, sleep deprivation the first hours after stress exposure might represent a simple, yet effective, intervention for PTSD.

The research was conducted by Prof. Hagit Cohen, director of the Anxiety and Stress Research Unit at BGU's Faculty of Health Sciences, in collaboration with Prof. Joseph Zohar of Tel Aviv University.

Approximately 20 percent of people exposed to a severe traumatic event, such as a car or work accident, terrorist attack or war, cannot normally carry on their lives. These people retain the memory of the event for many years. It causes considerable difficulties in the person's functioning in daily life and, in extreme cases, may render the individual completely dysfunctional.

""Often those close to someone exposed to a traumatic event, including medical teams, seek to relieve the distress and assume that it would be best if they could rest and ""sleep on it,"" says Prof. Cohen. ""Since memory is a significant component in the development of post-traumatic symptoms, we decided to examine the various effects of sleep deprivation immediately after exposure to trauma.""

In the experiments, rats that underwent sleep deprivation after exposure to trauma (predator scent stress exposure), later did not exhibit behavior indicating memory of the event, while a control group of rats that was allowed to sleep after the stress exposure did remember, as shown by their post trauma-like behavior.

""As is the case for human populations exposed to severe stress, 15 to 20 percent of the animals develop long-term disruptions in their behavior,"" says Cohen. ""Our research method for this study is, we believe, a breakthrough in biomedical research.""

A pilot study in humans is currently being planned. The studies were funded by a Israel Academy of Science and Humanities grant and the Israel Ministry of Health.

723,"Hello, I am new. I am trying to stop thinking and living in the past.
Because my father put me in Therapeutic Community for heroin addicts, which I had yet to do, w/ much older people in Queens when I lived in what would be considered the monied area of Long Island I was clueless and left.
However he told me if I didn't make it this time-this after over six months in 2 psychiatric hospitals-not to bother coming home.
Because I was tossed I remember everything before and it makes me very angry that they-my whole family went on w/ thier lives and never once asked what had become of me.I neeed an avatar."
724,In a nutshell I have this due to a servere tear during childbirth which left me with a colostomy.  Im being review by the mental health team would social services take my bubba away thanks for reading
725,"Last few days been down in the dumps, my concentration is minimal at best and stupid cycling thoughts. Thoughts about my PTSD no not really, thoughts on what the hell I do now. JS has only informed me the day before yesterday that he's been diagnosed scitzo-affective now.  Another label, another set of definitions to look into, to be prepared for. Yet just so exhausted by it all, crying today for no particular reason, just the weight and strain of it all I suppose.  

Why the hell did I get this life....I don't know but feeling very trapped by it all. The poverty, the social alienation, the constant deciphering of JD's delusions and showing him clarity being so carefull to word things right, now JS wanting to return and the thoughts of living with the both of them both so disorganised and delusional in completely different ways and they won't be able to get along without sibling rivalry. 

I hate going through all this crap alone with only a very limited FB view of what my so called sane family members are up to, now one of the few fam members I have reconnected with in the past year is deleting his FB account so I will not have any contact again with him.  Don't know why it's getting to me weren't ever really close anyway but still feels like just another kick upside the head.

Just venting guys, just so lost right now there's no way out of it. I may have to live with it all but I don't have to like it.:scared:"
726,"My past is stopping me from having relationships :low:
I hate the way my personal life is. 
My public life is a front......."
727,"I'm pretty sure I have PTSD, I've been discussing it with the team that look after me (Early Intervention in Pychosis) since I've started having some horrible experiences that relate back to some of the things that have happened in my life.

The thing is, I feel so alone in all of this because the situation that caused the PTSD isn't something you would commonly think of like rape, war, accidents, abuse any of that kind of thing and I can't find any information on it anywhere. 

I just feel so alone so I'm repeating my story in the hope that someone out there is experiencing the same thing

I've suffered with mental health problems since I was about 15, as a child my mother was addicted to codiene and drank too much, my dad eventually left her and us and us kids were left to look after her and stop her from killing herself. I got very depressed around this age and started to self-harm. My mum died when I was 16 and I tried to kill myself a few months later.

 The mental health problems just got worse from there because I started hearing voices and over the next 2-3 years I had a few pychotic episodes. Because of that I was sectioned numerous times and was in and out of hospital constantly. While I was in hospital I had a number of unpleasant experiences involving involuntary treatment, restraint and police interventions that have left me absolutly traumatised. 

This is a letter that I wrote to my pychiatrist explaining what is happening to me; 
(sorry that its so long but please someone read it :( )

""
Not really sure where to start, to be honest I really really don’t want to write this
I’ve been putting it off for weeks because I know how much it will upset me
But if it’s this hard saying all of this stuff in my head or writing it down imagine how hard it would be to say out loud in a room full of people. 

So I have to write it, I really have to get people to understand what I’m talking about, and I’m probably a lot more articulate when I write.  Lately I’ve been turning into a wreck, a nervous fucking wreck, I can’t go out of the house and round the corner to the shop to buy milk and bread without having to take a few deep steadying breaths. I have to give myself a massive pep talk just to sum up the courage to go and meet a friend in a coffee shop two streets away. And college and placement? I just haven’t been in more than half the time.

People have noticed a difference in me, my friends have noticed a difference in me, and they’re always telling me to chill out and calm down and asking me why I’m so angry. And I honestly don’t know what to tell them, I don’t know why I’m so angry all of the time, I just am. If I’m not a nervous wreck then I’m angry beyond belief
And I say that I don’t know why I’m angry but the more I think about it the more I start to believe that I’m not angry at anything anyone is doing now, I’m just angry at other stuff, at myself, at other people for doing what they did to me, at myself again for being the reason it all happened. 

People look at me weird when I’m in the middle of a conversation with them and I start flinching, my best friend keeps making a joke out of it, she recons I have a nervous twitch. It’s not a nervous twitch, I’ll be walking down the street talking to someone or just in the middle of a conversation with someone and either something will remind me of a bad memory or it will just pop into my head. Then I’m right back there again, I can feel crushing on my chest , I can’t breathe and I can hear the fucking alarms. No wonder I’m flinching, but then I have to hide it and pretend it was nothing while people look at me weird.  Happens numerous times a day now, it gets me down. 

I’m having bad dreams, I’ve always had the odd bad dream, I mean everyone does I suppose. And yeah I used to dream about hospitals and stuff, if you spend enough time anywhere you probably will. They were usually bad dreams, not very nice, but I didn’t have them very often.

Now it’s like a fucking joke, it started off around August/September; I’d be having two or maybe 3 bad dreams in a month.  Now I’m lucky if I get less than 2 or 3 a week. 

I’ll be back there (in hospital) and people would be pinning me down, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I did in the dream, but people would be pinning me down. Holding me down, pressing on my chest, pressing my face down so I can’t breath. I just can’t breathe and I’m being crushed and I’m trying to scream but I can’t and I can hear people laughing and I just can’t breathe. Or that police guy is stomping on my legs, or dragging me around by my wrists and the cuffs are cutting into them until you can see bone.  

They’re the most realistic horrible dreams I’ve ever had in my life (except right after my mum died when I used to dream about her)
I wake up every time not being able to breathe, and I panic and I try and get up or move over but usually I’m feeling all kind of dopey cos I’ve taken my meds and I can’t move, it’s terrifying, I can’t breath, but I can’t move to breath either. 
I hate them, they make me not want to go to sleep, but when I wake up in the morning I feel so tired.


There are just all these occasions where 
And god it fucking hurts to write about this, I really just feel ashamed and grotty and l
Like I shouldn’t be mentioning it to anyone ever. But it’s eating me up inside.
Where I’ve been restrained by people, or given medication when I didn’t want any medication, or when the police have had to come and take me to hospital.

There’s been that many occasions I can’t really list them all and I know this letter thingy is going to be kind of long but there’s a few occasions that are just fucking with my head. 

Like the time I flipped out because they wouldn’t let me leave my room to get my contact lenses stuff so I could get to sleep and they pinned me down on the floor with my face pressed so hard into a mattress I couldn’t breathe. I was screaming and crying that I couldn’t breathe and that they were hurting me. I had taped up cuts on my arm that came open from the nurse who was holding my arms down. I could feel the blood pouring down my arm from when they ripped open. The worst thing was that there was a nursing assistant or somebody in the background laughing at me, telling me to stop “being so silly” to stop “being a baby”

Or the time that the police took me to the hospital and I didn’t think I needed to go at the time so I fought the whole way there like an idiot. When I got there I kept trying to get out of the cubicle I was in. The police guy must have gotten fed up because he grabbed me and threw me to the floor, while I was on the floor he strapped my legs together, I was already in handcuffs. Then he started to knee me, in the thighs, in the groin. I couldn’t defend myself, I was screaming cos he was hurting me so badly.
I just didn’t and still don’t understand why he was hurting me.
I lie awake at night thinking about it
I was screaming that loud that a doctor came in, he got the police guy and someone else to flip me over so he could inject me with something.
I might have been a little bit loopy at the time but I was still human, I can still feel pain, fear and humiliation. That’s what gets me the most now, the humiliation of it. Not even getting a female nurse or police officer in the room before they just flip me over, pull my pants down and jab me in the ass with a needle. 

I understand why people did what they did, I understand that I really wasn’t that well and I did some really stupid dangerous things like SH myself  or taking a bunch of pills and sometimes being violent with people and refusing any help where people had to do something.  I understand that there’s a duty of care and all that where people can’t just stand by and watch me hurt myself. And probably out of all those occasions when I was being restrained by people it was necessary and probably most of the occasions when I had medication forced on me it was done out of necessity and done for my own good.
But I hope people can understand why deep down I can’t believe that, not when nearly 3years later I’m still having nightmares and vivid memory flashbacks and crying myself to sleep over it every night. How can I believe that all that was done for my own good when I feel fucking traumatised by it? Or when I look back to all those occasions where I had medication forced on me and I look for ******** policy on it and find out that after those occasions somebody is supposed to come talk to me and let me write my experience down in my notes and tell me what medication they gave me. 

I feel so unbelievably angry when I think about the fact that not one person gave a shit enough to come and sit down with me afterwards or the next day to ask me how I felt, or give me a chance to write down my experience in my notes or tell me what drugs they gave me. This is something they are supposed to do, I’ve read ********** policy, and not once did this ever happen. Not once.
It makes me feel like what they did was done to shut me up, to keep me quiet, to punish me. 
And of course I’m angry at myself just as much as other people, if I hadn’t of behaved the way I did it wouldn’t of happened, if I hadn’t put other people in those situations. 
I just feel like a bad person, I just feel so ashamed, almost start thinking I deserved what I got. 

All of this shit is what goes round and around my head when I’m lying in bed at night or just sitting alone in the flat. 
 I know what I sound like sometimes, I know I must sound like I’m just endlessly complaining about things, like I’m some kind of psychiatric hypochondriac or something. But this is important to me, I know I have lots of really great things going on in my life right now, an offer to uni and stuff, great friends, but I can’t enjoy them
, I can’t enjoy anything. I’m a nervous wreck, I’m terrified to leave the house in case something reminds me and sets me off. At the same time I’m terrified to stay in the house on my own because I know every evening like clockwork when things start to go quiet that all this shit from the past starts up in my head and honestly I just want to kill myself to make it go away. Or give myself a serious brain injury or something, just make it stop. 

 It upsets me that much that I just start thinking that I’d rather be dead then have to deal with one more night of lying in bed crying and crying and crying until I feel sick, desperately trying to distract myself from these memories and avoid any more bad dreams. I want to go to sleep to stop myself from thinking about all the crap in my head but I’m scared because I don’t want to wake up not being able to breathe again. 

I just needed to get this off my chest because it’s killing me.
I don’t know if I want to make a complaint, because I would feel too bad. I think over all I’ve been really looked after and helped by the mental health services as a whole
But I can’t stand the thought that other people might be going through what I am now and that people aren’t doing their jobs properly and making sure people are all right after occasions like the ones above I described. I just want something to change and I need help to stop all these memories from driving me crazy because I’m not coping very well. ""
 


Please someone tell me I'm not alone in this??"

729,"Body  flashbacks? Body memories?


Anybody else get them?

I get extremely painful aches in my arm and shoulder that come out of the blue, I know what they relate to now but I wish they would just fuck off. 

I used to scratch my right forearm till it was red with blood to stop the incessant itch emanating from it. I never knew what caused it and it had my GP completely baffled until last year when in a body memory flashback I remembered that is where they attached the electrodes when I was given electric shocks. So these body flashback memories do have a use in helping me find a way to understand my PTSD. I no longer itch there but I do still feel extreme pain occasionally.

Very violent spasms in my stomach, there is nothing physically wrong, I have had all sorts of tests and cameras inside my body."
730,"New to forum and struggling with flashbacks/cannot face traumas without pain

Hello
I am new to the forum. I had repeated traumas not too long ago, as an adult, and i am struggling with flashbacks despite working through what happened with a psychologist. It seems every time i do the things he has told me to do, that are going to help me deal with my trauma in the long run, cause me to be in a horrible state for a couple of days. I usually need to take diazepam or similar after just half an hour of writing about it. It makes me go off my food, makes me feel sick. Do i really have to face it now in order to get better? I don't know much about PTSD, we just talk about hyper-arousal, flight or fight or freeze etc... it is such a complex area full of minefields. I have read some books but i am not taking it in very well. It is too painful."
731,"Hey all i am new to all this so sorry if i don't say the right thing. I am suffering from ptsd after being a sniper in Afghanistian  i am 22 married and i scared that i am pushing my wife am family away. I am on medication which is beta blocker and sertraline which i feel are no use i can go from nice to disgustin in a split second. I recently got arrested for my behaviour and it is starting to scare me myself my wife and family are scared of me she has moved out. i do not no what to do or where to go i am in a rut and feel as if there is no way out! 

thank you Lee"
732,I have ptsd because of two events in my life. The first that happened was that i was molested by someone i didnt even know and by someone i trusted. This is about the second event. When i was 11 my dad passed away. He was a recovering alcoholic and what i didnt know at the time was that he was a recovering addict. He was taking methadone and his doctors increased his medicine too high and his heart stopped so he died. I never knew any of this how he died or anything. I was supposed to be there but i wasnt and i blamed myself to a whole new level. It went on like that for 4 years.  My guilt turned into suicidal tendencies. But now ive learned to accept it. This is to prove that no matter how hard it is you can get over something if you really want to.
733,"I started taking propranolol in January, when things suddenly got really bad on the anxiety front. There followed a difficult few months, but then I got flu and had to stop taking the propranolol for a couple of weeks due to very low blood pressure. This is when I discovered that though the drug alleviates my physical anxiety symptoms (rapid heartbeat and so on), it was actually causing emotional/psychological problems of fear and passivity and paranoia. As soon as I stopped taking it, I found myself a lot more 'normal' in terms of what I was happy doing, like going out into town and so on, and a lot more proactive in my life.

But then I'm also stuck with the physical symptoms of anxiety, which themselves make me more anxious. I'm not sure what to do - find a different medication?

I was hoping for some shrink help with CBT, or EMDR or suchlike, but since the local NHS can't seem to decide whether or not I have PTSD (and they're very underresourced), this is not forthcoming at the moment, so I've been dependent on medication and music and suchlike to keep me together.

I'm interested to know whether anyone else has had this problem with beta-blockers."
734,"For the last handful of years, Britain and the United States have done quiet experiments with a new form of therapy for veterans suffering from combat stress, using a resource neither nation lacks along their coasts: surf.

“Ocean therapy,” or surf therapy, will surprise longtime surfers mainly because of the official-sounding name; the idea that an ocean and a surfboard can be good for the body and mind is otherwise not very new.

But recent studies have tried to quantify just what happens in the water.

The United Kingdom’s National Health Service is still conducting trials in Cornwall, where waves wash in from the Atlantic, to determine whether “surf therapy” deserves taxpayer support. The idea caused outrage at the Daily Mail, where outrage is a business model.

“It’s important that the NHS uses its funds for medicine and equipment rather than watersports,” a British taxpayers’ advocate, Fiona McEvoy, told the Mail late last year. National Health defended the trials on the grounds that they were cheap — £250, or about $400 per person — and aimed at saving money on demand for antidepressants and other drug therapies.

But the U.S. Marines Corps has also worked “ocean therapy” into its post-traumatic stress disorder treatment regime. Until recently, Lt. Col. Greg Martin commanded the so-called Wounded Warrior Battalion West at Camp Pendleton. “Anything a guy really enjoys” will ease combat stress, he says, “but there’s nothing like surfing to touch the mind, the body and the spirit all at the same time. And that’s our approach in the Marine Corps, we have a whole-Marine focus, so it’s not just the medical side.”

735,"Can PTSD be caused by Delayed Grief? 

I've been reading into delayed grief, and it has it's similarities. My Psychotherapist told me that not grieving properly can lead to long term memory problems, for which I have. I didn't realise how bad until I was banned from Driving by my Doctor due to brain fog, and simply due to my mind wandering. 

A friend at my local therapy group is on the Citalpram for delayed Grief, so just wondering if there is simmilarities in the treatment of these conditions.

736,"I'm not sure where to begin.  My partner and I have been together for 4 years now and all but the first 6 months have been a challenge.  It is only recently that we have realized that ""our problems"" were really about anxiety - not so much about our love or compatibility.  Having said that - it is getting increasingly harder for me to deal with the angry and irrational outbursts.  She seems to be on a 2 month cycle - things are good after she dumps on me, we talk, she apologizes and then she feels great.  I on the other hand feel exhausted and wanting my space.  She was going to counseling for a few months but only because I asked her to - nothing came of it because she was merely showing up - not contributing.  She reads self-help books for a few weeks after an ""episode"", until she feels better and then slacks off because she believes she has a handle on her anxiety. The triggers are anything and everything so there aren't any clear cut buttons to avoid.  She always seems sorry for hurting me and I am better about not taking things so personally but it is very hard sometimes - especially when every melt down comes with the threat of having me move out.  I know it's her anxiety, I see the pain in her eyes, but it is starting to effect the love I feel for her and creating trust issues.  Thanks for listening:)"
737,"i have felt this way many times....like the only thing that will release the pressure in my head is to scream and scream....i have been writing and writing about my past...i have connected with my alters...yet still after all that work...i am sitting here tonight feeling the same tension i felt when i was 19 with the same intensity...like there is something inside me that is trying to get out and i feel like screaming...

i remember watching movies portraying mental health patients in asylums when that was the norm...and sometimes there would be patients screaming....well i can relate...i have often felt like being one of them....

i honestly don't know what it wil take for  my alters to be peaceful and not feel this way...trapped and frightened....

well i'm glad i 'told' and that there is a forum where i can express feeling like this.....i can't scream ... i never acted on the impulse ... i just suffered in silence....the feeling passes only to surface again days, weeks, months later...

i'm grateful for the forum because while i can't scream i can stomp...so here goes....:stomp::stomp::stomp::stomp:"

I am just going to write how I'm feeling to distract me if that's OK...

I am sitting up awake rigid with terror because I keep hearing noises and think someone might be breaking in.(I have gone through this on and off for 10 years after something happened that made me hyper-vigilant etc and has affected me ever since...I have also had several other incidences of attacks/abuse in my life since then so I suppose I must be experiencing PTSD, didn't really label this until now but anyway).

I never feel safe and I have realised one of the reasons I started staying out and working dodgy jobs through the night in my early 20s was to keep busy during the night and then sleep during the day when I felt safer. I have made lots of decisions for the wrong reasons and made things worse for myself in ways, but it has all been about self preservation(maybe backwards for someone who often wishes to die, but I would be in control of that).

My insomnia doesn't always have an obvious cause like this and I haven't had this for a while...I don't know exactly where these feelings start, I have had a weird day I suppose, very depressed with a couple of bouts of rage and SH out of nowhere...my nerves are just on edge, my head is a mess...
Years ago I used to sleep with a knife and fantasied about having a gun, I stopped that but tonight I have found something blunt and heavy and put it next to the bed, and it makes me feel better.

I just split up with my boyfriend, we weren't even living together but somehow I feel less safe(probably because he was practically my only real friend and we have said we won't have any contact now).
I do feel very helpless and alone...I worry about looking after my parents as it is really just me and them, they are getting older and I have been getting so ill they are supporting me.

I feel pathetic for spewing like this but I have no-one to talk to. I only recently found this site and can see how helpful it can be, even just as a way of getting feelings out in some way, which I just have, and it has helped a bit."

I just want to let you know that there CAN be hope.  After these last years, it has now been 11 months without an admission.  She is more engaged in life.  We talk more, she does things around the house and her spirits are lifted.  My wife cannot and/or does not share a lot about her feelings and her therapy, so I can't tell you why.  Just that it has happened. 

I know that it is VERY hard for many of you.  I am not saying that everyone will or can have a similar outcome.  Hell, I know that PTSD is forever and that there can be relapses.  WILL be ups and downs.

I just wanted to offer what hopefully YOU can view as a light at the end of the tunnel.  I hope that each of you that suffer with PTSD will continue to do whatever YOU need to do to heal.  Therapy, medications, talking here, even hospitalization if that is what you need to do to be safe.  Healing can come, I feel.  Even if it is in small steps.  I feel that I can understand how it does not feel that way many times.

Supporters, hang in there.  Learn what you can but also look at yourselves to see how you fit in.  Examine your own issues and seek help yourselves if that is what is needed.  If your spouse/partner's issues are making YOU depressed, you have to examine that before you can help anyone else.  If there is an emergency on an airplane, you have to put your own oxygen mask on first!

741,"Read the full Article here - http://beyondmeds.com/2011/12/16/traumaptsdhealing/

In situations of terror, people spontaneously seek their  first source of comfort and protection. Wounded soldiers and raped women  cry for their mothers or God. When this cry is not answered, the sense  of basic trust is shattered. Traumatized people feel utterly abandoned,  utterly alone, cast out of the human and divine systems of care and  protection that sustain life. Thereafter, a sense of alienation, of  disconnection, pervades every relationship, from the most intimate  familial bonds to the most abstract affiliations of community and  religion. 

— Judith Herman from Trauma and Recovery

 

 

The causes of trauma have three things in common:


 ●  An External Cause
 ●  Violation
 ●  Loss of Control
 The effects of trauma are surprisingly commonplace. These include:
 ●  bewilderment and confusion, an inability to understand what is happening or why it happened
 ●  a strong sense of denial, an inability to convince yourself that  the experience was real; your denial is reinforced by the denial of  those around you and especially of people in authority
 ●  sleep problems including nightmares and waking early
 ●  flashbacks and replays which you are unable to switch off
 ●  impaired memory, forgetfulness, memory which is intermittent, especially of day-to-day trivial things
 ●  exaggerated startle response
 ●  a deep sense of betrayal
 ●  obsessiveness – the experience takes over your life, you can’t get it out of your mind
 ●  depression
 ●  excessive shame and guilt
 ●  undue fear
 ●  emotional numbness, an inability to feel love, hope, or joy
 ●  physical and mental paralysis at any reminder of the experience
 
Tim Fields

Trauma is about broken connections. Connection is broken with the  body/self, family, friends, community, nature, and spirit, perpetuating  the downward spiral of traumatic dislocation. Healing trauma is about  restoring these connections.

742,"unpleasant dreams, memories etc, how long will it last?

so since I have been in in therapy I ended up remembering a whole load of crap which apparently I needed to remember to get better and now having textbook dreams, flashbacks etc:unsure:

its not overwhelming, its better than being psychotic was lol but was wondering how long it lasts, does it ever go away entirely, once you sorted it all out in therapy?  Or will there always be little reminders which poke their way into your consciousness at random points of the day and night?  Maybe it varies from person to person?

I hope I don't remember anything else!!!!!!"
743,"Cos I really can't be bothered. I expressed anger about the way my ex has been with kids this week and t got all excited that I had expressed an emotion, and that usually anger takes longer... She didn't say than what but I guess she means crying/sadness etc? And I pointed I was angry he'd messed up the kids, not me, even said he can do what he likes to me oops!

I totally get why people cry and that it is healthy but I cannot imagine doing it, I don't really cry, I don't know how, I've tried to make myself with evocative music and thinking about things (which is hard as memory v bad, many many gaps) but it doesn't really work. I'd rather get on with life but keep hearing that crying is 'part of the process' etc.

I don't feel like spending however long in therapy waiting to be made to cry, then crying for however long, then getting over the sadness or whatever. Surely I can skip all that?? I have two children to look after I can't be crying all over the shop.

Any experience or opinions?"

No one should have to listen to that sort of thing.  Is it OK to tell her?  Sorry if this is a stupid question.

Maybe I should just say there were some horrible humiliating things.  or maybe I could actually describe them but I don't know if thats allowed, or maybe it would be upsetting to hear.  I wouldnt want to hear it lol.

I have met a lot of people along the way who also feel this way....if healing is possible I wish it would not delay...I'm working my butt off asking when will it be my day?:stomp::stomp::stomp:"
747,"I suffer from PTSD. As apart of this I have problems with SH and hearing voices. I also experience flashbacks and hallucinations. All tis crap stems from a really shitty childhood. I dont really wish to go into how bad things were except it makes my life today a struggle. Have posted in SH and hearing voices forum and wasnt sure where I really belonged.

748,"I find this forum interesting because I think I may have PTSD among other things,
I have never been 'diagnosed' because I cannot get along with medical people espcially 'mind doctors'
the ones at my local hospital are scum anyway.
I did try going to the unit voluntarily for a year and they did bugger all to help me. just tried to fob me off with pills, which they know I refuse to take due to phobia of side effects and allergies. they also offered me 'art group' and 'cookery group' and 'threatre group' none of which appeals to me in the slightest.
so I signed off. that was years ago.
I have been in very bad situtions which would cause anyone to go crazy I think,.
Im not crazy, just angry, feeble, pathetic and very hateful,
I hate myself for being so small and ugly and weak that such abuse could happen to me over and over again,
and I hate myself now because I have no life due to not being able to manage my own body pains and symptoms. and needing care and not being able to live alone in my house because Im scared of the pains in my body.
I have been a victim of kidnap, multiple rape, mugging, sexual abuse, childhood abuse and theft, both by strangers, people I wanted to love me, people I trusted and my mums husband and son.
I hate people. really hate them and want to be left alone. yet I cannot cope on my own, which is ridiculous,.
if I believed in an afterlife I would just die now. but I dont, so I am scared. No god who existed and was kind would have let me experience the kind of things I have seen, so he must be a pervert if he exists at all. Look at all the little animals who suffer abuse at mans hand, and god does nothing.. so he cant exist,
I want to help them, and I give most of my benefit money to animal charities.. even one of those betrayed my trust and vulnerability as well recently.
so I can trust no one.. except maybe my manfriend who helps me but doesnt want sex in return, and my two lovely doglets, who I cant be without,.
even my mum I care about her but dont trust her because she let her husband abuse me when I was a kid and still lives with him.
I cant tell my doctor how I feel, coz he'd disrespect me then. hes a nice bloke and I want him to think im normal,.,. not evil.
so f*** knows what im gonna do now, cant deal with it for sure,. its driving me M** and I really am not,"
749,":cry2: OK so I have a bad past that i often relive while i sleep and because of my sleep disorders it is literally like i relive it and it is one reason i am so afraid to sleep. I am extremely paranoid and am alert all the time. I fear being in a room/car/ect. with a guy or a few guys (i MUST always have a female with me otherwise i am super afraid)... I had a doctor appt yesterday tho, and It was absolutly traumatizing. What i relive in my dreams, well I literally, for real had to experience it in real life and it brought back the most terrifying images and fear that i can not get rid of. I do not know who to talk to anymore either to get it off my mind or get help with dealing with it cuz my therapist severed the trust and I do not want to talk to her, and it is not a subject any of my friends know about...... all i want to do is cry:cry: and.... I am so afraid to live, and always afraid it will happen again. I do not want to live in this fear..... And i dont know what to do."
750,"One of the many stupid little things brought up in therapy is that after getting so smashed when I was 14 that I couldn't remembe anything til the next day, one of the guys who'd been there rang me to say he really wanted me to get a pg test as he thought someone had had sex with me. He was really insistent and serious about it but I just brushed him off. Tbh I don't think it is possible as I don't remember any physical symptoms (tho assume I could have forgotten them as I seem to have chosen to forget many things). But i reckon something must have happened for him to be so serious about it.  He was really worried that i ignored him. Therapist said I have to choose whether to deal with it or just shelve it. Last night I just felt like there are too many things which I will have to shelve but this is one thing I could possible find out more about. 

So I found his email address, quite easy as I have heard about him here and there and I knew he was self-employed. And I emailed him and just asked, explaining I'm in therapy and just want to know and it won't go any further.

I dont suppose he'll get back? I hope he does. Is this a crazy thing to do, has anyone else had a similar experience?"
751,"There are so many parts of me that need attention and healing some days I don't know where to begin...so I just lie down and rest...one thing I know is that all parts of me are terribly traumatized so trying to rest and relax myself is so important....one day I had an image of myself walking very quickly and my inner child was attached to my hip lifeless and as I walked I was dragging her along with me...so I have stopped overdoing things...and I check in with her and talk to her before I do even something as simple as washing the dishes or going to group or going shopping.  I have stopped forcing myself to work when I cannot and I have been off for almost a year now....it has been tough financially but I am getting better at budgeting and I do without things and not worry about it...

There is one girl that tries to get me to go out with her but she is so toxic that I turn her down all the time...I have asked her to move on...but she keeps contacting me from time to time...why I do not know....I cannot go out right now with anybody...I am hurting so much that I won't have a good time.  I can talk in group therapy because we are talking about what hurts but outside of that I am writing and not really talking to anybody.

Last night I felt like I had a really good rest...so much so that I did not need a coffee this morning...I drank some orange juice instead...I feel like I am resting all parts of me on every level and I realize that is what I need to do right now.  I have done a lot of reading on surviving childhood sexual abuse and PTSD and now I am ready to start reading books on Dissociative Disorder.....the books on hearing voices did not help me that much.  I learned more from talking to others who hear voices too....

If I look back at myself and how I was a year ago...i have improved significantly and that is encouraging but I also know that I have a long way to go....a year of hard work has paid off and I am hoping another year of hard work will move me forward in my healing journey...

Oh well...this journey is taking me up and down, all around the only constants being pain and chronic fatigue....two things that I hope will eventually lessen or go away as I do the healing work..."
752,"I feel like I have been walking through a dark, dense forest for the last three years...I am 42 and have been feeling like I am 99 and on the way out the door..low energy...no motivation...mood depressed...mind cluttered...general feeling rage and pain...today I felt a little better...I had a little energy and did not have to drag myself to group therapy....I actually walked out the door to my apartment feeling okay and that feeling lasted all the way to the group...during the group and all the way home and even now as I write...it feels like there is a break in the clouds...can it be that things might...just might be looking up or is it just a lucky so so day instead of being another crappy day?

Only time will tell of course...I'll see how I feel tomorrow...but I was so surprised today that I just had to say something...I felt 92 today instead of 99...still old and very weary but today I did not feel like the end was coming...I actually wondered if I could possibly feel my age some day in the future.

Healing from PTSD has been my dream for decades...and I have been working at it really hard for three years...it would be really nice to at least get to the point where the fog I have been walking in all my life is a little less dense or dare I wish that it clear up...

Well...that is all...hoping for a similar or better day tomorrow....wish me luck :)"

754,"Hi... so I've just been reading this forum for the first time today and my mind is a jumble of thoughts and it's hard to write this but I need help. 

I am 33, and have been in therapy for the last 6 months or so. My counselor is now certain that I have PTSD, though I was diagnosed with ADHD about 6 months ago. I know that my childhood had a lot of emotional and physical trauma, but my counselor strongly suspects that there was sexual abuse too. I don't remember any, but I do know that certain behaviors of mine throughout childhood and as an adult would generally point to my having experienced early childhood sexual abuse. Most of my childhood is locked up and I don't remember much except in little pictures, or in stories that I have heard members of my family tell and re-tell -- they're not really ""my"" memories. I remember plenty of unpleasant stuff between my mother, sister, and I - fights and arguments and emotional/physical abuse, but not to the extent that I think it would be causing such problems for me to this day.

Throughout my life, I've had spells of what I thought was depression, though now I think it was anxiety and being overwhelmed. Depression was a word that felt safe and accepted to use, so I would tell doctors and counselors that I had a history of depression. So, that's what I was treated for, but nothing really ever made much of a difference, and I would bounce back on my own. At age 19/20 I went through a period of self-harm that manifested by having sex with random strangers I met online or on a phone sex line. I don't remember much about it except that I am ashamed about it now, and that I felt almost mechanical and detached when it was all happening. Then I attempted suicide sort of out of the blue at age 21. Between these times, and in general, I have been overall a very high-functioning, seemingly smart person. I've been successful with work, until occasionally I just could not get myself to go to work and would call in sick too often, etc., but always manage to get another job because I present well - I come across as confident, charismatic, etc.

I got married 8 years ago and generally things were smooth for a number of years. I periodically fell into a funk or experienced anger that I could not explain, but generally my husband and I both just chalked it up to my ""history of depression"". Then my son was born in 2006, and things got much worse for me then. My anxiety skyrocketed, but of course I didn't really recognize it as anxiety then. When my son was 2, I became so dissatisfied at my husband and how he didn't seem to be helping me or recognize that I was falling apart. I remember a very clear ""split"" happening at that time, and deciding in my mind that I was ""done"" with my marriage and that since he didn't care about me anymore, it was up to me to find my own happiness. I didn't tell my husband anything at that time; I have always avoided conflict to a just crazy degree. I didn't want to, or couldn't, deal with it then. Shortly thereafter, I started experimenting with BDSM and ended up doing risky, dangerous, scary sexual stuff with people I met online. At the same time, I was also working full-time at a rather prestigious job that put me in the public eye. To all people observing, I was successful, on top of the world. Part of me was almost ""high"" on this feeling that came when I was engaged in my hidden world, and I remember frequently feeling proud of myself, but also guilty and ashamed and knowing that eventually everything was going to come crashing down around me and I was going to get caught. I didn't care. I knew I was going to get caught, and didn't want to, but frankly at a certain point was sort of fatalistic and thought that I was just going to do this as long as I could, and when I got caught, I would just kill myself. I was detached and unemotional about that. I didn't really want to go on living.

In 2009, I gradually stopped feeling that compelling urge to do what I'd been doing sexually, though it didn't stop 100%. I was still hiding almost all of myself from my husband and keeping a completely separate life from him and anyone else in my ""real"" life. My work started to falter and I couldn't seem to concentrate on anything or make myself DO things that needed to be done. It got to the point where I could barely get through a day at work and couldn't understand what was happening to me. My husband finally told me he thought we should go to counselling, which shocked me because, in my mind, we had been ""done"" for over a year. He never had any idea. The truth started to come out - in trickles at first, because I could NOT face what I had done, let alone tell him about it. The shame hit big time, then. We struggled hugely to come to terms with what I'd done, and I still can't even tell him WHY I did those things. We have been in marital counseling for the last year. Sometime maybe about a year ago, a friend of mine mentioned that it seemed like I might want to get evaluated for ADHD. At first I was skeptical and judgmental (didn't really have a perception of what ADD was except for over-diagnosed and hyperactive little boys). But once I started reading, things started clicking for me. My mind was all over the place. I got evaluated and they diagnosed me, and I started taking Ritalin. It DID help, and I began to see improvement right away -- but a lot of strange things were still plaguing me, and I still didn't understand what was going on with me.

About 4-6 months ago we started seeing a new counselor - at first for just marital. I have always had varying feelings about sex, and instinctively knew that something was ""not right"", but it's never EVER been something I've felt comfortable talking about in therapy. Pretty quickly, our new counselor was picking up on things with me and she said months ago that she was not convinced of my having ADHD, and it felt more like trauma to her. I didn't understand that because I didn't think I had any real trauma to speak of, except for what I have already mentioned. We've been going slow, she's been teaching me coping techniques, etc., but just in the last week I have begun really falling apart. Now that it seems ""real"", like stuff in my childhood really is connected to all the weird issues I've had all these years, well... that ought to be comforting to me, I would think, but instead I am just ...... not good.

I just started a new job 6 weeks ago and really NEED this job; it is providing my family with decent medical insurance for the first time in years and we really need the income. For the previous 6 months I wasn't really able to work, but just now, I am feeling less able than ever to work. I went in today for an hour, and started to have ... I guess a panic attack, or something, but I passed it off as nausea, because I didn't want them to think I was mentally ill. Apparently I looked bad enough that they thought I had the flu or something, but now my anxiety is higher than ever, because there will be so much work for me to come back to tomorrow, and at the same time, I am not 100% sure I will be ABLE to go back tomorrow. Which really brings me to the reason I am writing today, after all that above... how can I keep my job? CAN I get through this without losing it? Should I? My counselor told me last night that I might really just need to take some time to finish getting through this. I understand that, but ... this job was a very rare opportunity and very good one. Getting better is the #1 most important thing right now, but losing this job would be very bad.

Ugh... I am sorry this is so long. If anyone has gotten through it... I guess, any words of advice would be so much appreciated. I am going to be seeing my psychiatrist next week to ask for medical treatment for the PTSD. I am currently taking 40mg Ritalin and 60mg Buspar, which seems to be helping, but obviously I may need something more, at least for the short term.

Last question is about this trauma... if in fact there are repressed memories or something... do they HAVE to come out? My counselor has NOT been encouraging me to go digging - she says that if they come, they will come when I am ready - but - I am not convinced there is anything ""extra"" there beyond what I already know about. And I am not sure I want to know, ever. If there is something... well, I think I know the ""who"", if not the ""what"". And I really don't want to face knowing something horrible about these people in my life.

Thank you very much if you happen to get this far."
755,"Ok here goes bear with me.  Had a pretty crappy childhood and suffered from mental health/depressive issues since the age of around 7 when my parents marriage started to go terribly wrong.  I was an unexpected child for my parents in their 40s.  Was left with dear mummy after the split but definitely had been closer to my dad in my younger years.  Now age 37 I have a family of my own a fantastic husband of 16 years and a son (14) and daughter (13) all of who support me unconditionally.  However the need to get my parents love and approval has always eluded me.  

I've been having counselling for years and revisited it this year to deal with the issues surrounding my childhood and the way that I punish myself mentally due to many issues after my parents split.  I gave up on mum 2 years ago, I'm never going to be enough for her nothing ever makes our relationship close - sad but you have to know when to cut your loses.  The plan looked good I was going to live in the now and get to know my dad better.  Unfortunately dad was taken ill in May and diagnosed with heart failure.  He is still in hospital after losing 12 stone he has lost all his strength can no longer stand and is totally incontinent.  After a case conference this week it has been decided that he must go into a nursing home as he cannot care for himself and he needs 24 hour care for his medical needs.  I went to visit him yesterday and he has been diagnosed with mild cognitive problems and the nurses have advised me that his memory will deteriorate rapidly with the possibility that he is in the mid dementia stages.

Heres the problem  I feel like the time has gone now to get to know him and its too late.  He didn't even know who I was yesterday and when talking to me actually referred to me and asked me to look after me as I am only a little girl.

I'm crying as I type this.  The whole situation is hopeless.  Add to this the fact that I have 3 siblings who I have no contact with they are putting him in the nursing home and I have no say over where he is going or how to break it to him.  One of my siblings does give me basic info when she can be bothered and she has told me that they are planning on not telling him he is going into a home and merely telling him he is going to convalese(?) I think this is so cruel because he constantly asks to go home at present and thinks that he lives in his first family home from 1933.  

I thought I was getting through this slowly and things were progressing but now I can see no way forward.  Even with my beautiful family around me I'm drowning and don't know how to explain it to my husband.  He is very caring but doesn't understand why I can't take the fact that people do get old and parents should die before their children.  A great view if you can take it but unfortunately I am struggling.

Sorry for the length of this.  I think sometimes it just helps to type even if no-one reads it.

Love Claire x"
756,"Thought I was doing really well recently but just got another vision of what happened way back when, and I thought since I know more or less what happened these flashbacks would just fuck off, but no, they just hide out of sight until I am thinking the worst is over and 'bam' back they come with a vengence.

I just need some peace."
757,"In real life, body memories are a common occurrence for trauma survivors.
For most survivors, the body memories are much more involved, and occur as a much longer process. They will happen more frequently, and not come in such a neat package. But the point is, the body will remember the trauma, and the body will feel the same physical sensations all over again as it “tells the story” of what happened.
Body memories are the body’s way of remembering, storing, and telling the trauma. The survivor’s mind may have blocked out the pain and created dissociative walls around the traumatic experience, but the physical body itself can remember the trauma through cellular memory.
Sometimes survivors experience the body memories separately from intellectual understanding or emotional remembrance of what happened during the trauma. Dissociative survivors will feel intense body pain and have no idea why they are hurting. When the body remembers the traumatic incident at a different time from when the mind remembers the incident, it can feel very crazy making. The therapeutic goal is to put the various pieces together so that the survivor can work through, process, and heal from the memory as a whole.
The body feels the trauma in much the same as in the original incident and the various physical attitudes occur as if the trauma was happening all over again. The physical pain, shaking, trembling, jerking, physical reactions, intensity, and various body responses happen in a similar fashion as in the original trauma
Body memories are an important piece of the healing work. The body can say a lot about the incidents of abuse, and it really is impossible to re-create a body memory when there was no memory in the first place.
Because of that, body memories are often helpful in breaking through the denial layers of dissociation. The body may remember moments of the abuse that were too emotionally difficult for the survivors to manage, but by truly listening to their bodies, survivors can learn a great deal about their histories.
What is your body saying to you?
What does your body remember that your mind refuses to think about?
What does your body remember that you don’t want to hear?
What will it take for you to listen to your body? Your body was there for the abuse too. Maybe it knows more than you think it does."
758,"At 42 years old...I am in so much pain and am so depressed that I cannot work.  I have what my doctors call chronic PTSD ... it has affected my life especially my ability to go to work and to school...I finished college but I suffered the whole way...my nerves were shot by the end of it and I was popping anti-anxiety medication like there was no tomorrow...looking back they did not really help...I still hurt..

I remember sitting in class hurting in much the same way I am hurting now except then I felt the pain in my abdomen and now I feel it in my head...

I am really looking into myself and am facing the memories bravely and writing about what I remember and how I felt be it mad, hurt or sad...I went to bed very angry last night as I remember parts of my life and how traumatic and hurtful...people picking on me just because they knew I had no support system...I was already hurting because I was alone and they just made it worse.

I am in therapy but it is only twice a month.  This fall I will be attending a lot of group therapy and honestly I am hurting now and expect to continue to hurt just as much if not more as things come up in group.

I don't have any friends so I am very isolated which adds to the pain.  Sometimes I would feel better if I just had someone to talk to about whatever to distract from the pain.  Today I sat in my apartment alone and felt a need to have someone else present.  I did not think that hospital would be a good call...I hate it in there..I am always scared on the ward even on the women's ward...so I would rather stay home.

I have not left home for four days and go out only when I have appointments which have been few over the summer.  I know I will be meeting more people in the fall but I am very lonely now.

I keep looking into myself to see what is causing me to feel so low that I cannot exercise or do anything ongoing without pain or forcing myself and then having to stop because I feel too overwhelmed...there seems to be a lot of pain stored in my mind and body...

I read courage to heal...I read other books on trauma and did the exercises but more and more comes up and when I work through the many lists that are exercises in the books I don't know what to do with what I learn about myself.  My only guess is that I have to work to change how I am in the world and not let the years of abuse win...but that will take time ... just remembering what hurts also takes time and when I remember I hurt so badly .... at least now I still bid the memories come...I am ready for the pain and if it kills me I am ready for that too.  

I used to be afraid to die but I am not any more...not that I am suicidal...I am not but I am not afraid of death anymore...maybe that is what gives me courage to face life.  Just wish the pain would diminish.  I have been hurting like this for as long as I can remember...wish there was an end to the pain...but 42 years...I can only hope...

Am I alone...or does anyone have these same things happening too?"
759,"Well...I figured out what that heavy feeling inside me is that has affected my ability to enjoy life, work, school even to take in my surroundings in a beautiful park or forest...it is anger...pent up anger that I have not been in touch with my whole life...

I am glad that I am in touch with it now...but it feels hot and as it is surfacing is making me feel all kinds of discomfort...

Working on giving expression to that anger using art and will be starting an expressive art group...I think I will choose red and black paint and crayons and go to town on whatever paper they provide in the group.

When I was in hospital two years ago the doctor said that I had rage...I looked at her innocently and said 'who me?' ...she said YES YOU and I could not imagine what she was talking about...but now that it is oozing out of me I can see what she saw in my eyes and heard in my voice...rage...

It came into my head to write out every mean word I was ever called, every put down I received, every criticism...all the negative messages I have been receiving over the years...I wrote two full pages...no space to spare and my body started to hurt....it is like all the pain associated with those words came out all at once and I hurt from head to toe for five days and am still hurting...but I am glad I did it...I have it out of me ...those I guess were hidden hurts that I had forgotten about and stuffed so I put them out of me and felt the pain of them...now I am at the part of the exercise where I am refuting everything and writing the evidence against the mean things said to me...what proves them wrong...some things I realized are things that people just toss around liberally....like the 'b' word and the word loser...so I decided to not take it personally and just wrote that those people can be described in those words too....

My anger feels like a bottomless pit right now but I know it is not bottomless...if I keep writing I will eventually get it all out and find peace.....at least that is the hope...and here is to hoping..."
760,"PTSD, it is real, it does exist, and it is not something that can be ignored or brushed to the side. However, does talking really help PTSD? is it suppose to get worse before it gets better? Can you ever get over it? are you suppose to do what society tells you and just ""ignore"" what happened, ""move on"", or to whaat? On  the other hand, I was told talking about it would make it easier to get past, easier to deal with, but the one time I told anyone about it, I was literally almost killed, just like he said would happen if i told:scared:..... Should i talk? will it help? how do i know what to do? :confused:"
761,"I don`t have PTSD but I think my depression started when I was raped by two bastards.  
I have never talked about it. But it seems like my life is getting worse and worse. Nihgtmares, low self-esteem, problems with school, strange thoughts, self-destruction like self harm, smoking, to top it all my psychiatrist suspects me to  have schizophrenia... :unsure: lovely..
I didn´t have these symptoms earlier, but now it´s too late to be PTSD. Now it´s almost 4 years since ""the accident"" and I should be in good health.
I´m here and frightened because I have no clue what is wrong with my head... Have I PTSD, schizophrenia? or am I just depressed? :unsure:"

I do google searches and see various info or videos, primarily by those saying it is the best thing since sliced bread.  The same type of testimonials that I saw for Electro Conculsve Therapy.

My Brother inlaw is in the RAF and late last year he turned around to my sister and said he didn't love her any more and didn't want to be married any more etc etc he got really mean (not physically)

Any how he said come back she did and then he did it all over again....

He then said come back and she said no so after a few weeks he said he went to the Dr and they diagnosed PTSD and referred him for counseling of which he went to 2 sessions and he now says he is cured?? 

Can this happen can some one with PTSD be ""cured"" in two 30 minute sessions or was this just BS to get my sister back?

769,"Got a friend whoes son was in the forces. After he left Ireland and left the forces he became unstable and got into trouble with the law.

To cut a long story short he is in a mess now as the forces appear not to support people with a 'record' Shame for him as they trained him up as cannon fodder then in my opinion failed to retrain him for civilian life and in the world of normalness he was uable to cope as well as suffering terrible flash backs

770,"Hiya, my name is lily and im 24. I have recently been seeing a new therapist who believes i am suffering with P.T.S.D and i just wanted to talk to those who can relate a little to what i am going through and who may also have some advice having been there themselves.....so heres my story.

I was sexually assaulted, not yards from my house one day walking back from school at the age of 13, i know people have gone through a lot worse but it was very traumatic for me. I had little knowledge about sex and things at that age and it felt like i'd been thrown into this very adult and horrible world. It was reported to the police and i was interviewed, but pretty much straight after that it wasnt talked about...my parents didnt know how to deal with it and werent given any advice so im guessing they thought the best thing was to pretend like it never happened and move on. What i didnt know was that not talking about it wasnt helping and that started to show in my behaviour. I developed OCD, i'd self groom excessively, particulary straighten my hair until it was falling out but it felt comforting and i needed that self assurance. My parents noticed and threatened to send me to a therapist which at 13 was horrifying and so it shocked me out of the pattern, though it did return later in a different form. 
About 6months after i got my first bf, who was 3yrs older than me but seemed alot older which i liked because i think i felt a need for protection...it didnt last long but we still saw each other because we had mutual friends, he treated me very badly during this time period, was very cruel with the things he said and gathered his friends to join in,so most nights i'd come home feeling even more worthless than i already did. Enough was enough and i stopped seeing them, but the damage was already done.
I went through various stages as a teenager, from being extremely rebellious with no self respect, to a withdrawn person who wouldnt let anyone see her in daylight. I always had this obsession with how i looked, but by the end of year 11 i was coping and when i got into 6th form at school i came into my own, had a amazing bf and friends who were supportive and was doing really well at school and started to have confidence within myself. 
I got a place at uni, and for the first year all was well..i was very nervous and shy but i made a few friends,though i felt like the stupidest one in the group. I was doing good in my work and exams tho which was the main thing to me. We moved house which i found very hard,and not long after me and my bf broke up which broke my heart to be honest. I got through that by putting all my focus into my studies,but then one early winter morning i had to be in uni early, it was dark and a man approached me as i got off my bus....he followed me and kept getting in my personal space asking if he could be my friend and i just thought 'oh god its gonna happen again'. I ran and caught the bus straight home, i cried my eyes up all the way back. My therapist believes this is what triggered my now excessive behaviour, one because being followed alone is traumatic but also my association with that day i was assaulted.
I havent been out of my house alone since that day which was now 3yrs ago,not even to walk to the shop. i have panic attacks regulary, low mood and my ocd is extreme. help that ive had does not seem to be working and i just want to know what others think, or if they have any advice? feel free to ask anything sorry i've talked so much but i felt it was all valid

771,"i have been diagnosed with trauma indused psychosis and i just reasurched that this in related to PTSD. Is this true?

Thank you."
772,"When I was a small child, about 6 or so, I started having sexual fantasies about the grown men in my life. These fantasies made me incredibly uncomfortable. I developed this awful need to hide whenever I heard someone coming (like if I knew they were getting out of their car to come inside, or if I heard them coming down the hall to whatever room I was in). I had awful rape nightmares, and at that age wasn't entirely sure what any of it meant. I was also very easily startled, screaming whenever someone spoke unexpectedly, or touched me, or raised a hand near me (even if it was just to scratch their nose or something).

When I was 5 I was introduced to my dad for the first time. My mom had me when she was 16, and was afraid to tell my dad about me. He moved away without ever knowing I existed, and my grandparents raised me. When I was 4 my mom took me to come live with her and she got a hold of my dad for child support. She agreed not to make him pay child support as long as he had a father-daughter relationship with me. I'm sure he hated me from the getgo, when he found out about me he and his current girlfriend had just brought my little brother home from the hospital (having just been born). He blamed me for pretty much everything that went wrong in his life from that point on, and used to beat me, throwing me into walls, tossing me to the floor, hitting me, beating me with sticks... it's very painful to remember.

Nobody believed me, except my stepmom who was too afraid of him to do anything about it. I've always been clumsy and everyone preferred to believe that, instead. My mom and stepdad said that if something was going on I had to deal with it on my own, but I had no idea how to go about it and I was afraid as well. When I was 16, and there was drama going on with my mom and stepdad (he's very strict, military-style, and my mom is a free spirit who liked to sleep around and was never home), I opted to move in with my father, until he told me stories of horrible beatings he did to my little brother and I talked to my school counselor. She called child protective services on him without my knowing it (though I should have realized this would happen), but nothing came of it except that entire side of my family disowning me because I was, apparently, a ""bad egg"". 

My symptoms from the first paragraph have just gotten worse and worse, including anxiety attacks, flashbacks, self-harm...

When I lost my virginity my hyman wasn't intact, which was when it all came crashing down on me. During that year when I was 5, just after my mom took me away from my grandparents, but before my dad came into the picture, I was raped. I remember very little from that year, except that there were constantly people coming in and out of our home (and my life) that were untrustworthy at best, acquaintances of my mom. She was always far too trusting of strangers (even to this day) and I believe that one of her ""friends"" raped me several times throughout that year. I know one of her boyfriends beat me, he beat her and my small sister, as well. But the sexual fantasies at a young age, when I wasn't even sure what they meant, and the fact that I've always felt uncomfortable around men, the fact that I blacked out most of that year but I remember most of the years prior and after...

My counselor believes I'm right, I show all the classic signs, but my mom denies me ever having been in a situation for it to have happened. My stepdad was around at the time (she was cheating on him, and he was in the navy so was gone a lot), and he remembers the sudden  change in my personality and the shady characters and he strongly believes that I was raped, so do most members of my extended family. But I don't remember it. My mom denies it, my stepdad was gone too often to have any more than vague hunches... but I believe that if I remember the incident I might be able to work through my issues and lessen my symptoms.

I want to avoid drugs as much as possible, but it's very difficult to live like this... the horrible nightmares almost every night, the constant flinching, the need to hide, the constant fear, the hyper-vigilance... I'm exhausted just going through the hourly routines of making sure nobody is hiding in my curtains or under the couch! I have awful rape dreams, the face is almost always different, sometimes it's someone I know and trust only it turns out to be a demon who is just wearing their face... sometimes it's a nameless, faceless entity. I'm terrified of leaving my back uncovered, as though something will sneak up behind me. I also have dreams where I can't move at all, though my eyes are open and I'm looking around the room. Sometimes I see my fiance there, getting ready for bed or getting ready to get up, and I know I'm awake, but I can't move and it feels like I'm not breathing, like I'm suffocating, and then I feel movement like if my fiance touches me or the bed moves or something, and I'm released and snap out of it. Sometimes I hear a buzzing sound that slowly gets louder and paralyzes me, and it takes movement or someone touching me to snap me out of it.

Does anybody else have these symptoms? What do you do to help them? Is there a method to remembering trauma you've blacked-out to help you deal with it? These things have always exhausted me, and it's only recently that I learned about PTSD and how they all tie together due to my past experiences... I don't personally know anyone else who can relate to me and it would be nice to know that I'm not alone. Please and thank you for any support!"
773,"i have suffered depression and anxiety in the past but i thought now i am inmy late sixties i would be able to cope. my daughter had a rarecancer and last year was spent watching her battle for her life. we had to go to basingstoke for 6 weeks and i somehow coped. i had to be strong for her but since she has been getting well i am slowly going down mentally. i dont know why i feel so scared all the time, my youngest at 29 went away for a weeks holiday and i went to pieces. my long term partner who doesnt live with me, is going fishing for a week and im in pieces. its stupid i have my two daughters, friends, faith and yet i cannot connect. i cant stop crying and cant sleep. i dont want to go down that road again. why am i so scared of everything. its like i cant go forward and im stuck in this black hole. the thought of going away in october with my partner for a weeks holiday is taking its toll too. my daughter is well enough to go on holiday and her and her husband are going away on a cruise in july for one week, im dreading it. im scared of anything that is outside my comfort zone. its not like im alone my youngest daughter still lives with me and works but doesnt get home till late in the evening.  i feel selfish and stupid and really really scared. this cancer is hanging over my head like a cloud, i know that my daughters lifespan is shortened but she hopefully will keep well enough and they can keep it at bay. im a christian so have a faith but when this depression kicks in im lost completely and cant cope.  i love buddhism and am trying to meditate at home, have made myself an alter but i need to understand whats wrong with me. compared to some people i feel selfish to be like this. my son whom i adored walked out on his family 11 years ago and stopped us from seeing my two grandchildren. me my daughters and ex husband have not had any contact since although we tried. there was no arguments or major problems so we dont know why he did this is this all part of it."

775,"If I dont end up in the hospital by the end of this upcoming week, I will be VERY surprised.

Out of nowhere I had a nightmare in relation to the incident that caused my PTSD...not very pleasant...I don't think I can compose myself...at least not for the next few days...I've spent the last two days in tears, feeling angry, self-harming and smashing almost everything in my apartment...lost a littttle bit of control I'd say...I also find myself humming when I start to get upset again and then I proceed to rock back and forth and then I lose it...

I've been scared away from health professionals, counsellors, everybody in that field essentially. I've had some not so great experiences...I don't have a gp, because Ontario has a MAJOR shortage of doctors, and emergency rooms terrify me...But I figure if I don't get better I'm going to e-mail the one person who doesn't treat me any differently because of my ptsd (unlike everyone else). His e-mails always make things better and him being one of my professors, I dont feel endangered or scared (I have some troubles with males because all incidents contributing to my ptsd are a result of being attacked by males...the major one involved two male drunk co-workers dragging me into the back of the work place...enough said). Worse case scenario I'll be contacting him to drag my butt to the ER. 

Has anybody successfully overcome their ptsd to any extent?? Will I ever lose my fear of males??:blush:"
776,"I suffer from PTSD and it is ruining my life... the help from my psychologist doesn't even seem to be working... all I get is all these sheets to read and none of it helps.

778,"I've been in and out of hospital now for 18 months. The last time I was in, I was told by the psychiatrist that he couldn’t help me, only keep me ""safe"", he said that my CAT therapy would be the thing that would help, however I have 3 sessions left! and its done nothing, I had COG for 10 months before this and that did nothing either. I worry and over analyise everything making me question reality all of the time :unsure:, and it makes me so anxious, now I am addicted to lorazepam because i've taken it so much as part of my medications. Life feels like a living hell, I am now in care because of my history and I thought everything was ok with my lodgers, but its scary how much we don’t have in common, it feels like i'm living with strangers. I get so alone, flashbacks! I hate them, nightmares, triggers, constant fear that someone is out to get me and I cant even go to certain places anymore because it’s like a memory trip. I hate it. Does this ever go??  I’m sick of ending up in generals for SH/OD's, running away and sometimes not knowing that I’ve even ran off until I’m lost and reality kicks in or the police have caught up with me, I’m sick of being in psych hospitals, and nurses greeting me as if I never left, sometimes I think that I am already dead and I am creating this world up in my head to keep me sane, when actually its not sane at all. Will this ever go? I just want this too stop, I’m learning how too deal with this sooo slowly there has only ever been a few people in my life who I can say have helped but only temporarily! :cry:

P.S. I used to see a little girl called Molly (she looks and sounds about 10 years old), she used to tell me to die, and she would scream and try and make me hurt others. “go out in style”. no one believed it at the time, she was my secret for ages before I said because I was ashamed of how she was making me feel. I sometimes can hear her talking to me, mostly at night. Does anyone else here with PTSD experience stuff like this, its creeps me out and I don’t know what to do as my “outreach team” wont listen. 
Thankyou for reading this, it means a lot to me.
Becky."
779,this is going to sound awfull but i was raped and they made me have a bath afterward.  now i'm scared to shower or bathe.  i can go up to 3 days without getting in there.  once i'm in there i'm fine but it's just getting in that is the trick.  anyone else do this?
780,"why does one person decide its a good idea to come along and mess up someone elses life?
if that ******* hadnt of come into my life and did those things to me i could be passing all of my exams, i could feel safe mentally. i wouldnt be punishing my body every single day because i would be HAPPY. 
i dont need anyone and no one needs me."
781,":confused: well, here i am again...dont know what to do or how to help myself...A+E...nah dont think so.

For the last few months i have been fantastic, i have confronted my demons and felt as though i was doing really well, i have been getting out of the house, something i was afraid to do, i stopped smoking, very strange in itself because i feel now like i have never smoked, i began an Open University degree and passed the first of many modules with flying colours, my confidence seemed to make a return when i had a very long and loud argument with my neighbour and i didnt lose control.

Then it happened, a couple of weeks ago i missed my meds, not on purpose, but i missed, and as usual i convinced myself i could cope without them so i havent taken any since:doh2:
I think that i am now possibly the worst i have ever been, i am Jekyll and Hyde, on the one hand i am manipulative and cunning, its as if my head is planning without my permission:evil: it wants to get aggressive at every opportunity and it has times when it forward plans confrontational situations, funny thing is that i think that this is the guy talking now, calm, confident, slow... being sure of myself, reading and re-reading every word...arrogant

Then on the other side, i am now afraid to leave the house, i am suspicious of everything, everybody, every noice, i cant watch TV, i usher my wife and daughter off to bed as soon as is possible, this makes my enviroment easier to control, i cant sleep at night because of the noices, i have again started to see people that arnt there, this week a child of around 4-5 woke me from a brief nap, pulling on my foot (i was layed down) i woke, i acknowledged the child, asked what the problem was and got no answer for what seemed like a few mins then the child just disapeared, i was fully awake and found myself upset and extremely, even acutely aware of my surroundings, this stayed with me for a couple of days.
I was in bed a few nights ago, i was reading and the TV was on, i heard a voice call out my name, you know how some call your name in such a way as to be calling you over... i turned the TV down and listened, a shadow in my bedroom called to me from near the door, i got out of bed, went to the door and again listened, i clearly heard a voice whisper ""come here"", i went out into the hall way and looked into the other bedrooms, my eldest sons window was open, he was at his girlfriends for the night so i went into the room and closed the window, as i turned around i remember thinking ""what an idiot"" then i hear a voice at the bottom of the stairs call out ""here"", when i got to the top of the stairs i could clearly see a man standing at the foot of the stair, i sat on the top step, looked at him and said ""just get on with it cause i have had enough, next thing i know my wife was behind me asking what i was doing and the man had gone, i checked the house, it was secure.
there have been several similar instances but smaller ones, even sat here typing i feel as though i am being watched, i have to keep checking, the acute awareness is starting to take its toll today, i dont want to contact my pdoc or nurse, i dont think i can trust them so i only tell them what i think they want to know, i dont tell my family, they think i am getting better, i need to explode:stomp::scared::blush::cry2:, not just a bang, more of a boom, i can feel it inside and i dont know what to do about it other than wait for it to happen.


sorry for bangin on guys:("
782,"Im pretty sure everyone here who has been abused in some way or another has felt anger. weather it be towards the abuser, at themselves or just about anything. 
But my anger can sometimes be hard to manage. it can be so intense that it can intefere with my day to day life. 
how does everyone else manage their anger? 
i have talked about it on many occasions and talking about anger just doesnt help. self harm can be a way for me to cope but i strictly try to avoid that. the only thing i can really think of is punching something or finding some way to focus the pain i feel inside. 
just another speedbump i guess"
783,"I know I'm not alone, but I don't know how to ""fix"" myself :|

Well... I have a lot of issues going on in my head... I don't really know where to start so I may jump around a bit...

One thing I have an issue with is the fact that my mom told me that when I was between 2-4(I can't actually remember the age she said) I came home from a babysitter mentioning something about ""red eyes"" or something like that... I don't ever remember even GOING to that babysitter... 

I have a bunch of other things that I have issues with, mostly done by my dad... Like the time he ended up in jail because he hit my brother hard enough to cause his nose to bleed... later that day my mom came home and found out about it. She packed his stuff for when he came home. I had been on time-out when he got home and so I was in the kitchen. My mom told me to call 911. I went for the phone but he unplugged the connection(it was connected to the living room line) so my mom told me to go to the neighbors and ask her to call them. I opened the door to get to the side door and he was there, closed it and my mom bum rushed him. She pinned him to the door and told me to go... he grabbed my shirt and I heard a ripping sound... as I was let go I checked my shirt... no rip :| I went to the neighbors and called 911... and it went from there... the last thing I remember is talking to a police officer or two... I can't remember what they asked no matter how hard I try
   He used to give us spankings with a belt until I was 8-9... when I was 12 he threw me at a couch hard enough to knock it over, between the age of 8 and 12 sometime he kicked me in the ass hard enough to leave a bruise... The last thing I remember him doing is when I was 13... 
   My brother and I were going to sleep on the floor(something we did often and had called it ""camping"") and talking until we felt tired. Dad shouted for us to ""shut up"" from the living room... we waited for a while... then started whispering, eventually not realizing that our voices got louder... the door opened, nearly missing my head... He then lifted up his foot and slammed it down on my head 10 or so times... I used to remember the number... I waited for a while and eventually they headache he had caused grew too painful so I carefully went out there earning a ,""What do you want?!"" to which I squeeked out, ""I have a headache..."" and he grunted... I got some asprin and then went back into the room. My brother went to sleep while I stayed up, read a book and waited for my mom to get home. She got home and I told her the story... which ended up being the final straw.

Those are most of the things I can remember... the issues I'm currently having are what I feel like are excess emotions... I can feel other peoples emotions, mostly surface ones but sometimes the deeper rooted emotions. at first it was scary to experience, but I got used to it until recently....

My best friend pretty much stopped coming around, claiming to be ""busy"" when he has plenty of time to play games and smoke weed :| He was one of the people who, when he was around, helped me keep my emotions and anxieties in check... now that he's gone I've regressed to ""stuffing""... Its not healthy, but it's better than overreacting to everything...

Because of losing him... I've gotten all the extra emotions back and I can't handle it... also I get the shakes whenever I get too anxious... whether I'm scared or angry or whatever... its hard... my memory lasts 2-3 weeks for short term and I can remember stuff after 1 year unless I think of it...

I suffer from complex-ptsd and I have just emerged from a three week episode of complete withdrawal.

Can I asked anybody suffering from this illness ""is this part of c-ptsd or is it the meds (Quetiapine)??

I ask because I alternate almost on a weekly basis from high to low.

787,Anyone had it? how does it work? does it work?
788,"not sure if it is or not, tried telling my t but cos dont have nightmares she ruled it out.

anyway heres the story, before i had either of my kids i had an ectopic preg, i was heart broken, felt i had let my baby down, it didnt do what should be so natural. and when i am having bad times i want to die to be with this baby, as my current ones have a mum and dad, and my baby has no one, is all alone.

anyway the reason i wonder if i have ptsd, is cos i struggle to be close to my kids, i adore them, love them to bits, but petrified of losing them, if they fall over etc, i just say u are ok, have to force myself to cuddle them etc, scared i guess to face they are not well, fear takes over, especially with the eldest, as i was lucky and fell preg again quickly, so in theory i would still have been preg with the one i lost.

i have vision/fears of them becoming drug addicts, or been raped, i cant see the good stuff, just fear and abandonment, and when i was preg i literally went to the extremes of what not to eat, and i mean extremes, totally over the top during both pregs as scared i would lose them againif i didnt.

when they were born i insisted on having the heart monitors under their cots so if they didnt move in 20 sec the alarm alerted me, fear of cot death.

and i have nightmares, mainly of the little one, in a little white coffin, its horrible, though this are subsiding a little. 

so does this sound like ptsd? i really have to try hard to cuddle my kids, esp the eldest, although i try not to show her this, the youngest is very snuggly so he just snuggles in. is it hard for me cos eldest in theory should not be here? i dont regret her or love her any less, she is my miracle baby in a way.

so why cant i enjoy them like i sooooo want to?

Will the 'system' really help us get to the bottom of this, are there things that can be done/effective? - Am I compelled to loose everything I have worked for and watch my daughters emotional demise whilst the specialists drag their heals humming and haa-ing?:confused:  I have been 'flagging' difficulties for my child since the age of 7, now nearly 17 with a high IQ they are all still diagnosing/misdiagnosing - HOW and who CAN I/we TRUST? :scratch:
Bottom line is after and throughout all of this I am diagnosed with PTSD but my internal ramblings about external matters (some of which you have just read) are seriously affecting my ability to address my OWN now serious issue :doh2: - I need to stay with ME, know it intellectually, difficult in practice - hope someone can help/identify;)"

I've cried today and have gone back to my ED as a way to cope. I feel so lost.........  Scared to sleep because of the nightmares but scared to be awake due to flashbacks and thoughts.

793,"I am coping with being involved in an outdoor activies fatality. Thankfully the suicidal stage is some weeks away now but I am getting these huge mood swings. If i have managed to sleep i am very anxious as to how i will feel when i wake up, sometimes I'm OK and can look forward, other times I'm in the pits of despair and it frightens me.
I have had some medical support but they seem in 2 minds as to whether to refer me further or whether I will get better on my own account. So far I have been advised to try a CBT web-site however,  I struggle with the enthusiasm to do much with that site!

I have gone to my local 'MIND' wellbeing grouip and that helps. I am trying all sorts of self help techniques, eye movement stuff etc. Do I just battle on and hope it will all pass and be OK or should I be doing anything else?"
794,"Hi, haven't posted on the site for a while but need some advice.  I was diagnosed with ptsd a few years ago, due to repeated sexual abuse when I was a young child.  I had CBT, which didn't really help and was given various anti-depressants over the years, latest being citalopram, and again no relief.  I went back to doc to say my anxiety was worsening and was constantly on 'red alert' and was given a 2.5mg of diazapem, it didn't even take the edge off.  Told doc this but rather than raise the dose she stopped them and said I should just continue with the citalopram.  I feel i'm being fobbed off and just being left to 'get on with it', which is hard, and would like to know if other members on here have had more support from their docs.  Thanks."
795,My girl has recently been dx with this. We split beforehand back in Jan by mutual agreement but I miss her and love her so much! We both knew we had to split (I had my own problems) and it looks as if we'll never get back together again. I don't think she truly believes that I love her but I've never loved any girl so much in my life and I'm in so much emotional pain right now. She has been in a psych unit and I have come close to it since we split. I just feel we're meant for each other!
796,"I bloody hate my friends! Right well i want to state that this post is not about me, its about a close friend which im very worried about. 
My friend's mom has a boyfriend and he is abusive to her mother physically, emotionally. and he has been threatening my 15 year old friend (hes 40 or something) and im worried that he might start abusing her little brothers and sisters. he has already threatened their nextdoor neighbours.
I have been encouraging her to go to the police but she wont. so i set up a facebook conversation tonight with 2 close friends and i told them that we need to be there for her but they are just being so stupid and they wont do anything! am i the only one seeing how serious this matter is??
i will post the conversation below:

ME: Well i was talking to S today walking home and its basically about her mums boyfriend. Hes been threatening them and stuff. it sounds pretty bad.

T: Oh well no wonder she was really upset about it :'( 

J: oh yeah he's a dick.it's been going on for a while

ME: Apparently it got bad though and shes been pretty upset and pissed off about it all day. he like abused her mom i think. i told her to go to the police about it 

J: yeah i think he hits her.but i really don't know i don't like to ask. 

ME: Seriously i was talking to her and i was like.. S what if he does it to your little brothers or sisters? apparently he threatened the next door neighbours too. so that tells me they must of overheard something. Im trying to convince her to go to the police and i will need to talk to her about it tomorrow

J: yeah,i know i just sit there sayin yeah yeah yeah... i dunno i don't think she wants to make it worse.but i know she's never liked her mum being with him

ME: See i cant sit there and just listen. i want her to do something about it. because its really serious and it can get worse. You guys will just have to help and tell her to get in contact with the police because hes been texting S threatening things and her mum too. and it might get to her little bro's and sis's and that could ruin their life. trust me

J: yeah she was talking to me about the texts and that

T: yeah she told me that too but if her mom's scared of him then she wont go to the police 

ME: maybe we should encourage her to go to the head of our year or the school nurse if she wont go to the police? Im just really worried because i was off school and had MH problems for a similar reason. well its pretty diffrent but if it gets worse and something does happen to sophie then think how shit we will feel. Were stressed out to the max already with the GCSE's and just think about what she has to go through with that on her mind. 
Im just worried.

T: tbf its up to her mom what she does

J: yeah exactly T i wouldn't get involved.it's up to her mum what she does.and it's not as if sophie dont have any other family to talk about it with. 
(!!!!!)

ME: So were going to sit back while S' mom gets slapped around and S becomes one big emotional wreck. if it continues shes going to get MUCH worse than she was today. i can guarentee it. Its not only S' mom thats being affected. S is only 15 and that man is 40. she can do something to sort it out 

T:no but getting involved in other peoples lives when we don't know everything is bad

ME: I dont want to get involed. i want her to know that she needs to do something about it. you guys could atleast help. I tryed to kill myself for a reason. sure i was probably worse off than S, but i guess i only feel this way because i understand what shes going through. She cant just be put through this. 

J: i'm not gonna interfer,she'll sort it out her own way if she wanted us to do summin she would of told us

ME: Well if she told you about the texts and so on then shes kinda trying to look for some help. Maybe she just wants someone to talk to or maybe she doesnt know what to do!!!!


Ok im rambling on now. but my friends are willing to offer no support to her at all. Does it sound like im interfearing? or do my friends just sound uncaring and thoughtless of the situation. am i the only one taking it seriously?!"
797,"Hello, i found out through counselling that i had been abused by relatives as a child of three years old and had repressed the early trauma. But when i got to my late 30's my life started to come apart and i experienced daily panic attacks, sleep deprivation and aggorphobia. Work abuse had somehow triggered all the feelings of when i was three and at the time i didn't know what was happening to me. My career came to an end 4 years ago and i have been on incapacity benifet ever since. I live like a recluse and i am scared i will hurt someone if i get into a stressful situation. 

My doctors and counsellors have never even bothered to diagnose me for anything other than anxiety and depression and they tried to trick me into going private, when all i really need is a solution to my PSTD. I know i have PTSD. It is like a crown inside my head which seems to control my every move.

I am currently going to CBT and the counsellor keeps saying that he doesn't know why my assessement scores are not coming doing from severe depression. I am trying to come off of citalopram but the doctor doesn't seem to care.  

Its like they know something you don't and that they think you are a fraud and time waster. 

But this crown in my head is still there every day. I don't want to kill myself because i have life insurance and that would hurt my family, so when i get stressed the only option would be to thrash out. I had a fight the other day when a drunk tried to assualt me by grabbing my coat at my nieces birthday party. 

I'm 47 , out of work and pretty much out of my mind. I used to be an IT executive in the city of London, but now i'm a loser with an insane crown.

Does anyone know how to remove this PTSD crown? It doesn't seem to be associated with much these days. It is just always there.

Thanks for any thoughts.

798,"Writing a letter to prison sexual abuser *trig warning (just to be safe)*

*trig warning (just to be safe)*

Ok well i want to write a letter to my brother in prison who sexually abused me. He self harmed infront of me, he emotionally and physically made me feel like utter crap. Theres just so much. But yet he is my brother and as much as i DONT want to admit it. i have come to the conclusion that in a sick and twisted part of my mind, i still love him. he is my step brother afterall. So i want to write a letter to him in prison. It will be very emotional, im not sure if i will be allowed to send it. i might have to tone it down a bit. I talked to my councillor about this a few times. I was going to write to him after i finished my GCSE's. but with all the work piling up on me, whenever im depressed i know that its always on my mind. and in some sick way i sometimes wonder if he is ok. I dont know if he feels remorse for what he has done. im currently drafting a letter on microsoft word and i did ask what hwas his feelings on what had happened.
I dont deny that i hate him for what hes done, but i cant help but to still like him. When he abused me, there was times i could tell that he felt remorse. and he would try to make everything ok, we had some fun times before the abuse happened. and sometimes people say its best to remember the good? I dont know... i wrote in the letter that i THINK i want to forgive him. i know this may just seem crazy and i hope that im not judged for this post. but maybe forgiving him will help me move on. because im barely existing at the moment. This letter could be my freedom. if he writes back and says that it was a mistake and puts it to rest, i think moving on will be easier for me. I HAVE given this alot of thought. so before you tell me to think about it, ive been thinking about it for months. but sometimes my hatred for him stops me from actually beginning to write a letter. 
So what do you think about it? and also ive never written to an inmate before, so any prison writing tips would be useful. I already know letters are read and some are censored before the inmate reads them. I will probably have to hand write the letter after ive drafted it. 

I will probably post a copy of the letter on my journal once i have finished with it, so feel free to comment."
799,I served as a medic in Iraq 4 years ago and still haunted by the things i seen out there we tried so hard to save lifes but most of the time by the time they reached the field hospital out there they were blown up and in pieces. I was only 20 and obviously serving in the army (sorry should have said) we where not trained or prepared for that job at all and after each trauma it was just clean up and move on. i think about this everyday and cant watch certain things on the tv coz i start to cry and panic. My husband says i should talk to my cpn about this but they diagnosed me with mixed bipolar disorder and sent me to hospital for 2 months and now medically discharging me from the army. My career is ruined my self esteem is gone and i weigh 2 stone more than i did due to medication.  I tried to claim for compensation but this was basically laughed at and i got told that the army wasnt to blame for my bipolar or trauma from iraq and gave a hole list of reasons why. i went to my dr time and time again describing massive high's ad then lows in my mood and never once was i treated correctly. Feel totally frusted and want someone to pay but they r getting away with it. while my life is in ruines. :cry:

802,"Hi,

This forum feels like my last hope. 

I was involved in a road accident in August 2007. Pillion on the back of my husbands motorbike when a lorry made an illegal turn and we hit it at 40mph. I was dragged off the bike and underneath.....

I spent 6 months in hospital recovering from a broken back and 18 other injuries and battling to save my right arm.

I kept my arm, but it does nothing nor can I use it... 

However the mental pain I feel is far worse. Flashbacks still plague me, visions of that awful day, my recovery, my change in life.

I can't bear this pain, I want my old life back, my job, my freedom, to be pain free and have the ability to go out without worrying that i might be killed.

I worry about everything, there is nothing that I don't think might hurt me, if I step outside the house I almost expect a meteorite to come down and crush me. My dr calls it hyper vigilant.

I've seen a neuropsychologist and have had CBT but I still can't stop this craving for my old life and it kills me inside. It just isn't fair.

I pretend to my family I'm fine, but really I wish that someone who give me the option of being put out of my misery and stick a bag over my head....

I would just love to wake up without feeling the horrible sense of panic and despair...... it just never ends and I can't do this anymore..... Where else can i go?"

806,"Hello there, I am just wondering if anyone has had any experience of hypochondria following a rape or sexual assault, although I think it might be after any assault, depending on the person. Basically I was assaulted 7 years ago and immediately following had some hypochondria around STDs, and recently, without any real substantive cause, it has come back and seems to be getting worse. I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or if you can recommend any techniques that help you to STOP thinking about it!!

thanks 

 Here is some background for reference:

I was raped in 2001 when I was 18, by my supervisor at a part-time job I had while I was in college. Basically he offered to give me a ride home, but took me to his house—I was 500 miles from home in a city I didn’t know, I had no idea where we were. He lived in a garage, so no one would have heard anything. I don’t remember much about it—I wasn’t intoxicated or anything, it’s just been several years and I haven’t wanted to think about it, obviously, so I’ve managed to suppress it I suppose. Anyway, he didn’t use a condom and I remember being in sort of a haze the next day, so I went to get the morning after pill, which I took, but I didn’t have any kind of exam done (he made sure I showered before I left anyway). And then he sort of acted like we were dating, and since I still had to see him at work, I sort of went along with it, but tried to avoid him when I could. I eventually changed my schedule to stay away from him. He made it a point to mention that he’d been arrested once before for beating a guy with a chain, and that he knew where I lived (in a dorm at the university), so I was pretty sure I couldn’t go to the police. 
I didn’t report it, and I didn’t see a doctor. I seemed to be ok for about 6 months or so. Then I started to feel weak and shaky all the time, I was dropping things at work, I couldn’t sleep, etc…and for some reason being on public transportation was really upsetting (public transit had NOTHING to do with the whole situation—so I don’t know where that came from.) 
At first my doctors thought I had MS as I have a family history. I was convinced that I had HIV and was dying but was too frightened to take a test. I eventually had a total breakdown about 14 months after the attack, and saw a therapist, and had all the tests done, everything was fine. I had anxiety problems and panic attacks for a long time, they have gotten better progressively over the years. I have learned relaxation techniques, and have never really been the type to think that the racing heart and dizziness etc…meant a heart attack. I always seemed to know it was anxiety and to be more frustrated than frightened. 

After all that I didn’t date or sleep with anyone for almost two years. I then started dating a very supportive person who was very understanding. We dated for nearly 3 years, at the end of which I had sort of a one-night stand and then dated someone casually for about 2 months. I had all the normal STD tests done after that as well, just to be safe, even though I had been compulsive about condoms for everything. 
I then moved quite far away and didn’t date anyone for about 9 months. 
During that time I began to be oddly preoccupied with freckles—always assuming it was skin cancer. I began searching the internet for information on it, which always just makes you more frightened. I would get myself very worked up about this, but could usually calm myself down with facts, and then move on. Honestly I’m not really sure if it gets worse when I am stressed or not, partly because I haven’t really kept track and partly because I’m always stressed really. 

I work in the NGO sector, focused on violence against women, so I see and hear and read things every day that related to rape, domestic violence, etc…but it doesn’t seem to be making things worse on a daily basis. I’ve been in this field for 5 years, so I don’t think that adds to it. 

Anyway, in 2007 I met my current partner, and we dated for a few months, using condoms when we had sex. Then we decided to be monogamous and all that, and we both went in to be tested in a walk-in sexual health clinic. They have a ‘if there is something wrong, we’ll call you’ policy. They didn’t call either of us, so everything was great! My current boyfriend and I have been together for a little more than 18 months now. 

Recently I’ve changed birth control a few times, just trying to find one that doesn’t give me too many unfortunate side effects. So in changing all these brands I’ve had a yeast infection (thrush) 3 times in 3 months—really annoying of course, and almost certainly a result of changing the birth control. They warn you about it on the packaging! However, at some point many years ago during my paranoia about HIV I read something about how a yeast infection is usually the first sign in women. (I don’t even know if this is true!! But apparently it stuck with me!) and now it has totally monopolised my thinking. Now I know that I have 0 reason to worry, I’ve been tested several times, at very appropriate intervals, and I believe, at least, that I have a very solid, committed relationship, so I do not worry that my partner has been unfaithful. Despite all of this rationalising, my brain won’t stop thinking about this. I spend all day convincing myself that I don’t have a deadly illness. And it is frustrating and a giant waste of my time! 

At the same time I had an irregular pap smear (this is not terribly uncommon) but I’m now convinced I also have cervical cancer, and just did my monthly breast self-exam and have myself convinced that I felt a lump, and have now felt shooting pains in that breast AND a new freckle/mole thing that I spend half my time convinced is cancer.

Now at the moment I know that NONE of this is accurate. I’m quite convinced that I’m imagining all of this—but I need to find some more techniques to make my brain stop perseverating on these thoughts. I seem to be quite good about distracting myself—it has taken me like 2.5 hours to type this because I have enough to do at work that I don’t think about it, but no matter what I do the same thoughts creep back. 

Any suggestions? Any other rape/violence survivors who have experienced hypochondria after the assault? I don’t want to go and have loads of tests done for things I know are not wrong with me—I really see that as ‘giving in’ to these ridiculous thoughts, so any other recommendations would be much appreciated.

Thanks 

807,"Hey all, I recently joined this forum because I have realized I am deeply depressed and not sure what to do about it. I went away over the long weekend and I can't stop thinking about how happy I should have been with my partner and kids and instead spent the first day and night locked in my car crying my eyes out. I started an argument with my fiancée again over some trivial issue from his past that has nothing to do with me and ignored my kids leaving them to do their own thing and wonder why I was in the car crying my eyes out. My partner has assured me that be loves me and wants to help me and my kids keep asking if I am ok and that ""its ok if I'm upset"" but I just can't be happy. All I want to do is think about the worst things in my life, my past, my partners past, every mistake I have ever made, the fact that my family don't talk to me anymore- anything that upsets me. The same old thing happens, the next day I get up feeling absolutely lifeless my head is hurting and I feel like being sick because once again I have ruined everyones night. I just can't get over things or move on and I need to know that there is something I can do about it because right now I think everyone- my partner, my kids, will be better off without me. I am just bringing everyone down and it's killing me. I feel that the more and more I fall down I'm bringing them with me. I hope someone knows what I'm talking about."
808,"Hi all , I have not been diagnosed as PTSD but I reckon this is where I need to write this I have never told anyone about this except my parents when it happened and even then they dragged it out of me I did not volanteer the information and the next time was when I was in the therapy for the first time and even then I had to write it down because I could not say it face to face with another person, I have been married now for 25 years and to this day I have not told my husband and after leaving it this long I cant see how I ever can now. At the age of 15, I was gang raped I dont want to say any more about it just that it happened from there I went on to be a cutter which I stopped doing once I was in my 20's and I drank heavily my whole life I am now 50 . Depression and anxiety have been with me for as long as I can remember it was only about 5 years ago that I started having major panic attacks this is the point I ended up in therapy and on medication. I have been diagnosed as GAD .I am currently not taking any medication and trying to live without it , I am also trying to get my drinking under control.
I'm not really asking for advice I just wanted to get this of my chest.Thanks for listening."

810,"For the last few years its been nothing more but the same old crap and depression. im just getting sick of it. im sick of everything at the moment. 
I was sexually abused for 2 years, its something that i really dont want to talk about but its the thing thats making me ill and holding me back from living my life. I cant deal with it. and my familys getting sick of me. when i feel upset or anything they yell at me. saying that they dont want a repeat of lastyear (when i was at my worst) and it just makes me feel like absolute shit. whats the point in telling anyone? im just going to be upset when its bought up and then im just going to get yelled at again.
Im struggling with loving myself. i just cant do it, i hate myself and everyones pushing me to talk about it all the time and i dont want to. 
its just a 'no win situation' i feel completley and utterly stranded with no way out of this shit. 
why wont it just end already."
811,"i thought id give this ago...

alarm woke me up but the effects of zopiclone made me turn the volume off, i nearly missed the bus but got to college ontime. we were given our grades for our music assignments today, but i needed to talk to my tutor about something else, my carers really wanted me to mention it to him so i did. a students father in our group had been contacting me over facebook, he's 61 and he asked me to go to his house, told me he fancied me, so i said im sorry but no. its been bugging me, i have ptsd and have a had 2 people sexually abuse me, so this has brought up soo much in my head i cant describe, ive been having panick attacks at ridiculous hours of the morning, believing that he knew where i lived and he was going to ""get me"" he lives in the same town. my tutor first said that he wouldnt tell anyone else, and then after lunchbreak he said that legally he had no choice but to tell the welfare officer in the college. so i dont  know what is going to happen, and if this guy writes back i know i should tell someone but for the benefit of the kid in my class i dont want to rip his dad away from him as he is the only family he's got. 
i had therapy yesterday, came out crying my eyes out, i couldnt function properly so i rang for support whilst trying to keep myself upright in a estate road , crying into a bush, eventually i pulled myself together got on a bus and went into the town, to get some things for my carer, the support wasnt there when i needed it, i felt soo bad and it just seems to have gotten worse, i dont like my mum after the way she treated which is why im in care, but my nan is constantly trying to get us all together again (playing happy families) not reallizing how much of a strain it is for me to be in contact with her, my mum gave me her old phone cause mine was broke, i didnt want it only because i knew it had come from her but i accepted it, i deleted all of her messages etc but today i was on the bus to get home when suddenly i was looking through my saved txts one popped up from my mums new boyfriend telling her to warm herself up as hes going to give her a good time. this has made me feel sick, did she want me to find these messages, to proove to me that even tho i dont someone loves her and doesnt care about whats happened to me. i mean wtf.
after playing coldplay clocks over and over again for 2 hours in college today i think that is enough to make anyone feel abit crappy but all this added shit keeps piling high. even though i dont live with my parents anymore because of this ptsd, they ARE in my life quite often, its like i cant escape.
i live with 2 carers and i dont feel like i can talk to them cause they dont understand and keep telling me they dont want to see me in hospital again, which is fair enough but it made me worse knowing how dissapointed they would be if i did go back in.
right now im sitting here dosed up on lorazepam... with a burning weight on my chest .it feels like all my emotions have made me in physical pain because there are soo many of the them blabbering around.. and it hurts. 
next wednesdsy is my last session of therapy and my therapist has asked me to write her a letter about how its gone. 
personally i dont want to end therapy but as my reasons for keeping it arnt good enough i cant have any more sessions. fab. 
alone.

i dont know how much longer i can go on... i really am loosing it here....
sometimes i find myself saying... i want to go home...
knowing inside that i havnt got one...:cry:

when i was first admitted and no one really knew what was wrong with me:blush:, i was put straight on fluoxetine, and i ended up getting extremly suicidal, impulsive and anxious:scared:, so they then put me on sertraline and this did the same thing making me end up on a section 2 because i was really unwell:scared:. does anyone else get these side affects, or is it just me? and ambulance driver once said to me that he thinks its commen for people with ptsd so be allergic, but is he right?? :confused:
i am now on 100mg of questiapine a day and it sorta works for me but i think it needs to be increased just a little bit...

816,"In situations of terror, people spontaneously seek their first source of  comfort and protection. Wounded soldiers and raped women cry for their  mothers or God. When this cry is not answered, the sense of basic trust  is shattered. Traumatized people feel utterly abandoned, utterly alone,  cast out of the human and divine systems of care and protection that  sustain life. Thereafter, a sense of alienation, of disconnection,  pervades every relationship, from the most intimate familial bonds to  the most abstract affiliations of community and religion.
Trauma and Recovery
Judith Herman

The causes of trauma have three things in common:
 

An External Cause
Violation
Loss of Control

 The effects of trauma are surprisingly commonplace. These include:
 

bewilderment and confusion, an inability to understand what is happening or why it happened
a strong sense of denial, an inability to convince yourself that the  experience was real; your denial is reinforced by the denial of those  around you and especially of people in authority
sleep problems including nightmares and waking early
flashbacks and replays which you are unable to switch off
impaired memory, forgetfulness, memory which is intermittent, especially of day-to-day trivial things
exaggerated startle response
a deep sense of betrayal
obsessiveness – the experience takes over your life, you can’t get it out of your mind
depression
excessive shame and guilt
undue fear
emotional numbness, an inability to feel love, hope, or joy
physical and mental paralysis at any reminder of the experience

 Tim Fields




Trauma is about broken connections. Connection is broken  with the body/self, family, friends, community, nature, and spirit,  perpetuating the downward spiral of traumatic dislocation. Healing  trauma is about restoring these connections.
 Peter Levine, Ph. D


After any major physical “insult,” as they call it, it’s  all too easy to see yourself as a collection of symptoms rather than as a  total human being, including your spirit — and thus to become your  illness. Fear is powerful and contagious.
 At first I allowed myself to catch it, worried that if I didn’t do  what the doctors ordered, I’d be sorry. But now I’m learning to take my  healing into my own hands. Healing, after all, is not the same  as curing; healing does not mean going back to the way things were  before, but rather allowing “what is now”.

817,"Hi, i have just been diagnosed with PTSD via my councillor, as my sessions where about to end with her anyway she thought it would be a good idea not to start opening up with her but start fresh with a psychiatrist, i am waiting for him which might take a while.  For all these years i have kept all my childhood past in a corner of my mind and try not to think about it, although it is easier said than done, once i start with my new doc what can i expect, i am terrifed of thinking about my past and dread to think what will happen to me when i do start talking about it, reliving the experiances.  Do you think it it will make me worst before it get better.  Sometimes i think it may be a waste of time, it may not do any good, it may make me worst and not get any better.
Also i'm kinda hanging by a thread at the moment and not on any meds, i've been trying to keep off them but i do feel the need to go back on them.  Would taking meds interfere with my new session of would they make it more easy.  Any help would be appreciated"
818,"Argh, I havent been able to leave my house for two days because of these flashbacks. I'm feeling very jumpy which is triggering them of.
Please stop :-("
819,"I've been having triggers all day. I went out last night and this tosser got abit carried away, he wouldnt take no for an answer. He pinned me up against the wall he was pretty forceful with me, until the bouncers pulled him off and chucked him out. 
So now im left with having flashbacks all bloody day :-("
820,"I            dont really know where to post this. I have my own every day thoughts, like oh **** its morning i better get up. and when i get stressed or tired I get these parallel thoughts running along side of my own thoughts. now these other thoughts are either random rubbish or thoughts of harming myself or others. so far they remain totally separate but its driving me nuts. just a note. i have stopped one of my meds  as instructed by my pdoc, and reduced the dose of another. ANY IDEAS? my mh issues are depression, anxiety, panic disorder, .. ocd  and PTSD. thanks.:cry:"
821,"Hi. Has anyone been following the rather sensational news on PTSD and MDMA?
Dr M Mithoefer from Sth Carolina has some pretty revolutionary stuff to say about it. You can read the article on Times Online.
I have BPD and still have difficulty with unresolved PTSD because I can't 'debrief' the memories - they are so traumatic I just go into meltdown. It still affects me quite badly and though I have had good results from having Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, the PTSD remains. Read the article. I've spoken to my GP about it and he laughed in my face and said stuff about no one using PTSD as an excuse for getting MDMA out of him! Dick! I wasn't asking for it, and he wouldn't listen well enough to hear what I was saying.
Also, has anyone any experience of this system using eye movements to treat PTSD. Can't remember what it's called but it sounds whacky!:unsure:"
822,"Hi,
First post, i'm new here so hi! I've recently come to terms with the fact that I have some mental issues and want to try and resolve them, i've always been some what of a compulsive worrier but lately I seem be getting anxious/stressed about everything and sometimes i'll even realise i'm feeling this way about nothing at all, just have this feeling inside like i'm worried but no idea what about. I havn't been to my GP about it yet (although I think I might) but I believe it may be some kind of PTSD, let me set the scene for you

I am an IT technician, I worked really hard at school and college although I had a hard time with bullying etc and suffered low self esteem. I finished college and struggled to find a job working in IT, I spent a couple of years working in a miserable IT/customer service call centre before landing a great job with the local government probation service as an Assitant IT officer. I loved this job, worked hard at it and after a couple of years got promoted to lose the 'assistant' title. Along with this I started studying some more IT qualifications, got certified in Prince 2, ITIL and Microsoft Systems Administrator (server 2003). These are all good qualifications but at the same time, I was starting to find I was reaching the limit for development in my job. There was nowhere higher up for me to go so I started thinking about looking elsewhere for work. About this time there was a lot of talk of redundancy due to the recession etc and my bosses boss started talking about making big changes to the way the IT department was structured which could potentially mean my job would move to a different location, not something I wanted at all. I fell out with the guy because we had a severe difference of opinion in what was best for the organisation and started looking for work elsewhere. Out of the blue I got offered a job working for the Police (their IT is contracted out, it was these people i'd be working for). They sold it to me as a brilliant job but it did mean working shifts, a mix of nights and days. After much deliberation I went for an interview and was offered the position, this was about 18 months ago. I took the job and handed in my notice at my current place. Within a couple of days of starting the new job I realised i'd made a huge mistake. The shifts were 12 hours long, once i'd finished my training i'd be working alone (for the whole shift) and the shifts were a mix of days (7am-7pm) and nights (7pm-7am). I new about the shift pattern but I specifically asked before taking the jobs about who i'd be working with and they said it was a team of 5. The didnt tell me until I started that each of the team was on a different shift pattern and that only one worked at a time!. To top it all off the actual work was not what I wanted at all. It was boring non technical work, changing backup tapes, filling in spreadsheets, basically all the boring little bits that no one else wanted to do, add to that that on a night shift we were supposed to be installing updates on servers we had no idea what they did and then rebooting them, no one else was around so if something went wrong it was out neck on the line!!
Well, I quickly slumped into a depression, it was the middle of the recession and jobs were scarce, I started looking elsewhere but the job really got me down and I felt so trapped. I couldnt leave as I had bills to pay and I couldnt find another jobs because there was nothing around, plus this was having an adverse affect on my girlfriend whose mum had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer and needed my support but wasnt getting it. This went on for about 3 months and then my girlfriend had enough and said she needed a break because I was driving her mad. I couldnt deal with this and had a breakdown. Luckily my mum was on hand to help me out and I decided to quit my job there and then, but I felt completely broken, I had lost everything and it was all my fault.
I then spent a few weeks unemployed, not knowing what to do with myself before finding some temporary work filing in an office. This was 18 months ago, and from an exterior perspective I seem to have made a full recovery. A few weeks after leaving the job my girlfriend moved back in, a few more weeks later after many painful interviews and application forms I got a well paid job working at the local hospital as an IT technician and everythings getting back to normal, except that I still feel somewhat broken inside mentally. I dont seem to have gotten over what happened and I still feel a little trapped at times, plus as I said at the beginning I seem to be feeling a lot of anxiety and dare I say it, depression. I realise that I am taking life to seriously and want to stop worrying to much and start relaxing more and enjoying myself more, but I am finding it hard to get rid of these feelings.
I am worried if I go to the doctor he may prescribe me something which I will get reliant upon, I dont really want to take any medication, i'd like to deal with this myself, but I am not sure how.
So... at the end of that rather long story, what advice can you give to help me get over this and get back to normal?"
823,I'm seriously struggling with these flashbacks I can't handle them anymore. I'm getting really worried bout what might happen if I can't get them to stop. I feel so alone :'(
824,"and I'm finding it hard to understand myself and what is going on in my head.

A few weeks ago I suffered a bad fall, knocking myself out and needed a paramedic. I was at work, and even now there is parts I don't remember. What I don't understand is why I don't remember and it's bothered me since it happened. I was carrying something, I don't remember what it was or what happened to it. I know that probably sounds really insignificant, but to me it has played on my mind a lot.

I haven't slept properly, I am jittery, very low, finding it hard to concentrate.

My meds have been upped, and my gp is wanting to see me weekly, but what else should I be doing. Will this just go away?

any help I will listen :("
825,"(i apologize now for this random rant of a thread)
hi again, i haven't posted here in some time. i got diagnosed with PTSD a few months back and have been in a nightmare rollercoaster of meds and doc mistakes. couple trips to the ER and they haven't been letting me work. (i'm a firefighter and an emt on the ambulance.)
not sure if this is the best treatment option but i've decided to move, i resigned from work today. where i live is really rural so there aren't many healthcare options available. and when the doc talked about sending me to the hospital i talked with my mom and some friends and they're moving me to another state, and to a city. i'll be with great friends (don't have many left here) and have access to more healthcare.
 i'm just posting this i guess because i'm scared about moving and trying to start all over again. i decided to take a break from emergency work for awhile and hope i can find some work with animals. i'm just scared so i needed to tell someone, anyone. my fire dept is being really great and doing what they can to help me move, but my ems job pretty much just waved goodbye :(
i cried so hard when i handed in my gear, i'm really going to miss the job but i know i can't get well here.
a quick breakdown of whats happened just this month is i was on zoloft and xanax, but the xanax was like crack and wasn't working at all so my GP took me off the xanax and i ended up in the ER the next night with a massive panic attack. they took me off the zoloft and put me on ativan, then my GP added lexapro. that just seemed to build and build until i was super suicidal and p-doc just made me stop the lexapro cold turkey last week. doubled my ativan and might try wellbutrin next week.
guess my ? is, does anyone know if wellbutrin works on PTSD? since i can't handle the SSRIs."
826,"Im sick of feeling trapped in this cycle nothing goes right for long. I've had enough of pretending everythings okay just to get people of my back. 
I wish I could disappear for awhile :-("
827,"If i can explain this in a way anyone can understand, it'll be a miracle. 
My mum died three months ago so i had to move to live with my Auntie, Uncle and Cousin on the opposite side of the country, leave my amazing friends, change schools halfway through my GCSEs, all of it. At the time, none of it seemed very daunting. My mum had been an alcoholic all my life so i was used to some pretty crap times. I cried, got over it, moved, caught up with the work, settled into school and found a great friend in my cousin who I've always got on with. 
Then a few weeks ago i was struck with this horrible realisation of death, and it messed me up for a good while. I was five when I first realised i was going to die but it hasn't really struck me since, up 'til then. I felt sick every time i thought about it and i couldn't get over it. I've always thought too much but that put my entire life in an awful perspective and i couldn't bring myself to just think about the present and enjoy life, which is sad because I've always lived by the motto ""Live for now"". 
Although I've stopped thinking about death so much now, I've pretty much stopped thinking about everything else too. It's hard to explain. I live my life, i react how i would normally and i think about everything and i know what's going on, nothing has physically changed. However it's like, when i think about it, it's almost as if I'm not really there, as though it's not happening to me. To put it weirdly, it's as if I'm a consciousness that's just observing a lifetime happening. It could be that subconsciously I'm in denial that all this crap's happened, but I really do want to get back to how i was - completely content with my life and who i am, and enjoying every minute of it. I have a lot to live for and i feel I'm wasting my life by ... not being in it. 
If you have any ideas to help me get over this, I'd appreciate them. Just to let you know, I've already talked this over with someone (who, incidentally, suggested i put it on here) and I'm not going to a GP, as it is my mind and they won't be able to do anything different apart from give me pills which i won't take. Anyway, if you could be bothered reading all this, thanks. (: ."
828,"i can't handle my (former?) counselor contacting me...  what is wrong with me?

I had two counselors.  One I did a DBT group and worked on DBT skills with that I have seen on and off for several years.  I need to have a “primary therapist” in order to the DBT stuff.  After much searching I found a “primary therapist” that was willing to see me, seemed to be a good fit, and that my insurance would pay for.    

Right now, I am almost to the point of cutting off all contact.  And yet I want to go back to the counseling that was so helpful…   but I can’t seem to keep any good boundaries  with her and feel so invaded by her… and abandoned too…  and I can’t take her messages anymore…  to the point where I actually somewhat irrationally thought of getting a restraining order.   First time in my life I have actually really felt and acted like – “I hate you, don’t leave me.”

I’m pretty sure there is another better way to handle it. 

I started seeing in her (I’ll just call her “primary T” and the other DBT therapist the “DBT T”) in March of 2009, twice a week, two regular times – she required twice a week, two regular times, and I was fine with it.  I haven’t seen her in person since beginning of December 2009.   

The therapy with primary T was very helpful.  Not perfect, there were some things that were weird and not so helpful, but some parts of it really were key things that helped me change my own life a lot.

At first she felt it was a good idea and fine for me to text and call her in between sessions.  She kept encouraging it.  And that was helpful for me, at first... 

But in the fall, I realized I didn’t think it was a good thing to keep up.  I don’t know why, it just began to feel weird.   Like it was like too much contact, and I was beginning to rely on it too much.  So I told her I didn’t want to communicate anything over text except for scheduling.   I said maybe we could have email as a replacement.  I asked if I could just send email about things I was processing through and then we could talk about them in therapy sessions.  I had a friend in counseling struggling with similar problems and she did that with her counselor.  There were some things my counselor really was pushing me to talk with her about that I couldn’t seem to do without crying and coming emotionally undone.  I figured I could email her about those things though and start processing it that way – and maybe it would be easier to talk about in the session.   

I was leary of communicating over email, not wanting to take up the counselor’s time, nor wanting anything I emailed to be taken as like the final thing – I was admant about how anything she or I emailed about would just be “in process.”   She was very supportive of me emailing her...

At first, it worked very well.  It seemed to “break the ice” on the tough trauma related subjects she wanted me to tell her about and made it easier to talk in sessions.   She didn’t email back much outside of sessions, and I really actually preferred it that way.  

But then things shifted…  I’m still processing through what happened, what changed… 

She started emailing and texting me.   She still didn’t really respond much to what I was emailing her.   

I don’t know how to summarize the kinds of things she would email or text - but the information and things she would text and email seemed so drastic, confusing, and came with huge consequences – and I had no way to dialogue with her about them, ask questions for clarification before she would act negatively about me not doing what she had communicated in the email or text.   

She would often say that unless I do XYZ within a short amount of time, she would cancel all future appointments until I did the requested thing or sent the requested response.   Sometimes she would threaten to just terminate therapy if I didn’t do it in time.   (triggering all kinds of abandonment fears that I didn’t even know I had this intensely.)

It got to the point that anytime I got any text with her name on it, I would start to panic before I even read it.   Sometimes she would email, then moments later she would call and text (both) saying I needed to check my email right away.   

I soon told her I needed no more communication between appointments except for scheduling.  No emails, no texts, no phone calls.  It needed to all be saved for in-person therapy sessions.   

I would get very upset and dyregulated about them...yet at the same time, the in-person therapy sessions all still went very well.   She kept saying over and over about how SHE FELT therapy sessions were going very well too – and she would even repeatedly comment about how this was surprising her in light of how poorly I was handling the VERY SAME matters when she texted and emailed about them outside of therapy sessions.  

she just kept texting and emailing... and I kept saying pls stop... 

Then November on a Friday night, she called and canceled therapy appointments, and emailed a “notice” of “limits of therapy” that indicated she would immediately terminate if I did not meet the requirements in the notice.   It included being required to respond to all messages from her within 24 hours.  

She said she would meet with me again, only after she and I met with the DBT T.   She said the purpose of that meeting was for me to tell her what my concern about her was that I was “not telling her” but had told the DBT T.   The only concern I expressed to the DBT T was how I was not handling her texts and emails well and wanted advice how to not get so upset about it.  The DBT T was great…  and it was all stuff I told the primary T, many times over.  

But the primary T felt it had to be something else and that whatever concern I was saying to the DBT T was the very reason why “the therapy was not working” and I needed to talk with her about it, and clearly I was comfortable enough to tell the DBT T.  So at the meeting the DBT T and I explained, no, it was just me asking her how to stay contained about the emails and texts that I had told her I didn’t want and couldn’t handle… 

I have no idea why she felt the therapy was not working back then!!!  It was.  So I told the primary T all the things that did work about therapy and were helpful.   At the end, she said I did a great job and the info was helpful and we would have appointments again. 

She briefly went over her “requirements.”   I told her that some of the “requirements” I just could not do and felt very invasive.  When we were with the DBT counselor, the primary therapist was very workable and cool with things.  She said we could meet again, just her and I, and talk about what we both needed to make the therapy work and revise it and come up with a “contract.”  

I explained I needed some time to think about her “requirements in therapy” and that I actually thought a contract was a great idea – one that we would BOTH sign.   So we met.   Just before the second appointment (post meeting with the DBT T) she texted on a Sunday afternoon and said she would not see me at my normal Monday appointment time unless I faxed her by 5pm that night a signed contract to her.    Before she had said I had 4 weeks to come up with a final version... and no explaination for the change in deadline. 

I didn’t even know quite what she wanted in the “contract”…  So I emailed her a draft and she responded that it wasn’t sufficient.  No specifics of what was a problem with it.   I came up with a “temporary” contract with the changed terms about all communication outside of therapy sessions being only about scheduling and not having to respond within 24 hours.    
I changed it to include that it would be revised in two weeks after I had more time to think about it.   

Everything else was the same as she had listed on her requirements.  She said it was acceptable.   

She and I signed it had two great appointments after that.  She said at the end of all the appointments that it went very well and I did a good job.  The last appointment with was the first Thursday in December.   Then the next Sunday night, three days later, she called me at 9:30pm.   She said she was canceling my regular appointment time the next day (on Monday) and she was not rescheduling at this time and then she hung up before I could say a word. 

I can’t even begin to talk about what has happened since then.    

To say the least, she continues to text and email and leave voicemails about anything BUT scheduling.

I have not seen her since then, she has not followed through on re-scheduling, and she won’t say she has terminated.  She got angry when I told my insurance she did.   She won’t stop texting and emailing me, and even calling (usually just saying to check my email or respond to her text right away.) 

My insurance won’t cover anyone else because she has not terminated, and because she keeps telling them she will see me once I meet her requirements…  of which I have no idea what they are anymore.    SO the insurance says you need to just do what she wants... 

And she keeps emailing and texting and calling… But no actual conversation.  I keep pleading her to stop emailing / texting /calling until we meet - she said we would meet with the DBT T in December, then it was post-poned, then twice a time was set up in Jan, then Feb 4, now she has moved it to Feb 26.   

So I respond to all her messages with ""ok, well I will respond to all her emails and requirements when we meet.""  

Now she says she will terminate if I don't meet them, and ASAP, and they keep changing.  And I don't know what I need to do.   
Ugh, I have rambled on too much.   The last two weeks it has gotten so bad I have been at my wits end.  

I want to just tell her and my insurance bug off.  I want to just end it all… 
But I’m thinking there has to be something better…

any ideas?  feedback?  anything?

what is wrong with me?"
829,"Hi, new member here, hello.

I've joined on behalf of my missus, who I'm desperate to try and get help for. It sounds perhaps strange, so I'd better explain.

My woman is 22, I've been with her for the past 4 years and she suffered sexual abuse around 10 years ago. She never received counselling or anything following the incident and spent a number of years going off the rails, taking drugs etc during her teens, most likely spurred on by the fact she's had no way of coping with the trauma.

When I met her she was bubbly, cheerful and although unhappy with the things most women seem to be with themselves she'd reached a point where keeping busy and distracting herself from quiet moments alone meant there was only the odd occasion where she'd break down, and even then it was briefly. However, it's obvious to us that from that period up to now that the feelings & fears in her head were still there, just disguised or repressed. When she moved cities (40 miles distance) to move in with me a number of months after we met, she had anxiety grow from mild, to having bad days, to what it is now. Other symptoms kicked in and her current state is the worst and most worrying I've ever seen.

She can't leave the house. She's left the house around 20 times in the past 2 and a half years. Panic kicks in massively even by going into the garden or sometimes just looking out of the window, and she feels bad stomach cramps, palputations and / or that she's going to have an accident instantly. The times where she has gone out (just up the road to the shops quickly) is when she's been lucky really, a mixture of things going right for her.

She's had 3 mental health advisors and 2 private therapists come to see her at the house. The advisors had to be repeatedly requested for as they seemed so reluctant to do home visits. Two of them visited once, the other 3 times and briefly too, before declaring her supervisor won't allow home visits now. The therapists were costly, one being really unhelpful and the other ignoring her request to move an appointment date as her anxiety was terrible (the thought of people coming to the house has a horrible effect, but she knows it's the only thing that can help) and she never got in touch again or answered a call. Any kind of help she requests now involves them telling her she has to help herself, whether it to be to one of the 7 doctors she's tried now, NHS Direct (sometimes a panic attack or her depression leads to this), mental health centres (she's been on a waiting list for years) or whatever else.

For a few years in her late teens she was on 3 different anti-depressants prescribed by different doctors which with no doubt in mind at all made the situation worse, she was suidical and deeply unpredictable. Since off them she's sworn never to take any again.

We're in a remote part of the city we live in and took the house because there was nothing else, she was on edge in her hometown due to bad events and we just wanted to be together. However, my parents here are elderly and often ill with little means of getting around, her parents are miles away with little means of getting around. One works full time and is tired at night & weekends, the other is on DLA following a long-term illness and recent operation. We've no friends because we spend so much time together trying to battle the problem. Books, videos, all self-help techniques she can get her heads around, she tries really hard. I left work in March 2008 as her condition was so bad I couldn't leave her, she was in a terrible state and she felt incapable to look after our young son properly. Looking back, that period was miles better than this. We're on low income, she only qualifies for the low-rate DLA and Income Support, and I can't qualify for Carer's Allowance. I basically get nothing, but manage the money as I can't let her deal with the stress of dates of payments and low balances etc. We've been looking for a house to rent near my parents for 2 years, but it's a desirable, expensive area. Not many people consider housing benefit.

The local council housing scheme has offered nothing. Attempts to get priority even on the low level so we can be near 4 different family members have been turned down because ""we feel your partner is enough help for you"". I try my best but there's many things I've tried to help her with and failed, knowing it has to be someone experienced & neutral. I'm depressed myself, pretty much to current events, but then what will the doctors offer me? Yeah, I can imagine, the same stuff she quite rightly refuses to take.

She's getting knocked back by so many things whether it be doctors, advisors, therapists who don't want to come out. DLA officers who question her like she's a criminal, turn her down when she asks for advice. Housing offices refusing us due to DSS or just having nothing available. Our private landlord has not liked us being on DSS since I started caring for her full-time and even though she's had rent on time and no house damage etc she served us a repossession order last month and we need to be out within 3 weeks of today. The council said they'd help but then withdrew the offer when they required my missus to travel 2 miles to their department to drop papers in in person... I haven't got a car or anything by the way but she wouldn't cope anyway.

Add all this to the constant anxiety, panic, the clastrophobia she has in the house and the agoraphobia she has whenever outside, the Irritable Bowel Syndrome she has and the zero support she receives, and what you get is pretty much a ticking bomb of anger, panic & upset. The slightest thing will set her off such as not being able to find a household item. She'll feel so frustrated and worthless and the walls cave in, bringing everything up again and another breakdown ensues. I used to be shocked when thinking of how she has breakdowns pretty much daily but I'm not now, it's common for 2 or 3 a day. She can't relax when the lad is at school or in bed, and she's can't sleep due to the worry. She'll pass out from overthought at 4 or 5am, I'll wake with the young lad at 6 or 7am when he wakes me. Then she'll wake around 12pm, maybe 1 or 2pm and then by night I'll pass out 2am trying to distract her and she'll not sleep til 4 or 5am, and the cycle has been like that for months. 

I'm really sorry for probably going into too much detail by far, I guess I'm guilty of being used to having no-one to talk to except her, like she is with me and long-distance phone calls to tired family. Just needed to let it out and hope perhaps there's someone who offer advice on how to deal with medical professionals such as docs, therapists, maybe things to say that work? She's considered rehab but they say ""only if you're suicidal"". She's not that again, yet. But she does scratch herself rather deep on the arms and legs without knowing whilst she's panicking. 

Really feel like there's nowhere to turn in terms of getting her the help she so badly needs, I'm disgusted at her being told each week by some barnpot down the phone, ""Well, you DO have to put some effort in you know"". If only they could see the upset that causes.

Thanks if you did read this, and even more so if you reply."
830,"i had my second session with my psychologist today and she said that i have PTSD. this is an addition to all my other diagnoses. phew. i feel a sense of releif, but where do i go from here? i havent told any one about this cos they will want some detailes which i want to keep to myself. just wanted to get that off my chest."
831,"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/two-minute-shrink/201003/are-you-still-suffering-memories-unpleasant-experience

By now, most people are familiar with post traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD. PTSD is defined clearly in the DSM-IV, the psychiatric  manual that aims to define psychiatric disorders, as the development of ""characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor"" (italics mine). Examples can be found in patients who have experienced military combat, violent personal assault, kidnapping, torture, incarceration, and/or man-made or natural disasters. The list of extreme traumatic stressors can be quite long. But what many people---even psychiatrists and psychotherapists---don't know is that you can suffer PTSD-like symptoms from a less-intense unpleasant experience. The trigger for PTSD does not have to be extreme.

I have seen a fair number of cases where people had symptoms that masqueraded as anxiety  and depressive disorders, but when we explored the historical events in a person's life, these symptoms could be traced to milder traumatic or unpleasant experiences than are not normally associated with PTSD. And yet, their symptoms were exactly those of PTSD. In my experience, a milder traumatic event does not necessarily lead to a milder set of symptoms.

If you think you might be suffering from a past distressing experience, see if any of the following symptoms rings true for you: having recurrent nightmares, flashbacks, upsetting thoughts, or memories; feeling distressed when you're reminded of it; having physical symptoms, such as a racing heart or sweating when it comes to mind; irritability, jumpiness, angry outbursts, or difficulty sleeping; or feeling distant, negative, or uninterested in activities you used to enjoy. I've found that these are some of the classic PTSD symptoms you can get from an unpleasant experience, even if that experience would not be defined as ""intensely traumatic.""

Let me offer two examples illustrating problems of PTSD---two people who experienced life events that were emotionally disturbing but not the kind of extreme trauma suggested by the DSM-IV. Each had suffered a major loss and disruption of lifestyle. The first was a woman affected profoundly by a job loss that resulted in a major reduction in income. The second was a man who suffered after-effects from a divorce. Neither of these two events is usually considered a potential source of PTSD. Besides anxiety and depression, though, both people experienced flashbacks and nightmares, which forced them to relive the spectrum of traumatic experiences long after the events, as well as other symptoms usually present in PTSD.

In the clinical setting, one of the most modern successful treatments for PTSD is using virtual reality in which, using a head-mounted device, the person watches an interactive program created to replay traumatic events in an ascending hierarchy-from least to most disturbing-to expose and desensitize the person from the problem.

However, if you're still suffering the aftereffects from a distressing or unpleasant experience, you don't need fancy equipment to improve your symptoms. There are very clear treatment strategies involving relaxation, hypnosis, guided imagery, behavior modification. and cognitive behavior therapy that are useful in resolving the symptoms arising from unpleasant recurrent experiences, and there are therapists who specialize in such treatments.

For you, the first step is to recognize your own PTSD-like symptoms, and identify the unpleasant experience from whence they originated. I've found that once people understand the connection between their symptoms, the original event, and present-day situations that re-trigger those symptoms, we can very quickly and efficiently minimize or eliminate the condition. Best of all, many people with these symptoms can also begin to use self-care techniques I've developed-simple, practical strategies to counter PTSD-like symptoms stemming from unpleasant experiences in their past.

832,"I know it seems simple, but for me its not. I just went through a lot of MAJOR stresses and changes and at this time I'm  not dealing with it well. I had a stalker, which resulted in me getting a 3-year restraining order against him in what the judge called the worst case of harassment he'd ever seen in his court. Even the restraining order didn't make me feel better however, knowing that I was living a mere half mile from the stalker. This caused me to give up my apartment (which I had been living in alone) and put everything I own into storage. I am currently staying wtih my mom while I get my life back together. I have to commute two hours a day to my very busy work. One week later, my current boyfriend and I split and he doesn't want to work it out. 

I KNOW the reality of the situation. I am a very bright, smart, successful and fairly attractive 29 year old woman. I own and run my own business and have friends that adore me. I know that what I went through is not my fault. I've been in counseling and I've been to various doctors almost monthly for the different health problems this has caused me. I know that I need to get out and enjoy the community I'm living in now and make the best of it - meet new people, maybe accept some dates I've been offered, join some social activities. I know I need to eat better and get back on my bike. 

What I don't know is HOW. I have lost 14 pounds and counting because I have such a hard time eating when I'm upset. I've currently been in bed since yesterday and have not eaten anything in over 24 hours. I'm weak, shaky and I feel sick. I know that I have a head cold right now and severe allergies but I've convinced myself that I'm deathly ill and that I'm going to lose my mind. Despite the fact that I KNEW my boyfriend and I weren't right for each other, now I feel alone and scared and can't stop trying to see if he wants to work it out. 

How do I get out of this slump? I want to meet new people, and I want to consider closing my business in the old town so that I can be completely away from the crazy guy. I want to get out and enjoy life but I can't even get out of bed or get food down me right now. I'm afraid I'm going to cause myself some kind of permanent physical damage or make myself go literally crazy. Please help."
833,"I suffer from PTSD and severe back pain following an accident years ago. I failed the medical and had to appeal as ATOS only awarded me 12 points, which should have been over 100. Welfare rights helped with my appeal which has took 9 months and got all my relevant medical and got the decision overturned. In addition they also said i should be entitled to DLA and they got me mid rate care and low mobility. I felt relief I would be able to get my life back, get back to work and be me again, but no within 2 weeks of judgement DWP has decided to send me back to the same ATOS so called doctor for assessment again that both lied and ignored my problems. I don't want to go but have no choice. Rang my welfare rights advisor and she is surprised but says I will have to go. I am taking all medical and tribunal support with me plus I will take a friend. I don't understand why they are sending me back when the appeal overturned it based on my medical evidence, I did not even have to attend in the end. I just feel so down, I'm sure its a conspiracy to send me over the edge. I have worked nearly all my life even as a single parent I chose to work. All I want is the support and help to be able to get back to work and be me again is that really too much to ask. This has sent me straight down hill again, if they ignore it and fail me again then I will be back at square one and worried I may then lose my DLA. I can't go through this again any advice would be appreciated. I am thinking of just giving him all the medical stuff and refusing to talk to him."

835,"that I release all medical, mental health and educational records from my whole life?  I can understand talking to mental and medical - but this therpaist is even asking for police records of a traumatic event that we have not even talked about, no time to do so before she just suspended the therapy, and wants school records... I have no idea why.   She says she must review all of this information and get all the records before she will see me again.  

I don't know why.  

It doesn't feel good.  I don't know why it feels bad and so invasive... I'm not hiding anything.  It's also a lot of money to pay for all the record copies...

is this ever ok for a therapist to suddenly stop therapy and say they won't continue until they have all this info?    Is it common for therapists to ask for this?  require this?  

It's hard to find a new therapist right now, so I can't just easily go see someone else.  I really like seeing this therapist too.  and she has been very helpful for me.  But it's been almost three months since I have seen her - she keeps recheduling, and saying she needs this stuff, and I ask if we can talk about it first... 

I'm so mixed up..."
836,"Evening everyone,
Having a really shit day.  Would take too long to explain it all and i'm too upset anyway.  Hve hit the bottle - very unlike me.  Once again the cmht have succeeded in gagging me.  Spent all night trying to write out some notes to discuss with someone about a situation concerning my care.  Only to be told today they will not speak to me as it's a conflict of interests.  So pissed off it's untrue.  Am at the point of discharging myself as the stress of dealing wiht the system is outweighing the benefits i am getting from it.  Hubby is not impressed about me discharging myself.  Just feel i have no control over anything re my care and they are all busily discussing me behind my back.  Up till now this had been one of the few people I had respected.
Sorry for the rant as it does't really explain things, just needed to get it out a bit and have another drink before my other half gets home and trys to talk me out of it.

838,I was assulted on new years eve and i am having trouble getting over it anyone got any ideas?:eek:
839,"long ago I was diagnosed with chronic depression (after I got divorced). then I was involved in a terrible ordeal here in my home involving my roommate and a friend of ours (he was a mess mentally and a drunk and got drunk and tried to shoot my roommate and himself. I saved both of their lives by jumping in front of the gun and also wrestling him for the gun to keep him from killing her and himself (which he said he was going to do to himself). noone got hurt except me. I got fondled and kissed on, (but not fully raped), to be able to keep the bastard from causing anymore trouble, then the swat team got him and hauled him off. it was an all day ordeal. very not cool :cry:

so....many flashbacks later, lots of crying, anger outbursts, misery, etc. I finally drug myself to a therapist some 9 months after it happened and was then diagnosed with PTSD by her. then she decided to re-victimize me by putting me down during a visit (and to think that victims of crime paid for that). :mad: 
so now I am getting MUCH worse mentally, in addition to all my problems and misery, I am poor (I am a caregiver - dont make much doing that for one person), live in a condemable small home (I am trying to find a place to move to), my roommate (also a woman) has bi-polar and BPD (and she drives me NUTZ), and we have strangers come up in the yard alot and harass me, drive thru the private property even with all the signs up, and its always men who do it. It makes me afraid. to top if all off I am alone. I am the lovey dovey type that likes to have one special person to adore me as much as I adore that person, but I have only had 2 failed relationships and I am 37 years old. 

I am lonely, depressed, sad, I have gotten totally introverted now and do anything to stay home/inside. 
Its really hard even seeing family. I cannot even attempt to try to be with anyone that shows interest in me.
Yet, I wish I had someone to be with me all the time. 
its hard :blush:  I've seemed to have lost my faith in humans and even love to a degree. :cry:
.....and everyone keeps telling me to go see another therapist but if I was avoiding them prior to the bad therapist, I am DEFINITELY avoiding them now. :(

The only job I can think of getting is an at home job, but those are few and far between. I need a better income, but absolutely cannot even think of attempting to do a job search for a ""real"" job. much as I dont like the idea, I truly think I should be on social security, but dont know how to go about it."
840,"I was molested and raped approximately 15 years ago (when I was a child and adolescent). To this day, I am terrified of my own shadow. I can't sleep without nightmares.

When I travel to school or work, I'm constantly thinking of an exit route. What if happens again? PTSD consumes every aspect of me. The essence of me is gone. Has been gone since the first time I was molested. I will never be the same again. Thank you."
841,"Before freaking out in class and finding myself completely unable to go back, I bought the books and when the love of my life started insisting that I need to learn more about my ""illness"" I turned to a college psychology book to be told that people like me generally have low IQ's. 

I took that as a bit of a personal insult.

I question it. My IQ looks very good on paper but then, how do I manage to severely injure myself as if it were a perfectly normal thing to do? Why can't I use some of that ""Genius Level"" nonsense to devise a way to keep my life or even my God-sent relationship, together? Am I wrong in thinking that it takes a certain level of idiocy to screw up anything that was ever good in your life? 

Off topic, but does anyone else suffer from chronic physical pain and how do you fix that? Is there a drug out there, because this is positively ridiculous? Every bit of it has a source that I, with my ""gifted"" level of comprehension, remember every last bit of where each aspect came from. It isn't very nice to me. No, it's actually extremely upsetting. Is it more normal for a torture victim to want their captors dead or to want them to come back to finish you off?"

845,"Hi all, 

I'm new to this site and thought this section of the forum seemed like the best place for me to start. 

I have recently been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after 4 1/2 years of suffering mental health problems. My problems began when I was still serving in the army. I had a career spanning 8 years over which time I served all over the world regularly being exposed to stress which at the time had no significant effect on me. 

It was not until I was sent to Sierra Leone until I was involved in an incident in which I genuinely thought I was going to die, when I began to develop symptoms of PTSD. I don’t really want to be more specific right now since the memories of the event are still very upsetting.

Once I had returned from Africa I began to think about the event which occurred and while those around me told me that I should put it behind me and feel lucky to be back home safe, I began to relive the event over and over in my mind, the experience is what I referred to at the time as a dream/nightmare during the day. The process of reliving the event caused me to experience all of the fear/anxiety symptoms which I felt when I originally had the experience. 

This quickly began to affect my life and my ability to operate normally. At the time I was still in the forces and offered psychological counselling which amounted to a doctor telling me ""these things happen, the best thing you can do I soldier on"". 

Along with reliving the experience over and over I began to suffer with depression which I put down to dealing with all these unwanted emotions and psychological reactions. 

I began to notice that the dreams during the day (which i now know are flashbacks) I was having would be triggered by stimulus which at the time I was unaware of but which I soon began to realise. Once I had identified the triggers for my flashbacks I began to avoid situations where I thought that I may have a flashback triggered. 

This began to affect my ability to operate socially and lead to an extended period of not going and avoiding social situations, which I realise now only, add to the problems I was having. 

I left the army of my own accord and returned home to live with my parents. It was now that I began to notice increased symptoms of depression and anxiety along with a very short temper and anger, I found my ability to deal with normally stress free things was diminished and I would easily snap and loose my temper about the smallest thing. This had a bad effect on my relationship with my family. 

This behaviour continued for about 4 years until I went to my doctor and was referred to a psychiatrist, I was prescribed Lofepramine and diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. I found that Lofepramine caused me to feel drowsy but did after a bedding in period, help with my depression and anxiety symptoms. I have also taken diazepam from time to time when I was particularly anxious. I am currently waiting for a course of CBT to begin. 

Last December I went to a place in Scotland called combat stress, which I believe is only for ex forces, where I received some counselling sessions and met others with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Overall I found the week I spent there totally brilliant and would recommend it to any other ex forces who are having mental health problems. 

I have basically come on this site since recently I have been feeling isolated and wish to communicate with others who understand my situation and hopefully find ways of coping better with PTSD.

Thanks

Matt :)"
846,"This is the first time I will have actually written down that I have PTSD along with severe depression. I was abused by my brother for 3 years when I was 10 and then in a seperate incident I was raped by a man I babysat for. memories of the rape only surfaced a year a go which has led to more memories of the abuse coming out, I suffer from flashbacks, images and nightmares causing severe pain inside to cope with this pain I SH I have an assesment with a psychologist in Sept and id they agree to see me I will have to wait for an appt, so if anybody has any coping skills they can pass on I would be grateful if not it would be good to hear from anybody in similar circumstances, thanks"
847,"My names kaylie and im 17. im suffering a lot with mental health issues, ptsd being one of them and i also have psychotic depression, bpd and ocd. 

i was sexually and physically abused by both my parents until i was taken into care when i was 13 (and pregnant with my first child). my little sister daisy died when i was 8 and she cant have been more than a month old. neither of my parents bothered with her and it was left to me and my brother to look after her and we had no idea. i do fully blame myself for her death and i have never really spoke about it to anyone.

then when i was 10, my brother cameron died in an accident (he was 12). he was my best friend, the only person in my world who geniunely cared about me and always had my back and i miss him so much. all we had was each other and then he was gone. never really talked about his death either. 

and last of all, i had twin girls in july last year at 26weeks after they were dx with ttts and were really ill. i had a placental abruption and hemorraged and was in a coma for 3 weeks, during which my girls were really really ill, and i came round eventually only to be told beau wouldnt make it through the night and she died age 3 weeks. the anniversary is coming up and i dont know how im going to hack it.

i have flashbacks and voices in my head repeating all these things from my past. im scared to sleep at night because i know i will have nightmares and wake up a sobbing mess and feel worse than if id not slept at all. i shout, scream and cryin in my sleep and wake myself up. i wake up regularly during the night if i dont take sleeping pills and do manage to fall asleep, but usually i just sit there and think, and not sleep.

i dont even know where to start adressing things in my past. i have therapy and things but its stuck in there with a huge wall around it and needing some help breaking it down :("

As an element of my Ptsd I am hyper-vigilant about my health and safety, my problems come when I see things that are unsafe, not only for myself but others as well...you see I have to (obsessive) report them to whoever I feel is responsible.
Now, I live in social housing and my landlord is able to feed this, I see things all the time.
A few years ago the landlord tried to issue me with an ABC, the LGO understood me perfectly and said that the landlord was inappropriate, oppressive, discriminatory, and excessive...an individual who was involved still works for the landlord and I am once again in the position of reporting failures in H@S, however this same individual is once again not listening to what I say......I am treated as an idiot who is a pain...its getting me down...the stress increases my flashbacks and it generally brings me down, mental health workers have strongly advised me never to be on my own with this individual...or with the local office staff.
I am currently being ordered to do something that I know is not safe for me.
has anyone any suggestions about changing the culture of ""nutting"" me off?

856,"I’m wondering if I am imagining a problem.  My father dropped dead one day of a heart attack when I was 16 (I’m now 38 and old enough to know better!), and I had been very close to him - the pain was unbearable. This seems trivial compared to the things I have read from you all, but I feel I am still inappropriately in pain.  I cry too easily when someone dies in a film or TV show.  My mood changes throughout the day, from being content, to angry, to occasional euphoria and sometimes tears – I often cry while driving to work, and then manage to be perfectly composed when I get there!  Am also a bit hypersensitive to noise.  It’s not so bad it affects work (apart from a few angry scenes, where I feel I act like a child!), but most days I’m not on an even keel all day.  I sometimes wonder if everyone feels like this in a way, and I should just get on with it, but life seems difficult every single day, and it's exhausting.  I feel like a failure."
857,"Ok, i will put this into this subforum and hope that is ok. i am experiencing some problems with my boyfriend at the moment. he is 22 and has been in the us army for 4 years now. he was deployed in iraq for 10 months and got home well - at least i hoped so. since he came back last year and never had any problem, i though it would be ok.

a couple of weeks ago he had a breakdown at work. his doctor told him it was ptsd. they referred him to a mental health clinic he was supposed to visit last week. i wonder if he did.


since a few weeks (already before he had this breakdown) he acts very weird. he is kinda aggressive, i feel i cannot discuss things with him because i feel i'd make him freak out. he goes crazy about nothing, actually, so if i get off aim very fast, his reaction consists of yelling and cursing. i have to say, we've been together for 2 1/2 years now but we're locally separated. he lives in the us, i live in germany and at the moment it is difficult to change that. actually, it has a lot of advantages because he works, i work, he goes to college, i go to school and university and so on . it worked fine but since a few works, it is getting worse.

i have talked to a friend of mine whose a counselor in the british army and he advised me to be strong for my boyfriend. i shall try to maintain the relationship and i am willing to but it is getting very, very hard. :cry: he hasn't asked me about my feelings for a few weeks, i feel i have to beg for him to say that he loves me. i can understand (at least get it it, of course i do not *know* how he feels) that he feels numb and that is a very hard time for him at the moment. but right now it so just getting worse. our conversation are nonsense.. he gives me the feeling he doesn't want to talk, though he never says so. i keep asking if there was something i could do for him and always denies that which makes me feel :unsure: i dunno how to talk to him, what about. i feel helpless.
when i tell him something, he forgets about it. we couldn't manage to talk yesterday because i had an important meeting and his reaction was a furious text message... 

shall i just ignore it? i am feeling like a scapegoat at the moment... he's making me sad."
858,Sorry if this is not the right place to put this...I'll keep a long story short. Basically I was pleged with drink and forced into sex by my bf when I was a young teenager and for ten years since iv found it difficult to get over. I used to get flashbacks but then it turned more into an obsessive guilt thing that i couldn't stop thinking about. I'm a lot older now but still feel like i havnt gotten over it and i still think about it alot. Iv talked about it a lot to my counseller and a little to my current bf but it's still an issue. How do I get over it and stop thinking about it? xxx
859,"i was diagonised with GAD when i was 15.

then i had a psy-eval done when i was 19 and he thought i had PTSD.  i know why he thought that but i don't think so. 

i was raped when i was 16, and i told him this. 
he asked if i have nightmares, and i said yes.
he asked what about, and usually there about being raped or harmed. someone is always trying to hurt me.
he put the two together and came up with ptsd.

i don't see how though. maybe i didn't clarify enough.

see, i've had bad nightmares since i was little. way before the rape.
i've also had alot of other bad experiences with males but i've talked about all of them opening. when i think about them, i feel unclean and guilty but i don't think about them all the time or anything. i don't have vivid flashbacks or anything. so how does it all fit? how is that ptsd?

also, before any of my bad experiences (that i'm aware of) with men, i was leery of them. especially older males. and strangly, i don't remember alot of my childhood. it's like pieces are missing. there is one point where i don't remember my sister being around at all. it's like she disapeared or something. my father will tell stories and i have no idea what he is talking about. could i be repressing something or could just be a bad memory??  

is it ptsd or gad? it doesn't really matter, i guess. i'm just curious."
860,"In september 2000 i was the victim of attempted murder, sexual assault, aggravated robbery & toucher. The incident lasted about 5 hours of repeated hell. When i woke up in the park the cops took me to hospital and with my bad relationship with health care workers(nurse&drs) i wasnt believed. I was treated poorly(putting politely). When ever i had flash backs of the incident the nurses would say things like ""you werent raped and no we wont have sex with you"" at the top of their voices so all the patients could hear. I was constantly mentally abused by drs and nurses and patients a like. All this mental abuse while i was trying to teach myself how to talk again. Any way it was said on my file that i got a copy of that i am a man of poor character, unreliable history and untrustworthy nature ect. Then a couple of years later i complained to the police commissioner and he sent police internal affairs and major crime squad to investigate as the said above attempted murder ect and said the offender had criminal form for everything he did to me. Then the mental health clinic i was going too diagnosed me with PTSD and gave me 5 sessions with a guy who was a student phycologist for PTSD counciling that was all the couniciling i have ever had. I have constant flashbacks everyday, they are most disturbing. The thing that i did to help heal myself was to return to study at collage it was a real hard thing to do i had to read the first sentence in my study books 20 times before i would understand what i was reading because of constant flashbacks. Now all these years latter i am still studying and haven't had a disabling panic attack in years. I know that the study i took was the occupational tool i used to heal my self by giving me a distraction and sense of accomplishment. I usually pass with high marks too which gives me a sense of pride. All these years latter i still cant sleep until dawn. When i do sleep i have a panic attack in my sleep and wake up this happens for hours before i finally nod off And when i do fall asleep i have terrifying nightmares. With all this on my mind and other violent crimes i have suffered and not believed by authorities i also have never had a relationship nad i have no friends i am alone and seriously depressed i fight suicide everyday, but i live for god. I thought i would tell you all this in the hope that if anyone else is suffering ptsd that they to collage and study part time i know that study will retrain and discipline your mind thus healing your soul."
861,"Hi,
I have been reading the threads, I am know that I am not well in myself after reading, but not sure if I have anything wrong, I can associate to some of problems on this topic, I was sitting at the table i thought I had poured my coffee over my self, I see myself doing stuff like laughing or crawling around the floor like a animal making noises and I jolt my self as I thought I had, I have recently seen the room light up and I thought I was floating in between, I have lots of Flash backs its like a  video but can still see my surroundings, I am up and down, I can speak so much then completely quite I feel I dont want to talk, I have a twitch that if I dont contol it can go from blinking to my arm twitching to my leg, and my breathing feels very uncomfortable, I go to bed and try and sleep try not to think about it, I feel a bit embarrassed, I live in a rural area as I run away from the UK away from people, I am a very private person and I feel really uncomfotable around people,  I met my partner we are gay and she came to live with me she has been amazing, I am now moving back to UK, But I dont feel I will survive or will live long enough, I know I will but its a feeling I have, I think every morning when I wake up  to stick something through my temple to distroy my brain, I hate saying these kinda words, and feel very uncomfortable, I feel very sad and I should not, One minute I can be ok then the next I feel everything drain from me, I have no energy, I think really strangely and deeply about things, and become really obsessed with things, I feel its keeping my mind occupied, I know I don't allow myself to think of anything that hurts me, If my partner was not here I dont think I would be able to move, I get up for her and do things because I love her, I all so find it very hard to consitrate on anything, I cant remeber my past some i can, I cant rember my last street I lived in or my last doctors, I had to close my account in UK as I could not remeber my details, There is so much more, I broke my ankle could not walk properly for a year, But did not seek help, I cant think why, I feel I am very much on my own not needing anyone. But now moving back to UK, Is there anything wrong with me, It really hard work being me,,"
862,"How do you experience flash backs?

I actually feel as though I am there again and it is happening again. I am reliving the event.

My friend told me this is not a flash back - a flash back is like seeing a video of the event - you see it happening as though you are watching it on TV.

So what is happening to me then.  :("
863,I have recently spent time in the hospital on the psychiatric ward. I do well in this setting and I considering going into a residential program. I am wondering if anyone has had experiences with these types of programs and whether or not you would recommend it or not.
864,"Anyone else have trouble integrated a traumatised child self with a coping adult self?  The traumatised child broke through her shell 14 months ago after a panic attack; she seems to be looking at me as a coping adult with accusations of leaving her behind, she's also bewildered about where she disappeared to - and doesn't seem to like where she's landed here in my coping adult world.  Anyone suggest anything (CBT doesn't work because it calls for rational alternatives to anxious thoughts, etc, and though I can give rational alternatives, ""she"" is pretty scathing and asks how that's supposed to help her where I left her.  (I suppose in other words I'm coming up with rational reasons why ""the worst may not happen"", but she's in a place where the worst is happening all the time).  Generally, in my experience over the last 14 months in trying to get help, it seems the NHS is hopeless at dealing with any kind of mental disturbance that won't ""go away"" after visiting the CBT website and reading a couple of books.  Private counsellors just seem to say yes they're experienced in the field, but it takes quite a few sessions for you to discover what they mean is they studied it for a couple of sessions on their course."
865,"Hi all
I just wondered if anyone else is suffering with ptsd. I am feeling very alone and cut off at the mo and have been searching for advice on the internet for the last few hours (which is how I found this site!) My panic attacks are more like depersonalisation, feeling not attached to my own body and would love to know how to reduce them. I know they are caused by flashbacks which I am trying to deal with, does anyone else know how I am feeling and how do you deal with flashbacks and/or this depersonalisation? 
Any advice is welcomed.

866,"Former SAS soldier Andy McNab has warned that Britain was sitting on a ""timebomb"" of future severe mental health problems among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.

He predicted that without improved care a shocking number of those fighting in the ""war on terror"" would go on to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - and in some cases commit suicide.

The soldier-turned-writer also released a new survey revealing that two-thirds of UK adults think the Government's treatment of ex-servicemen and women is ""disgraceful"". Three-quarters believe care for veterans' psychological condition is ""inadequate"", and 49% would pay an extra penny in the pound of income tax to help returning service personnel with financial troubles.

Mr McNab tackles these issues in his new non-fiction memoir, Seven Troop, which looks at what happened to the men he served with in the SAS until 1993.

Two of the members of his unit have since killed themselves and a third is in prison after shooting his girlfriend dead.

NHS provision is ""totally inadequate"" for dealing with the estimated 15% of veterans who will suffer some form of PTSD, Mr McNab said.

He added: ""Since I left the forces some 15 years ago, the situation for ex-service personnel simply hasn't improved. I've seen for myself the appalling way that our soldiers are hung out to dry.

""The idea held by the Government that the majority of service personnel experience a smooth transition into civilian life is delusional and largely false.

""Living in the outside world when discharged is very hard and many ex-Armed Forces personnel experience huge difficulties reintegrating. Years of service institutionalise men and women who are then thrust back into society with minimal co-ordination and long term support. There is a pervading sense of literally being 'thrown out of the club'.""

Mr McNab stressed that responsibility for dealing with the problem lay with the Government rather than the Ministry of Defence (MoD). ""The military are doing their bit but they are restricted by their funds,"" he said. ""The system says once they (service personnel) leave, they are within the NHS system. There is this timebomb and the NHS won't be able to cope with it."""
